		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, there’s two things here.</p>
<p>First, for Cheeses that you are meant to eat moldy, like Bleu cheese, they are very specific kinds of mold that are grown and cultivated like other foods then mixed in/added with the cheese. It isn’t just random mold growing on it. These are known to be safe and are used to enhance smell/flavor.</p>
<p>Then, for other cheeses when if you find mold on a block of it you can just cut it off and eat the rest, this is because since blocks of cheese are typically harder/denser. The tendrils and spores of the mold can’t spread very deep into the cheese, so you can just cut off the bad area.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It all has to do with the type of mold; not all mold is the same. Some kinds, like what grows within blue cheese, are safe to eat. What grows on other foods can contain toxins that could upset your belly at best or make you very sick at worst.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Moldy cheese is usually covered in a specific, benefitial or neutral mold that will not kill you.</p>
<p>Stuff that gets unintended mold on it will have random and potentially harmfull/deadly species of mold on it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your question is like asking &quot;why is it OK to eat mushroom soup but a bad idea to eat a random mushroom you find in the woods?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mold&quot; refers to any one of thousands of species. Some of them are fine, some are toxic. The kinds of mold used to make cheese are species we know are ok to eat and put there on purpose, to make the cheese into cheese. The mold on food in your fridge is colonies of whatever random mold/bacteria the food picked up off of the counter / air / your hands / the grocery guy's hands.
