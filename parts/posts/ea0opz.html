		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, when you start working with infinites things get tricky. Some people say that the notion of size (cardinality) of sets is unintuitive for infinite sets, yet for me it's not the case if you think it about this way:
Two sets have the same size if you can find a way (any way, just at least one) to match their elements up one to one.
In your case, you have found a way to match up the set of positive numbers with the set of negative numbers, leaving zero out. Good! You have just shown that there are just as many positive integers as there are negatives.</p>
<p>But then, you jump out to the conclusion &quot;hey, zero is still out so if I add it then I have one more&quot;. Oops. No, because I can still find a way to map the set of positive naturals plus zero to the set of negatives. (just think 0 to -1, 1 to - 2 and so on). The problem with infinite sets is that adding some stuff does not necessarily make it larger, and taking out some stuff doesn't necessarily make it smaller. Even if you were to add or take out infinite amounts of stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why should 0 be the center?</p>
<p>I personally like -18306 to be the &quot;center&quot;. And it's clear that it is: There are an infinite amount of integers larger than -18306 and an infinite amount of integers smaller than -18306.</p>
<p>Or maybe there is no integer that's the &quot;center&quot;, but instead it's the halfway point between 12 and 13. That means we can pair up numbers based on their distance from the &quot;center&quot;: 12-13, 11-14, 10-15, etc... Clearly this proves that there's an even number of integers.</p>
<p>Jokes aside, the integer numbers don't have a &quot;central number&quot; or something along those lines. And the concepts of even and odd apply to finite sets, but fail to make sense when you consider infinite sets. After all, a number <em>n</em> is even if there exists an integer <em>k</em> such that <em>n = 2 k</em>. Similarly, <em>n</em> is odd if there exists an integer <em>k</em> such that <em>n = 2 k + 1</em>. When it comes to the size of the set of integers, there is no finite integer <em>k</em> one can find to satisfy either of those two criteria.</p>
<p>In general, many definitions and concepts that we're used to only work properly for finite values and sets and break down with infinite sets. In some cases, one could expand the definition in a fairly natural way to also cover infinite sets, but this isn't always the case.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>you can pick your &quot;0&quot; at any point. </p>
<p>you might just as well split numbers into <0 and >=0 and you'll get the same result, without excluding one number.</p>
<p>the answer simply is that there are equally infinite numbers in each half, however you split it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In set theory (or some similar branch?), there is a concept called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality" target="_blank">cardinality</a>. Basically, if I gave you a set (a group of numbers), the cardinality would be the amount of numbers in that set.</p>
<p>In particular, the set of all integers have cardinality of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph_number" target="_blank">aleph-zero</a> - a special case for “<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CountablyInfinite.html" target="_blank">countable infinity</a> ”. This means you can make a special kind of function that makes the set turn into a set of natural numbers (positive integers). <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-do-the-set-of-integers-and-the-set-of-natural-numbers-have-the-same-cardinality" target="_blank">Proof</a></p>
<p>Now, where is the middle point for naturals? It grows on one end without stopping so the middle keeps moving as it grows. It continually flips between even and odd as it grows. And since integers have the same cardinality as naturals, your reasoning breaks down.</p>
<p>———————————————</p>
<p>While googling the websites, I found <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/49034/is-infinity-an-odd-or-even-number" target="_blank">this mathexchange post</a>. It seems that there are a couple different types of infinity (and not meaning countable/uncountable) that makes things get confusing.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The top answer talks about <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfinite_number" target="_blank">transfinite ordinals</a>, which uses ordinals (location of an ordered set) instead of cardinals. He says the smallest transfinite ordinal number (which I think means smallest infinity in the context of ordinals) is even because it times 2 is itself. Add one to it and it becomes odd, add one again is even, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the second answer is cardinality again and brings up a definition of even sets: the set is even cardinality if it can be split into two disjoint (un-overlapping) sets with same cardinality as each other. For natural set, you can take all evens in one set and take all odd into another set, and both have cardinality of aleph-zero, meaning the natural set cardinality is even. His other explanation is that you can always make a pair from two numbers in a natural set, meaning it is even.</p>
</li>
<li>the third answer I have difficulty understanding, probably cause I haven’t learned about <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics)" target="_blank">rings</a>. I think it says that generally, you cannot say it is even or odd because you can add one to switch between even and odd but still be called infinite. Some exceptions come from “‘number’ systems” which I don’t understand either.</li>
