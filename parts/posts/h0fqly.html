We're usually extremely distracted by all the thoughts about where the item was last, what will happen if we don't find it, all the havok and frustration of not having the item...  </p>
<p>It's 100% just because of distraction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You'll notice that you rarely have this problem if you were to lose your keys or smokes in an completely unfamiliar place. It's usually in &quot;dumb&quot; places like your own house, on your own dresser, right in front of you.</p>
<p>This is because your brain is used to establishing patterns to avoid having to think about all the visual information coming in all the time. When your eyes scan across the top of your dresser, you know that 99% of the time there is nothing there. Your brain doesn't want to have to register &quot;behold myne dresser, it is once again barren&quot; every time your eyes pass across it on a daily basis.</p>
<p>But that leads to mental blind spots. You're so used to something not being there that you brain wants to skip over it and instead focus on the other thoughts that are trying to intrude, like &quot;oh crap where are my keys I'm going to be late.&quot; And sometimes the harder and more urgently you think, the more your brain skips &quot;irrelevant&quot; stuff because it's trying to be efficient.</p>
<p>Your &quot;I need to be intensely focusing on every detail to find this thing&quot; process is in conflict with your &quot;the way I intensely focus is by skipping over stuff I'm used to&quot; process. The problem is when the thing you need to find is actually in that stuff you're skipping!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
