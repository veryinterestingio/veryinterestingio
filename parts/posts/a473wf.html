		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From an artistic standpoint, it might be to drive the &quot;this place is hot&quot; point home. There's many subtle effects applied to films that one doesn't think about right away. Look at the film Aliens, with its heavy lens flare and blue filter. Kinda gives the impression of being in a cold inhospitable place naturally without having to have a character say &quot;gee this place sure is cold and inhospitable.&quot; Now go and play Dead Space 2, and there's a part in a big walk-in freezer and as you walk into it you'll notice it also suddenly applies a blue filter to say &quot;hey you're in a freezer&quot; without some hamfisted ezposition by the protagonist, and there have been games that use orange/yellow filters that have a noticeable sudden shift when entering the area to signify it's hot.</p>
<p>In the same way, a warm filter gives the feeling of being in a warm place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember the film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8prXNxNfEpY" target="_blank">&quot;Traffic&quot;</a> as being my first memory of this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Soderbergs  use of color filters is intended to establish a different location, not only physically, but psychologically</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Found a post that says this dates back to old Westerns:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-do-films-and-TV-shows-use-a-yellowish-tint-to-depict-countries-like-India-or-Mexico" target="_blank">This goes back to the time of the first Westerns shot in color. The desert is yellow. That is a fact. And the heroes of these movies had to thrive in the desert: the heat, the scarcity, the outlaws. So, when our heroes traveled to Mexico, which was usually depicted as being hotter, scarcer, and more outlaw-y than the Western US, it stood to reason that it had to be yellower. </a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some signals or props in art are really just shortcuts. Artists tend to repeat conventions that have worked traditionally <em>unless there is a reason to change them.</em> For instance, a shortcut to a chemistry teacher’s personality might be brown corduroy pants and a plaid shirt, boring nerd haircut. But if he <em>shaves his head,</em> it’s a signal something has changed substantially - in both his life circumstances and his physical state. And not only does that become integral to Walter White, <em>it becomes integral to Heisenberg.</em></p>
<p>It’s basically a principle of storytelling. Part of your story will always be told in these shortcuts and that can be how you establish a setting or someone’s basic big-lines personality without having to spend precious time on details. If a character or setting differs from those conventions, there should be a reason, and that reason should be important to your story. </p>
<p>So showing Mexico this way is more than likely just a way of saying <em>Mexico.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The yellow is, as has been previously stated, just the tinting that typically gets used for scenes set in the desert. Green lighting, however, is the standard for implying the scene is alien, foreign, or uncomfortable so that may have something to do with it. This is largely just because green is really uncommon as a color of lighting that we encounter in day-to-day life. The Matrix movies use this to almost egregious effect and it's also prominent in a lot of David Lynch movies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
