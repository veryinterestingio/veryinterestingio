		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dissociation? The brain has an idling mode when something doesn't need attention. It's what happened when you suddenly realize you're 30km down the road and can't remember driving. You didn't run anyone over, the brain shakes itself awake when anything unusual happens. The moment between dissociated state and consciously aware is a bit weird. </p>
<p>That form is perfectly normal and nothing to worry about. Absences from epilepsy or narcolepsy aren't normal. When panicking the brain can flip a fuse and dissociate to the point of no longer feeling pain or making memories, that is not healthy in the long run either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It's totally automatic. Foot, hand, foot, hand, but then you look down, realize how high up you are, and something changes. Then it's very deliberately foot... Hand... Foot... Hand...</p>
<p>I also get this cutting vegetables. I'll be halfway through a carrot and realize that I've been on autopilot with a sharp knife right near my fingers and then the whole rhythm is shot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This happens to me a lot when I do engaged computer work, like statistical analysis or any other thing that needs 100% of my attention. At a certain moment, I realize that the world is not only the screen and the keyboard, but also includes my desk, the window, etc. I feels like landing into myself and realizing that I am a physical being in a physical place.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In modern theories of consciousness they actually think that you are losing consciousness constantly throughout your day. Here's a scientific article I found that describes it more in depth and calls it &quot;mind-blanking&quot; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3784796/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3784796/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3784796/</a></a></p>
<p>In the book &quot;The Mind Illuminated&quot; by Culadasa (John Yates) he talks about how this blanking out refers to things called moments of consciousness or mind-moments, if I'm remembering that right. Basically there are individual 'units' of consciousness as you move through time and each can be filled with a particular thing or, more often than we'd like to admit, with nothing.</p>
<p>These are blank mind-moments and the more that you have them, the more likely they are to keep coming back. Serious meditators will often work at removing these blank moments and instead focus on the present moment so as to increase their level of awareness.</p>
<p>Hope this explains it. Basically you're by far in the majority for experiencing those moments and the fact that you recognized it isn't something to be scoffed at. I'd recommend the Mind Illuminated if you're interested in the topic more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
