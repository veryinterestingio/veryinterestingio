		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think about the fact that when we perform CPR we are literally exhaling directly into their lungs. If there was enough CO2 in a human exhale to harm someone why would we perform life saving CPR with that exhale? Our exhale does have some CO2 in it but our exhale is also still full of O2, we don't use all of the O2 we inhale and whatever isn't used comes back out in our exhale. The average human exhale is entirely safe to breathe in, it just is, which is why we're able to use it to save people's lives with CPR.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>You're wearing a mask, not exhaling into a balloon. There is no space for anything to accumulate. Perhaps a couple of milliliters of space where the mask isn't pressed too tightly against your skin? A typical breath will contain upwards of <a href="http://www.e-breathing.com/normal-respiratory-rate-volume-chart/" target="_blank">500ml of air</a>.  </li>
<li>You don't exhale CO2. You exhale regular air with <a href="https://byjus.com/biology/composition-gases-breathe/" target="_blank">a concentration of oxygen that's a bit lower and a concentration of CO2 that's a bit higher</a>.</li>

<p>Both o2 and co2 will flow freely through the mask, otherwise nobody could breathe with one on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
