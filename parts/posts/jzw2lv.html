		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing that I'm a bit fuzzy on are the specifics of mRNA vaccine protein synthesis because all explanations I've read of the process simply refer to a really generic ambiguous &quot;host cell&quot; that does the protein synthesis after it absorbes the mRNA from the vaccine.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>mRNA (packaged in things like liposomes) is injected into the host.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These liposomes bind with host cells, the mRNA enters, and the host cell ribosomes synthesize proteins based off of the vaccine mRNA and presents these proteins on the outside of their walls. <em>Do all kinds of cells uptake the vaccine mRNA and synthesize this protein? ie. the vaccine mRNA will be taken up by an assortment of epithelial cells, lymphocytes, myocytes, etc. and each of these will synthesize proteins based on the mRNA.</em></p>
</li>
<li>The body's immune system then identifies these surface proteins as foreign and proceeds to build up a memory of the antigen but also kills the otherwise various healthy (but antigen-presenting) cells in the process?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would likely be most cell types that come in contact with the mRNA liposomal particles, so in the current mRNA covid vaccines mostly muscle cells since it is an intramuscular injection. However, how well various cell types are transfected (internalizing and expressing the mRNA) varies (<a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/references/gibco-cell-culture-basics/transfection-basics/factors-influencing-transfection-efficiency.html" target="_blank">info page from Thermo</a> and figure 1 from <a href="https://bmcbiotechnol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6750-10-9" target="_blank">this paper</a>) so there's a chance one cell type could end up producing most of the protein due to variations in transfection efficiency among cell types.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an intramuscular injection, so the muscle cells will make the proteins. Basically any cell capable of producing protein that the RNA ends up in will make the proteins. Injections like this induce highly local expression of the gene in question, so it's not like the RNA is gonna float away and be picked up by some organ. It'll be mostly uptaken by muscle cells and maybe some fat/epidermal cells if it leaks towards the surface. Muscle is a great choice because the cells are long lived and produce huge amounts of protein, and a single muscle cell can even have multiple nuclei, so are basically protein factories. Other formulations like the russian vaccine use a virus for delivery and unlike the RNA vaccines, that will actually float away and be picked up by cells all over the body. But the virus they use for delivery will have a fairly specific set of sells it can enter, so only those will be producing the proteins at the end.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several people have indicated the answer is &quot;muscle cells&quot; which then begin to express the proteins... but doesn't this encourage your immune system to target and kill those muscle cells, since it detects the unrecognised &quot;foreign&quot; protein?!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>some cells simply don't have the capability to transcribe/generate new proteins. Red blood cells don't even have a nucleus or ribosomes (which are needed to generate proteins). </p>
<p>I havent read into the details of these covid specific mRNAs but my guess is that the LNPs are best absorbed by certain cell types which can then transcribe the mRNA. since the vaccine is injected intramuscularly, the muscle cells would be the prime target for mRNA/LNP absorption. Cells that are able to take up the LNPs wont be able to distinguish between &quot;human/self&quot; vs foreign/vaccine mRNA so they will be transcribed indiscriminately. the mRNA leads to the generation of viral particles which helps the body develop antibodies to the virus. So when you're infected with the real virus, the body already has antibodies ready to fight it!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
