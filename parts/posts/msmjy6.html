<p>Have you ever stared outside or at a single dot and just, stare there?</p>
<p>Thinking about nothing actually takes effort, because the brain is designed to think.</p>
<p>At any given point, your brain is constantly sending signals to keep you alive. Every sound and image is being processed by you. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I mean, you are going against evaluation trait to think about nothing. When your mind is blank, you are literally as defensless as it gets. because your mind is blank.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I've definitely realised at times, retrospectively, that I literally didn't have any thoughts for a short period of time.

<p>EDIT: Some people in other commends seem to think that to stop thinking means to stop all brain function. No. It simply means to stop your internal monologue and imagination.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
