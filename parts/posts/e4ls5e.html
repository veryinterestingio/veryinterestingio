		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>yes - you can think of muscles as huge bundles of motor units, which are small bundles of muscle cells.  Each motor unit has its own motor neuron.  When you raise one arm out to the side and are holding it there, your motor cortex is sending out a consistent stream of signals to keep that arm up.  However, it requires more force to raise that arm to its holding position, and therefore, requires recruitment of a greater number of motor units (more signals sent from the brain) to initially raise the arm.</p>
<p>It is actually pretty interesting how it works.  Motor units can't stay contracted for very long, or else once the arm was raised the signals would stop.  Instead, as individual motor units run out of ATP (the main cellular form of energy), they relax and the force that they were generating to keep the arm up is replaced by another motor unit that was previously relaxed.</p>
<p>To simplify - at the beginning of a muscle contraction, there are a really really large amount of individual signals, the number of signals then decreases but remains consistent until you lower the arm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the muscle and what youâ€™re doing. Holding an arm up requires conscious thought (if you fell asleep the arm would fall) to keep the muscles working against gravity, but in general the arm has two sets of muscles (biceps, triceps) pulling in opposite directions. On a flat surface no additional force is required to stop the limb moving back the other way.</p>
<p>Other muscles (such as sphincters) require a signal to relax, and others (such as the heart) are somewhat self-regulating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
