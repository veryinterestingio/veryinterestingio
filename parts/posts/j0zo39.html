		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other people covered your question. I want to add: </p>
<p>Every study that added MSG to <em>real food</em> showed that MGS or that even free glutamates had no correlation with headaches or other maladies. </p>
<p>Studies that <em>did</em> show a correlation, used a bunch of MSG dissolved in a small amount of liquid. Studies on headaches showed that very strong flavors can cause headaches. This effect was more pronounced in women. In the MSG studies that used very strong flavors, a similar proportion of male to female participants was noted, suggesting a strong flavor and not MSG in particular was the cause. This is further reinforced by the real food studies showing no correlation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In late 60's, a doctor wrote to a respected Journal of Medicine that eating at Chinese restaurants gave him nausea and numbness and attributed to the MSG, a common seasoning used by the establishments back then. He coined this term Chinese restaurant syndrome. After vetting his claims in the lab on animals with enormous doses, research did show negative effects, racial bias towards using MSG in Asian cuisines took off.</p>
<p>Allegedly, there was a claim the original letter was supposed to be a joke and Ho Man Kwok was a pen name of Dr. Howard Steel. But later this was debunked by the real Dr. Ho Man Kwok's children.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
