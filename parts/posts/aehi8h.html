Water is a pretty good solvent for most things, and permanent markers have a combination of chemicals that don't react that much with water, meaning it stays sticking to whatever it was put on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI3: Permanent really means - does not wash off with water.</p>
<p>ELI5+: Permanent marker is made with hydrophobic materials, meaning it does not bond to water. In general, substances are either hydrophilic (polar) or hydrophobic (nonpolar). Some things like soap have both a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic portion. This enables soap to grab things like oil, dirt, fat, etc. and wash away with the water. This is why washing your hands with soap is generally more effective at both cleaning and removing things like permanent marker. Other hydrophobic compounds like acetone, propanol (rubbing alcohol), and methanol are fairly good at removing permanent marker. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since everyone else is so very focused on Sharpies and pointing out that the word &quot;permanent&quot; doesn't really mean permanent:<br />
Permanent markers come in a couple of different types, the most common being your standard, water resistant kind. As with all pens, they contain ink, however in a normal pen, this ink can be dissolved in water, this is mostly the reason it wears off quickly. But permanent markers have added ingredients that make this ink water resistant, these chemicals are called &quot;hydrophobic&quot; and they are seemingly repelled by water. So the ink forms a layer on the surface, which can't be affected by water.<br />
BUT there does also exist chemical resistant markers (they are often used in labs to mark histology cassettes and microscope slides, as histologists often uses chemicals that dissolve standard markers) These tend to be made with more than one kind of ink, mixed together: one that is hydrophobic and one that is chemical resistant. They still work in the same way though: the ink forms a surface which can't be dissolved by some chemical.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
