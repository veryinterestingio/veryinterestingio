		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf_area_index" target="_blank">leaf area index</a>. O2 is a byproduct of photosynthesis so you want a measure of the photosynthetic area, not the mass.</p>
<p>Leaves that are not being illuminated are not producing O2 but do give off some CO2 due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_respiration" target="_blank">cellular respiration</a>. This does not mean that the entire tree is not growing since photosynthate products can move around a tree as per the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_flow_hypothesis" target="_blank">pressure flow hypothesis</a>.</p>
<p>As long as leaves are being illuminated above their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compensation_point" target="_blank">compensation point</a> then they will contribute to tree growth.</p>
<p>edit- if you look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PI_curve" target="_blank">PI curves</a> you'll see that plants tend to saturate at around 500 umol/m2/sec of light (about 25% full sunlight which is one reason why greenhouses may use shade cloths). But the effective LAI of a tree may be around 3 or 4 (rather than 1 like with a flat plane) because you may have leaves going each way particularly with conifers increasing leaf area and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert%27s_cosine_law" target="_blank">Lambert's cosine law</a> has to be taken in to account in light interception.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget that the largest plants (trees, mostly) have significant proportions of their total biomass that are effectively dead, used for support only. After several years (depending on species), these tissues are infected with various decay agents and start to decompose. So although some portions of the tree are still actively growing, converting CO2 to starches and sugars and making O2 as part of the process, other portions of the tree are decaying, effectively burning slowly, and releasing CO2 through the actions of insects, bacteria and fungi. This is why the oldest trees are not very effective at reducing atmospheric CO2, as their net effect between growth and decay is essentially zero.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wait. So in theory - if I understand these answers correct - it would be best for the climate if we cut down old trees and replace them with younger trees?
I mean sure, right now every tree is valuable but under ideal circumstances where hunanity doesnt destroy woods for profit, it would actually be good? (for climate)?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those are not the only two factors. The availability of trace mineral nutrients to enable the production of critical enzymes which are indirectly involved also influences this, as does the stimulation of plant carbohydrate production by the rhizosphere microbiome and by mycorrhizal fungi also influences this. For example, molybdenum is a critically important trace mineral nutrient used by nitrogen fixing bacteria (including free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which are not bound to legumes) in the enzyme nitrogenase, with which they fix nitrogen, without which the plant cannot produce its own enzymes and proteins. The rhizosphere microbiome &quot;purchases&quot; carbohydrates from plants with nutrients such as amino acids and nitrates.  Because of interactions like this, if molybdenum is limited, it indirectly influences the rate of plant photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Over the lifetime of a plant, about 70% of the carbohydrates produced by the plant end up in the soil to feed the soil biome, which offers the plant soil services in return. This is not to say that the soil microbiome is the ultimate factor, but it is a huge variable that influences many of the others. A tree that has a certain foliage level, which has large demands placed on it by a healthy and populous soil microbiome will carry out more photosynthesis and produce more oxygen than a larger tree with more foliage that does not have as much demanded of it.</p>
<p>The scaling appears to be a factor of how much root mass there is (really, how much surface area), and how much the biome that the root surface is demanding of the tree, and whether the trace mineral nutrients available to the tree are bottle-necking any of the processes. These are correlated with the tree size and the foliage level, but are their own variables. Keep in mind that mycorrhizal fungi can increase the nutrient accessing surface in the soil 10x over the surface area of the plant roots alone, so the activity and vigor of the soil fungi also influences this, since they &quot;purchase&quot; carbs from plants using other nutrients they obtain for the plant, such as phosphorous, minerals, and even water.</p>
<p>Young trees that are aggressively growing and increasing in size may have less foliage than a large mature tree, but they will capture more carbon and produce more oxygen. So the stage of life of the tree matters as well. It also matters how you measure. Per ton of biomass, really young trees will likely produce more, but per tree, perhaps less.</p>
<p>TL;DRâ€” there are far more factors than the amount of foliage and the size of the tree.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trees produce oxygen by absorbing carbon (literally CO2 becomes C + O2, by a much more complex route). So the amount of O2 produced <em>in total</em> is directly proportional to the mass of the tree, as that is where the carbon is going.</p>
<p>A tree that is not growing produces no net oxygen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
