		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is kinda like asking “which part of your arm do you throw with?”</p>
<p>The answer is: you use all of your brain, with some parts playing a larger role than others.  </p>
<p>Your brain isn’t like a chest of drawers with discrete sections.  It’s one cohesive mass that all works together.   We talk about the “emotion” centre or the “pain” centre or the “memory” centre for simplicity, but it’s never as simple as that.  The brain as a whole is always involved.  </p>
<p>A physical skill like handwriting is largely “stored” in the “motor” centre of the brain, but also in the “memory” centre and the “language” centre and the “art” centre and the “learning” centre.   It’s also stored in the “long term memory” centre, and has its place in the “emotion” centre because of all those associations you made as you were learning how to write.</p>
<p>Do you see how complicated this gets?   It’s stored... in your brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like diagnosedwolf said, many parts all over the brain are used in any skill.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a physical change associated with learning a skill, then you could say that <strong>learned skills are stored in the new</strong> <strong><em>connections</em></strong> <strong>between neurons and between these brain areas.</strong></p>
<p>When you are learning something (a fact, a language, a physical skill), you are training neurons (brain cells) to fire together and in certain patterns. Your brain works in a way where neurons that often are triggered to fire together &quot;learn&quot; to connect. They grow more dendrites and tangle together and with enough increased connection, one firing will now <em>automatically</em> trigger the other connected ones to fire.</p>
<p>That's why a complex motion gets easier with practice. When you start playing piano, you have to think about &quot;hit this key with this finger, that key with that finger etc.&quot;. As your piano-playing neurons form interconnected networks, you can eventually just think &quot;play a G flat 7th chord&quot; and the rest is automatic. After even more practice you can sight-read: look at dots of sheet music and just automatically play it, as easy as you could read words.</p>
<p>By the time you can sight-read piano music, that &quot;learned skill&quot; is &quot;stored in your brain&quot; in the form of a bunch of new connections. Neurons in your visual processing, memory, emotion, hearing, and motor control &quot;brain centres&quot; would all be involved, and would be more heavily interconnected than before you started practicing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Brain researcher here! The explanations that others have given are great, and it’s very true that we do use our entire brains for almost everything. However, some parts of the brain do specialize and are especially important in performing a specific task. For instance, Weirneke’s area (behind your ears) is very important for understanding speech, while Broca’s area (closer to the front of your brain) is mostly in charge of producing speech.  Other parts of the brain are also important, but when we see damage to those specific areas from trauma, stroke, tumors, etc we can see a very specific impairment of those functions. </p>
<p>If the hippocampus is damaged, that’s when we see impairment to what’s called <em>explicit</em> memory, or memories we can consciously recall, such as your mom putting a bandage on your scraped knee when you were small. Therefore, we know that the hippocampus plays a large part in the storage of those explicit memories. However, people that have damage just to the hippocampus usually have no trouble with what’s called <em>implicit</em> memories, which are things like riding a bike or holding a pencil. A person with complete amnesia and no idea who they are or where they are can sit down at a piano and flawlessly play Chopin’s Nocturne. That tells us that implicit memories aren’t really stored in the hippocampus like regular explicit memories. </p>
<p>Instead, we’ve found two places that do seem to be integral to the storage and retrieval of those implicit memories: the basal ganglia and the cerebellum. This makes a lot of sense to us researchers, because the cerebellum is normally in charge of balance and movement, and the basal ganglia is known to control fine motor skills. If we see damage to either or both of these specific parts, we see a large impact on those implicit memories, or “learned skills” that we don’t see at all when just the hippocampus is damaged. So generally, the cerebellum and basal ganglia are referred to as the place where those learned skills are stored. However, like others said, brains are very complicated and you use much more than just those parts to store, retrieve, and perform those learned skills.</p>
<p>Edit: it actually is pretty in line with the adage “muscle memory” because even though the memory is not stored IN your muscles, it is stored in the exact same place that controls your movement of those muscles. There’s no running to a different part of the brain to retrieve a memory of how to swim; the part of the brain that stores the memory of how to swim is the same one that controls you actually swimming. That proximity is part of what makes it feel so automatic. Evolutionarily, it’s probably a really good idea. The last thing you need when a lion comes up behind you is to waste milliseconds trying to remember how to run away!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simple answer, native language is stored in the left frontal Cortex of the brain, in an area called Broca’s area. It is attached to a different part of the brain called Wernicke’s area, and damage to either or to the neurons connecting them can cause problems with speech.
Interesting fact- if you study a language, it is stored on the RIGHT aide of your brain with other memorized things like words you learned for the SAT for example, and may cross over eventually if you become native enough, but this can have weird effects. I had brain surgery when I had just graduated college on the border of Broca’s area and the motor cortex. I had pretty bad aphasia and was literally pushing words out , I lost all my nouns, had no fluency whatsoever. Three word sentences maybe, with great difficulty . I would hold up a fork and ask “WHAt...IS?”
One day my boss walked in during my doctors visit, and said “oOoS, JenChan, DoU?” I replied in a fluent torrent of Japanese. My doctor was so excited that the next morning I found myself surrounded by medical students and the subject of a bedside lecture which gave me this insight- although it would have been nicer if the doctor been explaining TO ME, at least I heard it.
Also would have been nicer not to be charged for the “consultation”
