		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At orbital speed, any small object will just immediately disintegrate on impact rather than stay intact and penetrate like a bullet. That means that it is enough to have two or more layers between space and the crew - a collision might punch a hole through the outer layer, but probably not through the second because all its momentum is spread out over a larger area. </p>
<p>But if any large object hits the ISS, it might destroy the entire thing and kill its crew. For that reason, they track space debris with radar, and if it is estimated that it will pass the ISS (or any other satellite) too close for comfort, they will use their thrusters for evasive maneuvers. </p>
<p>In addition to that, at the altitude that the ISS is orbiting, there is still a very thin atmosphere. Anything flying up there is slowing down and will eventually fall back to earth. Which means that the ISS has to use its thrusters anyway to maintain its altitude, which can be combined with evasive maneuvers. It also means that debris at that altitude cleans itself up after a while.</p>
<p>Debris is a much greater problem at higher altitude, above 500 km. There, the atmosphere is so thin that all that junk will basically stay there forever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ISS and the spacecraft that is docked has trusters that is used to do debris avoidance maneuver. There was one done <a href="https://sattrackcam.blogspot.com/2020/07/iss-debris-avoidance-manoeuvre-of-3.html" target="_blank">last Friday</a> when a docked Progress cargoship raised the orbit by 900 meters</p>
<p>So large space junk it tracked from the ground and actively avoided but for dust size, you build it so it can sustain impacts.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OP - there is some small atmosphere there, which helps clean up debris.</p>
<p>Furthermore, due to the fact that as something halves in size, surface drops to 1/4 but weight to 1/8, small particles have a much greater surface to mass relationship so they drop speed much much faster.</p>
<p>In short, a particle 10000x smaller loses speed 10000x faster, everything else being equal.</p>
<p>So in effect that atmosphere scrubs small particles, the smaller the better. Also air resistance - which is what decelerates them - grows roughly with square of speed, so the very fast particles burn up their speed fast.</p>
<p>The ISS, being comparatively massive, loses speed slowly and just needs some regular boost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ISS purposefully occupies a very low-altitude orbit. At its height, there is enough residual atmosphere to induce a tiny amount of drag. This slows down orbiting objects and eventually causes them to fall into the atmosphere where they burn up. The ISS avoids this fate by getting the occasional speed boost from visiting spaceships.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simply put, because as much junk as is up there, it's STILL basically empty space. Even including intact and functioning gear (such as the ISS itself) the difference in &quot;density&quot; in orbital space between now and when we first started chucking stuff up into space is so small that in most other disciplines it would fall beneath the noise floor for your measurements.</p>
<p>Let's take Geosynchronous orbit as an example. That's up at an altitude of 22,236 miles, which means it is a circle of 139,713 miles in circumference. Now lets make an assumption that every geosynch satellite is the size of a city bus, which google says the largest ones come in at 45 ft long. It would take ~16.39 MILLION satellites to end up with a ring of physically touching material. How many geosynch satellites are there currently? 402.</p>
<p>So generally speaking the statistical likelihood of a collision is very small even if we do nothing. But it does still happen occasionally regardless, which is partly where US Space Command comes into play. They operate ground radars which track just about every bit of material up there larger than a few millimeters in length. The world's satellite operators (even 'enemy' nations) all have contact info on hand and if their satellite is at risk of running into something (another satellite, or just junk) they will call them up and warn them about it. It's one of those duties where it benefits everyone, even enemies, to work together on because nobody really benefits from satellites shattering up there. In the case of these messages being received, the parties involved will figure out an agreeable system for who moves and in what direction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
