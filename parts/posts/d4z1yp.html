<p>I am founder and CEO of a Robust.AI with Rodney Brooks and others. I work on robots and AI and am well-known for my skepticism about AI, some of which was featured last week in Wired, The New York Times and Quartz. </p>
<p>Along with Ernest Davis, I've written a book called Rebooting AI, all about building machines we can trust and am here to discuss all things artificial intelligence - past, present, and future.</p>
<p>Find out more about me and the book at <a href="http://rebooting.ai/" target="_blank">rebooting.ai</a>, <a href="http://garymarcus.com/" target="_blank">garymarcus.com</a>, and on Twitter @garymarcus. For now, ask me anything!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How much of the predictions about AI are just speculation and how do the predictions of experts with a great deal of knowledge on the topic differ from the speculations of the general public? Do you think we even can predict future technology accurately, or there's just enough people making predictions about the future that by chance some will end up being right? Is there any meaningful science supporting the robustness of future technological predictions?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
