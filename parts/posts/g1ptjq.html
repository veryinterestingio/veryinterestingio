		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Dog Aging Project is a longitudinal, observational research study that brings together a community of dogs, owners, veterinarians, researchers, and volunteers to carry out the most ambitious canine science project in the world. This ten-year, citizen-science initiative will investigate the biological, lifestyle, and environmental factors that influence healthy aging in dogs, and by extension, humans. To learn more or to join our efforts visit <a href="http://www.dogagingproject.org/" target="_blank">dogagingproject.org</a>.</p>
<p>We have been closely following the veterinary implications of COVID-19. Currently, two dogs in Hong Kong, a cat in Belgium, and at least one tiger in the US have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for the current pandemic. Neither of the dogs displayed symptoms of illness. Both cats did. For more details about our current understanding of COVID-19 in pets, please check out <a href="https://dogagingproject.org/dogs-and-covid-19-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont/" target="_blank">Dogs and COVID-19: What We Know and What We Don't</a> and <a href="https://dogagingproject.org/human-to-animal-transmission-of-sars-cov-2/" target="_blank">Human to Animal Transmission of SARS-CoV-2</a> on the Dog Aging Project blog. </p>
