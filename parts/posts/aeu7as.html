		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Metabolizing different things in your body requires the necessary enzymes to physically come in contact with whatever is being metabolized. Usually this means that if you have more (for example) drug in your body, that means you'll have drug bumping into enzymes at a higher rate. In the same way, after a while and a lot of the drug has already been metabolized by your body, it takes more time for your enzymes to randomly bump into the drug because theres less of it floating around.</p>
<p>Whats different about alcohol is that when you drink, all the enzymes for metabolizing alcohol are WILDLY outnumbered by the alcohol molecules. Theres so much more alcohol than there are enzymes that pretty much every single enzyme is working maxed out. This rate remains constantly at full speed until alcohol levels drop low enough that the enzymes arent completely saturated, which i think is in a range considered sober.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say you're an enzyme, and your job is to get rid of either caffeine or alcohol. Sometimes you'll be actually getting rid of those things, but other times you'll be floating around waiting to bump into them.</p>
<p>When we drink alcohol, we have lots of those alcohol molecules floating around compared to the enzymes. Imagine you're given a bucket and told to empty a swimming pool, you're gonna work at a pretty <strong>constant rate</strong> because you don't have to spend any time looking for water until it's about all gone. Similarly, when there are so many alcohol molecules in us, they're constantly bouncing into the enzymes, allowing them to work as fast as they can. In chemistry, this is a zero-order reaction if you want to look further into it or find similar ones</p>
<p>When we ingest caffeine, there aren't as many caffeine molecules compared to the enzymes that break them down. Imagine you're told to find a dozen needles in a haystack. The more you find, the harder it is to find more because every time you find one, you make it harder to find more. Similarly, the few caffeine molecules are waiting to bump into an enzyme and every time a caffeine molecule is lost, the likelihood goes further down. In this case, <strong>the rate depends on the number of caffeine molecules remaining</strong>. This is a first-order reaction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body has little guys called enzymes that break stuff down. Drugs break down when a particle of the chemical randomly bumps into the relevant enzyme.</p>
<p>Caffeine: Low concentrations of drug particles and enzymes means that the breakdown speed is limited by how often a drug particle randomly bumps into an enzyme. Therefore the more drug particles present, the more collisions happen, aka rate depends on drug concentration. You get exponential decay as you described.</p>
<p>Alcohol: At levels high enough to intoxicate you, there's WAY more alcohol particles than enzymes. Each enzyme is effectively &quot;surrounded&quot; by alcohol, so the limiting factor is not how many collisions there are but how fast the enzymes can physically do the breakdown. With all enzymes working at max speed, the alcohol gets processed at a constant rate (at least until there's so little left that collisions become a factor again).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
