<p>Wikipedia does have a giant list of modern states but the properties that distinguish the states seem so random.
In contrast solids, liquids gases and plasma seem to be very different.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;States of matter&quot; are not a simple tactile or easily observable property. A state is a &quot;region&quot; in the space of physical quantities (temperature, pressure, etc.) where the properties of matter are well defined and continuous. Between two different states there is always a &quot;discontinuity&quot; in the beheaviour of matter when altering these physical quantities.</p>
<p>One classic example is that the more heat you give to a liquid (for example water) the more its temperature increases (physical quantity). This happens continuously up to a certain point (evaporation point), when adding additional heat will not increase the temperature of the liquid, but will start a process of transformation to another state, gas (discontinuity). When the liquid is all evaporated and transitioned to the next state, gas, adding additional heat will again increase the temperature of the system, exactly like it did before the transition.</p>
<p>If you extend this idea beyond temperature and to other quantities, you realize that you can define a new state every time you have a discontinuity in one or more physical quantities.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned in other answers, states of matter are generally sperated by a state change, a sharp change in some physical property, while within a given state, that property varies smoothly. As an example of a property we don't usually equate with state change, superconductors have a specific superconducting state. This is measured by measuring the electrical resistance of the material. When you reach the critical temperature for a super conducting state, the resistance drops to beat zero and then stays there as the temp continues to drop. </p>
<p>There is some nuance to this definition, in some cases of you manipulate the temperature and pressure right to can actually skip the sharp change in physical properties. For instance in water, if you subject it to very high pressures and the heat it, you won't see the phase change from liquid to gas, it will be a continuous change between the two. So this definition isn't perfect, but it gives a better idea of how physicists use the word state technically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Phases of matter are defined by the transitions between them, called phase transitions. A phase transition is a discontinuous change in some physical quantity. For example in a first order phase transition the energy per particle will change discontinuously as temperature varies across the transition, holding pressure fixed.  In a second order transition, the derivative with respect to temperature of the energy will change discontinuously; and so on. A contour plot of the discontinuous quantity in in the temperature - pressure plane will show “cliffs” - sharp changes- at the phase transition, and these  define lines in the temperature pressure plane. For a liquid vapor phase transition the phase transition line disappears — the cliff goes away— at a critical point. Beyond the critical point there is no longer a sharp transition between the liquid and vapor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the other answers so far have been good to talk about properties. For example heat capacitances, superconducting vs not, paramagnetic  v ferromagnetic, insulator v conductor, etc.</p>
<p>I know for solids at least there is an argument to be made about topological structures (or more commonly crystal structures.) Looking at the way the atoms arrange themselves in a material can change the properties of the material. Often these structures change with temperature and pressure just like with your traditional phase diagram. In fact, there are very complex phase diagrams for many solids, particularly at high pressure and low temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>There's really no such thing as &quot;states of matter&quot;. Each substance -- or even more exotic creatures for which the word &quot;substance&quot; seems inadequate, such as fundamental quantum fields -- behaves in its own way. We see broad tendencies that seem applicable to many substances, but I think every child can tell that the solid-liquid-gas-plasma tetrachotomy can't be quite right because they can see things like toothpaste or peanut butter that don't look like either of the four states, but that at the same time you can't make a paste out of water.</p>
</li>
<li>Strictly speaking, the notion of state (or, more properly, 'phase') can be somewhat informal because what we define are not the phases but rather the transitions between them, which, as others have stated, are associated with discontinuities in some physical quantity, which we call the 'order parameter' for that transition.</li>
</ol>
<p>So you see for example the many arguments in this thread about whether or not liquid and gas are the same phase. That's a question without an answer, because all we know is there is a phase transition between liquid and gas, which terminates at the so-called critical endpoint: there exists a certain combination of pressure and temperature at which the latent heat of vaporization drops to zero, and at ever higher pressures there is no abrupt change at all.</p>
<p>What we have is a map where the borders are not necessarily closed lines, and we're asking where the countries are in the map. The answer is you can't draw them unambiguously, though in some cases we may subjectively decide to call the region next to a line a &quot;liquid&quot; and the region on the other side a &quot;gas&quot; even if there's no border between the regions if you go further up north. It's a subjective judgement call.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
