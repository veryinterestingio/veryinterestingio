		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>The royal chefs of Louis XIV's court that elevated black pepper to its current status. Louis the XIV was a notoriously picky eater and preferred his food as lightly seasoned as possible—he considered seasoning a vulgar act. In fact, he banned outright the use of all eastern spices beyond salt, pepper, and parsley (deemed more wholesome and exquisite than ruddy cardamom). Black pepper's spiky, pungent flavor provided just enough kick to the King's meals without overwhelming the taste of the underlying foods to satiate his needs.</p>
<p>The near-exclusive use of salt and pepper as table-side condiments has since spread throughout Europe and the Americas.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few reasons but my favourite is because of King Louis XIV.
Evidently he was a very picky eater and only liked his food lightly spiced.
The two “spices” that he didn’t mind were salt and pepper, so that’s all his chefs used.
And then everyone who wanted to prove how refined they were would eat like the king, turning salt and pepper into the staple it is today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Salt isn't a spice. The reason it's popular is because it was available pretty much all over the world and was primarily used for preserving food for at least 8000 years.</p>
<p>Pepper from what i've read, were the romans liking it and conquering pretty much everywhere. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two reasons.</p>
<p>Salt is amazing at preserving food, so much so that it was very valuable. The word salary comes from the salt allowance that Roman legions were partially paid in.</p>
<p>Secondly, both of them don't simply add an extra flavour to the food, like adding an actual spice. Salt and pepper actually make the existing flavours amplified, making them very useful in cooking just about everything. </p>
<p>It's also worth mentioning that salt isn't just useful, and tasty, but is also absolutely vital for survival. Salt is incredibly versatile, useful and you'll die of horrible things if you don't have it.</p>
<p>Pepper just tastes great. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Salt and pepper both have a long history although salt has a longer one than pepper. Salt has been used as a preservative since the time of Ancient Egyptians, before the development of refrigeration this was one of the only ways to preserve food for a long time. Salt is also one of the basic elements of our sense of taste. If you eat something salty you know instantly it's salty, and that may make you want more of it. The reason we developed this taste for salt is because salt is very important for our bodies to function. Salt (NaCl) is a mineral consisting of a sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl) atom. Sodium is important in keeping our body functioning well and we cannot make ourselves, we have to get it from our environment. It is important in helping regulate the water levels in your body, too little sodium and you will disrupt the balance of water on the outside and inside of cells. Osmotic gradients could be another ELI5 itself but basically too little sodium and you'll get very sick. </p>
<p>Pepper has had a different history. The pepper we most commonly refer to is actually piper nigrum, or black pepper. Romans also used piper longum, or long pepper. Long pepper has a stronger, hotter taste compared to black pepper. Black pepper adds just a little bit of spice without overwhelming the food and it grew popular during Roman times but it has a long history in its native environment.  Black pepper grows in SE Asia and has had a long history there as a seasoning. Its been known to Indian cooking since approximately 2000 BCE but was relatively recent  (in historical terms) in European cooking. Louis XIV, king of France from 1638-1715, arguably made black pepper the commodity it is today, he had a reputation for being unable to stomach strong foods so his chefs seasoned foods with just dashes and salt of pepper. As French cuisine was the haute cuisine of the time this usage of black pepper spread. Its also worth noting that pepper has also been prone to what is most popular of the day. On discovery of the New World chilli peppers became an exportable commodity and when dried had a taste profile similar to black pepper but with more heat and spiciness so when it was discovered it become the haute spice of the time and black pepper had reduced popularity among the wealthier classes. Black pepper has retained its popularity historically and became a staple in European and American cuisine which is why its so prolific now. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
