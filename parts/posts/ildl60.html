		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because people are willing to pay that much for Tesla stock, basically itâ€™s that a lot of people believe that Tesla is going to be successful (or at least believe that the stock price is going to keep rising) so a lot of people are buying more and more tsla stock, making the price go higher and higher. </p>
<p>This then give the company an abnormally high valuation, because the value of a company is found by how much money the company makes or how many items they produce, but instead by the total value of all the stock owned in that company. Basically how much money would be needed to buy all of the stock.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Value of companies is not directly related to how much they are selling now or even what profits they are making now. Instead the value is based upon the potential profits in the future, now this can include selling fewer cars than the competition, but making more profit per sale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Price is not connected to anything material in some cases. </p>
<p>In the Netherlands, a single tulip bulbs was once worth a mansion. No reason. It was just hype.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stocks are a bet on how profitable the company will be. If you think a company is about to be very profitable because we legalized slave labor again, you buy up a lot of stock &quot;betting&quot; that the value will go up. Once we re-outlaw slave labor, you cash out and sell.</p>
<p>In short, there's no real logical reason that tesla stock is more valuable. It's just more valuable because a bunch of people think it's more valuable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because thr stock market value is in large part a projection of future performance.  Historical data may be a useful indicator, but it's not the only factor. The pace at which Tesla has increased market share in this case is the driving force behind the surge in price.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
