		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As explained to a five year old:Colors you mix are different from colors in light. Light bounces off pigments, what the pigments don't soak up (like a sponge in water) bounce off and come into our eyes. The main pigments, red, yellow and blue, can be mixed to make the other colors, but the light our eyes take in and use to see is red, green and blue.</p>
<p>Because computers make light and aren't mixing pigments, they use what we see instead of needing to mix up different pigments in order to get colors.</p>
<p>Edit: Reworked slightly. Said the main pigments were easier to produce, and I am not certain of the factual accuracy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difference is between additive and subtractive colors.  When adding more of the color source makes the result brighter, usually from emitting light sources like light bulbs, LEDs (computer monitors), the sun, the primary colors are RBG.  When all additive primary colors are present you get white. </p>
<p>When adding more of the source makes things darker, like paints, and other light absorbing/reflecting scenarios, the primary colors are subtractive and you get RYB.  All subtractive primary colors make black.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Color theory is complicated.</p>
<p>For paint (light absorbers), we commonly use Cyan, Magenta and Yellow. For screens (light emitters), we commonly use Red, Green and Blue. But those are actually the same choices.</p>
<p>What? Yes, Cyan is White minus Red, Magenta is White minus Green and Yellow is White minus Blue. That is, Cyan paint is actually a Red absorbing paint, etc... And when you mix paint, you absorb all of the mixed paint (we say paint combine subtractively). So mix Cyan and Magenta, and you get Blue (absorb Red and Green).</p>
<p>Now, the question is why we chose Red/Green/Blue in the first place? Well, the reason is due to our color perception. We have 3 kind of cones in the retina that perceive Blueish, Greenish and... Yellowish?!</p>
<p>Why Red then? Well, those cones actually detect a blurry spectrum. The Bluish one will see from violet to cyan, the Greenish one will see cyan to yellow, and the Yellowish one will see green to red. Then your retina do a funny trick where it subtract the Greenish to the Yellowish and deduce Redishness.</p>
<p>But technically, we could use other base colors. The human color <strong>gamut</strong> is big, and to pick good base color all you have to do is pick them far apart. You can then form any color in the middle of those, but not outside. Three color form a triangle with already a decent area, ideally you have as many color as the entire spectrum. And finally, to translate it into paint color you have to invert those colors (subtract them from white).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Red, Yellow, and Blue are not really primary colors. That's an inaccurate and outdated color model developed before we understood how light works. There are 2 color models we use now. Subtractive color (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) is used for things that reflect light, like dyes, inks, and pigments. Additive color uses red, green, and blue, and is used for things that emit light, like tv, computer, and phone screens. Our eyes also see color in RGB. We have 3 different types of cells in our eyes that detect color, and each is most sensitive to a different wavelength of light, corresponding to red, green, and blue. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>RGB <em>are</em> the primary colors.  Your art teacher was wrong.</p>
<p>RYB can be called the primary pigments, if you like.</p>
<p>The parts of our eyes that detect color resolve all incoming visible light into either red, green, or blue, and our brain makes up all the rest by comparing intensity of each.</p>
<p>So computers are made to mimic our biology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
