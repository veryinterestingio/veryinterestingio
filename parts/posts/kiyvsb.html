<p>Just a simple question, further details about some cases in the link above. This condition seems a bit dangerous to just suddenly come out of nowhere, and is the first time I'm hearing about it.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Another news article which claims experts have said mostly heavily immunocompromised like cancer patients, organ transplant patients and diabetics are in danger of infection.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to your article and the US <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/mucormycosis/index.html#:~:text=Mucormycosis%20(previously%20called%20zygomycosis\)%20is,to%20fight%20germs%20and%20sickness." target="_blank">CDC</a>, mucormycosis is most common in patients who have weakened immune systems, like those taking corticosteroids for severe COVID symptoms. The fungi that cause mucormycosis are fairly common, but an intact immune system normally keeps it at bay.</p>
<p>And yes, mucormycosis is potentially life threatening.</p>
<p>Edit: for further reading about fungal infections, I recommend this <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4292074/" target="_blank">review</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The species of mold that cause mucormycosis are ubiquitous in the environment. We are exposed to them all the time.</p>
<p>It's only pathologic in patients with compromised immune systems, classically that would be severe diabetes with history of DKA, solid organ transplant, bone marrow transplant, and other hematologic cancers. Oh and it's been associated with iron chelation therapy. Typically infection starts in the sinuses or lungs, and spread to adjacent areas. It can also cause skin infections, this is thought to be related to contaminated dressings.</p>
<p>The causative mold is angioinvasive. It likes blood vessels, and spreads inside blocking blood flow, so it can cause a lot of necrosis, and spreads quickly.</p>
<p>It's a terrible infection. Treatment is antifungal drugs and requires aggressive, repeated, frequent, and early surgical debridement. You need to cut away everything you can until you get to healthy appearing bleeding tissue. The earlier you start the better the chances of survival. That also depends on what form you have,best we can do is probably 50% survivi, and usually you end up with a lot of disfigurement due to the surgical debridements.</p>
<p>This isn't that common an infection though. maybe 1000 reported cases over 50 years? I've only taken care of 5 or 6 patients with confirmed diagnosis over the course of 10 years.</p>
<p>The association with getting mold infections after COVID is something that we have noticed in the at risk population. Though we see far more aspergillus than mucor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The condition is more than &quot;a bit dangerous,&quot; as it kills more than half of people who have it.  I've seen 3 patients with it in the last couple years.  Ophthalmology and ENT are usually at the forefront of care as the fungus causes rapid necrosis usually involving in the sinuses, nasal cavity, and orbit before affecting the brain. Patients were, and usually are extremely poorly controlled diabetics here in the US.  These post COVID patients are probably diabetics and additionally on high dose steroids making them further immunocompromised.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is one of the few dermatologic emergencies.  Although it is extraordinarily rare, it has a predilection for the immunosuppressed and those with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.  I would be interested to see if the patients involved also had those medical comorbidities.</p>
<p>For those interested, Mucormycosis has highly diagnostic pathology on simple H&amp;E.  <a href="https://dermnetnz.org/topics/mucormycosis-pathology/" target="_blank">https://dermnetnz.org/topics/mucormycosis-pathology/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the phrases that is often used is opportunistic pathogen, as these and many others are common environmental fungi people can be exposed to them on a regular basis without much of an issue however, once the immune system is weakened they can cause infection and the range of issues that entails. There are a heap of fungi which are opportunistic pathogens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
