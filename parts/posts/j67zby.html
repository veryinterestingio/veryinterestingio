		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Coffee, juice, and soda are not &quot;other liquids&quot; in the way that, say, cooking oil is. Those are all just water with stuff in it. However, in some cases, like coffee, the other stuff in the water causes your body to produce more urine, which can make it so, on net, you lose water. Whether or not the diuretic effects of coffee are enough to completely cancel out the water you gain I can't say (though I doubt it). You probably could survive (i.e. not die of dehydration) by just drinking coffee. The same definitely goes for juice (which is mostly just water + sugar) or soda (same thing with CO2 mixed in).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to recent research you probably could get away with drinking beer instead of water as long as it doesn’t exceed 2% ABV, as the alcohols diuretic effect is negligible at that concentration. But good luck finding any beer like that as basically all commercially available beer starts around 4% ABV.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don't necessarily need plain water, and plenty of people go long periods without ever drinking it. It may not be as healthy, due to the sugar content of soda and juice, or caffeine in coffee, but they will satisfy the body's water needs, in addition to the water taken in from foods. And while caffeine is a diuretic, drinking coffee still provides a net increase in hydration.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you could, because those things all contain water.</p>
<p>Water is needed because, primarily, it's a polar substance, meaning it has a net partial electrical charge: the hydrogen ends are positive, and the central oxygen is negative. This makes water really good at dissolving materials and carrying minerals in it. There are also <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/why-is-water-important" target="_blank">these benefits</a> to staying hydrated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
