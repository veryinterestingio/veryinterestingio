There is no rush to figure out what particle is responsible for water staying in the bucket when I spin it around. What am I missing?</p>
<p>Edit: Guys and gals thanks for all the great answers and the interest on this question.  I'm glad there are people out there a lot smarter than I am working on this!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some Background: General relativity is a classical theory and thus has no force carrying particle (or gauge boson). The forces in the standard model (sm) however have gauge bosons: photons, weak gauge bosons, gluons. This is due to the fact that those theories are <strong>quantized</strong> and a gauge particle arises as a result of a quantized theory.</p>
<p>It was quite hard to detect the quantized nature of QED (magnetism and light) by proving the particle nature of light.</p>
<p>Gravity however is thought to be a quantized theory as well.. GR (general relativity) is believed to be insufficient and a quantized version of it is expected to be realized in nature. This quantized theory is hidden from our view at our accessible energy scales and so we cant directly detect a graviton at our energies (yet). Note that quantized GR needs(!) a graviton.
Quantizing GR is a bit difficult though. if we do it like we do it with our other gauge theories (QED,QCD) problems arise which is ongoing research.</p>
<p>You say, Gravity is not a pure force since its just curvature in space time. I think this is a matter of definition! It is an interaction leading to acceleration in your frame and thus a force for me.</p>
<p>I remember that gauge theories can be seen as curvature of a &quot;color space&quot;  and that there are surprising many parallels in our theoretical descriptions of GR and gauge theories. Maybe ask in stack exchange about that or even here if you want to know more about that. In this sense magnetism can be explained by curvature as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because its very difficult to see how gravity can't be a quantum interaction if every other field is.  Leaving Gravity as a pure classical distortion is space-time makes predictions about super high energy particle interactions impossible.  We assume the universe makes sense, and there are no fundamental incompatibilities.</p>
<p>An Example is
Particles can be in a super position of states.  General Relativity does not allow for this, which part of the super position generates the classical gravitation distortion?  What happens during collapse of the waveform?</p>
<p>There is no solution to this problem currently.  There are no background independent Quantum field theories.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the hope that it will lead to a theory of physics which doesn’t include every particle interaction becoming a black hole with infinite energy density at a single point, because we know that that doesn’t happen. I’m not really knowledgeable about the current work on quantum loop gravity and other similar theories, so I don’t know how convincing they are, or what the state of the field is atm.</p>
<p>And of course, string theory is the other solution here, since it means that interactions happen over a region of space, so the infinite energy density thing doesn’t happen. It brings its own problems of extra dimensions, and finding precisely the right way to hide them so that we see 3+1, while maintaining the normal physics that we observe and without adding too much extra physics that we don’t yet observe. The advantage of string theory though is that you get a meaningful description of gravity without any extra work (or quantum fields). </p>
<p>However, some feel that its flaws and absurdities and lack of real evidence (there are lots of things that kind of imply string theory, especially if the beauty of the mathematics counts, but none of them could be used to directly show string theory by experiment.)</p>
<p>As for the historical reasons, with the exclusion of gravity, everything can be explained by quantum field theories, with QFT we made some of the most accurate theoretical predictions ever, and there is no denying that for EM, the weak force and the strong force, QFT has been highly successful. Especially in the regard that we can make approximations with perturbation theory.  </p>
<p>It doesn’t seem too much of a stretch to think that gravity could be explained by much the same mechanism, but we found that we couldn’t use perturbation theory like we could for the other forces, it is non-renormaliseable. If you try to use perturbation theory you get these problems of random black holes and infinite energy densities. People tried to do things without perturbation theory but that is really really hard. So some people proposed string theory and some other people tried a bunch of different methods. And at the moment, neither have worked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of interesting answers here but I feel they neglect the purpose of theory. Physicists treat gravity as a &quot;fundimental force&quot; because for the purposes of generating predictions it is consistent with reality. Untestable conjectures about reality tend to be less than useless by limiting our imagination to rules we impose that do not necesary accurately reflect reality. The framework that treats gravity as a fundimental force is no more &quot;accurate&quot; than the framework that treats it as pure geometry and are not mutually exclusive. The one model better predicts behavior from certain conditions better than the other and vice versa. No model can be absolutely accurate as we are ultimately limited in our ability to describe reality. Gravity just is, it isn't a wave, it isn't a fundimental force, it isn't geometry, these are all human creations and aproximations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
