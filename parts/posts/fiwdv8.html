		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit: I just wanted to say that when I wrote this I
made some minor simplifications in order to make this easy to understand, including leaving out the “repo market.” If you want to learn more, read The Economist or WSJ. </p>
<p>—————</p>
<p>The government isn’t just giving banks $1.5 trillion. </p>
<p>There are three things you need to understand before I talk about the specifics of what’s happening now: </p>
<p>(1) The Federal Reserve is a central bank that was formed by the government. It operates independently from the rest of the government. The president can’t tell them what to do. Congress can’t tell them what to do. It’s almost like a non-profit organization. It’s goal is to keep the economy as steady as possible and prevent excess inflation. </p>
<p>(2) A US treasury bond is an IOU from the US government. Anyone can buy a US treasury bond. When you buy it, you’re giving a loan to the US government. Personally, I own about $1,000 worth of them because all my relatives gave them to me as gifts when I was a kid. You can cash them in for money whenever you want, but the longer you hold onto them, the more interest they accrue. A big bank like JP Morgan might own billions of dollars worth of these bonds. </p>
<p>3) The money that you (hopefully) have in your bank account right now isn’t actually sitting at your bank. The bank is using that money to give people loans. That’s how the bank makes money. At any given time, your bank may only have about 10% of everyone’s money as cash-on-hand. The rest is given out in the form of loans. So if everyone came to the bank at the same time and asked for their money, the bank wouldn’t be able to do it. They simply don’t have the cash. </p>
<p>When the economy is down, banks start running low on cash. Banks give out fewer loans so they don’t run out of money. This may force the interest rates to rise. Imagine a bank saying “I’m really short on cash here. But I guess I can loan you some if you’re willing to pay 30% interest!” Fewer people and fewer businesses would choose to take out loans. Plus businesses are scared to take out loans during a recession anyway. Overall this  means less money is spent. And remember when businesses are spending less money, it means businesses aren’t paying as many employees to work.</p>
<p>In order to solve this problem, the Federal Reserve is buying $1.5 trillion worth of US Treasury Bonds from banks. Now the banks have cash, and the Federal Reserve now owns these bonds. The Federal Reserve can sell these bonds later and recoup a lot of the money.</p>
<p>TL;DR You want to start a lemonade stand. You ask the bank for a loan but they don’t have any money to give out. A magical fairy called the Federal Reserve flies down from the sky and buys stuff from the bank. Now the Federal Reserve has stuff, and the bank has money. Now the bank can give you a loan! With this loan you are able to buy lemons and sugar, which helps out your local grocery store! And you’re able to hire a few employees, which helps them out too!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The government buys bonds (IOUs) from the banks so the banks have cash to meet their needs. The government then trades the bonds back for cash later (usually as short as a few days). That way when you go to the bank to take out money, they have money to give you and everyone else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>calling it a bailout is misleading. That makes it sounds like the government is just paying for the bank to continue operations. “Bailouts” are just government loans to help the banks get back on their feet, but they have to pay them back. In fact, the US government ended up making money off of the 2008 bank bailout</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short simplified answer - it’s not a bail out. You deposit money with a bank, bank lends your money to some else, like a small business owner who needs to expand his store. When something bad happens and people want their money back, the bank might not have enough money to give you money back right away. The government essentially opened up a pool of money the banks can borrow from temporarily to pay you until the small business owner slowly pay back their loan, which is put back in that pool the government opened up. </p>
<p>TLDR version - The banks don’t technically get the money to keep</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
