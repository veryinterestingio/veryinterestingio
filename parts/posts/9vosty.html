		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Paranoia basically. It's possible for a cell phone to create a spark powerful enough to ignite a flammable gas mixture, but it takes some extreme circumstances, like the phone being dropped or crushed or something.</p>
<p>The thing is, guess what else is present at gas stations, and has electronics specifically designed to create sparks that ignite flammable mixtures, plus miles of other electronics and thousands of pounds of steel clanking around, none of which is designed to never produce sparks? Why cars themselves of course.</p>
<p>Backing up a little, there's a whole industry for real hazardous area electronics. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_equipment_in_hazardous_areas" target="_blank">This wikipedia article</a> is a good place to start. Areas that are expected to have, or to have a reasonable chance of, having flammable mixtures of air and gasses, have designations that represent how much of the time ignitable mixtures are present. A normal gas station could be considered Class 1, Zone 2, but none are actually treated this way, likely due to the impracticality of it and the very low percentage of the time anything ignitable is exposed.</p>
<p>There are standards for electronics that are actually designed to operate in environments full of flammable gasses. This include Intrinsically Safe electronics, which are designed in such a way that they cannot produce a spark strong enough to ignite anything, even if dropped, damaged, or mishandled. This one is used for most small handheld electronics. You can buy IS cell phones and PDAs and other such gadgets, <a href="http://www.reliabilitydirectstore.com/Intrinsically-Safe-Cell-Phones-s/82.htm" target="_blank">like these</a>, but they're very bulky, expensive, and underpowered compared to normal consumer devices. Generally nobody does unless they need to work in environments that are actually restricted.</p>
<p>Some other standards include Explosion-Proof, for electronics that are enclosed in heavy metal cases with very little ventilation, such that an explosion can happen inside, but it will not breach the case or cause any mixtures outside of the case to ignite. Also Purged and Pressurized, where an air hose feeds known-clean air into an enclosure around the device. The enclosure is intentionally not completely sealed, and maintained at a slight positive pressure, so that clean air constantly leaks out, preventing any flammable gases from leaking in.</p>
<p>You'll notice that none of the things around a gas station meet any of these requirements. Notice the lack of quarter-inch thick steel around the gas pump electronics, and the lack of a airtight hatch on the door to the store. Gas stations are, for practical purposes, not hazardous areas, and there's minimal risk from using a cellular phone normally, as many other things far more likely to spark are there. That said, please don't spill a big puddle of gasoline, drop your phone in it, and then hit it with a hammer - that has a pretty good chance of starting a fire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another theory is that static electricity held within anythin in immediate range of the gas pump could lead to sudden discharge by means of some electrical conductivity. Combine that with a variable frequency based comm-protocol such as bluetooth and there may be a chance that is not supported by any documented connection.</p>
<p>This is mostly overprotective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The myth is that a cell phone could cause a static spark that could ignite the gasoline fumes  from the pump and blow your car up. That cannot actually happen -- your cell phone would need the ability to generate thousands of volts of direct current, and a great deal of the phone's design is intended specifically to prevent this. </p>
<p>However, using your cell phone does actually increase the possibility of an accident in two ways:</p>
<p>1) You aren't touching the car or the pump handle, allowing any static buildup from other sources to accrue without being discharged; that's why you're supposed to touch a piece of the car's chassis before gripping the pump handle if you've let go of it, and</p>
<p>2) You're paying attention to your phone, not the pump, which prevents you from noticing potential hazards such as a leaking pump or nearby ignition source. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a myth.  No survivable amount of cellphone rf can ignite gasoline.  They never could.  You can make sparks in a microwave but the rf level is a million times higher and would, like. cook you.</p>
<p>Actually, as insanely bad an idea as it sounds, smoking cigarettes cannot ignite gasoline either.</p>
<p>All cases seem to come from static electricity.  Almost always a young person getting back into the car, sliding out over a fabric seat, getting charged, and touch nothing before removing the nozzle and delivering a zap.</p>
<p>Why only young folks?  Older people grab the door frame to help themselves out and thus don't pick up a charge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
