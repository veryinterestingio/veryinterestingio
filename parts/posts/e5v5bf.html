		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some metals act as a filter and only reflect certain parts of the spectrum. For example, gold absorbs the blue parts of the incoming light and therefore appears yellow-ish.
For “silver” surfaces, there is no dip in the spectrum, instead the metal reflects less than 100% of the total incoming light and therefore appears grey-ish.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because &quot;silver&quot; isn't really a color like the others, it's just what we call a neutral reflective surface.</p>
<p>Real surfaces don't have just one color, they are more complicated than that. When we think of a basic colored surface, we usually think of the <em>diffuse</em> color. A matte color, in other words. Matte white is what we call a surface that reflects all light, but scatters it.</p>
<p>But some surfaces are shiny. That shiny reflection can also be colored, and we call that the <em>specular</em> color. It can be different from the diffuse color for any given material! And different surfaces can have a different balance between matte and shiny. For example, white ceramic/china is somewhere in between, with a strong matte component (the main white part) but a very noticeable shine. A lot of surfaces have a non-white matte component, but a totally white/neutral shine.</p>
<p>When it comes to most colors, we don't really distinguish between matte and shiny in the way we talk about them. But it turns out that surfaces that reflect all colors, but are predominantly matte or shiny, are common enough and distinct enough that we give them different names: white and silver, respectively.</p>
<p>There are some other examples, e.g. we call something with a lot of shine that is yellow &quot;gold&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>if you see something as silver, it wouldn’t be reflecting all of the colours.</p>
<p>If we talk about mirrors, it would be because of the angle of reflection. If a mirror is placed at an angle such that a blue flashlight is reflecting at you, it reflects all of that blue flashlight, it doesn’t suddenly find red where red isn’t</p>
<p>edit: also you must remember how colours work. If you see red, it means that whatever you are looking at that is red, is simply absorbing all other colour wavelengths and only reflecting red. So a surface like a mirror that is showing red, is actually only reflecting the light that other stuff doesn’t absorb.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
