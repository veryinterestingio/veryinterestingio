<p>It always goes from the senders phone, to the telecom network computer system and then to the receivers phone.</p>
<p>Depending on the configuration of the telecom provider sms system messages get stored for different periods of time this is called the (sms) retention period.</p>
<p>It differs per carrier, it's somewhere between 0 days and a year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Kinda interesting...one time those servers had a fuckup and delivered a bunch of old texts sometimes to the wrong people. <a href="https://www.komando.com/security-privacy/why-random-text-messages-middle-of-the-night/612170/" target="_blank">https://www.komando.com/security-privacy/why-random-text-messages-middle-of-the-night/612170/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am curious to know what happens to texts if you block a person. Can you still retrieve them later or do they just disappear? Edit to be precise I blocked my bastard old boss via my iPhone contact list. I just unblocked him because I’ve got more unemployment coming but was wondering if I missed something</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few years ago I actually worked on the Oracle servers that Sprint was using to save and send all text messages. It was 4 identical beefy servers that each ran two statements 10s of thousands of times per second: insert a message, select a message. That was it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To provide a little more information.:  The servers are called SMSC.  At least the one I supported had Web and application front end servers with a database backend.  All SMSgoes through the SMSC and looks for routing information the final destination of the SMS.  If it is not handled locally, it gets handed off to a clearing house Verisign.  If it is handled locally, the SMSC communicates with the telco switch to see if the phone is available, if yes, then the SMS gets handed off and delivered tot he phone.  If not, then the SMSC will try again later.</p>
<p>So until the SMS is delivered, it lives in a database.</p>
<p>Also, while most of the infrastructure of the SMSC was  standard servers, we did have specialized network bridges to communicate over the Telco SS7 network directly to the Telco switch.  A Telco switch is the modern implementation of the old telephone switch boards you see in old movies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
