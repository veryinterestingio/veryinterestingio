		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there's a lot going on here. I'm a physicist, not a biologist, so I'm going to talk mostly about the physics involved.</p>
<p>Visible light is very useful as a sensory medium because the spectrum of the sun peaks in the visible region. So the world is nice and bright in those wavelengths, at least during the day. This is why animal eyes have generally evolved to make use of those wavelengths. I know a few animals such as birds and some insects extend that range a little into the UV beyond what humans can perceive, but they don't go very far, because there's not much point having a sense organ sensitive to wavelengths that aren't commonly found in on Earth. Similarly with anything beyond short infrared. There are some species such as pit vipers who have infrared sensory organs to detect body heat of prey, but nothing detects microwaves or radio.</p>
<p>There's a physical problem on the long wavelength end. To detect a given wavelength, your detector needs to be at least roughly the same size. Even if there were natural radio waves bright enough to be useful, no animal would be able to see them without a detector the size of an aerial, or a satellite dish.</p>
<p>There's another physical problem too, in that microwaves, radio waves, x-rays, and gamma rays all pass through our bodies. If your body can't <em>stop</em> a photon passing through it, it basically can't detect it.</p>
<p>Putting all this together explains why living beings can sense visible light and almost nothing else. We can feel the warmth of infrared, but because of the longer wavelength it doesn't have the fine resolution of visible light. So those pit vipers can detect roughly where a warm prey animal is, but they can't resolve it with any detail.</p>
<p>If animals can't <em>sense</em> any given wavelength, then there's not much point being able to emit it, even if it were physically possible. A lot of wavelengths simply can't be generated by an organic being - radio for example takes a large transmitter, and is most efficiently built of metal. X-rays require too much energy input, and are dangerous besides.</p>
<p>I'm fairly certain no organisms emit anything other than visible light, or possibly near UV/IR (as well as the thermal IR you mentioned). And I hope what I said explains why.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to focus on radiofrequencies, because infra-red and ultraviolet frequncies of the EM spectrum are obviously used by many animals (although I don't think any animal actively produces ultraviolet light, they just reflect it).</p>
<p><strong>In short:</strong></p>
<p>All animals produce bioelectric fields, and as a result, some electromagnetic radiation is also generated as radio frequencies in the gigahertz range. Some animals are further adapted into passively sensing these electric fields with specialized electroreception organs, and others still are further specialized into actively generating their own electric fields/discharges and sensing their surroundings based on how their own electric field is affected.</p>
<p>So a lot of animals can <em>sense</em> and some can <em>produce</em> electric fields.</p>
<p>But I don't think any species is evolved to specifically sense or produce <em>electromagnetic waves</em> at radio frequencies for useful purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Long answer:</strong></p>
<p>There are definitely animals that can emit electromagnetic radiation in the radio wavelengths, but I don't think any of them actually make <em>use</em> of that radiation - it's more of a byproduct of other things they do.</p>
<p>For example, there are several aquatic animals which can produce high voltage electric discharges, which they can use to incapacitate nearby prey animals, or to deter predators.</p>
<p>Electric current is movement of charges, and when you accelerate charged particles you produce electromagnetic waves. However, these animals don't generally have an antenna to select a certain wavelength to emit. Instead, an electric discharge typically produces a broad spectrum electromagnetic pulse. If you had an radio nearby, tuned to a &quot;white noise&quot; frequency on the AM band, you might be able to hear a series of faint &quot;pops&quot; for the pulse generated by each discharge, depending on how close you are to the source (the animal). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cly0DEdJLsI" target="_blank">In this video</a> the electric discharges of an electric eel are demonstrated with a speaker hooked up the voltage probes on the aquarium, converting the electric discharges into sound in a more direct way, but <em>theoretically</em> this is also what you should be able to hear on the radio receiver.</p>
<p>There are also animals that can sense electric fields, which is called <em>electroreception</em>. These, too, tend to be aquatic animals, and a lot of them are also animals that can produce the aforementioned electric discharges. In fact, part of the function of the electric discharges is sensing conductive and non-conductive objects nearby, because they interact differently with the electric field produced by the animal. This is called active electroreception, and it's used by animals such as electric eels, electric rays, and some sharks (like elephant fish).</p>
<p>There is also <em>passive</em> electroreception, in which the animal senses weak bioelectricity generated by <em>other</em> organisms nearby. Most sharks can use passive electroreception.</p>
<p>Now, again <em>in theory</em> if you have two electric eels producing their electric discharges, they would <em>definitely</em> be able to feel each other through their electroreception sense. And, in theory, if you can sense <em>electric fields</em> then you can also sense <em>electromagnetic radiation</em>, at least if it's powerful enough (and at suitable wavelength) to excite the sensory organs that can sense electric fields.</p>
<p>However, I don't think the electromagnetic pulses produced by these animals are actually strong enough to travel very far through the water. This is because water tends to have all kinds of ions in solution, which makes it conductive, and conductive materials typically become opaque to EM-waves (though they can be transparent on some wavelengths). Case in point, radio waves that can easily go through air do not penetrate very far in water. Because of this, I think it's just the electric field that these animals sense, rather than the (very weak) electromagnetic pulses that would be produced.</p>
<p>Then there are animals that can sense magnetic fields. Again, in theory, if an animal has a sensory organ that can sense magnetic fields, it could <em>in theory</em> be able to sense very long radio waves as a form of slowly oscillating magnetic field. However the required field strength to pick up these radio waves with a magnetoreception organ would probably require extremely powerful transmitter. It doesn't seem like any animal has a mechanism to actually produce radio waves of such intensity.</p>
<p>Producing electromagnetic radiation at wavelengths shorter than ultraviolet would be problematic because at some point, EM-radiation becomes ionizing so the organism would be actively giving itself cancer. This might actually be a valid strategy at increasing random mutations in a species with extremely fast and effective reproductive cycle, but I don't know of any examples where such a thing would have occurred. And I don't know of any biological mechanism to produce short wavelength UV-radiation, never mind X-rays or gamma rays... except by absorbing radionuclides, but then you would just passively emit radiation from their decay.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not quite radiation per se, but electromagnetic all the same: Electric eels can push a LOT of current into the water around them. Plenty of other sea life, as well as with migratory birds, use magnetic fields to navigate. But you're not going to see life operating outside the visible spectrum as far as photons are concerned due to the reasons other commentators have outlined.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the fact that visible light is visible is because those wavelengths are in the range of energy quanta of the excited electron orbitals of typical biomolecules.</p>
<p>So a typical carbon based small molecule doesn't emit radiation outside that range.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/Sacramento_City_College/SCC%3A_CHEM_330_-_Adventures_in_Chemistry_(Alviar-Agnew)/03%3A_Atomic_Structure/3.06%3A_Electron_Arrangement-_The_Bohr_Model_(Orbits)" target="_blank">figure</a> 3.6.8</p>
<p>TIL X rays are emitted from excited tungsten atoms (for human made x ray machines) so they have the right electron orbitals. So let's use tungsten and x rays as an example.</p>
<p>Not much <a href="https://youtu.be/VTLYris4kJU" target="_blank">tungsten in organisms</a>.</p>
<p>There <em>are</em> some tungsten containing enzymes. Could bio tungsten could have other roles such as emitting x rays?</p>
<p>X rays are so high energy, it would be really a big energetic challenge to get enough chemical energy in a biomolecule to excite tungsten enough that it would emit an x ray upon relaxation. <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/L7thMTuiUxshf4ip6" target="_blank">two <em>orders of magnitude</em></a> more eV than visible light. That is probably why life doesn't use such systems but rather depends on lower energy range that produces visible light.</p>
<p>Sorry I didn't get to <em>lower</em> energy emissions (compared to visible light) but I'ma think on it</p>
<p>My friend pointed out that the visible light spectrum is also the peak of solar radiation hitting our planet so maybe this biophysical justification is still within the &quot;box&quot; of life on earth, and with different selection pressures there could be similar molecular systems that worked in X-ray or radar range.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
