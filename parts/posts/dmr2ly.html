		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, creating matter from energy is perfectly doable.</p>
<p>One example would be particle accelerators such as the LHC. In the LHC, proton beams are accelerated and thereby given a very high amount of kinetic energy. These highly energetic protons collide and produce various new particles. The combination of newly produced particles often has a higher mass than the 2 protons that collided to form them.</p>
<p>Consider for example the production of a Higgs boson. The Higgs boson was found to have a mass of 125 GeV (giga-electronvolt), while a proton has a mass of 938 MeV (mega-electronvolt) or slightly less than 1 GeV. So the 2 protons that collided to create a Higgs boson have a combined mass far smaller than the mass of the particle that was created.</p>
<p>And this is possible thanks to the fact that the protons had such a high amount of (kinetic) energy going into this whole mess.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another example is <em>pair production</em>. A high energy photon can, when in the vicinity of a nucleus, turn into an electron and positron or other particle-antiparticle pairs. The photon energy has to be greater than the mass-energy of the particle pair. A photon in empty space doesn't undergo pair production because energy and momentum cannot both be conserved, a nearby nucleus is needed to take up the excess.</p>
<p>EDIT PS: The photons need to be high-energy X-rays or gamma rays to do this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, let me one-up this question...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In theory, if we were able to provide a sufficient energy source [i.e. Dyson sphere or similar] could we produce specific atoms, and or compounds ? And furthermore use those compounds for extraterrestrial constructions?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And yes I know we are moving to the sci-fi realms now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the energy given off in a fission or fusion process comes from the release of nuclear binding energy.  E=mc^(2) describes a &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence" target="_blank">mass-energy equivalence</a>&quot;.  That is, any mass has an equivalent amount of energy, and vice versa.</p>
<p>From the above link:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>The difference between the rest mass of a bound system and of the unbound parts is the binding energy of the system, if this energy has been removed after binding. For example, a water molecule weighs a little less than two free hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom. The minuscule mass difference is the energy needed to split the molecule into three individual atoms (divided by c2), which was given off as heat when the molecule formed (this heat had mass). Likewise, a stick of dynamite in theory weighs a little bit more than the fragments after the explosion, but this is true only so long as the fragments are cooled and the heat removed. In this case the mass difference is the energy/heat that is released when the dynamite explodes, and when this heat escapes, the mass associated with it escapes, only to be deposited in the surroundings, which absorb the heat (so that total mass is conserved).</em>&quot;</p>
<p>If we could contain all of the energy and matter of that stick of dynamite in a sealed vessel, the numbers would be the same before and after it exploded.  However, such <strong>closed</strong> systems don't exist in nature, and so some energy is lost to the environment.  Due to mass-energy equivalent, the remains of that stick of dynamite weigh a fraction less after the explosion than before, and that &quot;mass defect&quot; can be assigned a value according to E=mc^(2).</p>
<p>In other words, mass is <strong>NOT</strong> converted into energy in a fission or fusion event.  We can't really &quot;weigh&quot; energy released in a reaction, so we use E=mc^(2) in order to <strong><em>describe the energy released as an equivalent mass</em></strong>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
