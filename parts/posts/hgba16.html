		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This would obviously depend on the time period and the military force. I am assuming you are talking about times before modern warfare as modern warfare treats rank and positions quite differently then before. Field promotions are usually conducted by any superior officer as positions needs to be filled. But they are usually just temporary promotions for the campaign until a better replacement can be found. So it does not come with any additional pay or rights. Military units usually keeps a log over everything that happens including field promotions. The officer would often send letters to his superiors recommending people for permanent promotions. If this is granted the promotion becomes permanent and would come with a pay raise. An officer might have a quota for how many people of different rank he would be allowed to promote. It might also have been up to the military education facilities to decide who would be promoted but the recommendations would help a lot, especially if exams did not go well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Onboard a ship the highest ranking officer serves as the captain and the 'promotion' is automatic.
The interesting story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sitgreaves_Cox" target="_blank">William Sitgreaves Cox</a> is of particular note because Lt Cox didn't realize that he was the highest ranking officer and was court martial-ed for abandoning his post.  he was kicked out of the Navy for it.<br />
I believe this story is told in the book Starship Troopers. If not this one, then one just like it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Speaking for the Canadian Military, but I presume very similar principles apply for most other western militaries, an army is divided up into units each with their own Commanding Officer (CO). For the infantry, this would be a Battalion. Battalions are made of companies, companies made of platoons. </p>
<p>In our National Defense Act, the CO is the lowest level officer which is granted any legal authority, by merit of their position and is typically of the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. Legally speaking, orders coming from a subordinate officer are considered delegated authority.</p>
<p>The CO will be authorized to promote people. There may be limitations on what ranks they can promote, or if they are allowed to delegate this authority, but in principle, the answer to your second question about who can give battlefield promotions - the CO.</p>
<p>If the CO is killed there would be a line of succession, and typically the Deputy CO would become the acting CO and would gain their authorities. </p>
<p>As for who tracks them. Every unit has an Adjudant who works either for the CO or DCO. They are effectively (though they would hate this description) the unit Human Resource Officer. Every day, during peacetime and war, part of their job is to send reports to higher headquarters, where promotions, casualties, and other info would be tracked. </p>
<p>There aren't really any current provisions for battlefield promotions in current policies, but I imagine that even during major conflicts like the World Wars, it still would have followed these general principles. </p>
<p>I also can't imagine that, if things became so chaotic that it were impossible to follow this reporting chain, promotions wouldn't be enough of a priority to actually occur. Soldiers would follow orders from the existing rank structure until the unit could reorganize.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apparently the last time one was given in a modern Western military was in 2014, in the British army:</p>
<p>Rifleman Gigar Das was given a field promotion to Lance Corporal in 2014 after serving eight years in the 1st Battalion The Rifles. Das had been deployed on three tours in Afghanistan and one in Iraq. Das was promoted after General Sir Peter Wall, Chief of the General Staff witnessed him giving a training session in marksmanship principles. General Wall was astonished that Das was still only a Rifleman. He immediately promoted Das after consulting his company commander, Major Sam Cates. The Ministry of Defence confirmed the last field promotion was believed to have happened during the Korean War in 1953.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
