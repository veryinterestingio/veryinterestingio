		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One big reason that pathologists are able to determine whether the person &quot;died on impact&quot; is the lungs. In a car crash, debris and smoke inhaled into the airways and lungs is a sign of breathing post impact.</p>
<p>However, in the end, it is a judgment call, based on the amount of trauma, scene photographs, positioning of the victim and angle of collision, conditions of internal organs, blood loss, etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Emergency Physician here:  The most common mechanisms of “instant” death are catastrophic brain injury or aortic tears/transection.  There is a single tethered point left over from fetal circulation called the “ligamentum arteriosum” that used to be a fetal blood vessel but is not part of extra-utero circulation. In sudden deceleration injuries (like crashing a car into a tree) all of the internal organs continue to move forward for milliseconds (and millimeters) but since the aorta is anchored at this part (right after the arch), this part is still but the parts above it and below it move, which creates sheering forces causing it to tear.  Every once in a while, these tears are contained but surrounding tissue, but most people will bleed to death into their thoracic cavity in seconds to minutes.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That phrase is used for compassion's sake. No one wants to hear or think about someone suffering, especially a loved one, when they die. There are some mechanisms of injury, such as severe head trauma which exposes brain tissue, which would lead to a very rapid death, but short of the brain literally exploding, there isn't &quot;instant&quot; death. In the decades I worked as an emergency room RN, I know that is just something we tell families to comfort them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
