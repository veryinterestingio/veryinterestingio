<p>The best surface to mix watercolors is a porcelain glaze. When mixing watercolor, you want a palette surface where the water will spread out and stay where it's wiped from the brush, not bead up. Essentially, if you wipe a wet brush on the mixing surface, the water should streak out as a solid ribbon of water and not bead up and break. </p>
<p>When testing porcelain tile at home depot, I found that all of the bath tile caused the water to bead up to some degree. But, when I use a basic dinner plate, the water spreads out evenly without beading.</p>
<p>I am wondering why a glazed surface like a dinner plate would work fine, but a bath tile would not?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're dealing with an extremely complicated set of physics: Wetting and contact angles.</p>
<p>There are no easy generalizations that can be made. <strong><em>Any blanket statements made about this  topic will ALWAYS have exceptions</em></strong>. There is <strong><em>only</em></strong> a set of equations that can be used to calculate the wettability of a specific material, with a specific fluid.</p>
<p>Every fluid will behave differently. Every surface will behave differently.</p>
<p>Glass CAN make water bead on its surface. It can also make it wet the surface. Porcelain CAN make water bead on its surface. It can also make it wet the surface. Even intuitively absorbent materials, like a sponge, or fabric, can make a fluid bead up. We've all had clothing that spills will bead on, until we move the slightest bit, and its absorbs. Conversely, intuitively &quot;slick&quot; surfaces like a car's paint, or a piece of polished metal, can be wetted. </p>
<p>This phenomenon is not a simple matter of surface tension, even though surface tension is one variable in the set of equations that govern it. There are many other factors: what is the composition of the <strong><em>air</em></strong> surrounding you? What is the chemical composition of the pigments you have dissolved in the water?</p>
<p>All you can do is test different materials, to find which ones work best for you. Trying to predict this is essentially impossible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The surface isn't reducing the surface tension of the water. What defines whether the water beads up, is a competition between the surface energy of the solid, the surface energy of the liquid and the interfacial energy between the solid and the liquid (as well as a few other things). Have a look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_angle" target="_blank">this wiki</a>.</p>
<p>However, it's not straightforward to predict if the water will bead up. Though you can simplify it slightly. Generally speaking, a solid with a lower surface energy will cause the water to bead up, as forming exposed solid surface isn't as costly compared to a surface with higher energy.</p>
<p>But surface roughness also plays a big role in defining how wetting a liquid is. The rougher the surface, generally, the more the liquid will bead up.</p>
<p>So to more directly answer your question: it looks like the dinner plates are made from smoother and lower surface energy materials than the porcelain. Though this is a massive simplification and a true analysis of this would also include a discussion of the interfacial energy between the liquid and the solid (as well as any effects due to dirt).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Porcelain is a term that isn't correctly used in a lot of cases. Most everyone uses it to describe a white clay body, but it is more specifically a clay body comprised of a large percentage of kaolin. It isn't necessarily the relevant term here. <a href="https://digitalfire.com/article/ceramic+tile+clay+body+formulation" target="_blank">Here's a bit about tiles and clay bodies, porcelain or otherwise.</a> </p>
<p>(Edit: I should mention that I am assuming you looked at glazed bath tiles, but it is possible that a bath tile could be unglazed. Then you have to worry more about the <a href="https://digitalfire.com/article/339" target="_blank">clay body's vitrification</a> and porosity, which absolutely has major, major impacts on water absorption.)</p>
<p>I imagine you are more interested in the properties of a glaze (in your case, ideally clear on top of a white clay, or the glaze itself is white). Glazes do in fact have a ton of variability both in surface texture and the way in which they fit to a clay body. <a href="https://digitalfire.com/article/high+gloss+glazes" target="_blank">This discusses high gloss glazes.</a> It doesn't quite hit your question, but it may illuminate how complicated a glaze surface can be. Digitalfire is a fantastic resource for learning about ceramics, and it may very well have your answer somewhere.</p>
<p>A ceramics materials engineer might have some insight here regarding the industry standards for a bath tile vs a plate. Since a plate is for food use and has certain safety standards, I actually wonder if bath tiles have some sort of hydrophobic coating applied after glazing. Still, <a href="https://digitalfire.com/article/attack+on+glass%3A+corrosion+attack+mechanisms" target="_blank">this article</a> makes me wonder if there is a preferred glaze formulation for tiles. They don't have to worry about leaching and such.</p>
<p>I'm very curious what more studied individuals have to say about this!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Appaulingly has a great explanation about defining surface tension. I'd like to just add the detail that bath tile could also contain or have a surface treatment that involves several different plastics or organic materials to help reduce the surface tension, such as PTFE coatings. We use teflon all the time since it has such a low surface energy. </p>
<p>If you'd like to read more on surface energy, <a href="https://industrialcommunity.3m.com/blog/surface-energy/" target="_blank">here is a neat blogpost from 3M on surface tension that I think is a good entry point.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
