		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Frame of reference is important here. While the aircraft itself is moving faster than the speed of sound in air, the inside of the cockpit has a speed of zero in reference to the aircraft. So while you may be moving faster than the speed of sound in air outside the aircraft, inside you are not. </p>
<p>Vibration from the engines does travel through the frame of the aircraft into the cockpit. But the roar of the aircraft tearing through the air overpowers any other sound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember watching a documentary about Concorde many years ago, and it noted that on passing Mach 1 the only signs inside the aircraft were a minor dip on a pressure gauge in the cockpit, and the electronic sign changing from “Mach 0.99” to “Mach 1.00” in the cabin. Occasionally there was also applause.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The air outside the aircraft is passing over it faster than the speed of sound, but <em>only</em> the air outside.</p>
<p>But air inside the aircraft cockpit is relatively stationary.  Any noise in the cockpit from the engine is being carried by the frame of the plane rather than the air outside so that won't really change.</p>
<p>The biggest change is that in the transonic region (Mach 0.8-1.2) flow is a bit mixed up so some areas are supersonic while others are subsonic resulting in a fair bit of noise that will drop off once everything is just forming a shockwave, but supersonic travel will still be much louder than subsonic travel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
