		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you own a big supermarket with many departments, meat, sea food, produce, paper goods, etc. Each department would be a 'division' of the company.  Everything gets sold at the same registers, and the stock crew fills up all the shelves regardless of what the product is.</p>
<p>Now you buy a deli across town.  You own it, and have someone else running it for you.  If someone buys a loaf of bread at the deli, they pay for it there, not at your supermarket.  The deli and the supermarket might have different insurance companies, sell different brands of soda, etc.</p>
<p>If you're the 'corporation' the deli and the supermarket are both subsidiaries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A subsidiary is a separate legal entity which happens to be owned by the company. Thus a subsidiary can make contracts in its own name, own various property, is registered with the authorities and pays taxes, can be sued and has legal responsibility etc. A division of a company doesn’t do anything like that. It’s just how the company wishes to organize its labor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Typically, a subsidiary is a <em>legally</em> separate company that is owned by a different company (either in whole or by a controlling amount).  The subsidiary will have its own corporate charter, file its own taxes, have its own ownership structure, etc.  The parent company just owns enough to have de facto control of its operations.</p>
<p>A division is typically part of the parent company.  They don't have the things above - they are legally part of the parent company.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>A division is a young child that still falls under the same household.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, division is an internal division within a company wheres subsidiary is a seperate company that is owned by the parent.</p>
<p>What others have not mentioned is that subsidiary can be owned in whole, or in part by the parent company.</p>
<p>So, for example ParentCo is a company that owns other companies.  SubCo is owned 100% by ParentCo, this is sometimes known as a wholly owned subsidiary.  But OtherSubCo is owned 50% by ParentCo and 50% by some other company.  ThirdSubCo is owned only 33.33% by ParentCo and 2 other companies each also own 33.33%.  All of these companies may or may not be considered subsidiaries, depends on lots of factors. </p>
<p>Something that becomes important is control.  Control is also not just defined as &gt;50% ownership.  Majority ownership IS control, that's for sure, but parent companies can have effective control over subsidiaries even though they don't own more than 50%.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
