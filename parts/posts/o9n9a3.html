		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several things that I notice that will clue me in to CGI:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lighting is off.  It looks mismatched with the scene, or it doesn't shift with perspective.</li>
<li>Edge blending is unrealistic.  Often the edges of the CGI are too fuzzy or too sharp.  They look the same when &quot;distant&quot; as when &quot;close&quot;.</li>
<li>Unrealistic physics.  Like when someone is shot into the distance at what would be 50g acceleration.  Or, when a Transformer grabs on to a bridge and shoots around in the other direction without destroying the structure or generating enormous exhaust from thrust.  Or when something large drops from orbit and doesn't create a crater or shockwave.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>movies employ many tricks to avoid you getting too close of a look at a &quot;fake&quot; thing.  especially fake human things (I mean... whos to say what a fake thanos should look like?  but we know what humans should look like, especially famous recognizable ones that were just in the last scene)</p>
<p>so they put on masks, and wear outfits that have easy to render textures and minimal &quot;loose&quot; fabrics that need to wrinkle.  They they shoot the scenes with lots of cuts and bright lights, and distractions, and the rare close ups they will put a real image into a fake scene and just the right shadows so you cant see the cutting line.</p>
<p>games on the other hand... have almost no control over how you see them.  the angles and lighting are completely uncontrolled, they can do very little to optimize them other than improving everything about them in all circumstances.  which is much more difficult.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modern CGI has gotten really good at replicating photorealism, especially with the use of ray tracing which has allowed movie makers to actually simulate how light actually works in the real world. Games do a really bad job of showing how human skin and light interact because it's actually really complex and games (until recently) couldn't use ray tracing. Movies don't have the same limitation so they can spend as much time and money as they want rendering their frames whereas games need to render dozens of frames per second. Basically at this point you really have to know what to look for to spot the CGI, even more so in action scenes where your brain is more focused on the action. Unless of course the studio just does a really bad job of drawing superman's mouth...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
