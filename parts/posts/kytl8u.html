		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is the something attempts like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Sign" target="_blank">International Sign</a> have tried to address. Unsuccessfully.</p>
<p>It turns out that getting all deaf people to use the same sign language is not much easier than to get everyone else one the planet to agree to speak Esperanto.</p>
<p>The problems with getting people to discard what is often their native language for some nebulous benefit of being able to communicate easier with some other people very far away is that people for the most part don't want to.</p>
<p>Language is culture and the deaf community in many places has been very protective of theirs. (Just look into the controversy about cochlear implants to get an idea of how passionate some people are about those issues.)</p>
<p>It doesn't help that sign languages aren't related along the same line as the spoken languages that exist alongside them. American Sign Language, is for example based on French sign Language and rather different from British Sign Language.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Same reason there are variants of spoken language.</p>
<p>Things like BSL (British sign language) and ASL (American Sign Language) evolved after the US had parted ways with the UK but before international telecommunications were invented, so evolved mostly separate. They each have their own, separate, hard fought, histories that I suspect many signers would be unwilling to give up.</p>
<p>As a note - BSL isn’t “British English in sign form”, similarly ASL isn’t American English in sign form either. </p>
<p>Sign languages often/always have a radically different language structure to spoken ones, including things like “spatial grammar” that doesn’t even really exist in spoken languages. In order to learn to read written English (in the case of people in English language countries) signers need to learn a completely new language - English - that is has almost nothing in common with their own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because people from different regions developed sign language individually. A person's culture also plays into it - for example, some hand gestures that are rude in one country are not rude in another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the case Black Americans Sign Language, segregation forced African Americans to make their own language (they couldn't attend deaf schools, which were only for the white until relatively recently). I doubt the BASL community is interested in giving up their rich heritage for an international language that might lack some of the nuance their native signing does.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
