		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your stool turns brown in the large intestine (colon). The brown color is NOT from bilirubin directly, but from a breakdown product of the bilirubin known as stercobilin.
Stercobilin is produced by bacteria in the gut once they have broken down bilirubin (which is broken down from the iron-containing part of your red blood cells that gets released when a red blood cell is destroyed, also known as heme). When red blood cells are injured, heme is released, and it gets absorbed by white blood cells (macrophages, basically these big dumb goons that float around eating whatever doesn't belong in the body) where it gets processed and then sent back into the blood to the liver. The liver will further process the Particle Formerly Known as Heme into bilirubin, which is then stored in bile and released into the duodenum (the part of your digestive system immediately after the stomach).
As the bilirubin progresses through the gut, it will be converted by bacteria into something called urobilinogen. Urobilinogen can be released in the blood or stay in the digestive system for excretion. The urobilinogen that remains in the gut will get eaten by bacteria in the colon; the waste product from these bacteria is stercobilin, and that's what gives poop its brown color.
Whether you have an iron deficiency or not doesn't affect the color of your stool very much, unless the bleeding is in your actual GI tract which can cause black or tarry stools (from the clotted blood).</p>
<p>TLDR: Colon </p>
<p>edit: Wikipedia is a surprisingly excellent resource for medical knowledge. Sometimes the explanations are difficult to understand without background knowledge, but usually they're pretty good</p>

<p>Double edit: Thank you so much for my first-ever Reddit gold! I always knew it'd be for talking about poop. And the follow-up questions are awesome too, thanks guys</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The color in poop comes from the breakdown of red blood cells. Red blood cells contains iron binding proteins and the color comes from the degradation. </p>
<p>“The non-iron portion of heme is degraded into the waste product biliverdin, a green pigment, and then into another waste product, bilirubin, a yellow pigment. Bilirubin binds to albumin and travels in the blood to the liver, which uses it in the manufacture of bile, a compound released into the intestines to help emulsify dietary fats. In the large intestine, bacteria breaks the bilirubin apart from the bile and converts it to urobilinogen and then into stercobilin. It is then eliminated from the body in the feces. Broad-spectrum antibiotics typically eliminate these bacteria as well and may alter the color of feces. The kidneys also remove any circulating bilirubin and other related metabolic byproducts such as urobilins and secrete them into the urine.”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The answers are mainly right</p>
<p>The brown colour of poop comes from a compound called <strong>stercobilin</strong> which is a metabolic product from the breakdown of the haem part of haemoglobin. It’s a waste product that is excreted in your faeces. Check out the enterohepatic circulation of bile </p>
<p>Haem is broken down to <strong>biliverdin</strong> which is then further metabolised to <strong>bilirubin</strong>. </p>
<p>The bilirubin is transported to the liver, glucuronidated and then excreted into bile. The conjugated bilirubin is then converted in the gut back to bilirubin, which is then further converted into <strong>urobilinogen</strong>. Some of this is reabsorbed and excreted in the urine, but some remains in the gut and is converted further to stercobilinogen and stercobilin. Stercobilin makes poo brown.</p>
<p>Haem -red</p>
<p>Bilirubin - green/yellow </p>
<p>Urobilinogen - colourless</p>
<p>Stercobilin - brown </p>
<p>Urobilin - yellow </p>
<p>Edit: fixed urobilingen</p>
<p>Edit 2: clarified colours </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
