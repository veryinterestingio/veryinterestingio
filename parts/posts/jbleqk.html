		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Reddit, I'm Col. Terry Virts. I'm a former astronaut who commanded the International Space Station from 2014-2015. I also spent two weeks piloting the Space Shuttle Endeavour in 2010. During my time in space, I took more than 300,000 photos of earth, conducted hundreds of experiments, did everything from shooting an IMAX movie to replacing a crew mate's tooth filling! I also went on three spacewalks. I'm now a professional speaker, photographer, director, and author. My directorial debut documentary, <em>One More Orbit</em>, was released on VOD on Oct. 6 and my new book, <em>How to Astronaut: An Insider's Guide to Leaving Planet Earth</em> released on Sep. 15! From fighter jets to unwieldly space suits, space station cuisine, and an uncensored look at answering the call of nature in zero-g, <strong><em>HOW TO ASTRONAUT: An Insider's Guide To Leaving Planet Earth</em></strong> is a wildly entertaining collection of short essays that offers a primer for future space tourists with a sneak peek behind the curtain at the rules, lessons, procedures, and experiences of space travel.</p>
<p>I will start at 2pm Eastern (18 UT), ask me anything!</p>

<ol>
<li>What do you do in your free time on the ISS?</li>
<li>What responsibilities does a commander of the ISS have compared to the other astronauts?</li>
<li>What is it like to go outside on a spacewalk? Is it terrifying or are you just focused on the task at hand?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a few questions :
1) Does the Captain of ISS lead all the teams aboard regardless of their nationality? If not how often do you interact?
2) Do astronauts often get existential thoughts when looking at the earth from a distance? Or are they the pros?
3) Have two ppl who are dating ever sent to the ISS ? Or has someone started dating once they were aboard?
Cheers !!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
