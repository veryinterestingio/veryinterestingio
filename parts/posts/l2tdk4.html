		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that combustion cars have brakes that turn the car's kinetic energy into heat energy, and electric cars have both these conventional brakes and can also do regenerative braking that turns some of the car's kinetic energy into electricity instead of heat. The reason they have both is that regenerative brakes can't apply nearly as much braking force as normal brakes. My question is, would it be possible for regenerative braking to be engineered to be capable of stopping a car just as quickly/effectively as conventional friction brakes can?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many locomotives have a system called dynamic braking. Where the DC motors are turned into generators and that power gets directed to resistor banks to brake the locomotive. The system works great at high speeds. However as the locomotive slows down less power is sent to the resistors and they start becoming less and less effective. At that point the conventional brakes are needed</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Realistically, no. The maximum amount of regen varies by speed and is limited by the power rating of the motor-generator and by the maximum charge rate of the battery. You'll actually see that more powerful EVs are much better at regenerative braking because they can handle more power at a time. My Tesla stops in half the distance using pure regen braking compared to my Volt, even though it's like 1.25x heavier. It's got a much bigger battery and beefier MGs that can actually regenerate &gt; 100 kW whereas the Volt tops out at 50ish kW regen. This tapers off at lower speeds though, you don't have nearly as much regen capability at low speeds. Slowing down from 70 to 60 is much easier than from 10 to 0.</p>
<p>This also varies by state of charge and battery temperature. Cold batteries can't charge as fast, and a battery at a high state of charge can't either. So even if you had a ridiculously powerful motor-generator that could brake at hundreds of kilowatts, you would have to add a big resistor bank to dissipate the energy if the battery couldn't keep up. And that doesn't solve the speed issue, you'd need a multi-speed gearbox to allow the motor-generator to spin faster at low speeds if you want to be able to generate as much power. </p>
<p>One interesting thing that is happening though is switching to drum brakes on newer EVs. Even though it's an old tech and has inferior braking performance, it's much lower maintenance and also captures any particulates better (brake dust from brake pads wearing down is a significant source of particulate emissions that reduce air quality)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, for a ton of reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The car isn't always on.   When the car is parked, like on a hill, it needs not to roll away.  You need physical brakes to do this.  The brake <em>could</em> be in the transmission rather than the wheels, but its gonna be a friction plate, or lockout.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cars are required to be safe even when things go wrong.  If the motor fails, and they do, you still need to be able to bring the car to a stop.  Physical brakes are nice because you can have a pure mechanical linkage where even if everything electronic fails, they still work.</p>
</li>
<li>Regenerative braking get worse as the car gets slower.  Using the motor as a generator provides less and less torque as the motor spins slower.  This is unlike mechanical brakes where you have a constant torque.  You can get around this by actively applying reverse torque, but at that point you are losing energy, not regenerating.</li>
</ol>
<p>All this being said, brakes on an electric car are secondary.  Only used at low or no speed. This means that friction brakes can last an order of magnitude longer than they would in a gas car.  However they are not going away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's technically possible, but a bad idea for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Braking power is dependent on relative motion of the wheel/drive shaft to the brake. As the vehicle slows down, the braking power is reduced, and at a standstill the vehicle must expend at least some energy to keep itself from moving.</li>
<li>Friction brakes can only be disabled through damage to the pump, cylinder, lines, pads, or wheels. Regenerative braking can fail due to a malfunction of the computer, power system, stator coils, capacitors, or any number of other electronic components in addition to failures of the wheels; notably most electronic failures would also disable the vehicle's drive and steering, rendering the vehicle instantly and completely uncontrollable.</li>
<li>Parking brakes would still need to be friction-based, since regenerative brakes are unlikely to continue working for days or weeks after the vehicle has been powered down.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing I would like to add is that regenerative braking (or kind of the opposite, eddy current braking) can act as the perfect ABS system. The faster the wheels spin the higher the braking force. If the wheels don’t spin there’s no braking force. So even if you’re driving in ice, you’ll be able to apply the maximum braking force that the motors/tires could apply. That being said, there’s no way to come to a full stop with just regenerative braking. You would have to have some kind of friction brake. Trains and roller coasters use eddy current braking so they’ll slow down even if the track is wet.  It’s just a piece of aluminum on the car that passes through stationary electromagnets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
