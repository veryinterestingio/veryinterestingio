		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming you mean geostationary orbit around the moons themselves, not the gas giants:</p>
<p>All the large moons in the solar system are tidally locked to the planet they orbit.  That means their rotational period is the same as their orbital period.  In this case, it is only possible for a satellite to stay stationary with respect to the moon's surface if it is located at one of the Lagrange points of that moon.  </p>
<p>For any of these moons, a space elevator could be built from the moon's surface and passing through the moon-planet L1 or L2 point.  This would be much easier to build than a space elevator around Earth for example, because of the lower forces involved, although it would be longer in terms of distance.  In fact, there are semi-serious proposals to build a space elevator from the Earth's Moon to the Earth-Moon L1 point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I don't think you can have a gas giant tidally locked to its moon, so with gas giants that can only happen as a result of an unlikely accident.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nope, the ones you’re interested in are much too big and too far away from their host planets to be geostationary from the surface of the host planet. There may be natural satellites in a natural geosync orbit around gas giants (statistically it has to have happened somewhere at sometime) but we’ve not discovered them in our solar system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. Gas giants rotate very quickly; a “day” on Jupiter, Saturn, etc is about 10 hours.</p>
<p>Jupiter’s largest Galilean moon, Io, has an orbital period of just over 42 hours.</p>
<p>Saturn’s innermost spherical moon, Mimas, has an orbital period of just under 24 hours.</p>
<p>Jupiter’s innermost moon, Amalthea, orbits the planet in just over 11 hours, or slightly slower than a Jovian day. Amalthea isn’t spherical nor particularly large; it’s basically an asteroidal object.</p>
<p>The issue is that there’s a minimum size/mass an object has to be in order to become spherical, but there’s also a minimum distance that object has to be from its parent planet so that it doesn’t get ripped apart by tidal forces. Jupiter and Saturn are both enormous, so this minimum distance is quite large, and well outside the radius of a perfectly geostationary orbit.</p>
<p>Smaller objects don’t have the same issue. It’s even possible for a moon to orbit <em>below</em> geostationary orbit; Phobos orbits Mars once every 7 hours, or more than 3 times per Martian day.</p>
<p>Basically, you <em>could</em> have a very small asteroid or comet-style object in a stationary orbit over a point on a gas giant’s surface, but it would be purely coincidental rather than being caused by tidal interactions. The definition of “surface” when it comes to gas giants is rather hazy as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No moons (edit: of gas giants) are known to be in geostationary orbits at present, but for the sake of a story you could engineer a way to drag a small moon or asteroid into a geostationary orbit.</p>
<p>Just bear in mind that all the gas giants rotate really, really fast (under 20 hours each), which means you are limited to something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metis_(moon)" target="_blank">Metis</a>.</p>
<p>Also, check out Red Mars by Kim Stanley Robinson, he moves the moons of Mars to build this sort of space elevator, though in that book they didn't last long.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
