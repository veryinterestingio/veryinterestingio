Shouldn't they be named Tenthy-five, as an example. It's also partially true in other languages, such as French, why do we do this?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically the more commonly a number is used the more  likely it is that they get their own special name. And until fairly recently people just generally didn't need to be able to count super high. Or if you did need to you would just use multiples of smaller units. Like say 5 dozen instead of sixty, and tack on whatever was left over as an extra number. And language was in use for a long time before people started caring about large numbers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People here know a lot more about language than I did when I was five. My understanding is that it comes from counting in scores. One through twenty are unique because we used to count this way, in sets of twenty. For example, eighty-five is four score and five.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
