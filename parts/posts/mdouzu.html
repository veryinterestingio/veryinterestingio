We're Yuan Jiang, Dave Heldebrant, and Casie Davidson from the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and we're here to talk about carbon capture. Under DOE's Carbon Capture Program, researchers are working to both advance today's carbon capture technologies and uncover ways to reduce cost and energy requirements. We're happy to discuss capture goals, challenges, and concepts. Technologies range from aqueous amines - the water-rich solvents that run through modern, commercially available capture units - to energy-efficient membranes that filter CO2 from flue gas emitted by power plants. Our newest solvent, <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/news-media/cheaper-carbon-capture-way" target="_blank">EEMPA</a>, can accomplish the task for as little as <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/03/new-generation-carbon-dioxide-traps-could-make-carbon-capture-practical-bringing" target="_blank">$47.10 per metric ton</a> - bringing post-combustion capture within reach of 45Q tax incentives.</p>
<p>We'll be on at 11am pacific (2 PM ET, 16 UT), ask us anything!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi and thanks for joining us today!</p>
<p>So it's been a couple years since I've heard anything but carbon neutral fuel production via algae is basically a dead end these days, no?</p>
<p>Is EEMPA being considered for use in submarine CO2 scrubbing? Does it smell as bad as MEA?</p>
<p>Is it better to capture CO2 near the production source (e.g. city centers, factories) or can we build vast capture plants where land is cheaper and more available? I'm thinking of massive geothermal facilities in say Iceland capturing CO2 for the whole planet</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm currently a mechanical engineer who's intensely interested in carbon capture technology and is wondering the best way to get into this field. I've been considering getting a PhD, but I'm not sure what good programs are out there. I've seen that ASU has a center for negative carbon emissions.</p>
<p>Anyways, I just really want to help make a positive impact on our world and am looking for advice on how to accomplish this. </p>
<p>Thank you!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
