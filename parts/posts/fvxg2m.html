		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Often when you oversleep, you are waking up in the middle of a sleep cycle which causes a phenomenon known as &quot; sleep inertia&quot;</p>
<p>When you wake up naturally at the end of a sleep cycle your mind is ready to go, when you experience sleep inertia you are waking up in the middle of a sleep cycle and your brain is actually prepared for more sleep and not being awake and it takes significantly longer for your brain to come around</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I ha e read that when people are chronically underslept that your mind goes into a type of ‘survival mode’ where everything is kind of failing but you don’t feel as tired. When you sleep more heavily, your brain relaxes some of that ‘survival mode’ and it starts to hit you how tired you are. You can’t catch up on sleep quickly to repair damage, it takes several days of consistent sleep to really get into recovery, so that could explain it</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes it could be that you're mistaking the cause for the effect.  When I get sick or have bad allergies, I tend to be very tired.  So I sleep a lot, but I'm still very tired.  But it isn't because I slept too much, it's because I'm sick.  So you think you're tired because you slept too much, but really, both sleeping too much and still being tired are the result of an illness.</p>
<p>I'm not claiming it is the only reason, just a possible one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because as you get adequate sleep, your body is more aware of your deprivation. When you’re deprived, your body adjusts to working with less sleep, so you feel “less tired” vs sleeping well, when really your body and mind are working at a lower gear. </p>
<p>Source: “Why Do We Sleep” book recommended by Bill Gates, it showcases groundbreaking sleep research from the last ~40 years. Read it and your life will change. Amazing book. Not the most fun to read, though</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

If you oversleep, you either have a pre-existing condition that causes you to do so or you simply do it with no reason and it turns out to harm your health:</p>
