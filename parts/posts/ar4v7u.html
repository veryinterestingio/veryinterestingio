		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People will drink particular drinks based on their mood. A guy who usually drinks beer might switch to whisky when he's drinking out of anger, for example.
&quot;Whisky makes me aggressive.&quot; - no, mate. The Whisky simply exacerbated your underlying aggression.  </p>
<p>Drinks get you drunk. There isn't a type of drunk linked to a type of drink, there's only a type of drunk based on the mood you're in while you're drinking.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As said by others, no scientific evidence as of yet. But I wonder if different states of mind drive people to certain drinks.</p>
<p>For example, I'd wager people going into a bar to do tequila shots probably already have their minds set on causing trouble. Blaming the alcohol seems to be a convenient excuse to me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ethanol is the same regardless of the drink. The other things in the drink are more important. Sugars, tannins, sulfide, starch, grains, etc. are in the particular alcohol. Then add in mixers, juices, limes, lemons, mint, etc. and things get all messed up.  </p>
<p>Those who drink wine generally drink it slower with food. Beer drinkers (IPAs, etc) get fuller faster. Hard liquor shots needs less liquid to equal the same %ABV as mixed drinks and you are more likely to drink more faster, leading to a faster titration (drunk) rate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
