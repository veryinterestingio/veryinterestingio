		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. Every protein has a “thermodynamic landscape” that determines what shapes it can be in what environment. Not all proteins can become prions. </p>
<p>Now could all proteins lose their shape? Yes, but that would mean that life would cease to exist: to lose all protein structure you’d have to either heat up the earth ridiculously and vaporize the water. Or you’d have to add so many chemicals to water as to make it toxic. The proteins would fall out of solution and be solid then.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question, do we understand what about the structure of the misfolded Scrappy protein (the most likley prion to occur in humans if I understand correctly) causes other Scrappy proteins to also become misfolded? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I understand that both the correctly folded and &quot;misfolded&quot; structures are similarly energetically stable which is why this misfolding can occur spontaneously, but is it understood how the misfolded structure precipitates further misfolding of other scrappy proteins?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you have a knot. Now imagine that there is a second type of knot where, if a loop from that knot hooks onto part of your knot, it will pull on it in exactly the right way to cause your knot to turn into the second knot.</p>
<p>Obviously, this only works with knots that are tied the way your knot is tied, not with any possible knot in the world. </p>
<p>Similarly, proteins fold into different configurations, and those configurations are what allow the proteins to do what they are needed to do in the body. A prion disease is caused by a protein that is folded in such a way that it causes some protein in the body to refold into a configuration that mimics the prion configuration. Now not only is that protein no longer capable of doing what it is supposed to be doing, but it is in a shape that will encourage more of the same protein to take on that non-functional state.</p>
<p>There is no single prion that could cause all possible proteins in existence to refold into a copy of that prion. You need to start with the right protein for it to work on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others here have covered the question sufficiently to explain why prions don't literally make a person melt into grey goo, but I think it's worth mentioning what a prion actually <em>is</em>, because there are a lot of common misconceptions. </p>
<p>A prion is, broadly, a misfolded protein that has the ability to misfold other proteins, which you've got correct in your post. However, they only misfold other proteins of the same type. There is a specific protein known as PrP, the Prion Protein, which was thought to be the only protein that behaves as a prion in mammals. This is why diseases like scrapie, mad cow, and CJD can all be transferred between their various hosts — its all the same protein. That being said, it's now thought that there is another mammalian prion protein, a type of alpha-synuclein that might be the cause of multiple system atrophy. I don't think this was proven though, but I could be incorrect about that. I'm not exactly on the cutting edge of prion research myself (nor do I want to be, that shit is terrifying).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
