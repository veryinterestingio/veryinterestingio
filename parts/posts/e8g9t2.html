<p>The individual molecules of water in SCW are still polar. However, in bulk, SCW behaves as if it is non-polar. This is likely (not 100% certain) because with the increased kinetic energy of the molecules, the effect of hydrogen bonding is weakened. Furthermore, the molecules may conglomerate in ways that cancel out the individual molecules' dipoles.  Ultimately though, there is still more research needed on this topic. </p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who answered and commented. I really appreciate it. Happy Holidays!</p></div></div>

<p>I'm guessing you or somebody who told you got the idea from the fact that you can use the supercritical state of water to dry things without the capillary pressure destroying their fine structure. The water doesn't become non-polar, but it does stop sticking to itself in the same way it usually does when it's a liquid. As you decrease the pressure it becomes less dense and more like a gas until finally it is gas. This process is used for making <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerogel" target="_blank">aerogel</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gaseous molecules are capable of fewer hydrogen bonds, which is the thing that separates liquid water from vapor in the first place. There are 3.4-3.6 hydrogen bonds per atom (i think its per atom. it may be per something else) in liquid water, 4 (maximum) in solid water, and presumably a statistical average nearer to zero in gaseous water. Supercritical fluid provides enough kinetic energy to disallow the formation of hydrogen bonds, and enough pressure to keep the molecules close together. Thus the entropic effect (the formation of the clathrate cage, or however you spell it) that keeps nonpolar substances from dissolving in water is negated.</p>
<p>This is my thought. Chemist.</p>
<p>Edit: Per molecule... obviously. I'm not drunk. You're drunk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
