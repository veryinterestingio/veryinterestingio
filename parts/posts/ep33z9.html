		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>VHS isn't film. There is no picture on a strip of VHS. It's a magnetic tape that gets read and converted into a signal to create audio and video data.</p>
<p>The pattern of the magnetic particles in the tape can be changed, the Record option uses magnets to change the pattern of the magnetic stuff.</p>
<p>Tapes with copy protection actually just use a little tab that interacts with a switch (if the tab is present you can record, no tab is safe) but this doesn't change the <em>tape</em>, it just changes whether the VCR is allowed to engage the record head or not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think there's really any ELI5 way to explain how the actual signal that gets recorded onto the tape gets made, as analogue color video signals are crazy complicated.  However, the way the signal gets onto the tape is pretty intuitive.  </p>
<p>The tape itself is made of what is essentially plastic with a bunch of tiny magnets embedded into it.  When the tape is recorded, each of these tiny magnets is magnetized to a varying degree, and this changing magnetic field can be read as a varying electric current when the tape is pulled past a playback head.  One important thing to note is that there is a lower limit to the size of an area you can magnetize on the tape, which is limited by the size of the magnetic particles, as well as the recording head.  This means that in order to record more information, you need to move your heads past the tape faster, so that they cover more area in the same amount of time.</p>
<p>Inside the recorder, there is a drum mounted at an angle.  This drum spins rapidly, as the tape is dragged around it.  The drum has at least 2 heads on it, on opposite sides.  This means that each head essentially draws a diagonal stripe on the tape, each picking up where the other left off.  The reason for the spinning drum is that it allows you to have a very fast relative speed between the head and the tape without having to move the tape very quickly.  This allows the same amount of video to be recorded on much, much less tape.  Early attempts to record video on tape failed largely because they just needed too much damn tape.</p>
<p>If the tape already has a signal on it, (or actually, whenever you're recording), the tape passes by a demagnetizer before being recorded.  There are a few different ways to demagnetize something, but pretty much all tape recorders rely on an electromagnet that changes polarity very rapidly.  This randomizes the magnetic fields on the tape, wiping out any trace of the old video signal that could interfere with the new one.</p>
<p>Note that some VHS machines have more sophisticated drums with 6 or more heads.  These do almost nothing for regular playback and recording, but they enable better fast-forward and slow-motion playback.  The reason they're necessary is because the tape's motion slightly changes the angle of the stripes the heads draw.  If you try to speed up or slow down the tape, the stripes will no longer align all the way across, which is why many players have static over half or more of the screen when fast-forwarding.  Multi-head machines switch to a head that is better aligned when one starts to come out of alignment, leading to more, smaller static bands. (Or, on really well-engineered machines, almost no distortion at all.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A VHS tape is literally like an Etch-a-sketch. It records information using magnets. When you erase or record over a part of a tape you're just shaking all the magnetic bits so they don't resemble what they used to anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
