<p>1) They don't always survive. Ships are lost every year to heavy seas. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_ship" target="_blank">And sometimes it turns out that a particular design or model of ship is particularly vulnerable.</a></p>
<p>2) There are centuries of shipbuilding and sailing experience that inform ship design. Combined with modern design tools and materials, and ships can be designed to withstand huge loads from waves (like dynamic loads of up to 50+ atmospheres in severe conditions). <a href="http://shipstructure.org/pdf/2007symp09.pdf" target="_blank">You can read more about how ship design in this paper.</a> Unfortunately, there aren't global standards for ships and, as I mentioned, ships do in fact break up all the time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are other answers here explaining how they don't always survive, but none giving you the actual reason why boats CAN handle this treatment and survive.</p>
<p>The answer to this is weight displacement and distribution and is basically the same reason the boat floats in the first place. Namely the boat displaces as much water equal to its weight. When the boat is getting tossed around, it is still displacing as much as it weighs, so it's not going to sink. Add to this that boat designers design the boat so its balanced to always return to an upright position. When a boat gets tossed upwards and strikes the sea on the way back down, the impact force is evenly spread across the area that impacts the water, and as its displacing its own weight, its no big deal. Imagine throwing a rubber duck into your bath and see how it &quot;bounces&quot; off the water. Basically the same effect.</p>
<p>Likewise, when huge waves wash over the boat and spill all over the decks, the water isn't actually doing anything other than washing over it and off. The boat is sealed and unless the water gets inside and starts to lower the boats attitude in the water, its not gonna do much. Imagine trying to sink a rubber duck bath toy by pouring water over it. You will never do it. Cut a hole in the top and pour the water inside the duck though and eventually it will sink. And while thousands and thousands of gallons of sea water might weigh a huge amount to me and you, comparitively to the ship, it's nothing.</p>
<p>So basically, enclosed boat is full of air and displaces the water it sits on. Without being able to overcome that, waves can't sink the boat. Waves don't break the boat apart because the energy of the water is quite spead out across the ship.</p>
<p>Having said that, as others pointed out sometimes boats do go down due to severe waves and stormy seas. However this tends to be because the boat is either capsized (Rolled over and unable to right itself), or other mechanical defects that allows water to breach the boat and get inside it, thus making it heavier and heavier till it takes on too much water. In fact in most modern ships, this is 99% the cause of ships going down in rough weather, and it's now rare when mechanical reasons aren't counted. A mechanically intact and correctly run ship can take on some truly horrendous seas just fine.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMNhO8dKJjQ" target="_blank">Here's a famous example</a> of a ship being broken up by heavy (Actually not considered all that bad by most maritimers) seas. The cause? Poor maintenance and an even poorer inspection programme for the ship.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't always survive. Plenty of ships are lost at sea, although much less so in recent times. Modern ships, while massive, are also very well designed. And while the fluid dynamics at sea can be wild, they're also decently well-understood, so ships can be designed to be strong enough not to collapse/snap in heavy seas.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn't absolute, and ships can still sink from rough weather, poor nautical skills, bad luck, or any combination. But a modern vessel, properly crewed and maintained, and with a good captain who has good information (weather forecasts) will stand a very good chance of making it out of any given voyage safe and sound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These ships survive because of their design and different systems on the ship that can work together to keep the ship stabilized.</p>
<p>The most common system onboard to stabilize the ships are their ballast tanks. These tanks generally hold seawater to create weight.
Because of this weight, the ship has a lower point of gravity thus giving it more stability.</p>
<p>Imagine a Formula 1 car. It is designed for high speed. One of the reasons it can go that fast is because it is build as low to the ground as possible. Because the F1 car is lower to the ground, it has a lot more stability to handle these high speeds. The stability comes from a lower point of gravity.</p>
<p>The placement and dimensions of these tanks are calculated before the ship is build. They come in many different shapes and sizes but generally have a squarish or rectangular shape.</p>
<p>The seawater is pumped into, or out of, the tank via pumps. These pumps are either operated by crew onboard (most common) with the use of Alarm and control systems, or by manual control on a switchboard. Depending on the design of the piping system that is installed they generally come with one or two valves on smaller ships but can have more depending on the use case of the ship and the tank.</p>
<p>The amount of seawater in the tank is managed by trained crew on board with the piping system. There is more to it than just filling the tanks. You have to take into account your current cargo on the ship as well as different types of liquids in different tanks located throughout the ship. For example: The more weight on the left side of the ship facing forward means you will have a bias towards the portside of the ship. The more weight on the right side facing forwards means you will have a bias towards the starboard side of the ship.</p>
<p>Other than the ballast system there will be electrical systems that will help stabilizing the ship. These systems can help with planning the route of the ship so they don’t catch bad weather or heavy winds. They can also take over steering to stabilize the ship. The captain will be in charge of this and will judge whether or not it’s safe to go through storms and what route to take. </p>
<p>All of the systems are driven by an onboard power plant which will generate power for the ship. If these power plants fail then the aforementioned systems don’t work. </p>
<p>The captain also has to go to manual steering when there’s no power. You can imagine on a large ship that the rudders will be driven by large electrical motors. In the case these don’t have power, you won’t be able to rotate the rudder. With all of these systems having failed, the chance of capsizing or splitting will increase tremendously. </p>
<p>Of course there is backup power after the power plant fails. This is only for a certain amount of time. The minimum amount of time you’ll have is based on regulation for different components on your ship.
I am a project engineer for a company that is specialized in Alarm and Control systems on different sized ships. For us the general minimum norm is 30 minutes after the power plant fails. This can differ for electrical motors on a rudder or pumps on a ship.</p>
