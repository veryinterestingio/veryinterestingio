		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I live in New Zealand where the coronavirus is nearly eliminated because of the lockdown. However we are being advised to get flu shots. How is it that the lockdown eliminated covid but not all the other cold/flu viruses (which have a lower R naught value)? Where are the viruses being introduced from if no one is entering the country without going into two week quarantine?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Animal transmission and long-term surface transmission do occur, also some people manage to not beat an illness in the average time and stay a carrier longer than average, but the easiest example is also the simplest.  Even under lockdown some portion of the population is still required to do work and move around among others and some of them get infected.  On top of that long distance travel is likely to resume eventually, probably within your normal flu season, and there are many areas where the lockdown didn't align with others that will still have passed on and picked up new strains.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's likely that flu season has been <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/8/20-1229_article" target="_blank">much more mild</a> this year because people are in quarantine.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, the pediatric emergency department people tell me that this time of year is peak for children coming in with a virus called RSV, a common childhood &quot;cold&quot; that can be quite serious or even deadly. They see nearly none of that, and instead see traumas from kids who are stir crazy and breaking their legs jumping off couches. I doubt parents are sitting at home when their child is gasping for air from RSV.</p>
<p>People aren't completely isolated. They are interacting at places like grocery stores. Also keep in mind that the &quot;cold&quot; isn't one virus. It's many different viruses that cause similar symptoms (coronavirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza, etc). After recovering, many people will still be contagious for weeks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just got my flu shots a couple of weeks ago. Talking to the doctor about whats been happening over isolation. She said it should be peak flu season at the moment, in Australia, and they are almost seeing no cases. So it does seem to be slowing infection. As an aside there has been a push in Australia, in the last couple of weeks to get on top of a head lice problem before the kids go back to school. A once in a generation opportunity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This doesn’t address your question directly, but it’s still relevant. The reason why health authorities are encouraging people to get the flu shot is to relieve stress and burden on the healthcare system which is ordinarily attributed to flu amongst the population. It’s true that with everyone in isolation, and exercising physical distancing, the incidence of flu will be lower than normal, however there will still be community transmission. Attempting to suppress this transmission leaves more space allocated to deal with COVID-19 related issues. Also, COVID-19 and flu are each individually sever. The combination and possibility of contracting both at the same time has the potential to be even more fatal, thus if you can mitigate the risk of one (i.e. the flu, through flu shots) it’s a good idea to do so.
Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another difference no-one has mentioned is that when the NZ lockdown started, only a small number of people had Covid-19. But flu viruses was circulating through the whole population, like usual.</p>
<p>Under the sort of lockdown NZ and most other countries have had, the R0 is reduced to significantly below 1, but not to 0 or even close. Which means the number of active cases will be going gradually down, but there’s still transmission and new cases happening — eg among essential workers that are still active.</p>
<p>For Covid-19, starting at a small number and with extensive contact tracing so that the last few cases could be found and strictly isolated, it didn’t take long to bring the number down to zero. But for the flu, starting at a significant proportion of the population, the number going gradually down wouldn’t have brought it close to the level yet where contact tracing could finish the job.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
