		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><h3><del>Redacted</del> <em>Abridged</em> version, hopefully more fitting for this sub:</h3>
<p>Surgeons stitch most large blood vessels back together by hand. </p>
<p>Many of your smaller blood vessels are not really needed to keep your organs alive, and there are <em>a lot</em> of them. So surgeons just staple or cauterize (burn) most of them to stop any bleeds and don't further bother with stitching all of them. It would just take too much time.</p>
<p>It helps that very small blood vessels can regrow on their own when and where they're needed.</p>
<hr />
<p>Nerves are more tricky. They're often too small to stitch together properly, and don't heal well even if put back together.  </p>
<p>So transplant surgeons just ignore them altogether. </p>
<p>They can do that because luckily most of our organs don't really <em>need</em> any nerve connections to do their basic job. </p>
<p>A heart without nerve connections will have trouble speeding up/slowing down on demand, but it will still beat. A lung without nerve connections will have trouble coughing, but it will still breathe. And both kidneys and livers work just fine without nerve connections telling them what to do. </p>
<h3>Original, but not really 5-year-old-friendly version:</h3>
<p>Most larger vessels are manually sutured together by the transplant surgeon(s). </p>
<p>Smaller/less important ones are often simply clamped shut with surgical clips or cauterized to prevent bleeding, since these are often not immediately necessary for oxygenation of the graft and and manually suturing them would just prolong an already long procedure.</p>
<p>After a successful transplant there'll often be some re-vascularization(?) going on. At a certain level blood vessels will grow &quot;on demand&quot; wherever there's a lack of vasculature, either by existing vessels growing out and connecting with each other, smaller vessels growing in diameter or even entirely new vessels forming. But as far as I know this is something that only occurs on a very small scale,  so any major vessels that aren't re-attached by hand will remain separated. </p>
<p>As for nerves, for most organ transplants these are just ignored. Surgeons obviously try to damage as little nerve fibres as possible, but whatever gets cut just remains cut. </p>
<p>They do try to suture major nerve bundles when doing limb transplants, but that's still kind of experimental stuff. And just as with the blood vessels they only bother with some of the major bundles there and hope for the rest to sort itself out over time as far as I know. With current techniques surgeons can't really suture individual nerves anyways. </p>
<p>Surprisingly enough none of those organs doctors routinely transplant today really <em>require</em> innervation. Kidneys, livers, lungs, even hearts all do just fine without any direct connection to your nervous system.</p>
<p>In the case of the heart it'll mean that changes in heart rate will come with some delay since the brain has to rely on hormones in the blood stream to communicate with the donor heart.</p>
<p>In the case of the lungs your cough reflex may be reduced or impaired, although most coughing is triggered in your trachea I believe, which isn't transplanted anyways.</p>
<p>Both the heart and lungs can regain innervation over time, as cut nerve fibres slowly grow back over. Doesn't happen for everyone, but for at least some patients.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For a more dumbed down version, the human body is insanely powerful at adapting. If town nerves are close to each other they can learn to communicate. Furthermore, it will learn what signals need to go to the new organ from the brain. If they're are no capillaries connecting a host to the new organ they will grow to connect to it. The important factor is that bodies can grow and adapt to fit most cases. Surgery is usually trying to move the big things around so that they are in a position to fix them selves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simple answer:</p>
<p>Nerves and lymphatic (immune) vessels are not reconnected.</p>
<p>Big arteries and veins are sutures together (anastamosis).</p>
<p>The organs function fine like this. Note, that if given a blood supply, a heart will beat on its own, even in a box.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Wait. Is this ELI5? Oh, I'm sorry little guy. I misspoke. The implanted organ is just like a plant you move from a pot (carcass or relative) and put into the ground (the donor recipient). At first the plant is shocked by the new environment but if we're lucky and we plan it out just right, it will like its new soil, then its roots will take hold and it will grow big and strong</p>
<p>Or you get sepsis and die because somebody messed up and dropped a junior mint in you during the operation </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This has to do with supporting the theory that cellular memories remain with organs and affect the behaviours of those who have organs transplanted into their system from others.</p>
