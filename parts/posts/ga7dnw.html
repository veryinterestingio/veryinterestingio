<p>Hi Reddit! I'm Keith Schneider, a professor in the Food Science and Human Nutrition Department in the Institute for Food and Agricultural Sciences at the University of Florida. With concerns raised over the spread of COVID-19, consumers are worried about how to handling their grocery store purchases. Right now, <a href="https://ifas.ufl.edu/covid19-information-updates/" target="_blank">UF / IFAS</a> is working to educate consumers and growers alike on the facts that are tied to taking care of produce during a global pandemic.</p>
<p><a href="http://explore.research.ufl.edu/covid-19-response-your-grocery-and-food-safety-questions-answered.html" target="_blank">Proof!</a></p>
<p>More about me:</p>
<p>I received my PhD in Food Science and Human Nutrition, from the University of Florida, my Masters in Public Health from the University of South Florida and a Bachelors in Biology from the University of Florida. I have been working with Extension offices in Florida to help educate growers for over 20 years. Since 2005, I have reviewed various journals on produce safety, food science, microbiology,
