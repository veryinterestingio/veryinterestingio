		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine the electrons as a bunch of marbles (or ball-bearings) in a tube all touching each other.</p>
<p>You push one end, the other end moves almost instantly.  You push them back, they all move back instantly.  You're causing work to happen on everything that those marbles rub against.  That &quot;work&quot;/&quot;friction&quot; is what lights up the bulbs, power the cooker, etc.</p>
<p>Now generally speaking, it's not a tube, but in fact it's an entire sheet of marbles.  In fact, not even a sheet, a box of marbles.  It just so happens that, say, copper being a good conductor, means that all the marbles in the &quot;air&quot; don't move very much at all, because when you push, the marbles in the copper wire are the ones to move with the least effort (least resistance).  So even though every cubic nanometer of space is filled with tiny marbles of electrons, when you push them, the ones that actually move are the ones that aren't &quot;stuck&quot; to the others they are touching and offer the least resistance to movement.</p>
<p>In a copper wire, that means that the marbles that do move basically move like they are in a contained tube (with the boundaries of the tube being those electrons that are making the plastic covering, the air, whatever, which &quot;resist&quot; movement more).</p>
<p>If you push hard enough, though, even the ones in the air will eventually get moved along too.  Hence you get an arc through the air.  The bigger the arc gap, the harder you need to push (more voltage).  So lightning is millions of volts, but can clear an arc-gap hundreds of metres long.  It's pushing *so* hard that the electrons in the normally-quite-stiff air get moved and pushed along.  That's also why lightning/arcs change their pattern rapidly... they are literally moving along the path of least resistance all the time and the air is moving / wetter in places, so different electrons find it &quot;easier&quot; to move.</p>
<p>You have to push harder, but the air is basically a big huge wire too.</p>
<p>In a vacuum, you don't get arcs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Air is a conductor, just not that good. So it conducts only at high voltages. So electrons aren't jumping the gap, even in DC current the electrons move very slow and wouldn't be &quot;jumping the gap&quot;(no electrons from one wire would make it to the other wire in most timescales).</p>
<p>So just think of the air as a high resistance wire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As other posters have pointed out, in any current in a wire the electrons move very slowly; however the voltage wave (think of it as the &quot;pressure wave&quot;) moves at a significant fraction of the speed of light. Hydraulic cylinders are good approximations. AC electricity is generally pretty slow -- usually 16 2/3, 50, 60, or 400 Hz so about 1/100 of a second -- while the time-scale for the arc to form is ns to us, or 1/1'000'000'000 to 1/1'000'000 second. This means that for the arc, the voltage over the gap is essentially constant until the current starts flowing.</p>
<p>Remember that when you have a gap in a conductor, there will initially be no current flowing through it. Therefore all the voltage in the circuit will be concentrated there -- in the wire U=R*I and initially I = 0, and thus no voltage in the wire.</p>
<p>When the gap is exposed to high voltage, there is a strong electric field. This is in volts / meter, so the smaller the gap, the higher the field. If there is a free electron in the gap (coming from random ionization events like cosmic radiation or from the negative (cathode) surface), this electron will be accelerated in the electric field. When the electron has picked up enough energy, it can cause another ionization event by colliding with a neutral atom or molecule in the gap, giving rise to yet another electron and another positive ion. If the probability of this happening is high enough, this causes a runaway cascade, which generates a lot of electrons and ions. This is a plasma -- similar to what you have inside a fluorescent tube but denser -- which can conduct electricity since there are free charges. This completes the circuit, allowing the current to flow through the arc, and if the power source is strong enough, generates a lot of heat.</p>
<p>For AC electricity, there is one advantage -- since the voltage is going through 0 twice per cycle, at this time there is nothing &quot;feeding&quot; the arc more energy. This causes the arc to stop, if it has time to cool down and dissipate the plasma. However for DC the voltage stays high, which makes circuit breakers for high voltage DC much harder to make than for AC.</p>
<p>For your second part of the question (&quot;And where would they go to anyway if it just jump to a wire?&quot;) I am not sure what you mean?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An arc is basically ionized air. There's so much charge in the air that it gives off light, but also this ionized air is a lot more conductive than regular air. I think the air may change to plasma state, but don't quote me on that.</p>
<p>Basically, an arc forms when the voltage between two points becomes greater than the &quot;breakdown voltage&quot; of the air in between. Breakdown voltage is the point at which a dielectric (insulator) like air can no longer insulate. The electricity (often literally) punches through the dielectric, creating a low-resistance path. In the case of air, this is when the arc is struck.</p>
<p>What makes arcs dangerous is that they are self-sustaining once struck, and are difficult to extinguish. Once the initial ionization happens, the heat from the electricity moving through the air causes further ionization, sustaining the arc.</p>
<p>DC and AC arcs behave differently, and DC arcs are harder to extinguish. However, they're basically the same thing. Electrons aren't really jumping the gap after the initial strike. The arc is more a function of current going through it, heating the air.</p>
<p>As a fun side note, the main scenario arcs happen is when disconnecting a heavy load. The wires and components in the load act as an inductor. One of the cool things an inductor does is try to resist changes in current flow. When current flow increases, it stores the energy in a magnetic field, slowing the rate of change. When current decreases, or stops, the magnetic field collapses, creating a huge voltage spike. That spike is usually what strikes the arc, and why proper sizing and design of disconnect switches is so crucial. Imagine a circuit breaker tripping on overload, only to strike an arc internally and keep conducting while melting itself. Not a fun situation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think your confusion comes from a common misconception. When electricity flows through a wire, think of it like a river. I think a lot of us initially imagine a wire with no electricity flowing through it as an empty riverbed waiting for the electrons to come rushing through it. But in reality the riverbed is already full. Every possible path already has the electrons in it, but the flow of electricity is just those electrons moving and trading places.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
