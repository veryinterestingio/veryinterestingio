		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's all about using different parts of your brain at once.</p>
<p>People are saying it's so you can get other jobs done at work, or seem authoritative, but that doesn't exactly explain why we do that in our own homes during personal calls.</p>
<p>Think of talking to friends, it's often to easier to do when you're also enjoying a meal, walking, playing games. etc.</p>
<p>I've even heard of people who play Mario Kart while on the phone, deliberately, during professional calls, and who say that makes it easier to focus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Language and communication is much more than sounds. Normally you would have a lot of body language and expressions to gauge at the same time as youre listening to someone.
With all that stimuli missing from the conversation, your attention has to go somewhere. As a solution, we fiddle, doodle, walk, and in general do meaningless stuff while we talk on the phone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For me, even though I've worked in call centers for (now) decades, it's because I really hate phone conversations.  I much prefer speaking to someone in person.  That being said, I have no idea why walking around helps, but it does help me feel like it's more of a conversation than just talking to the voice in my head (as it were)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I always fidget when I'm anxious. I figured pacing while on the phone was just another way to get rid of the excess energy. And it helps quiet the back of my mind that is free to worry when otherwise unoccupied.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read somewhere that it’s because you are trying to find the person. You can hear their voice but you can’t see them, so your subconscious is trying to find them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
