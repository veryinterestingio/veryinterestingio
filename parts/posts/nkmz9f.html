I'm Gene Kritsky, PhD (Entomology, 1977, Illinois) Professor of Biology and Dean of Behavioral and Natural Sciences at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati. I'm a Fellow of the Entomological Society of America and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. I have published over 250 papers and 10 books, including two on periodical cicadas. My cicada research has attracted national attention with appearances on the ABC Evening News, CBS Evening News, the Today Show, CBS Sunday Morning, and CNN Science News. My work has also been featured in U.S. News and World Report, USA TODAY, Parade, People, Discover, Scientific American, The New York Times, The Washington Post, Science News, The Scientist, and many international publications.</p>
<p>I have been called the Indiana Jones of cicadas. I'll be on at 2 p.m. ET (18 UT), Ask Me Anything!</p>
<p>Here's a link to the story the Cincinnati Enquirer, part of the USA TODAY Network, published about me: <a href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2021/05/09/brood-x-cicadas-gene-kritsky/7349531002/?gnt-cfr=1" target="_blank">https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2021/05/09/brood-x-cicadas-gene-kritsky/7349531002/?gnt-cfr=1</a></p>

<p>How much of a concern for their population is this fungus that takes half of their body, leaving them in a zombie-like state?</p>
<p>I also read that some cicadas managed to &quot;tame&quot; a type of cordyceps to, instead of being a parasyte, adapt to become a symbiotic organism, but the information I have found about it it's little as I believe the original founds were in Japan.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
