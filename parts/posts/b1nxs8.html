		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because keeping in time is hard for lower frequencies, so when someone goes out of sync, someone else tries to match them, getting it wrong, and then someone else trying to match them, and it escalates away. The psychological side is increasing beats is like increasing heartbeats. More adrenaline. Keeping a slow-clap going is very hard, even if there is a loud tempo setter. </p>
<p>Escalating frequencies is kinda like this: <a href="https://youtu.be/YhMiuzyU1ag" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/YhMiuzyU1ag</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe another thing to consider is that slower tempos in general are harder to perform than faster.  The slower the tempo the greater the space in between each note.  That space is much more difficult to negotiate at 30 bpm than at 180 bpm.  We naturally move up to a more comfortable tempo that we don't feel like we're almost guessing at from one beat to the next because it's so slow.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Most do, because as others have said, they're anticipating...but there's more to it.</p>
<p>If you're talking about recorded concerts, keep in mind that microphones (and, for that matter, your own ears) are fixed points in space, and sound takes time to travel. </p>
<p>If an entire audience is trying to clap along with the backbeat (or, if this is a country music concert, the bass drum) they're going to be anticipating when they're going to hear it and clap then.  But the sound they're waiting to clap along with has to travel to them- and then the noise of their clap has to travel back to the microphone that is picking up the sounds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
