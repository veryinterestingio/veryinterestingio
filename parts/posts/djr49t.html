		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you touch a dryer sheet, you'll notice it's oily or tacky, and basically it's fabric softener spread on a sheet. The sticky feeling is from a surfactant. The word &quot;surfactant&quot; comes from &quot;surface active agent&quot;. They have molecules that attract and stick to both oils and water. </p>
<p>Surfactants are useful in detergents (they stick to oils and let them get rinsed away) and in salad dressings (they keep the oil and vinegar from separating). </p>
<p>Laundry detergent uses surfactants to do the cleaning. These are usually &quot;anionic&quot; surfactants, which means the water-liking side has a negative charge. These are great at pulling dirt and oils out of fabric and then forming a little cluster, making sure the oily dirt stays suspended in the water in a little bubble. This prevents your clothes from getting dirty in the laundry water. </p>
<p>A dryer sheet in your laundry spreads another kind of surfactant all through your clothes.
The surfactant used in dryer sheets has a positive electrical charge on the water-liking end, it is &quot;cationic&quot;, so it sticks to negatively charged clothing fibers like a magnet. It cancels out static electricity from the fabric rubbing together. It also adds a layer of oil to the outside so the fabric doesn't easily rub together well enough to build up any more static charge.  </p>
<p>The water-liking side sticks to your clothing fibers and the other oil-liking end points outward. The dryer sheet also contains a lot of oil or silicone to coat your clothes and make them feel really soft. </p>
<p>Because each molecule has a positive charge sticking outward, the fibers repel one another and feel extra fluffy when they're dry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So first of all, what is static? It's a buildup of charge that causes our clothes to stick to us. </p>
<p>To get rid of that charge we need to balance it out with something charged the opposite of it. </p>
<p>Dryer sheets are coated with a material that is charged oppositely when heated to negate the charge of the clothes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
