When the kettle is about to boil properly all of the water in it is at or near boiling point, so a lot more of the bubbles make it through to the surface to get released as steam rather than popping inside the water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The noise is caused by vapour bubbles formed near the hot surface at the bottom, but quickly bursting due to colder water above. As bulk of the water reach closer to the boiling temperature, then bubbles near the hot surface start to grow and escape to the top surface instead of bursting at the bottom. So, kettle goes quieter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When hot bubbles hit cold water they pop and make noise. But when hot bubbles hit hot water they keep moving. At the start, the bottom of the water is hot and the top is cold, so the bubbles that rise up from the bottom keep popping. Nearer the end, all the water is hot, so the bubbles don’t pop as they move to the top, so less noise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a pretty tricky one to explain simply, buy I'm going to give it a shot. </p>
<p>When you book water in a kettle, there is a temperature gradient across the water - the bottom of the kettle gets very very hot, the bottom of the water is hot, and the top of the water is colder. </p>
<p>The noise comes from cavitation, which is what happens when bubbles in water collapse. This creates a very rapid change in pressure, and since sound is a pressure wave cavitation makes sound. </p>
<p>When you boil water, everything starts at room temperature. Then you switch on the kettle and the bottom starts to heat up. This heat is slowly transferred to the water, heating it up too. As the water heats up, little bubbles start forming. These bubbles are gas from the air that was dissolved in the water coming out of solution. Since they are lighter than the water around them, they float from the hot water at the bottom to the colder water at the top where they either escape the water or are cooled off first and collapse, making noise. </p>
<p>As the kettle continues to heat up, it will eventually get to a surface temperature that's higher than the boiling point of water. When this happens, pockets of steam form at the heating element. Just like the air bubbles, this steam floats up to cooler water where it is cooled, condenses, and experiences a rapid pressure change making sound. </p>
<p>The water continues to heat up and mix through convection, until eventually all the water is the same temperature, the boiling point. When all the water is at the boiling point, the bubbles of steam that are forming at the heating element don't lose any heat to the water so they don't condense and don't collapse. This means that instead of making sound, they escape into the air as steam. </p>
<p>Hopefully that makes sense! </p>
<p>TL;DR; boiling makes bubbles, when the bubbles pop they make sound. When the water is hot enough the bubbles don't pop anymore, so there's no more sound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heat enters the water at the bottom of the kettle, because that’s where the heating element is.</p>
<p>This causes a very thin layer of hot water to form, right up against the heating element, at the bottom of the kettle. The layer of hot water on the bottom and the cold layer of water above it don’t want to mix very much, so fairly quickly, the hot layer stays down there long enough to get hot enough to boil. When water boils, it instantly turns from liquid to gas. This makes tiny bubbles of water vapor that are far less dense than the water that was there a fraction of a second before. This makes the first noise you hear. Those bubbles immediately want rise up like a balloon. But the instant they even begin to expand away from the heating element into the cooler layer of water, they immediately cool and collapse again. The bubbles collapse before they even get big enough for you to see them. Even though the bubble collapses, the heat is still in the water, and the warmer water still wants to rise up like a balloon, which it eventually does. </p>
<p>After a period of time, water currents become established, where hotter water constantly moves up, and cooler water constantly moves down to take its place. Once these currents are established, the constant movement of cooler water to the bottom stops any spot up against the heating element from getting hot enough to boil, and the noise goes away for a while. But the overall temperature of the water in the kettle creeps higher and higher, as the water takes turns getting heated at the bottom and going to the top to cool slightly, right before going back down again as hotter water shoots up to take its place. If the lid is on the kettle, this helps the hotter water hang on to more of its heat during its trip to the top of the water and back down.</p>
<p>After another period of time, the cooler water coming down to replace the water that just went up is still hot enough that it’s very close to boiling even by the time it gets back to the bottom. Once this happens, when it gets down there, it does boil, shooting back up again, and you can hear the water boiling again. This time, there is a lot more “shooting to the top” movement than when your first heard the initial boiling. The bubbles also last long enough for you to see them, and eventually they last long enough and stay big to reach the top as full bubbles, at which time the state of the water is described as a “steady boil.”</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
