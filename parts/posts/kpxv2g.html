She asked how, if two people with (let’s say) perfect pitch sing a song, how is it possible that we can still tell who is singing when the notes would be identical?</p>
<p>Note: I know absolutely nothing about music, but figured this was the best place to ask for her.</p>
<p>Edit: Wow, many of these answers are incredible! I had no idea this would receive such in depth and thoughtful feedback. I have learned a huge amount. I was not exaggerating above when I said I know nothing about music (I don’t even know what pitch is - just quoted my daughter on that) and I’m grateful to those of you who took the time to help me learn.</p></div></div>

<p>For a five year old I’d say that a saxophone and a flute can play the same note, but they have unique shapes to their bodies causing a difference in sound. Humans also have different shapes to their bodies causing them to sound different when singing the same note.</p>
<p>Edit for a more complete answer to address harmonics and overtones: </p>
<p>Imagine having a palette of only red paints. They are all the same color (or note) but are different shades (or spectrums) of the red paint note. You can mix the lighter red shade with the darker red shade and you’ll still get a red. The color of red that a person can sing is based on their unique blending of red shades. They sing these shades based on how their body is built.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the components of a musical note is its <em>timbre</em> (pronounced TAM-bur). Timbre is all the sounds associated with the source that <em>aren't</em> part of the pure tone.</p>
<p>Instruments (and the human voice - hereafter I'll just say instrument, but it works the same either way) don't produce a pure tone. The instrument creates the root frequency, the pitch you're trying to make, and also overtones. Take a guitar string: it will vibrate at a particular frequency, and it will also vibrate at exactly twice that, and exactly thrice, and exactly four times, and etc. The shape of the instrument and what it's made of and the size and shape and material of the main source of vibrations (lips, reeds, vocal cords, etc.) all change which overtones get amplified and which get diminished. Your ears can hear the differences in these overtones, although your brain filters it from your conscious perception of the sound unless you focus on it.</p>
<p>With a human voice, this includes the size and shape of your mouth and lungs and sinuses and skull and thickness of your skull and jaw and tongue and so on and so forth. All of these things change the overtones in subtle ways, so that even when the root pitch is the same the pitches around it won't be.</p>
<p>Timbre also includes all the unique sounds that come from the instrument: things like key clicks or valve movements or breath noises or little scratchy bits in your voice, etc.</p>
<p>Edit: &quot;That's not how you pronounce 'timbre!'&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/timbre" target="_blank">It is in American English.</a> It is at the very least <em>one</em> correct pronunciation in English. Yes, I know it's borrowed from French but this comment isn't in French, it's in English. I don't expect everyone on the internet to understand English, but if you're reading this in the original that means you understand English. Some 60% of the English lexicon comes directly from French so if you're gonna get upset every time someone pronounces a French word &quot;wrong&quot; in English you're not going to get very far.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sound isn't just the exact pure tone of the pitch they're singing in. Every instrument and voice has a distribution of frequencies around the main pitch, known as its <em>timbre</em>. A piano, for example, is very concentrated around a specific pitch, while a drum is more spread out (which makes piano a better instrument for expressing detailed harmonies, but also makes it sound much more dissonant if you play a note that's a bit off).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think there's a better and more interesting answer than the ones posted here, even though they're all good explanations.</p>
<p>The &quot;note&quot; a singer, or any other instrument makes, is a frequency. Literally &quot;how <strong>frequently</strong> does the sound oscillate?&quot;</p>
<p>With a guitar, it's &quot;how frequently does the guitar string oscillate?&quot; Meaning vibrate. If you watched a guitar string in slow-motion, you'd be able to see it vibrating after it was plucked. You can kinda see it even without slo-mo, it's just a blur.</p>
<p>With your voice, it's flaps of skin in your throat that are vibratring.</p>
<p>If someone sings an A#, that means their vocal chords are vibrating 466 times per second. Everyone singing an A# at the same time is vibrating their vocal chords 466 times per second.</p>
<p>But sound is MORE than just a frequency, which you know if you think about it. It's also an &quot;amplitude.&quot; Which means &quot;loudness.&quot; We could both be singing A#, but I might sing louder than you. Same note, two different volumes.</p>
<p>But sound also has a SHAPE! Which is SUPER COOL! Let's look at the &quot;purest&quot; tone, which is called a <a href="https://www.wisc-online.com/assetrepository/getfile?id=3768&amp;getType=view&amp;width=0&amp;height=0" target="_blank">Sine Wave.</a></p>
<p>That is a real simple wave and because it's so simple it would make a very pure tone if you listened to it. But <strong>pitch</strong> is <strong>just</strong> frequency. A wave with a different <strong>shape</strong> but the same <strong>frequency</strong> would be the same pitch, but could sound very different.</p>
<p>Let's look at a different kind of wave. What's called a <a href="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-41c43d0e532ac48adf72c485e31c5e33-c" target="_blank">Saw Wave.</a></p>
<p>You can see why it's called a saw wave, right? Looks like the teeth of a saw! </p>
<p>Well, this makes a VERY different sound. It sounds...actually it sorta sound the way it looks! It has an <em>edge</em>. It's not as pure as the sine wave. When you listen to any bowed instrument, the sound you're hearing is a Saw Wave, because that's the actual physical motion of the string!</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/5azm0uox03y21.gif?format=mp4&amp;s=ea49e13ee62118531858184d756c3b8047f810a2" target="_blank">Watch this!</a></p>
<p>(the preview might not be working)</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/5azm0uox03y21.gif?format=mp4&s=ea49e13ee62118531858184d756c3b8047f810a2" target="_blank">https://preview.redd.it/5azm0uox03y21.gif?format=mp4&s=ea49e13ee62118531858184d756c3b8047f810a2</a></p>
<p>You can see it there. The bow is pulled across the string. At first, the friction of the bow catches the string and pulls it smoothly back. That's the &quot;ramp up&quot; of the saw wave. Eventually the tension in the string overcomes the bow's friction, and the string 'snaps' back. Which is the sharp, straight-down line of the saw wave. But the bow is still pulling, so the string gets caught again and the cycle repeats. </p>
<p>Saw Waves and Sine Waves are still pretty simple though. The waves produced by the human voice look <em>weird</em> and <em>messy.</em> <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lhC4Y.gif" target="_blank">Look!</a></p>
<p>If you look on the graph, everything from the 1 hash, to the 8 mark is ONE cycle. That is a complex wave and it's still way simpler than the human voice. The human voice looks more like <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jody_Kreiman/publication/281119746/figure/fig6/AS:668580781752330@1536413488325/Waveform-showing-extreme-aperiodicity-phrase-finally-by-a-female-English-speaker.png" target="_blank">this.</a></p>
<p>THAT is why two people singing the same note are recognizably different. They're vocal chords are vibrating VERY complexly. So complex, it's almost unique! When you recognize someone's voice, you're recognizing the unique properties of the SHAPE of the wave their vocal chords make. That shape is based on the physical shape of their vocal chords and their throat and even their mouth which is helping shape the sound as it comes out.</p>
<p>The <strong>rate</strong> at which their skin flaps vibrate might be the same, but because their skin is floppy and weird shaped, it doesn't just go smoothly up and down like a guitar string. It waggles all over WHILE going up and down and that is what singers and musicians call &quot;timbre.&quot; Timbre means &quot;The way your skin flaps waggle around while you vibrate them.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
