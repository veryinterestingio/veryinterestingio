		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vehicle manufacturers are fined in many states if they do not produce enough EVs. Tesla, who produces <em>only</em> EVs, sells their extra &quot;credits&quot; to these manufacturers. In the previous four quarters, they made over a billion dollars doing something that essentially cost them nothing. That led to them posting a profit for four quarters, which (among other things) made them eligible for the S&amp;P 500, which caused people to buy more stock, which caused their valuation to go up, and so fourth. </p>
<p>They also had the <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2020/01/19/tesla-model-3-7th-best-selling-car-in-usa/" target="_blank">7th best selling sedan in Q4 2019</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When people talk about value, they talk about forward thinking. In the future, lots of people *think* Tesla will be valuable, but they're not making very much money now, because they're still growing.</p>
<p>Lots of companies lose money in their early years, as they spend the money they make, to help them get bigger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The value is based on the stock price, not the cashflow or assets.</p>
<p>The stock price is high because many people think it will grow, not because they are making high profits.</p>
<p>It's definitely a bubble and will probably fall some day unless Tesla starts selling more cars than Ford.</p>
<p>Tesla has the lead in technology for now, but will they forever? Probably not.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm a huge Tesla fan. But Tesla needs to grow its infrastructure quite a bit to maintain this valuation once the hype dies down</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tesla being almost bankrupt last year was an accounting view.  Tesla had spent almost all of its cash just before its cars came off the line and could be sold to bring in income.   The cash was spent on the materials and costs to produce the cars.</p>
<p>Once the cars were finished and sold Tesla had plenty of money.</p>
<p>If Tesla had needed more money it could have borrowed it.  The appearance of being near bankruptcy was actually excellent cash management that was spun as a problem for the company by people who wanted to target the company. </p>
<p>Tesla may not be worth what investors are currently paying for it, but it also wasn't close to going bankrupt last year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stock prices are based on profits and expectation of future profitability... they had to spend a TON of money to build out the infrastructure to crank out as many cars as they anticipate selling, but they got past that startup hurdle and now have the capacity and demand to sell a ton of high profit margin Teslas.</p>
<p>Imagine you're starting up a lemonade stand. You and your friends scrounge up $20 to buy supplies. You go into the store and grab a package of cups, a bag lemons, a bag of sugar, a pitcher... you get to the register and it's $21 because you forgot about sales tax! But you run out to your mom waiting in the car and get the extra money you need. You almost couldn't have your lemonade because you were short, but you got the funds you needed and now your stand can open up. It's a huge success and you sell $100 worth of lemonade.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
