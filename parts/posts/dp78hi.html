			<a href="/posts/dp78hi" onclick="return false">ELI5 : Why is it recommended to have 8 hours of sleep when sleep cycles happen every 90 minutes, wouldn’t waking up at 8 hours be in the middle of your cycle?</a>

Wouldn’t that make you feel drowsy if you’re interrupting the sleep cycle when you wake up after 8 hours?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a natural variation in amount of time adult humans need to sleep, but 7-9 hours is now the recommended sleep length (but this varies by age). Even if we keep to the traditional 8 hours of sleep, your first sleep cycle (consisting of all sleep stages) is usually around 2 hours. The longer you are asleep, each cycle gets shorter, and the proportion of time spent in each sleep stage (N1, N2, N3, REM) changes, shifting to longer and longer time in REM/dreaming sleep. How groggy you feel when you wake up depends on which stage of sleep you were in when you woke up. At 8 hours, it's often easier to wake up not groggy because even if you are in the middle of a cycle, you are more likely to be in REM/dreaming sleep which looks a lot like your awake brain leading to less grogginess, generally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's three key ideas regarding your question.</p>
<p>The first is that humans generally need 7-9 hours of sleep. 8 hours is just an average. </p>
<p>The second is that sleep cycles average about 90 minutes. But...</p>
<p>The third is that as we get closer to waking up (assuming you have normal sleep and are not in sleep deficit) the cycles no longer enter deep sleep phases. Waking up in deep sleep is what makes us feel groggy most of the time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok I’m reading a lot of comment that start with ‘ I think’ or ‘ I only need 6-7 hours’ and ‘8 hours is all made up’. </p>
<p>I highly recommend reading the book Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker. He’s taught at Harvard and Berkeley and runs the Center for Human Sleep Science, and the book documents his studies on how sleep impacts our performance. One consistent finding he has is that sleeping less than 8 hours impacts our performance the next day and into the future (I can’t remember the precise experiments, but he has students memorise something, and force various groups to sleep different hours) and the ones that sleep 8 hours always perform the best. </p>
<p>I’m a bit troubled at lack of citing papers or resources, so hopefully this book points you in the right direction. I am by no means an expert, but this book fully convinced me to get my 8 hours of sleep every day. It’s truly shocking how bad it is for you long term to not get to that amount.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Funny you should ask:</p>
<p>Before the wide spread use of artificial lights, there was a first sleep and a second sleep.  Some scientists believe that &quot;bi-modal&quot; sleep is what humans are most accustomed to.</p>
<p>Until the early 18th century, people would go to bed more or less at sundown.  They would then wake up in the middle of the night and spend an hour or so thinking, praying, reading, making love, etc.  Then they would go back to sleep for another few hours.</p>
<p>Here is an article providing more in-depth information about first sleep, second sleep, and the 8 hour sleep:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>there is a lot of misleading information in here. if you want to learn more about our current understanding of sleep from a laymans perspective i urge you to watch a few Matthew Walker videos. i like the Joe Rogan one, but there are plenty of others including TED talks. few youtube videos have made me pause and reevaluate my self like his have.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
