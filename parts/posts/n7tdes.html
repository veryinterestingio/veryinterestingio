		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, there wasn't a standardized frame rate (24 frames/sec) until the mid-20s. The illusion of movement happens as low as 15fps, so cameras, early on, filmed anywhere from 15-30fps. So footage that was filmed at 15fps and projected at 24fps suddenly looks sped up.</p>
<p><strong>But they were never meant to be seen that way. Whoever transferred them screwed up.</strong></p>
<p>Every silent film we have ever seen was a transfer onto 8, 16, or 35mm, done 50+ years ago, as cellulose nitrate film aged incredibly poorly; it became brittle and combustible (hence, less than 10% of all silent films made exist to this day). They burned like a modern-day Library of Alexandria. If they were originally transferred at the wrong frame rate, that is the only way we have ever known those films to exist and the originals were destroyed so it can never be fixed properly.</p>
<p>After 10, years I finally got to use my degree. Thank you for asking.</p>
<p>Edit: Yes, changing the framerate is very easy in the digital age. Every film could be corrected in speed as frames were transferred 1:1. 75+ years of silent film played too fast has changed the language with how we perceive it (i.e. it may look unnatural to us if it were corrected). It is a major part of the history of film and I think distributors choose to leave it as a document.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as I’m aware it’s for two distinct reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The frame rates of the cameras were incredibly low and when played back on devices with a much faster frame rate, it speeds everything up. </p>
</li>
<li>Also there was a period of hand cranked cameras being the standard, so controlling the speed was down to humans which is another reason for sped up and inconsistent footage.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m not sure if the two reasons can both be applicable to the same footage but if so that would probably explain the most extreme examples.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
