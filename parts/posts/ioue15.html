		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're all progressing steadily - no major failures have been reported yet, but this will take time. Best estimates are initial/topline data by year end, with a potential approval shortly after. Global roll out to public is unlikely till around June or so next year (due to a combination of manufacturing times, approvals etc.)The problem is that to prove a vaccine works is fundamentally different from a therapeutic. With a therapeutic, you can give the therapsutic/drug  to x people, placebo to x people, and in a relatively short time ( weeks to months) you can find out who's getting better, and prove efficacy.With vaccines, you need time most importantly. You can give the vaccine to x people, and placebo to x people - and then you need to wait certain time - long enough to compare infection rates between placebo and vaccine group. For e.g. there's 3 possible outcomes</p>
<ol>
<li>Infection rates are comparable between placebo and vaccine --&gt; vaccine isn't efficacious</li>
<li>Infection rates are significantly higher in placebo group than vaccine --&gt; great, vaccine works....</li>
<li>Infection rate is low in BOTH placebo and vaccine groups, and comparable -- This is the most irritating scenario. Because this could be due to 2 reasons - vaccine worked, but general infectivity dropped in both groups - due to social distancing, precautions, whatever. OR. vaccine didn't work, becasue the vaccine group was affected at teh same rate as the placebo group --- Meaning this is inconclusive. This is very common in vaccine studies and why a large number of vaccines fail in Phase 3.</li>
</ol>
<p>To reduce the likelihood of option 3, the approach is to test in large numbers of patients, over a significant amount of time ( 6 mo or so) , so that they can have data on the placebo side to compare. That's why this will take time.</p>
<p>Also the reason why anyone saying they'll have &quot;great results&quot; for a phase 3 trial that started in June/July by Oct/Nov is either unaware of the level of data needed, or is bowing to non-scientific pressure.</p>
<p>That said, you could have preliminary data (from a part of the tested population etc.) sooner than year end, but usually that's not enough to approve drugs unless in extreme circumstances. Additionally, a longer follow up is required for safety, which we may not have by then. So we could see promising candidates start to show up soon, but not ready for global prime time till mid next year</p>

<p>Edit: Fixed typo.</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the gold!!!!</p>
<p>Edit 3: Wow. Thanks for all the awards. Now I have to figure out what they actually do! I'm reading the replies and am trying to answer them as best as I can.</p>
<p>Edit 4: To clarify my timeline estimate further, I was referring to June as the expectation for the general public, i.e. all of us. The vaccines will most likely be rolled out in stages, with front line workers or high risk populations first.  Depending on if EUA is granted, we could see a conditional or emergency approval by early next year meaning those groups could get this by March or so. And then it'll be available to the rest by June.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 5:</strong> My best post ever, and the day I post AZ halts their trial - smh. This halt is not a failure. It's proof that the system is working as it was designed to, with the clinicians observing an AE they didn't expect, and so the trial is paused till they understand it better. </p>
<p><strong>Edit 6:</strong> The most frequent qn below is why not test the vaccine by infecting them with the virus. I've answered below, but briefly its ethics. Informed Consent is a key part of trials, and even more important in these cases to communicate the risks involved. We still don't know all the potential long term consequences, so how do you convince someone to risk their life by purposely giving them a potentially fatal virus? Offering money etc, would also be unethical. It's a complex topic - not unlikely but very complex.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>there are hundreds of vaccines in progress right now.  several of which are in phase 3 trials.</p>
<p>This isnt exactly like creating a vaccine for some unknown illness.  Coronavirus is relatively well understood, and there has been 10+ years of unmotivated research into SARS/MERS.  That knowledge has greatly aided adapting a vaccine to Covid19.</p>
<p>Im not aware of any vaccines which have failed, no major ones anyway.  they all saw positive efficacy with acceptable side effects in at least a portion of recipients in phase 2 trials.</p>
<p>this is a good tracker.</p>
