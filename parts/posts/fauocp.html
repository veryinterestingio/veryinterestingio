Picking was a way to preserve food before refrigeration was a thing. So what changed? Why change a perfectly good method by ruining it with so-called “preservatives” that <em>require</em> refrigeration.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, many pickles today are not fermented but preserved in vinegar, which is faster to make.</p>
<p>However, even fermented pickles can get bad after opening. When you ferment something (from pickles to beer), you first sanitize everything and then add the &quot;good&quot; organisms that you want to ferment (and not spoil) your food. As long as the containers remain closed, no other &quot;bad&quot; organisms will enter. So you can preserve them for a long time, as long as they are closed.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>After fermentation, food is less likely to spoil because most of the sugars have been consumed and the content may be too acidic for some organisms, but it is still possible for bad bacteria or fungi to grow on your opened beer or fermented cucumbers. So you may want to refrigerate after opening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Refrigerating any jarred or canned product is a good idea if you open it and don't use it all. Canning &amp; jarring are great processes for long term storage because they sterilize to product and remove almost all air from the container before sealing. </p>
<p>The problem is that as soon as that seal is broken, bacteria, mold, and air can make their way inside. This is particularly bad for something pickles since some people like to stick their bacteria-covered hands into the jar to grab one. The vinegar-based brine will kill some of the infiltrating bacteria and mold spores, but it won't be enough to stop them entirely. So you refrigerate them to dramatically slow bacteria and mold growth and give you time to finish the jar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You probably don't actually have to. They are covered in vinegar.</p>
<p>You also don't have to refrigerate mayonnaise but they tell you to any way.</p>
<p>As the other user mentioned there is a method of pickling that includes a live fermentation but that's not as common commercially. Those will only be preserved as long as they are submerged and the culture is active(which can be thrown off by a ton of stuff so not ideal for shipping, etc.)</p>
<p>Now you've got your canned vinegar pickles. These can also be made this way at home. The salt and vinegar is the preservative. I'm not sure what &quot;so-called preservatives&quot; you are referring to.</p>
<p>Another note is that canning itself is a way of preserving many different types of food before refrigeration. However, this only preserves the food until you open it.</p>
<p>So generally when you open a jar of something it's going to need to go in the fridge, whether it is home made or store bought.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
