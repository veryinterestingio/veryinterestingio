		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best way to think about volcanoes is as Earth's way of transferring heat from the inside to the outside, while also letting dense stuff settle to the bottom and lighter stuff come out to the surface.</p>
<p>Volcanoes are fed by molten magma/ That magma is stuff which formed in the mantle. The mantle of the earth is not liquid - it's actually solid. But some processes cause parts of it to melt. Once that happens, the molten stuff is less dense than the rest, so it begins to rise up and feed volcanic activity.</p>
<p>Once the material rises up into the crust it will eventually reach a point where it becomes neutrally buoyant; the same density as the rock around it. That causes the rising magma to pool and form a magma reservoir (also sometimes called a magma chamber - this is a poor description because it give the impression that there's some kind of hollow there).</p>
<p>That magma is literally just molten rocky material, so if you let it cool it will gradually crystalline and form igneous rocks. Most magma ends up cooling long before it ever gets near the surface, and forms things like granite and gabbro.</p>
<p>If the pressure in a magma reservoir gets higher than the strength of the rock holding it in, then it's possible the magma will suddenly find its way to the surface. When that happens we have what's called an eruption.</p>
<p>If the magma is runny, or there's not much gas, we just erupt lava. However, if the magma is thick and viscous, and there's lots of gas dissolved in it, then as the magma comes to the surface the gas begins to form bubbles, and the magma starts to fragment. That makes ash particles, and we get an explosive eruption.</p>
<p>The force of the eruption will depend on the viscosity and the gas content fo the magma, and the amount of magma being erupted. It can vary on many orders of magnitude.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Volcanoes can fill up with lava in a few main ways. If the volcano is on a diverging fault line, where two tectonic plates move away from each other, magma from deep inside the earth can rise to the surface of the earth's crust. If a tectonic plate with an ocean on it being subducted, or is going under, a continental plate, the water actually lowers the melting temperature of the surrounding rocks. This newly melted magma then rises to the surface of the earth. Some volcanoes are not on fault lines. These volcanoes, such as Hawaii, Iceland, and Yellowstone, ate the results of hotspots. We aren't 100% sure why these hot spots exist, but what we do know is the are parts of the earth's crust where magma can rise to the surface.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a bit rusty on some of the details, but hopefully I can provide enough background. I've abandoned the numerical order, but I've tried to answer all the questions so the information is hopefully all there. </p>
<p>The earth's crust sort of floats on softer, malleable material known as the mantle. The mantle is at very high temperatures and pressures essentially because of how deep it is. This means that although its a rock it is able to  behave more like a liquid. The crust above is broken up into several distinct plates which all move about on this softer material as it convects.</p>
<p>When plates move away from each other, or one plate is forced under another, you get volcanos. Volcanos form at the boundary between the two plates because mantle material is able to rise up through weaknesses and cracks as 'magma' (see the pacific ring of fire, the ring of volcanoes which surrounds the Pacific Ocean Plate). As the mantle material rises it loses pressure and becomes molten and is now actually a liquid rock. It's still at high pressures, just not as high as before. It is also still very hot. This is how magma is formed, and magma can essentially be thought of as molten rock rising through the earth's crust. </p>
<p>Some magma is really thin, hot and runny and can easily flow through cracks and fissures in the crust. It then pours out onto the earths surface. When magma reaches the surface we call it 'lava'. A good example of this is Hawaii, where you can see videos of eruptions that don't involve a lot of energy at all as the magma can escape easily and the lava flows away freely. </p>
<p>At the surface lava cools rapidly and much like any other liquid reaches a solidification temperature (just like how water freezes at 0 degrees). It forms lots of crystals of various minerals which are joined together as a crystalline rock. An example of this would be basalt, which contains the minerals olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase. Over the course of several hundreds of eruptions, the rocks formed by the lava solidifying will build up over a long time. Eventually this forms the typical cone shape you associate with many volcanoes, which are a bit like a point layer cake made up of hundreds of layers of lava. </p>
<p>Not all magma is the same and some magma will form different minerals and as such different rocks. When magma is really thick and viscous it struggles to work its way out of the crust. It's losing temperature and pressure all the time, and just like how of you open a can of cola it fizzes up or if you let a beer go warm it loses fizz this magma gives of lots of previously trapped gas that it can no longer hold on to anymore (because of the change in pressure and temperature). These include steam, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide. Some of these are toxic, and it's why sometimes you get a rotten egg smell at some thermal springs, geysers, ect.</p>
<p>When this thick magma gets trapped, it builds up more and more pressure in the shallow crust as more magma arrives but none escapes. This causes the earth to bulge, and add to this the build up of steam and gases, you get a massive explosion. This is similar to what happened at Mount Saint Helens in 1980. These eruptions release huge amounts of energy, and cast Ash, gases and broken rock into the sky. This material falls to earth as a pyroclastic flow (worth searching on YouTube) and deposits layers of this ashy material all around in valleys and depressions. This sediment overtime can also build up and form rocks just like the materials which reach the ocean can go on to form sandstones and limestone. The magma which can't make it to the surface will cool and crystallise in the cracks in the crust and form crystalline rocks like granite. </p>
<p>Krakatoa is a good example of an explosive eruption like this. It basically blew up half an island, could be heard all round the world, and the amount of ash in the atmosphere reflected all the sunlight and caused one of the coldest winters on record. Even in London, halfway round the world from the Pacific Island the eruption happened at. This gives an idea of the amount of force involved in these types of eruptions.</p>
<p>But as I mentioned before, some volcanoes such as those in Hawaii have hot, thin, runny lava. This can flow freely, and there is really not all that much energy released during these eruptions. Of course, all around the world at the various plate boundaries magma is slightly different and you can get anything in between these two extremes. These magmas will all produce slightly different rocks, just because there starting composition is slightly different. Also, often volcanoes evolve starting out runny, and becoming more explosive through time which further complicates matters.</p>
<p>So there are a few ways in which a volcano can erupt, and form various types of rocks. Sorry I couldn't keep to the numerical order but I hope this gives you some of the answers you were looking for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
