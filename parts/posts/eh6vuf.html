		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is still a lot of debate regarding the causes of hangovers and it is challenging to study.</p>
<p>There are a few factors that are thought to be the main contributors to feeling so crappy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Your body has an inflammatory response to the alcohol, inflammatory responses don't feel good</li>
<li>Alcohol alters the levels of different neurotransmitters in your brain and this takes time to return to normal</li>
<li>Alcohol damages your mitochondria (part of your cells that make energy).</li>
<li>The metabolites of alcohol (chemicals that your body breaks alcohol down into), particularly acetaldehyde, are toxic.  Acetaldehyde is usually broken down really quickly so probably has minimal impact for most people, unless you are genetically less able to break it down (its build up in the body causes 'Asian Flush' in some East Asian people for example)</li>
</ol>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>I should have included something about dehydration up here. Dehydration definitely contributes to how you feel in the morning but it is not solely responsible for the actual alcohol hangover.</p>
<p>This is the reason hangovers can still occur with appropriate hydration and why they don't go away simply by rehydrating.</p>
<p>It's generally considered that the effects of dehydration often occur concurrently but should be considered separately to the effects of the alcohol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally it's a combination of things.</p>
<p>Dehydration is part of it, not just lack of water but your electrolytes get all out of whack.  Eat a banana and drink some OJ. </p>
<p>Ethanol breaks down into nasty stuff like acetaldehyde.  This is rough on your liver.</p>
<p>Ethanol suppresses REM sleep so you don't get as good of a rest as you might think.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Combination of many things:
Dehydration + low electrolytes<br />
Bad REM sleep<br />
Inflammation  </p>
<p>But, what a lot of people are afraid to say is that a hangover is acute alcohol withdrawal. This is why drinking the next day cures a hangover more than almost anything (Hair of the dog). A weird side effect of hangovers I get is sometimes referred to as “the fear” or really bad anxiety a day after drinking. Drinking acts on GABA (inhibitory NT), so you’re somewhat feeling the over-compensation from your body on that effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has less to do with alcohol and more to do with dehydration, you can achieve many of the same negative affects by simply not drinking water for an extended duration. Sure alcohol helps you get dehydrated more quickly. This is why it is generally considered a good idea to switch between alcohol/water rounds to lessen or completely negate it.</p>
<p>Essentially your body is using whatever water it has to digest/flush out the alcohol (which is why you probably wake up needing to relieve yourself) Alcohol itself has no nutritional value and most of the things you drink it with aren't much better. I'm sure there are things I am missing out on but I'm not an expert</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They would, no shit, IV themselves with saline on hangover mornings to speed the recovery... and it worked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
