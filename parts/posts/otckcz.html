		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious about this and don't really see it addressed elsewhere.  It's become common to allow a bottle of liquor (whisky, cognac, etc) to &quot;rest&quot; after opening.  In fact, I just read this in a vodka review: &quot;It is Beluga’s philosophy to have this vodka rest after each step of the production,&quot; explains Borisov. After a five-time filtration process to achieve maximum smoothness, the vodka's final resting period is 90 days. &quot;This allows it to reach perfect balance and harmony,&quot;</p>
<p>Since I always like to ask myself &quot;why is that&quot; and &quot;what mechanism is at work here&quot;, I'm asking precisely that.  Is there some chemical change happening to drive a flavor shift or is this &quot;resting&quot; of a seemingly stable substance mostly psychological in nature.  If a sealed or capped bottled is allowed to &quot;rest&quot; sans additional oxygen or heat, how is it changing?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With a lot of spirits, their individual character comes from the infusion of other flavors based on what vessel they're resting in. Bourbon, for example, uses oak barrels that are charred on the inside. As they rest in large barns that are not temperature controlled, the natural thermal expansion and contraction causes the spirit to move in and out of the barrel wood, absorbing various organics and other chemicals along the way. </p>
<p>Once bottled, spirits don't age anymore. Ideally. If they're poorly sealed, then they may oxidize. </p>
<p>Resting a bottle after opening will allow for any volatiles that want to escape to do so, although in a narrow bottle your available surface area is limited. That's usually why you decant into a different container from the bottle before drinking. </p>
<p>Any flavors remaining in the spirit after it rests are what 'should' be there. </p>
<p>Vodka is a bit silly though, as it's generally going to be as close to straight ethanol and water as you can get.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In terms of the maturation chemistry of distilled spirits, most consumers focus on congeners. Congeners are the volatile and non-volatile trace elements present besides ethanol, such as fusel alcohols, acetone, acetaldehyde, esters, tannins, aldehydes, and so on. While vodka is highly distilled, it is not 100% ethanol, some trace amounts of congeners remain that will affect flavor. In terms of aging, some of the congeners may break down, evaporate, or interact (e.g., aging whiskey in wood barrels involves congener interactions), all of which can affect flavor.</p>
<p>Another aspect consumers aren't typically aware of though is how ratios and purity of ethanol and water affect the structure of a spirit. You may think that ethanol and water is just a solution with each freely floating around each other. In actuality, ethanol and water like to form clusters that affect flavor as well. Ethanol is sort of hydrophobic on end of the molecule and hydrophilic on the other. Thus, when water is added, it wants to bond to the polar hydroxyl group of Ethanol, but stay away from ethane hydrocarbon part of it. Depending on the ratio of the water and ethanol, water may bond to the ethanol to form clusters that change viscosity and thus mouthfeel (which is part of the reason we prefer distilled spirits around 40\~45% ABV).  However, congeners can affect the formation of such clusters. So as the distilled spirit rests and the distribution of congeners change, so to will its structure change in relation to ethanol-water clusters.</p>
<p>So getting back to your question, what Beluga is describing is not aging in a bottle or decanting an alcohol after it is opened, but rather resting prior to bottling. Thus, what is likely occurring is maturation in large stainless steel tanks for longer periods, so as to produce a vodka with a different flavor in terms of congeners and structure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>How do they define those terms?</p>
<p>I wonder how their claims are going to fare against a blind test. See if people can distinguish between &quot;rested&quot; and regular vodka, when the only information they have is two identical-looking glasses in front of them which they can go ahead and taste.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially the tannins that are within the liquid are now reacting with oxygen. When tannins react with oxygen they chain together forming larger/longer molecules. The longer the tannin chains the more full bodied and flavorfull.
Tannins themselves are molecules that come from plant materials: for example red wine which is fermented with the vines/skins of grapes have natural tannins, but white wine has these materials filtered prior to fermentation so there are very few tannins. This is why you should let a red wine &quot;rest&quot; or &quot;breath&quot; while it is unnecessary for white wines. Spirits such as whiskey/scotch contain tannins from the barrels in which they are aged.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
