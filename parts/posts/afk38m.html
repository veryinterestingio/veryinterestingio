		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People with different hair textures have different needs. The oil on your hair is made at the scalp, and it over time disperses to the length of your hairs.
Now imagine that each hair is a slide, the straight slide is much faster than the curly slide.</p>
<p>People with very straight hair get the oil all down the shaft of the hair much faster because of this. They might appear to have very oily flat hair, think of Severus Snape. They may opt for less of a deep condition, and a more thorough shampoo.</p>
<p>Whereas people with very curly hair usually have very dry hair, cause its harder for the oil to make it down the shaft. Dry hair will usually be frizzier, Like Hermione in the first books. So someone with curly hair will opt for a more moisturizing routine, which leads to more defined curls. ie. Hermione at the Yule Ball.</p>
<p>Now this is only the very basics, there are tons more variations in hair textures and scalp needs. As well as the fact that people with curlier hair also have thicker hair and coarser hair.</p>
<p>Apologies for the formatting, I’m on mobile. Edited to include more Harry Potter references </p>
<p>TL;DR: Yeah, curly and straight hair do have different needs. Curly hair needs more moisturizing than straight hair</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are actually chemical differences in shampoos and conditioners which benefit curly and dry hair, but <em>a lot of the time</em> it's just BS marketing.  As other have said, dry and curly hair has less oil and needs to be moisturized more.  Just from my personal research, having dry and curly hair, it's best to avoid harsh sulfates, which are used in most shampoos, because sulfates will strip more oil from your hair and make it drier.  Just the same though, you'll find that a lot of shampoos marketed towards curly and dry hair, still have sulfates in them.  I've also read that it's best to avoid dimethicone in conditioners, because it will attach to your hair and build-up.  It will make your hair look more moisturized at first, but as it builds up, you'll eventually have to resort to a sulfate shampoo, to strip it all again...which will set you back to having really dry hair.  You can find shampoos without sulfates and conditioners without dimethicone, but you have to hunt for them and just because a brand is marketed as &quot;for dry or coarse hair&quot; doesn't mean it's free of these chemicals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Due to my daughter having curly hair and me having straight and therefore no idea how to handle her hair, I am frequenting /r/curlyhair. I have learned she needs to use shampoo infrequently, and all her hair products should be silicone-free! Has to do with the fact that curly hair is generally dryer than straight, I think.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There CAN be a difference, but a lot of companies will rely on you not knowing your cosmetic ingredients, and will use the same formula with a few additives changed to sell to you “specialized” products. Finding products with actually tailored formulas can be difficult and you probably won’t see too much of a difference between drugstore/pharmacy brands.
(Source: worked in a curly-specialized salon with a woman who was neurotic about ingredients. Actually did INCI labelling for our in-house products.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Only partially related, but hairs can have a variety of different structures, which are also heavily related to ethnicity.</p>
<p>Most asians have round section hair, so their hairs are more straight and glossier.</p>
<p>Most europeans have oval section hair, which tend to be more fizzy looking and less glossy.</p>
<p>African, black people instead have &quot;bean&quot; section hair, which tend to have the classic &quot;afro&quot; look.</p>
<p>The degree of wavyness depends instead on how the hair follicle (underskin part where a hair grow) is shaped and tilted: if it's perpendicular and straight follicles make for straight hairs, while tilted and curve follicles produce curly hair, with everything in between.</p>
<p>Different skins also produce different amounts of oils and fats, so i assume that different shampoos have different purposes, just not at the absurd degrees ads seem to suggest.</p>
