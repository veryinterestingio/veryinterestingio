		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd also like to point out that there's no way there's 50k amps going through that.  Even if the wrench had a resistance of 0.001 ohms, that would still be over 2 million watts and the whole thing would have instantly vaporized.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because where the wires touch is a small area, smaller than the center of the wrench, so the metal nearest the wires has less material through which the current can flow and more resistance than the center of the wrench. </p>
<p>This is magnified by the fact that iron has a positive temperature coefficient (as it heats up its resistance goes up). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>first note, on the top it doesn't start glowing where the cable touches.</p>
<p>It starts glowing where the cross section of the wrench is the smallest.  Between the wrench end and the raised and stamped boss going down the middle.</p>
<p>Simply put, that is the location with the highest resistance.  </p>
<p>A reminder of ohms law, volts=current <em> resistance.  power = volts </em> current.</p>
<p>The wrench sees the same current along its length, but the narrowest spots(higher resistance) have the largest voltage drop, and are consuming the most power, and start glowing first.</p>
<p>Though often a bad connection will heat up too (and the copper mass of the cables may aid in cooling the contact points in this case).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJOX0c60wQE#t=8m45s" target="_blank">this other wrench later in the source video</a>, which melts from the middle <em>outward</em>, just the opposite of the phenomenon being asked about. As a scientist, before answering a &quot;why does [blah] happen?&quot; question, it's crucial to make sure that [blah] is an actual phenomenon and not a fluke, etc. Otherwise your explanation probably doesn't succeed at distinguishing reality from its alternatives, namely, is a bad explanation.</p>
<p>The other comments aren't wrong, but miss part of the story, that the order in which parts of the wrench heat up seems to depend delicately on the wrench geometry, and probably invisible material flaws inside the wrench.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe the way this wrench heats up simply has to do with the way the electricity is pushed into it. Those cables are just pushed onto it, contact will be bad and rather high-resistance, so those spots do heat up first. As they heat up, their resistance grows, they heat up further and also heat the material next to them, raising the resistance there too, causing further heating, further increase of resistance, and the effect migrates inwards from the ends where contact was first made.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
