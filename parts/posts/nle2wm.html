		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the beginning the universe was extremely hot. It was so hot that originally protons and neutrons were not stable, and if they formed would immediately break into their constituent quarks. As the universe expanded it cooled down, and at some point was cool enough to reliably form protons and neutrons. The early universe was also extremely dense, so now you've got a lot of free protons and neutrons bumping into each other. They could combine briefly, but everything was still so hot that these early atoms were unstable and would just fly apart.</p>
<p>After expanding/cooling a little more, suddenly protons and neutrons could bind together into the first stable atoms. If a proton and a neutron bumped into each other they could combine to form H^2. If a proton and H^2 bumped into each other, they could combine to form He^3. If H^2 and He^3 bumped into each other they could form He^4 (while losing an extra proton). </p>
<p>So the earliest atoms were formed just as the universe cooled, through random interactions such as described above. This process is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis" target="_blank">Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis</a></p>
<p>However, this process was not open-ended. In particular, there were very few atoms formed with atomic weight greater than 4, and virtually no atoms formed with atomic weight greater than 7. This has been called the &quot;mass-5 roadblock.&quot;</p>
<p>The reason for the roadblock is that there are no stable isotopes of atomic mass 5. If you take an atom of He^4 and add a proton then you get an atom of Li^5, which is highly radioactive and decays back to He^4 nearly instantly. If you take He^4 and add a neutron you get He^5, which is similarly unstable and decays back to He^4. </p>
<p>Thus, the only way to get atomic mass 6 and 7 atoms in the early universe is to &quot;jump over&quot; the mass 5 isotopes. This can be done through the relatively rarer reactions of H^2 and He^4 to form Li^6, then H^3 and He^4 to form Li^7, and He^3 and He^4 to form Be^7.</p>
<p><a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Astro/mass5w.html" target="_blank">Mass 5 Roadblock</a></p>
<p>There is a similar roadblock at mass-8, and the mass 6 and 7 isotopes in the early universe were already thousands of times less abundant than elemental hydrogen, so any isotopes of greater than mass 8 were only produced in vanishingly small quantities, if they were produced at all. </p>
<p>To answer your second question, &quot;How do we know that?&quot; The basic answer is that the above model appears correct but is incomplete. The reactions given above occur with different probabilities, and we can test these probabilities experimentally in the lab. This is well understood nuclear physics. Then, given those probabilities we can use the above model to make predictions about the relative abundance of elements we should observe in the universe. In particular, we can look at the spectra of other stars to determine their relative proportions of hydrogen, helium, and lithium. </p>
<p>For any of you cosmology geeks out there- this is a pretty cool result. Big Bang Nucleosynthesis only occurred around 10-20 seconds after the Big Bang, after which the universe was too cool for spontaneous fusion to occur, so these proportions are assumed to be relatively frozen at that point. The observations of elemental abundance in stars gives us a snapshot of the early universe back to 20 seconds after the Big Bang. In contrast, the universe only became transparent around 380,000 years after the Big Bang, so this is one way that scientists have been able to peer back past that transparency transition and the much vaunted Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). </p>
<p>The results of such observations are that the proportions of hydrogen and helium are exactly as expected. However, the values we observe for lithium are far lower than would be expected. This is known as the &quot;lithium problem&quot; in cosmology, and there are many hypotheses as to the cause, but so far there are no conclusive results. It could be that the above model is correct, but some secondary effect consumed a lot of lithium in the early universe, or it could be that the above model is somehow incorrect, even though it's based on a solid modern understanding of nuclear physics. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From about 1915 to 1926, work was done which showed that all the galaxies around us, were moving away from us - and that the speed with which they moved was proportionate to how far away they are.    That observation alone implies the were all at the same starting point, at a finite time in the past.   </p>
<p>This turned out to be consistent with the newly proposed (1915) theory of General Relativity - which , prior to this, had the problem that it couldn't produce an infinite-age, static (non-expanding or collapsing) universe.  </p>
<p>This leads to the conclusion that, as you trace time going backwards, the Universe gets denser, and hotter; inevitably, at some point, the universe is so dense and hot, that the light elements we see around us would break apart, first into their constituent neutrons and protons, and then those break apart into their constituent quarks.  </p>
<p>Now, run the same scene forward in time: as the Universe expands, it becomes less dense, and cooler, and the quarks first join into protons and neutrons, and then these join into the light elements.   In fact, based on the binding energy of these elements, you can predict what the ratio of the density of the lightest elements are to each other -- and it does a *pretty good job of doing that.   </p>
<p>*Note: &quot;Pretty good job&quot; means different things to physicists than it does to, say, a cook.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You are referring to the era of nucleosynthesis/nuclei. There are 2 things to consider. 1.) If it's too early in the universe, you cannot form stable nucleus because a high energy photon just breaks it up into a proton an a neutron (universe is too hot). 2.) If it's too late in the universe, the free protons and neutrons can form stable nuclei, but free neutrons themselves are not that stable themselves, and decay into other things. Between these 2 periods, there is a sweet spot where you can form nuclei without neutrons destroying themselves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>how do we know that</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because the period of forming these nuclei isn't that long, and there is no stellar nucleosynthesis, you can really only form the light elements (isotopes of hydrogen, helium, and lithium). But in principle, as long as you know the baryon-photon ratio*, you can simultaneously predict what the relative abundances of all the light elements are as a function of that ratio. <a href="https://www.einstein-online.info/wp-content/uploads/Kosmologie_Primordiale_Nukleosynthese_%C2%A9_Daniela_Leitner_Markus_Poessel_Einstein-Online-768x1010.jpg" target="_blank">Here's</a> a plot of what that would look like (the ratio is eta), and the observed values of eta and the relative abundances are the vertical and horizontal bars respectively. They generally agree, with the notable exception of lithium.</p>
