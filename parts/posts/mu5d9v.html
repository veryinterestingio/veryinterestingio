		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A thin atmosphere is still an atmosphere, so it works by the same principals helicopters work here on Earth. Mars has famous dust storms, which require air that flows which is important for helicopters and air travel.</p>
<p>Also note Mars has much weaker gravity than Earths, so even though the atmosphere isn't as thick as Earths, a helicopter on Mars doesn't need as much downward force to gain lift. But the key here is generating that lift. </p>
<p>Which turns out is just a (relatively) simple matter of mathematics. Cause the atmosphere is so much thinner, to achieve the lift, the helicopter had to be small and light. Then its rotor-blades had to be longer and spin faster than a craft of equivalent size would need on earth. </p>
<p>The fact is all the stuff <em>required</em> for flight is on Mars, just at different levels, and so we take our knowledge of flight and adjust for those conditions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The TL;DR is they just make it very light and spin the blades very fast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During Ingenuity's flights, the atmosphere on Mars is at best (when it is cooler) 1/70 as dense as that on Earth, and the gravity on Mars is about 38% of that on Earth.</p>
<p>In the first approximation, the power required for a helicopter to hover scales according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_loading" target="_blank">disk actuator theory</a>. According to this calculation, the lower density means that 8.4 times more power (square root of 70) is required, and on the contrary, due to the lower gravity, 4.3 times less (0.38^(1.5)) power is required. So, altogether, we need to buy a factor of two in power to fly on Mars.</p>
<p>We either have to simply expend twice as much power as a model <em>of the same size and mass</em> on Earth, or to increase the diameter of the rotor two-fold while keeping the mass the same, to hover using the same amount of power as a model on Earth. Or we can <em>decrease the mass</em> while keeping the rotor diameter constant. Twice lower mass would allow us to fly with just the 70% of the power of the same size model on Earth.</p>
<p>Mars Helicopter <strong><em>is</em></strong> relatively light for its size, 1.8 kg with the battery -- this is even slightly lighter than most of the comparable size RC model helicopter (1.5-2.5 kg) without battery (the battery can add another kilogram), even though Mars Helicopter has vastly more complicated electronics, much wider rotor blades, and two rotors instead of one.</p>
<p>Note that the width and the number of rotors do not enter into the above calculation -- but they are of course important and determine how much power can be used before the rotor blades stall and loose their efficiency in generating lift. The much wider rotors and the two rotors instead of one allow the relatively small diameter rotors to use a relatively large power (350-500 W) to generate sufficient lift despite very low density of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the same size model helicopters on Earth spin their blades with the same rpm as does Ingenuity (about 2500), but they are able to fly <a href="https://youtu.be/AXSfFLGeVZA?t=299" target="_blank">crazy acrobatic maneuvers</a>, and for that can use around 2 kW of power.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aero Engineer here. Definitely already answered but with helicopters/propellers/fans it all has to do with mass flow rate, which is gas density x area x velocity (like flux for electrodynamics).  If you need constant mass flow to lift the helicopter but with less dense atmosphere, the area or velocity term has to increase. In this case I would guess both larger blades <em>and</em> faster spin. Efficiencies can be further optimized with the the contra-rotating blades to make these changes more subtle.</p>
<p>Edit: just wanted to add the next step in design is the blade shape itself, which can be thought of like a wing. Choosing the best airfoil and planform can optimize the lift at given conditions.  And different given conditions result in different performance; hence the aircraft will have an operational “envelope.”  But that gets into nuance that OP wasn’t exactly asking about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>2500 RPM, that’s 41 2/3 rotations per second, to put it into perspective most Earth helicopters rotate at around 450-500 rpm.</p>
<p>Also some incredible engineering in weight management, the whole craft has a mass of only 1.8 kilograms (≈4 pounds)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
