<p>But the perception of time for insects is different from ours. Imagine everything is in slow motion.</p>
<p>It's not crashing but mild bumping for insects, like we are bumping into other people when you're moving in a large and tightly packed crowd.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>My evidence is working outdoors for more than 10 years.</p>
<p>Big ass dragonflies dgaf.  They monstertruck over all other flying creatures and have no problem bouncing off of people either.</p>
<p>Its led me to the conclusion that while drsgonflies are harmless, they are the total jerks of the flying insect kingdom.  Whenever there are wasp or hornets in the area, dragonflies will fly into my face, my arms, hands, back of neck, bounce off then fly away.</p>
<p>This of course makes me think for a moment that a wasp or something is about to sting me, but nope, just a dragonfly messing me.  I cant prove it, but Im certain that dragonflies not only laugh, but sound like pete puma when they do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
