		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Contrary to how it may be presented in general discussions, your body does not &quot;form&quot; antibodies in response to antigens. Rather, when antibody producing cells differentiate (become antibody producing cells from more general precursor cells) the portion of the genome that is responsible for producing the antibodies undergoes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V(D)J_recombination" target="_blank">dramatic and random rearrangement</a>. So everyone has a large number of B-cells each of which has a (more or less) unique and different antibody sequence. This repertoire of antibodies is not the same across people because of this randomness.</p>
<p>In the process, cells that produce antibodies that bind your own cells are removed. What remains are a collection of cells that produce some large but limited set of antibodies. When an antigen is present one or more of these antibodies may bind weakly to the antigen. Through a complex system of interactions between various immune cells, the B-cells that make that antibody undergo expansion and further mutation. This leads to a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_maturation" target="_blank">affinity maturation</a>. Here the cells mutate their already somewhat working antibodies to be more specific and bind tighter to the antigen, and those that do the best job are kept around and form memory cells. This is the process that takes \~2 weeks from the time the antigen is present to become immune.</p>
<p>Specifically for blood groups, the different blood groups correspond to different sugars that coat a protein on the surface of red blood cells. Glycosylation (addition of sugars) is very species specific (many proteins are glycosylated differently across species even if the proteins themselves are very similar), thus there are generally many sugar-specific antibodies floating around as they had been selected from previous antigen exposures. This means that it is very very likely for a person that was never exposed to A or B antigen to have at least moderately binding anti-A/anti-B antibodies.</p>
<p>TL;DR Antibodies are created through random mutagenesis first and then are selected for activity only after the antigen is seen. This pattern - introduce variation, chose the best variant after selective pressure - is just how evolution works on almost every scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>They are not A, B, or O and can make anti-O. It's rare enough that if you need a transfusion they may need to fly it in from a different continent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The theory I’ve read is that a very small portion of some common microbe(s) resemble our A/B antigens so closely that they more or less “cross react” with those blood types.  </p>
<p>This is in contrast with the standard “post-exposure” antibody development most people are familiar with.</p>
<p>Antibodies are formed against <em>epitopes</em>.  <em>Epitopes</em> are specific areas of protein which are unique and recognizable (like a target to match).</p>
<p>The theory is that microorganisms have <em>epitopes</em> which closely resemble the <em>epitopes</em> from antigens on our red cells.  The one I recall was a common virus that they sequenced and showed how similarly structured the <em>epitope</em> was.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
