I’m wondering why we have to install(?) The disc even if we’re offline. Installing the disk doesn’t even make it available to play while the disc is not in I’m just confused what is installing shouldn’t the disc just run once you put it in ? Thanks</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Games these days are much, much bigger, with gigabytes of textures, sound and so on. They are simply too big to run from temporary memory as they used to.</p>
<p>They install because data access is much faster from a hard drive than an optical disc. You only need the disc in the drive to prove you own the disc. Downloaded games work just fine without the disc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Games are bigger now. Installing from disk prevents you having to constantly be reading data from the disk while playing, which would dramatically hurt performance. You must continue to use the disk after installation as a form of DRM. You can't just give the disk to someone else for free and continue to play.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Playing off the disk would be too slow.  Since a bluray can hold like 50 GB and it reads at like 27MB/s.  So you copy to disk first where reads can reach 100MB/s or faster.  </p>
<p>Then you need to download stuff or patch because the disks are made weeks if not months before the game is actually ready since it takes a while to manufacture, distribute, and put on shelves.  And all people are doing these days are just rushing things out the door asap since competition is high.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's important to note that video game consoles didn't used to have internet. This means that when a video game was shipped to the store shelves, it HAD to be finished and quality checked BEFORE shipping. </p>
<p>Now with internet access, video game developers have the luxury of setting a release deadline and shipping games before the product is actually finished. The disc will include 99% of the game, but developers can finish the game after the disc is manufactured, before the game is delivered to the customer, then require the customer to download updates on release day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the reason is partly because video game companies are manufacturing things in such a way that physical is more inconvenient than digital. They dont want you to be able to sell the game to gamestop when your done and rob them of profit. Also everyone makes more money from a digital game since it's the same price as the physical without any of the costs of producing a disc shipping it all over the world and giving the retailer a cut. Game companies have been trying to do this for at least 20 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
