		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cortisol, known as the &quot;stress hormone&quot;, causes all sorts of inflammatory responses throughout the body, which contribute to the aging effect. When you add in the psychological implications of the trauma (depression, guilt, etc) that change the person's affect, the combined result is that the person seems ages older than they were.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It might be appropriate to mention adverse childhood experiences, or ACEs. </p>
<p>There are some interesting articles on Wikipedia on this and related topics, and TED talks from Sandra Bloom and Nadine Burke Harris.</p>
<p>The basic notion is that childhood trauma can lead to long-term health problems like heart disease, diabetes and stroke.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s definitely stress and cortisol, but also self care. When I had a traumatic birth experience and my daughter was in the hospital for months I feel like I aged 5 years and part of it was I wasn’t taking good care of myself. I didn’t get my hair done or take good care of my skin. I wasn’t exercising or eating great. Those things can age you, appearance-wise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
