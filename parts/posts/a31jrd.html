		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Skydiver here. The water always hits you from the direction you are falling. From the moment you exit the aircraft, you are &quot;falling&quot; forwards at around 70-90 knots typically. That is already fast enough that you will be striking water on the side of you facing the relative wind. From there, the direction of your fall becomes more vertical (referred to as the slope) while constantly accelerating up to terminal velocity. So, you end up catching up to more rain droplets from the direction you are falling. This happens until the parachute is deployed and your descent is slowed sufficiently that rain starts falling faster than you. </p>
<p>I'm avoiding the words belly and back as that can be confusing - it is possible to skydive in many orientations. Belly down is the basic &quot;box man&quot; position, but skydivers also backfly, go head down or head up. Terminal velocity varies from 120-180mph and is dependent on the style of flying. </p>
<p>Skydiving in even just light rain is actually so uncomfortable that your face often turns red from being battered by raindrops (if wearing an open face helmet). It feels like coarse sand thrown at you at 100mph. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming you jumped from below the height of the raincloud, and that the rain drop originated sufficiently high above you to already be falling at their terminal velocity, and that you are bellydown, you'd initially be struck by rain on your back. As you fall and gravity accelerates you, the rate that rain strikes your back slows down, as fewer and fewer rain drops catch up to you. As you approach your terminal velocity, which is faster than that of a raindrop, you'll be catching up to raindrops ahead of you, and they'll strike your front. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Not accounting for any other wild variables, you would be falling into the rain. Whatever side of you is facing down will hit the rain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
