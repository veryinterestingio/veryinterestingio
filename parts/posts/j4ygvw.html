		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedogenesis" target="_blank">Pedogenesis</a>, the process of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil" target="_blank">soil</a> (dirt has no clear definition) formation, on Earth is definitely strongly influenced by a variety of lifeforms (and a wide array of organisms beyond fungi), but it is not solely a biotic process. Weathering is a key component of soil formation as this is breaking down intact rock into smaller pieces (physical weathering) and changing the chemical makeup and/or organization (chemical weathering) of that material. If we consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weathering" target="_blank">weathering</a>, we can see that many of these processes are abiotic (e.g. frost cracking, abrasion, hydrolosis, etc), but some are biotic or biotically mediated (e.g. tree throw, root cracking, bioturbation i.e. burrowing and tunneling, release of various acids by plants, bacteria, and fungi, etc) and most of the processes on Earth somehow involve water.  As described in the pedogenesis wikipedia entry, details of the parent material (i.e. type of rock and minerals present), climate (i.e. amount of water, temperature ranges), topography (i.e. steepness of slopes and ease of transport), and the type of organisms present will all influence the type of soil that forms and the details of that soil (e.g. its thickness, which horizons are present, compositions, etc).</p>
<p>On other planets and moons, there are still a variety of weathering processes that occur which can effectively break down intact rock into soil, though often you will see the term &quot;regolith&quot; used for this material when it is on other planets or moons to distinguish from Earth soil which involves biotic processes and incorporates a fair amount of organic material. Sometimes you will still see this referred to a soil (as it is on Wikipedia), but it's more common in the literature to see it just all called regolith (e.g. <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2005RG000184" target="_blank">Colwell et al, 2007</a>) with &quot;soil&quot; (at least in a lunar context and in this reference) referring to any grain in the lunar regolith greater than 1 cm (though even in this paper they're inconsistent and switch between usage of regolith and soil as synonyms). Sticking with the moon as an example, there are a few <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_soil#Formation_processes" target="_blank">process which form regolith/soil</a> including meteorite impacts, solar wind sputtering, and cosmic ray spallation. If you want a deep dive on lunar regolith/soil formation (and yet another slightly different discussion of usage of the words regolith and soil on the Moon), the <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.251.2682&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank">Lunar Regolith</a> chapter by McKay et al in the Lunar Sourcebook provides a lot of detail.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> - Most rocky planets/moons will have some layer of loose, unconsolidated material blanketing much of their surfaces and which will variably be referred to as soils. The process of forming these soils on Earth is very strongly influenced by the presence of liquid water and a variety of organisms, but it is not solely a biotically mediated process (i.e. it's not just &quot;fungi breaking down rocks&quot;). Soils/regoliths/unconsolidated layers of rock bits can form through abiotic and non-water mediated processes on other rocky bodies, though the end results are decidedly different from what we think of as soil on Earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Soil is the connection between geology and biology. To over simplify it it’s basically a mixture of ground up rock  mixed with organic material like dead animals and plant material. Some rocks are even made from biological material like dolomite and dolostone. A rock made of millions and billions of shells of sea creatures and then compressed deep in the earth into. There are mountains in Italy called “the Dolomites” and where I live in Vermont it is all over.</p>
<p>I guess in the case of dolomite or dolostone you could argue that soul mixture is almost entirely made of organic material.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Soil is quite complicated. </p>
<p>To start, fungi is not the only thing that breaks apart rocks. In some climate, fungi don't readily survive in extreme heat, cold, or dryness.</p>
<p>Here in Central California, we have extreme heat and dry summers which isn't conducive to fungi. The famous tumbleweeds are actually intolerant of fungi, when we get our rain in the fall, then fungi will penetrate and rot their roots causing the plant to break off and tumble. The tumbleweed is a hybridized plant, but one of it's parents was from Siberia where it was too cold to have fungi. </p>
<p>A big part of healthy soil is not mineral based, but organic matter. Leaves, wood, animals, and other life falls on the ground and rots away. This can biodegrade into rich soil.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
