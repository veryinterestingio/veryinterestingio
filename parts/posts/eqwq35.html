		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Insects most definitely do have microbiomes, and this has been a fairly rapidly growing area of research in recent years.  For example, termites completely rely on gut symbiotes (including both eukaryotes and bacteria) to be able to digest wood, and there's been some interesting studies on how the evolution of these microbes tracks the evolution of their hosts (or rather, how it doesn't; see <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)30037-X" target="_blank">Bourguignon et al. 2018</a>).  Plenty of other insects have also been the subjects of microbiome studies, including bees, which have relevant microbiomes both within their bodies and within their food provisions.  The effect of various pesticides on bee microbiomes has been the subject of a fair number of studies (e.g. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/115/41/10305" target="_blank">Motta et al. 2018</a>).</p>
<p>As for the second part of your question, there isn't that much available research on this yet, but I did find one interesting study by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-29032-2" target="_blank">Stull et al. 2018</a>.  These researchers did find significant differences in microbiome composition in their treatment group of humans who ate cricket flour, mostly just due to <a href="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-29032-2/MediaObjects/41598_2018_29032_Fig5_HTML.png?as=webp" target="_blank">increases or decreases in the proportions of certain types of bacteria</a> compared to their control group.  However, these are all bacteria that naturally occur within humans, so the implication isn't that the subjects got new bacteria from crickets, but rather that certain gut bacteria just do better or worse under that particular diet.  Though obviously in this case the crickets were heavily processed and quite far from being alive, so I'm not sure if that would change anything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly related, but even plants have a microbiome of sorts. There are special <del>fungi</del> fungal relationships called mycorrhizae around the roots of certain trees/higher order plants that facilitate nutrient uptake. At a certain point you find out biology is just a nesting doll that builds on whatever works, with no regard for whether the advantage comes through hosting another organism. Thus, we find an insane amount of these examples in nature, gut microbiomes being one of the many. It is suspected even mitochondria started as a prokaryotic/bacterial symbiont that has now genetically degraded to the point that it is more like an organ within each cell. Another case of one creature &quot;feeding&quot;/supplying &quot;nutrients&quot; to another, just on a more microscopic scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Part of insects and nematodes.  It is often symbiotic.</p>
<p>A lot of the danger of nematode (worms) infection in mammals may be an immune response to <em>wolbachia</em> in the worms.</p>
<p>One strategy of killing nematodes like heartworms inside mammals is to use an antibiotic that targets <em>wolbachia</em>.  Some nematodes cannot survive without it in their microbiome and will decline and eventually die off.</p>
<p>This avoids using more toxic chemicals that kill the nematodes directly, and may prevent a crisis where the nematodes die off suddenly and decay, exposing the immune system with a flood of <em>wolbachia</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes insects have bacteria. That is pretty well established.</p>
<p>On the second part, eating anything will affect your gut microbiome as it changes the chemistry in there. Though I am not sure if bacteria from insects you eat will occupy your gut I (PhD candidate in microbiology)can hyothesize. When bacteria enters your gut it must &quot;fight&quot; with other bacteria already in your gut for space and nutrition. So the answer will be, it depends. Are your gut microbiome stable enough to prevent other bacteria from taking residence. And in most cases, there will be temporary disturbance and your microbiome will eventually go back to how it was before new bacteria came in. It's unlikely the insect microbiome will take up forever residence in there. Good question though!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I'm currently working with Drosophila (fruit flies) and their microbiome is largely dependend on their food intake, but they can have a stable microbiome if they dine of the same food for a while. I don't think think that eating live insects are going to change a humans microbiome, the present microbiome in humans is usually quite resistant against newly introduced bacteria unless you're sick or on heavy antibiotics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
