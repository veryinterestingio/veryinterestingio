		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's important here to distinguish between grammatical gender and biological gender. Grammatical gender describes what rules a specific word follows in the grammar of that language. Biological gender describes living things that reproduce sexually by splitting in two separate genders. Despite the name the two aren't strictly related. </p>
<p>Grammatical genders are more akin to word classes: words in the same class will behave in similar ways, such as declining and conjugating after similar rules, using similar adjectives when described in a sentence (i.e all blue masculine words in Icelandic are &quot;blár&quot;, all blue feminine objects are &quot;blá&quot;, all neuter blue things &quot;blátt&quot;), or take a specific determinate forms (i.e la vs le in french). </p>
<p>So grammatical genders are a description of how a word behaves, not the other way around. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Historical perspective</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We frankly don't know for sure. Some theories suggest that genders initially started as classes to separate inanimate and animate objects, Later feminine and masculine split due signify a group of things, and words that didn't properly fit with the other two classes. </p>
<p>There are some evidence that genders slightly increase comprehension and comprehension speed of a sentence, as well as slightly reducing ambiguity, but research seems to be situational. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>How is it decided for new words.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By observing how people use the word. Remember: Gender isn't imposed from on high by an absolute authority.  it's a handy box that we use to group similar words together. If the new words is displaying characteristics of either gender we put it in that gender. People will morph new words so that they fit in with the grammar and don't sound stiff and unnatural, and during this morphing process people decide if the new word sounds better as masculine, feminine, or neuter (or other genders some languages might have).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what other people have said, Proto-Indo-European is the ancestor for a lot of the modern-day languages spoken (as the name suggests) in Europe and India. The PIE language is generally believed to have sorted nouns into three classes: masculine, feminine, and neuter. If you look at today's most widely-spoken Indo-European languages, you'll find a lot of the well-known examples of grammatical gender, descended from the original PIE classification system:</p>
<ul>
<li>German, Russian, and Marathi still have the full three-way distinction.</li>
<li>Spanish, Portuguese, Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi, French, and Italian distinguish masculine/feminine but have lost the neuter class.</li>
<li>English has lost the gender distinction in nouns but preserves it in pronouns (he/she/it).</li>
<li>Bengali and Persian have lost gender distinctions entirely.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For some languages it might have been based on observations of the world and to make communication more clear, but in other languages it was more a result of cultural norms. Some languages even have more than two genders, too.</p>
<p>As far as how the gender of new words is decided - they can look at how people talk about it and decline it already and go off of what's popular, or they can look at the word itself and see which gender it would match up with just based on how it ends. In Russian for example, words that end in a consonant are masculine. Since the word &quot;computer&quot; ends in a consonant (in Russian), it was logical to treat it like a masculine noun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When reading or listening to someone speak, you have to recognize a word as corresponding to some meaning that you know. But you know lots of meanings, and so that process of finding the appropriate one takes time. When words are marked into explicit categories (e.g., male/female, future/past/present, thing/action), the process of finding the correct meaning becomes easier on average because it reduces the number of meanings you have to search through. Gender's only important insofar as it presents a distinction that cuts the number of options in half. As new words enter a language, they will in turn re-shape the language and language use to keep that process efficient.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
