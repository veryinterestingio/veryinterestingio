		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It does not have zero calories. The energy content is 66 Calories/100 grams.</p>
<p>Labeling law allows that food that contains less than 5 calories per serving. 5 calories would be 7.5 grams of mustard but when I looked at single-serving packaging online the size I found was 5.5 grams. So less than 5 calories and can be labeled as zero.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It is possible that the stuff you can consume has zero calories.  Water is an example. You can't metabolize it for energy, it is in fact the result of normal metabolism for food alongside carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>There is other stuff like dietary fiber that have zero calories for human and is a part of the food we eat. The fibers are too long for us to break down and extract the sugar so they pass trou us. Other animals like cows can break it down with the help of bacteria. They can live on grass but you can not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is also the fact that if it is less than 5/calories per serving, they are allowed to round down to zero.</p>
<p>This is why some packages that have both per serving and per container facts on it may say 0 calories per serving but 15 calories per box.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Eat all 75 of them and you have consumed 73 calsâ€¦ it is a minders day mystery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Calories are a count of how much energy your body can extract from the food. There's plenty of things you can safely consume that your body isn't capable of extracting any energy from, like water. </p>
<p>Or in the case of something like mustard, there's some stuff you can get energy from but not a ton so they can round the calories per serving down to 0 if they use a small serving size.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
