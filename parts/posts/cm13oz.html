		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Osmosis.  If you have a higher salt concentration in the water than in the fluid the bacteria are swimming around in, it will force some liquid out (and some salt in) and relieve the pressure from the fluid buildup.  Also antiseptic like was said above.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I struggled with a wart on my finger for three years and nothing would make it go away, until I went on vacation to Hawaii and the ocean water just made it fall off.  It’s been 12 years and it hasn’t come back.  Salt water is magic</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the case of an ingrown toenail, soaking it in a warm bath with Epsom salts softens the skin. Softer skin will move out of the way so you can either trim the nail or let it grow out past the spot where it was trying to grow into your toe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a biologist I find it unlikely that it is killing bacteria in any really amazing levels.</p>
<p>I think it is more likely to have what we call a <em>bacteriostatic</em> effect--it simply prevents growth of new bacteria. And that allows your own immune system to fight a fair fight and take care of the problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
