		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I answered a very similar question recently. So I'll take the liberty of plagiarizing myself:</p>
<p>Genealogical companies that trace your ancestry use ambiguous terminology to make you think they're that good. The methods they are not so reliable, and vary greatly from company to company.</p>
<p>Roughly how it works is, they get your DNA, they take a look at a large number of locations on your genome, locations thought to vary between ethnic groups. Then they compare your results to a reference library, basically a DNA database, that they built over time. They build such libraries by different methods that aren't really that clear, because they don't disclose too much information about it. But the general idea is that they go around the world and take the DNA of people with deep roots in a given region like a bunch of families that are known to have been in one region for a long time. They find similarities between these people at those locations on the genome or &quot;loci&quot; and they Label these common denominators as a marker for a given region.</p>
<p>So as you can see, the results they give you are only as good as the accuracy of their reference library. And this library is built with not so accurate methods (like partially with self reports for example, a family could say oh we're hardcore Scots, we been living in this land for a thousand years, but too many people want to believe that about themselves, doesn't make it true). Sometimes a whole group of people who lived in region A for thousands of years migrate to another region B a couple centuries ago and stay there, they still make it to the reference library as people of region B. So that's one giant problem with their approach, another is that they look at a limited number of locations in your genome, they don't sequence the whole thing that would be too expensive. So they're missing a lot of info. That's another issue. Yet another problem is they use mathematical algorithms to actually compute percentages based on your results but the algorithms are kept hidden as a &quot;trade secret.&quot; So we don't even know how good their algorithm is.</p>
<p>So when you get results that say you're 30 percent British, it doesn't necessarily mean one third of your DNA came from there. It just means 30% of the locations in your DNA they looked at, they think are quite common in Britain, because the people they first looked at in Britain think of themselves as very British. People migrate way more than you think, and these &quot;markers&quot; of a given area, are just statistical estimates, these markers could also exist elsewhere, they have not looked everywhere on the globe.</p>
<p>Edit: Wow, I comment on many ELI5 posts, first one I get silver for, thank you kind redditors. There's an overwhelming amount of replies, it will take some time to respond to them. I'm at work, but I'll try to get back to you guys asap. Just a few quick clarifications though:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The results these companies give you are likely to be accurate, qualitatively (where you could have roots from) but not quantitatively (how much of your family tree originates from a given region, percentages). I'm a scientist, so when something is inaccurate quantitatively, I dismiss it altogether. So that's a point to bear in mind.</p>
</li>
<li>I gave the example of self reporting to emphasize the magnitude of error that could contaminate their results. But they obviously use other methods to establish their ref library, such as registered records and family trees in governmental bodies and databases.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Second part to the question: and do they all go back the same amount of time for where I'm &quot;from&quot;.</p>
<p>What I mean is, right now ancestry says I'm british and Irish back to about the 1600's. I'm sure if you went back another 500 years, I'd be from another part of Europe, etc.</p>
<p>Do the ancestry sites all go back to a certain time period?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not just based on your DNA, but based on millions of samples from all over the world.   </p>
<p>They have a huge database of DNA and from some of those they knkw where they are from, and by analyzing that data they can see that certain combinations of genes are more common in certain areas, and from there they can eventually draw conclusions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
