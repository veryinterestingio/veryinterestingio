This explains variations in altitude within a reasonable range above the surface, but in the interior gravity drops off and eventually goes to zero. Is there a point where pressure ceases to increase or does it continue all the way down?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It will continue to increase. If you dug a hole to the center, the gravity acting on the air at the bottom of the hole would be near zero, but the air higher above would continue to press down on you. The pressure would grow slower and slower, but it would continue to grow.</p>
<p>It may help to imagine a planet made entirely out of air. The sphere is kept together by gravity, in a way, all air is &quot;trying&quot; to go to the middle, but all of it can't get there, because it's already too &quot;crowded&quot; down there (i.e. high density and high pressure). If you were to venture into the middle of this sphere, you'd feel being squished from all directions as all the air is being pulled towards you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Getting the actual numerical pressure profile would require a fair amount of effort and assumptions because it depends not only on the gravity profile, but of course also on the air itself. Hydrostatic pressure is given by density times gravitational acceleration times column height (if g is constant with height; otherwise we need to use the differential form). The gravity profile with depth is of course not known for certain but can be estimated to reasonable accuracy by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preliminary_reference_Earth_model" target="_blank">using existing models</a>. Something you may find interesting given your interest in the subject question is that gravitational acceleration does not simply decrease linearly with depth as the shell theorem would suggest for a sphere of uniform density. Instead, it is constant or increasing with depth all the way down to slightly over half the Earth's radius because of the increasing density of the Earth with increasing depth. </p>
<p>So we have g as a function of height and can use that to calculate hydrostatic pressure, but what about density? The air changes in density as it changes in pressure, so the pressure depends on the density and the density depends on the pressure. Further complicating the calculation is that the temperature of the air will certainly increase substantially with increasing depth, with its own impacts on pressure and density, and that almost certainly the air will no longer be reasonably assumed to be an ideal gas for most of the depth of the Earth. And when we talk about a hole bored to the center of the Earth, when was the hole bored? There will be  very significant convection driven by the geothermal gradient for a very long time after such a hole mysteriously appears.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we don't need an explicit pressure profile to answer your question. At static equilibrium (assuming for the moment that static equilibrium is reached by the time we care about the pressure profile), the column of air ending at the center of the Earth has a positive gravitational acceleration value all the way down to the very center, so it always has some positive weight and therefore always contributes to increasing pressure in the air below it. As a result, we can conclude that the pressure profile will have pressure increasing with depth all the way to the center of the Earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The barometric relation is dP/dz = -ρG, where P is pressure, z is the vertical distance (measured from the Earth's center, say), ρ = ρ(z) is the height-dependent air density, and G = G(z) is the height-dependent gravitational acceleration. So we &quot;just&quot; need to integrate dP = -ρ(z)G(z) dz.</p>
<p>The simplest model for G(z) is a linear increase with increasing z: G(z) = gz/r, where g is the gravity at the surface and r is Earth's radius.</p>
<p>The simplest model for ρ(z) is the ideal gas law, ρ(z) = P/RT(z), where R is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_constant#Specific_gas_constant" target="_blank">specific gas constant</a> for air and T(z) is the depth-dependent temperature.</p>
<p>Plug in your favorite function for T(z), or simplify the problem substantially (with corresponding expected loss of accuracy) by taking an effective average such as 1500 K.</p>
<p>Thus, we have dP/P = -gz/rRT(z) dz. Analytically or numerically integrate. If you make the assumption of constant T, we have</p>
<p>ln P_0/P = -g(r-z)^(2)/2rRT, where P_0 is atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p>This gives P = P_0 exp[g(r-z)^(2)/2rRT] = P_0 exp[gr/2RT] at the center of the Earth, which is...very large, to a point that the ideal gas law assumption fails because the air has condensed. I'll stop here for now, but this gives you a sense of what the calculations would look like. Please let me know if you see any errors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
