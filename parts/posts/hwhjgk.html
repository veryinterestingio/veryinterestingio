<p>I can do this on either hand. It just takes practice. </p>
<p>My wife hates the tapping, which is why I bothered to practice it both ways to begin with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your pinky and ring finger are connected to a certain extent.</p>
<p>You can test that by bending your pinky to touch your palm.It is basically impossible without also moving your ring finger.</p>
<p>When you tap down with your pinky your ring finger automatically moves with it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think any of the answers here are correct. </p>
<p>I just tried this and what I noticed is that when my hand is rested on the table in a relaxed position, and I lift my palm slightly so that my fingers are not touching the table, the natural position of my fingers is such that the pinky is closest to the table, the ring finger is a bit farther, and the index finger is the furthest away. This is because, at least for me, the resting position of my pinky is more curled than my index.</p>
<p>Therefore, when I simply plop my fingers back down in the table with the least amount of effort, the pinky finger naturally touches the table first, followed by the ring, middle and lastly index.</p>
<p>In order to reverse the order I would have to actively move my fingers instead of just letting them fall on their own, or rotate my wrist in an uncomfortable way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am assuming this has to do with how the tendons in your fingers work together. The first two are able to bend somewhat independently of the other fingers, but your pinky especially can’t really do that, as it’s meant to help grip objects and such. Bending your pinky moves your other fingers more than bending any other finger. </p>
<p>So I may be wildly off base here, but it seems like the other comment is likely on to something. Bending your pinky first basically bring the other fingers along with it, instead of doing it the other way around have having to make some extra effort to get all your fingers down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
