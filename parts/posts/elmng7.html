<p>I figured colds and flu tend to travel pretty far and wide and wouldn’t vary much place to place.</p>
<p>However several people have suggested that my immune system is less equipped for variants here.</p>
<p>I’d love to know if it’s just been bad luck or if it’s just going to take a while to adjust.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes you are being exposed to variants you aren't yet immune to.  However there are other factors. If you are in a place, like a transport hub where there are loads of people bringing in new strains of disease you will get ill more often, also the environment can weaken your immune system, so if the climate is harsher or if there is more pollution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the things about colds is that they aren't all caused by the same virus, or even the same family of viruses. Adenoviruses, coronaviruses, and rhinoviruses, among others, can ALL cause colds. The viruses can absolutely differ from one region of the world to another, and this could well be why you're getting sick more frequently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Right at the top they will talk about the different strains of influenza going around and you can watch maps of the US and drag the time bar to watch the flu spread across the US.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the page, you can click on individual states and see the percentages of what flu strains are going around. Might help you compare two areas</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
