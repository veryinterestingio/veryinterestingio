		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have already pointed out &quot;unions&quot; but that's only one side of the story. The other side is insurance and cost.</p>
<p>Basically insurance wants some other person to blame to reduce costs when something happens. And that human just doesn't cost much.</p>
<p>I just looked it seems coal is about $33.72 per ton at the mine, and $39.09 delivered. I'll just take this as gospel, and it is one of the cheapest things I could think of that gets rail shipped long distances.</p>
<p>Each train engine can pull 14,000 tons. I've seen trains with up to 5 engines. For a total train weight of 70,000 tons. </p>
<p>This gives $2.3604 Million for the train value at the mine, and $2.763.3 Million delivered. The delivery fee is $375,900.</p>
<p>Let's also say it takes a month for the longest train trip (it is much lower), so the train is worth $4.5 Million a year in delivery fees. Even if we assume the operator makes $100k a year (and I'm certain they make less) there is only about a 2% boost in train value per year. That just isn't that much difference.</p>
<p>Since the insurance for the operatored train costs less, it simply isn't worth the fight to remove the operator. And remember making it full automatic would require investing money, for effectively no gain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hard to explain to a five year old...</p>
<p>There are several reasons.</p>
<p>If you go cbtc (communications based train control) for a goa (grade of automation) 2 (automated driving but start and doors are controlled by driver), 3 (same as two but controlled by a person on the train not constantly sitting in  the cab) or 4 (full automation) you have to upgrade your entire line or it gets really messy. You need wayside equipment for that (Wi-Fi to feed the train orders, positioning systems so the train knows where it is and the operations control knows where the train is) and equip your trains for it.</p>
<p>You can not pick and chose parts. Mostly you are bound to one provider and buy the entire package from them. Interoperability is a future goal but not yet achieved.</p>
<p>So it is mostly used in new lines or if a line reached the end of its life cycle and would need a major overhaul anyway. Afaik there are quite a lot built and planned. Mostly in China and the middle east, though. It is just a huge undertaking and was hard to do with mixed operation (old and new for a time) in the past. But it seems there was a lot of progress made. But that is also a reason why it is mostly reserved for metros and people movers. If you have for example mixed use (light rail/freight rail/high speed rail) it becomes a nightmare to have everything that goes through equipped and tracked. </p>
<p>Additionally there are safety concerns. The lines have to be separate from anything or at least they had to in the past. Nowadays we can make sure the tracks are secure and free with radar or laser technology for example. But the best things are subways or above grade rails on pillars or some other elevated inaccessible railway. There are also solutions where the trains are operating automated where the are separate and by a driver on sight at lower speeds where they are not.</p>
<p>In general operation and building cost are still higher than for more simple forms of operation and it only really makes sense if you need to realise very low headways (time between trains) and transport massive numbers of passengers. So it is usually the busiest lines.</p>
<p>I am not an expert on the subject but I did/do work with some. Therefore my knowledge might be at times imprecise or just outdated. Feel free to inquire further. I can not however give any information about specific projects, I think.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on which trains you're talking about and where you are.</p>
<p>If you mean like a Metro / Skytrain, those are unmanned in a lot of places. For those that aren't, the older and more used it is, the more difficult it is to replace or update it. Driverless trains require more than just a smart train, the tracks need to be adjusted to accommodate for them; sensors, proper fencing, etc. </p>
<p>Unions and already deeply rooted companies / people, also don't like it when technology advances and replaces or undercuts them. It's why fossil fuels are still widely used in some 1st world countries that have better, cheaper and safer alternatives. It also seems to be a US problem, a lot of Asian countries, Canada, and European countries have mostly automated trains.</p>
<p>If you mean locomotive style trains, it's because those tracks don't have a lot of the protections the transit sort of trains do, and there is often great value in the train itself as well as it's cargo.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
