		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The fact of the matter is that modern medicine doesn't know exactly what's going on at a biological level that connects testosterone and sex drive. But, it's been observed that a lower testosterone level results in a lower sex drive and vice versa.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My experience as a 50 year old male. High testosterone does not guarantee a high libido. I have had high test (&gt;50 nmoL) and very low estrogen (&lt;20 nmoL). I used to joke with my doctor that if Delta Goodrem (the most beautiful woman in the world IMHO) came knocking on my door on a Saturday night wearing sexy red lingerie and said let's go Bert I am up for everything and anything I would have to reply &quot;Sorry not tonight&quot;.
I was functional but had zero libido. I have experienced low and there is zero. Zero feels weird and after time dreadful. I felt less than human.
Libido can be affected by numerous hormones but is also a brain wiring issue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very basic explanation, but testosterone in the bloodstream converts to DHT, or dihydrotestosterone, which is responsible for genital growth and arousal as well as male pattern baldness among other things. Some of the testosterone in the blood converts to DHT; the more testosterone, the more DHT can be produced.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are receptors in your sex organs and sexual circuitry in your brain that respond to testosterone by ramping up those organs’ response to sexual stimuli. There’s probably no special reason testosterone was chosen for this task as opposed to any other molecule, but that’s the molecule we and most other species evolved with. The general purpose of having a masculinization hormone is to create the necessary sexual dimorphism between the males and females of the species (estrogen being the equivalent feminizing hormone in females). In addition to contributing to sexual functioning, testosterone also develops other sexual traits like deeper voice, stronger muscles, and increased body hair in men—traits that advertise their maleness to the rest of the species and help them fulfill their male role. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
