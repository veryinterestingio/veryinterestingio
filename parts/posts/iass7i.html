		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure which animals you’re referring to but different animals have different reasons for this. Gulls, for example, pound on the ground to make worms think it’s raining, and then they catch the worms as they come up for a drink. </p>
<p>Other animals “dance” for mating purposes, or for communication.</p>
<p>Humans tap dance because their mom made them when they were 7 and never really lost interest since.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s part learned behavior part a way to let out some frustration.</p>
<p>The learned behavior part is they see you react to it in a positive way and possibly give more pets/treats for the tippy tapping. This positive reinforcement makes them more likely to do the behavior again.</p>
<p>The letting out frustration is basically them anticipating being happy, and the anticipation makes them frustrated so they move to get rid of it. I suppose it could almost be considered a displacement activity. It’s the same a children jumping for joy when you give them a toy. Extreme excitement and no knowledge of how to contain it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Some dog breeds have a natural prancing walk, and other dogs will prance when excited. Usually to get other dogs to play with them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes dogs are trying to balance between a command or training and their excitement. If you've told them to sit, and they know they might get a treat, they might have so much giddiness that they tippy tap. They might do the same, or get zoomies, if they know they are not supposed to jump on people, but are excited to see them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
