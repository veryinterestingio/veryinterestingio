		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water content and surface. Tortillas are very dry and flat, so there's no water and very little space to grow for mould. Sliced bread has more water and because of all the yeast air bubbles and being sliced has a lot of surface for the mould to latch onto.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Food spoils due to many factors, mainly the amount of preservatives, moisture and air levels and temperature. If the preservatives are the same in both, then I would say that the higher amount of moisture and air in bread is the cause. </p>
<p>In any case, keeping it in the fridge will extend both products lifespan, although it is recommended to keep bread in an airtight bag at room temperature for best quality. Tortillas seem to be fine in the fridge, and can stay good for weeks!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
