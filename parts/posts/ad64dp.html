		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Commercially grown bananas are genetically identical and originated from a single source not that long ago. They are seedless clones, so are all the same. Apple's have thousands of varieties and have been cultivated for centuries for this variation.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While there are 1,000 or so varieties of wild bananas, 95% banana exports are one single variety called Cavendish. </p>
<p>The Cavendish is a seedless breed so every offspring that is produced is a clone of the previous generation.</p>
<p>That means every banana you eat is pretty much identical to the last so the taste is the same.</p>
<p>The same happens with some varieties of other fruits as well. Granny Smith apples are all clones as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
