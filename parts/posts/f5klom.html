		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While Saturn will be in the habitable zone and Titan along with it you have to think of how these worlds will be affected by the increase in temperature. The average density of Titan suggests it is a good mix of rock and ice, so with an increase in radiation from the sun, most of the methane will be lost to space and the ice might melt, but that much ice may mean a water world (covered in ocean). Titan is tidally locked to Saturn and orbits ~16days, so its days are ~16 Earth days. This would mean wild temperature variations between day/night sides. Also, Titan does not have its own magnetic field so maintaining an atmosphere is not promising. It does get some protection from Saturnâ€™s mag field, but it also ventures outside of it and gets blasted by the solar wind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One issue with trying to establish habitation around a red giant star is the unpredictable variable nature. There may be periods of time where certain orbits will be in the habitable zone, but this goal post could swing around wildly depending on how active the star is over time. A small change in solar output could be absolutely devastating to any attempt at making a stable ecosystem on an outer planet moon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
