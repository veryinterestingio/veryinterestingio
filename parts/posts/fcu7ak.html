		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure about insects, but a study has shown that there is some correlation between the development of highly-advanced vision in primates and the amount of deadly snakes present in the areas they developed. This is known as Snake Detection Theory.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/110/47/19000" target="_blank">https://www.pnas.org/content/110/47/19000</a></p>
<p>The study suggests that part of the longevity of primate species is due to our evolving a highly-specialized threat detection system through our vision. It explains why primates evolved vision that is second only to birds of prey, instead of other senses (such as smell) that are a lot more common to be found highly-developed in other animal species.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The present study shows preferential activity of neurons in the medial and dorsolateral pulvinar to images of snakes. Pulvinar neurons responded faster and stronger to snake stimuli than to monkey faces, monkey hands, and geometric shapes, and were sensitive to unmodified and low-pass filtered images but not to high-pass filtered images. These results identify a neurobiological substrate for rapid detection of threatening visual stimuli in primates. Our findings are unique in providing neuroscientific evidence in support of the Snake Detection Theory, which posits that the threat of snakes strongly influenced the evolution of the primate brain. This finding may have great impact on our understanding of the evolution of primates.&quot;</p>
