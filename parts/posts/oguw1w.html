		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are a bunch of cosmologists from the Cosmology from Home 2021 conference. Ask us anything, from our daily research to the organization of a large conference during COVID19!</p>
<p>We have some special experts on</p>
<ul>
<li>Inflation: The mind-bogglingly fast expansion of the Universe in a fraction of the first second. It turned tiny quantum fluctuation into the seeds for the galaxies and clusters we see today</li>
<li>The Cosmic Microwave background: The radiation reaching us from a few hundred thousand years after the Big Bang. It shows us how our universe was like, 13.4 billion years ago</li>
<li>Large Scale Structure: Matter in the Universe forms a &quot;cosmic web&quot; with clusters, filaments and voids. The positions of galaxies in the sky shows imprints of the physics in the early universe</li>
<li>Dark Matter: Most matter in the universe seems to be &quot;Dark Matter&quot;, i.e. not noticeable through any means except for its effect on light and other matter via gravity</li>
<li>Dark Energy: The unknown force causing the universe's expansion to accelerate today</li>
<li>&quot;The Hubble Tension&quot;: Measurements of the universe's expansion rate, which are almost identical but, mysteriously, slightly discrepant (aka the [sigh] &quot;crisis in cosmology&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<p>And ask anything else you want to know!</p>
<p>Those of us answering your questions tonight will include</p>
<ul>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With the Hubble Tension issue, do you think the most likely explanation is that our understanding of the standard candles might be fundamentally flawed? As per this article from 2019 (<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/hubble-tension-headache-clashing-measurements-make-the-universes-expansion-a-lingering-mystery/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/hubble-tension-headache-clashing-measurements-make-the-universes-expansion-a-lingering-mystery/" target="_blank">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/hubble-tension-headache-clashing-measurements-make-the-universes-expansion-a-lingering-mystery/</a></a>) it seems that the early universe measurements from the Lambda-CDM put Ho at the lower end (67) and the late universe measurements that require standard candles seem to put the value of Ho &gt;67. Could it be that we are not fully aware of some extra dimming/red shift effects that could be making our standard candles seem further away?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
