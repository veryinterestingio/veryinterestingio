		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One sneaky thing legit companies are doing all the time now is making the &quot;unsubscribe&quot; button unsubscribe you to those specific types of emails. Oh, you don't want to subscribe to our daily deals? That's ok, we'll still send you the weekly deals and the special deals. Some sites have like 10 different lists that you have to unsub from individually</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Companies breaching GDPR get quite huge fines, so it is the case in general that in Europe that like actually works.</p>
<p>Or, even better, just mark the emails as spam so that your spam filter learns to block them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on if the email you tried to unsubscribe from is a legitimate marketing list, or spam.  If it's a legitimate marketing list from a reputable company, the chances are pretty high that the unsubscribe link will work, but if it's spam, it'll either do nothing, or encourage more spam.  Legitimate unsubscribe links can often take days to propagate, though, so maybe mark the message as spam too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It feels like this because companies usually have you on multiple emails lists. Itâ€™s better to go in manually and unsubscribe all from their website. Gmail has a block feature too now but I only see it as an option on some emails for some reason</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
