<p>&quot; Both sexes <strong>have</strong> a cloaca, an opening on the tail that permits <strong>sexual</strong> intercourse, egg laying and removal of wastes. During mating, the male hooks his tail under the female (he <strong>has</strong> a claw like tip on the end of his tail) and then brings the cloacas together to allow entry of the penis into the females cloaca &quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a hole near the base of their tail on their underside called the cloaca. Both males and females have this hole and it is a shared orifice for solid waste, liquid waste, and reproduction. The different systems all function separately and have internal mechanisms inside the cavity that share the outer sphincter. The penis is hidden inside this cloaca when not in use, and then expands with a dramatic increase in size and is easily visible outside of the tail when in use. </p>
<p>Some more fun facts! Turtles can be very difficult to determine the sex of especially as juveniles due to the lack of external genitalia. Researchers will sometimes use laparoscopy, putting a camera into the cloaca, but this is obviously invasive for the animal and requires expensive field equipment. So some work is being done on using hormone levels in the blood, which can be tricky as there is some overlap between the sexes, but can help provide sex information as part of more routine sampling. Chromosomal sex identification isn’t possible, sex is actually determined by the temperature of the nest, with warmer temperatures leading to more females (leading to one of the many threats these animals face due to climate change). Adults can be easier to sex as they can exhibit sexually dimorphic traits such as males having larger tails to house those magnum dongs. Finally, some species of turtles can even use their cloacas to breath! At very low metabolic rates during hibernation underwater, some turtles will take in water through their cloaca and extract oxygen using special high surface area tissues within their cloaca. Turtles are so weird, it’s great.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I was working at a veterinary hospital a turtle came in that had his whole penis out. And it was huge. Something was very obviously wrong however, and it turned out it had prolapsed out due to some sort of infection. Usually they are kept up inside their cloacas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
