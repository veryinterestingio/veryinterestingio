		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Top comment isn't exactly correct, these numbers refer to study outcomes, not individual person's risk factors. ARR is the absolute percent change in an outcome based on the study treatment. So if death was the outcome tested and it went from 3% to 2% with the treatment, the ARR would be 1% </p>
<p>RRR is what you normally see reported because it is a more impressive sounding number. It refers to the change within the group that had the outcome you were testing. So for the same 3% to 2% death rate, RRR would be 33%</p>
<p>This is why you have to look at baseline risk and sample sizes when evaluating medical claims. That &quot;halve your chance of stroke!!&quot; billboard could be based on a study where the stroke chance went from 0.002% to 0.001% </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi there.  30-year biostatistician here. I see thehorror2's point about outside risk factors.  I would put it even more directly as follows: absolute changes refer to <em>differences</em> in risk while relative ones refer to <em>ratios</em>.  Smoking roughly <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2928253/" target="_blank">doubles</a> the risk of stroke while multiplying the risk of lung cancer by <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/lung/basic_info/risk_factors.htm#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%2C%20cigarette,Many%20are%20poisons." target="_blank">at least fifteen</a>.  Yet strokes account for more smoking deaths than lung ca because their background rate is so much higher.  Thus ARR is useful in making inferences and choices about risk.  But because RRR (or increase) tends to be more constant across a variety of risk groups we often express results in terms of it, as above.  Also, relative risks tend to be easier to calculate and so were preferred in the old days.  This preference has a surprising persistence.</p>
<p>Quoting from the Lancet,  <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(21)00075-X/fulltext" target="_blank">https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(21)00075-X/fulltext</a> (the embedded parentheses won't let me directly link), a 95% reduction &quot;means that in a population such as the one enrolled in the trials, with a cumulated COVID-19 attack rate over a period of 3 months of about 1% without a vaccine, we would expect roughly 0·05% of vaccinated people would get diseased.&quot;  Thus it is a relative not an absolute reduction.  The absolute reduction for this population is .95% (or .0095).  But for a population with a background rate of 50% the absolute reduction would be 47.5% (or .475).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Put simply, absolute risk reduction is the flat difference in risk an intervention causes compared to the risk without the intervention. For example if your chance of being put on a ventilator when you have covid is 3% when you're not vaccinated, and 1% when you're vaccinated, the absolute risk reduction is 2%.</p>
<p>Relative risk reduction is the decline in risk an intervention causes <em>relative to initial risk</em>. So in the above example, the initial risk was 3% and the intervention reduced it by 2%. (2 / 3)*100% = 66.7%, so the intervention cause a 66.7% reduction in the initial risk</p>
<p>It's just two different ways to frame the same numbers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ARR is the actual reduction in the event rate by your intervention. Go from a 10% chance of something happening to a 5% chance after your changes? 5% ARR. Obviously, reporting this as a lone value doesn’t inform your audience much unless they are familiar with the odds of the thing happening in the first place.</p>
<p>RRR is the reduction in the event rate by your intervention, <strong>with respect to the original odds</strong>. So in our previous example, 10% control to 5% after intervention is a 50% RRR. This is much more readily understandable by an audience, but may also mislead without context, like when the original odds are so low in the first place that even a high RRR lacks practical significance.</p>
<p>To put it in COVID terms, stealing <em>and extrapolating</em>  u/nuclearcaramel’s stats, the Pfizer vaccine reduced the risk (I’m assuming of contracting disease at all?) from 0.736% to 0.036%. ARR = 0.7%. RRR = 95.1%. Both, in this case, pretty significant.</p>
<p>PS: if you’re wondering how Moderna’s ARR is greater than Pfizer’s control risk in the first place, it’s a different baseline risk in the locations they did their studies. That’s another downside of ARR. It doesn’t cross studies very well when the control groups look very different.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
