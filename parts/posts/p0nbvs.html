<p>So it doesn't need to go through your bloodstream at any point to cause an infection, then once it infects a cell, it releases a protein that suppresses that cell's ability to release cytokines, which is responsible for signalling the immune system. </p>
<p>So does that mean that each successful infection is able to complete its life-cycle, or does the body have a way of defending from this?</p>
<p>Also, does immunity/antibodies play a factor in such cases?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is a hypothetical first infection of an unvaccinated individual. I may have missed some details or otherwise confounded the timeline so treat it as a general story:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As you breath in coronavirus infected air, many of the viral particles will get caught in mucus that lines your airway and lungs will destroy the viral particles. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the virus can make into your cells, the presence of double stranded RNA, double membrane vesicles, or other strange viral features might trigger the release of interferon to prime neighboring cells for suicide should they be infected, as well as alert the immune system. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As virions bud off the infected cell they come into contact with neutrophils and macrophages which will attempt to eat them based on any strange general non-human characteristics (for example having the wrong carbohydrates showing). But their ability to detect coronavirus at this point is limited since they have no way of specifically identifying it so it is able to continue spreading. <strong>(Had they been vaccinated circulating antibodies could have specifically bound to virions preventing their entry into cells and signal to the macrophages to eat them, while T cells could have targeted infected cells directly)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now some of the new cells the virus enters destroy themselves when they detect something is off because interferon has signaled to them a viral infection is happening. This leads to further inflammation and tissue death in the lung. The infected person might feel a bit off but is otherwise ok. In the nose, where some of the first cells were exposed, inflammation/viral infection has killed off some of the support cells for the olfactory nerve and the individual begins loosing their sense of smell. Virions are also released when the individual is talking or breathing. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over time the virions spread, they get into the blood and move to other tissues like the kidneys, eyes and brain. The immune system is desperately producing B cells that secrete antibodies but they are not yet specific enough to bind to spike protein, T cells are also not yet able to specifically bind infected cells. They are refined through mutation but this will take some days. All throughout the body, infected cells are releasing cytokines telling the immune system to do something and infected cells are trying to destroy themselves and the virus to stop its spread.  Additional platelets are made and blood clots are at an increased risk of forming and causing heart attack stoke, pulmonary embolism etc. (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7470660/" target="_blank">further effects on organs</a>) Now the individual feels sick and they likely have a fever. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More time passes, the lung damage has become noticeable and breathing difficulties begin. The body now has some B cells, antibodies and T cells that can bind the virus or infected cells and they are trying to clear the virus. The individual feels very sick now, at this point if they are not healthy enough to continue they might need to be hospitalized and put on supplemental oxygen or a ventilator. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hopefully the antibodies/B/T cells have been able to specifically bind the virus and infected cells and stop its spread. There is still a lot of tissue damage and they feel terrible but the amount of virions is decreasing and the body keeps fine tuning its antibodies.</p>
</li>
<li>The virus is cleared, the individual is no longer infectious but their lungs are a mess and they still feel fatigued. Recovery varies from person to person and long covid effects are not yet fully understood.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mucous will entrap viral particles where they can be destroyed by the digestive system. One type of antibody, called IgA, is specialized to fight pathogens on mucosal surfaces. This antibody has receptors to transit through your epithelial cells into your mucous spaces. Additionally, some blood plasma is filtered through your epithelial tissue, which lets IgM and IgG antibodies access to your mucosal spaces.</p>
<p>One of the big questions right now about respiratory virus vaccine development is whether we should focus more on techniques that stimulate IgA production, such as nasal sprays, versus methods that produce IgG, like intramuscular shots.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you first get exposed to a virus, your body has little defense.  It isnt geared up to produce antibodies, so the virus rapidly reproduces and brings the viral load up, which basically general to any body tissue.  </p>
<p>The body then produces antibodies versus that virus, and when it detects and active infection, produces a massive amount of them.  </p>
<p>So then we get to the crux of your question, which is how does the airway gain the immunity?  Well the airways are highly vascular, meaning that the produced antibodies can provide immunity to those sites, and while it's certainly possible for a virus to enter into and infect the respiratory tract on a small scale, the blood vessels in the respiratory tract as well as the fluids present which are rich in antibodies very quickly lock down the virus from reproducing on a large scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several defense lines in your airways:</p>
<p>1) mucus and cilia which transport most things back up that got caught in the mucus and don't belong there.</p>
<p>2) macrophages: they sit there and sense all the time for danger and attack whatever they find.  These are your first line of defense.</p>
<p>3) antibodies: IgA type antibodies are produced by Bcells and secreted into the mucosae (so into the lumen of your airways and intestins too for that matter)
These B cells are activated by antigen presenting cells who present the newly found antigen (from covid) to the B cells.  They recognize it and start producing antibodies.  IgA for mucosal protection and Ig G en IgM mainly for internal protection (every place inside your body)</p>
<p>The first time covid strikes there are no antibodies so there isn't enough protection.  It can bind to our receptors and infect us.</p>
<p>However after you got antibodies, they (IgA) are in the mucus layer and bind all covid particles which are become targets for the macrophages to destroy.  After this the macrophages present the antigens to the B Cells and you get a booster reations which produces even more antigens.
So once you are protected, the antibodies protect you.</p>
<p>Unless the virus mutated and your antibodies can no longer bind to the virus.  In that case your immune system will make new B Cells specific for that new strain. Etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
