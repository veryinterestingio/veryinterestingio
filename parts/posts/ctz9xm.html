		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main difference is that it <strong><em>is</em></strong> both man-made fire and the magnitude it's reached. There was a small news outlet that ran a piece on farmers talking about promoting a &quot;Fire Day&quot; both to clear land and to show support for the actions of Brazil's moron of a president de-funding enviromental programs. There's a piece from one of the largest newspapers in the country about the original article <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/08/em-dia-do-fogo-sul-do-pa-registra-disparo-no-numero-de-queimadas.shtml" target="_blank">here</a>, in portuguese but it has a graph about the number of fires by day.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://g1.globo.com/ro/rondonia/noticia/2019/08/16/fotos-comparam-locais-de-porto-velho-atingidos-por-intensa-fumaca.ghtml" target="_blank">cities in the Amazon covered in smoke</a> from these fires. Some are covered for days now, this piece is also in portuguese but there is a before/after picture of the same spot in the city.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/08/20/sudden-darkness-befalls-sao-paulo-western-hemispheres-largest-city-baffling-thousands/?noredirect=on" target="_blank">Yesterday, the smoke reached São Paulo, the largest city in the western hemisphere, (this one is in english)</a> and made the city dark at 3 pm. These cities are about 1,500 miles apart (or the distance between NYC and Austin, TX, which is about the same as the distance between London and Istanbul). Imagine a dark cloud of smoke spanning basically across the whole of Europe, that's whats happening.</p>
<p>I've seen americans comparing this to California's natural fires, but the Amazon is pretty humid year-round, despite the lowers levels of precipitation in the dry season. It's not comparable to California at all. The Amazon's <a href="https://en.climate-data.org/south-america/brazil/rondonia/porto-velho-3120/" target="_blank"><strong>driest</strong> 3 months in Porto Velho (the city covered in smoke)</a> have an average precipitation of about 30 mm, which is about <a href="https://en.climate-data.org/north-america/united-states-of-america/california/sacramento-1460/" target="_blank">half the average of the 3 <strong>wettest</strong> months in Sacramento</a>.</p>
<p>Natural forest fires sure can happen in the Amazon, but they don't spread like this. This is man-made.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/08/21/753140642/tens-of-thousands-of-fires-ravage-brazilian-amazon-where-deforestation-has-spike?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_term=nprnews&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=npr" target="_blank">NPR reported that according to an official agency (INPE), there have been 74,155 fires in Brazil in 2019. About half those fires, nearly 36,000 of them have ignited in the last month. That's nearly as many as in all of 2018!</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There have been 72,843 fires in Brazil this year, with more than half in  the Amazon region. That's more than an 80% increase compared  with the same period last year. The European Union's satellite program, Copernicus, released <a href="https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/charts/cams/aerosol-forecasts?facets=undefined&amp;time=2019082000,12,2019082012&amp;projection=classical_south_america&amp;layer_name=composition_bbaod550" target="_blank">a map</a>  showing smoke from the fires spreading all along Brazil to the east  Atlantic coast. The smoke has covered nearly half of the country and is  even spilling over into neighboring Peru, Bolivia and Paraguay.  </p>
<p>While there's nothing new about mining companies, ranchers, poachers, etc, starting forest fires to clear land and/or drive out indigenous groups, the sheer number of fires this year is absolutely unprecedented. Activists in Brazil are accusing the President, Jair Bolsonaro, of ordering these fires in order to clear away forests for massive mining and agricultural projects. Bolsonaro is kind of notorious for seeing the pristine rain forests of South America as a waste of space, a bunch of stupid trees that are in the way of commerce, so everyone's been freaking out about the potential for massive environmental destruction ever since he got elected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Data released by Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research shows that from January to July, fires consumed 4.6 million acres of the Brazilian Amazon, a 62 percent increase compared to last year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Per <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/145464/fires-in-brazil" target="_blank">NASA</a>, fire activity in Brazil is actually <del>lower than average</del> they’ve update it to say “close to average” (whether close to means above or below is anyone’s guess) from the last 15 years. Comparing year to year fire stats is not helpful so the posts comparing it to last year or 2013 are completely arbitrary and are being used to sensationalize what is happening. The “Amazon is burning at a record rate” headlines don’t mention that the data they are using to say it is burning more than it <em>ever</em> has is data that has only been collected since 2013. Again, sensationalized.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fires are not an important part of the ecosystem in the Amazon, unlike  in north American wilderness.</p>
<p>Fires are infrequent isolated brief and intense.</p>
<p>As a result the majority of species have not evolved to adapt to fire.</p>
<p>The purpose of this fire is to destroy &amp;a tame the wilderness the same way America destroyed its own; to fill it with ranchers and farmers &amp; end  Any further concern for the environment or the Eco systems.</p>
<p>If you can destroy it, then there's nothing for people to Protect.</p>
<p>Trump and the conservatives in America are encouraging the same thing in areas surrounded by wilderness there encouraging the locals to ignore off road signs and feel like the areas not something to be protected but something that they own that they can do whatever they want with.</p>
<p>There's a lot of confusion from people who think about fires in the northern hemisphere thinking that applies to the Amazon and it does not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
