In addition when I get kicked in the thigh at Muay Thai, I get a burst of white hot anger. But when I feel other pains of a similar level (if I was rating them on a scale of one to ten), they don't make me furious. Why is this?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Besides the Google copy-paste already mentioned, my own theory based on my own experience is that I'm pissed at myself when I do something stupid so I get angry at myself, or whoever inflicted pain on me. The element of surprise is also annoying and causes a reactive emotional response, like cutting your finger or ripping your fingernail off unexpectedly, as opposed to just having an aching pain that's more predictable. Again, just my own estimations from personal experience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans have a set of instincts called our 'fight or flight' response. When we experience anything that suggests we're in danger, our whole bodies will switch gears either to defend ourselves (fight) or get away (flight). Pain is one of our major fight-or-flight triggers. Anger is a 'fight' response.</p>
<p>We subconsciously choose between 'fight' mode or 'flight' mode based on a number of things - these include how much danger we thing we're in, and how we understand our ability to deal with that danger. We also all have our own built-in tendency to go one way or another, depending on our genetics, personality, and experiences, etc.</p>
<p>Stubbing a toe or getting hit in a controlled martial arts setting are comparatively 'safe'. We may get hurt, but we may also be confident that nothing is trying to kill us in those environments. So the 'fight' response, and the anger that comes with it, are more likely. All of this is sub-conscious, meaning we don't actually choose between them. Our brains just automatically go into one mode or the other based on their wiring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The body has two distinct pain pathways, fast and slow. The fast path, utilising thick nerve fibres which plumb in 3 short steps straight from the source of pain into the brain (somatosensory cortex) cause you to react instantly to pain or heat (flinching / pulling away). The slow path uses thinner fibres and the circuitry goes to various other parts of the brain including those which control emotion. The different pathways are why when you stub your toe, there’s a brief sharp shock of pain and enough time to think “here comes the real pain” before the crippling agony hits you. It’s this slow pathway which can trigger a whole host of other reactions, but dependent on the stimulus (or what you’ve done to yourself) it’s activation varies, hence why you sometimes get angry, sometime feel other emotions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
