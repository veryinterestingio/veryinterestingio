If you were active, you were just being a child and needed discipline. But now as an adult, sometimes I wonder if I have ADD/ADHD or I'm just lazy, forgetful, and have a short attention span. </p>

<p>Can anyone explain to me the difference?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ADHD is a neurological condition and, in my opinion, a poorly named one.  It is <em>not</em> simply a very short attention span or lack of motivation; the real deficit is in executive function. People with ADHD are capable of freakish levels of focus, but they have an impaired ability to choose what they focus on. And when they are zoomed in on a task, it’s very difficult to disengage, even for things that they know are important.  Likewise, a person with ADHD isn’t forgetful; they often have brains like sponges. They just don’t choose what they will remember. </p>
<p>It’s like having a Ferrari engine with with a Geo Metro steering system.</p>
<p>From the outside, all this is easy to mistake for laziness.  Many children with ADHD are told over and over that they are lazy, that they could achieve if they just cared more. And I suppose that really answers your question: a lazy person doesn’t care when they let things slide.  A person with ADHD usually cares a lot.</p>
<p>If you’re troubled by your behavior but unable to change it, get yourself evaluated by a mental health professional.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ADHD is a lack of executive functioning, which in ELI5 terms is just a difficulty in processes helping you decide what to do. This can include inability to assess lengths of tasks, being unable to ignore distractions, being able to sort relevant from irrelevant information, and so on. You can see how these might inhibit someone with ADHD’s ability to carry out everyday tasks, and how this person behaves might very well be perceived as being lazy or forgetful. It’s important to note that this doesn’t necessarily imply personal failure, it would be a lot harder for a lot of people to pay attention and successfully carry out tasks if, say, there were a lot more distractions around for them.</p>
<p>It may be difficult to assess your question, because having or not having ADHD isn’t one thing. Everybody’s executive functions fail them, but some people have it worse than others. I follow a blog that wrote about it (linked below) that might illustrate it thoroughly, but I think one of the only ways you’re really going to be sure is by talking to a therapist.</p>

<p>It's not that you can't concentrate, it's that you have less control over what you concentrate on.</p>
<p>Say you're in class or a meeting and start a little doodle in a dull moment. Next thing you know, you're absorbed in it -- and you miss whatever happens around you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>“Lazy” is about being content doing nothing. ADHD may look the same externally, but I think there is more of an issue that tasks are just harder to start/keep doing.</p>
<p>ADHD lacks ability to do tasks by intent alone. No amount of wanting something to be done seems to overcome the lack of wanting to do it for ADHD.</p>
<p>In my view, “lazy” implies the lack of wanting something to be done. This is an issue with desire/motivation which is not the direct cause of something not being done for an ADHDer. </p>
<p>An ADHDer is more likely to forget a task, be easily distracted, or be difficult to distract on something engaging, even if something else is more important.</p>
<p>I am not sure “lazy” is a real thing indepependent of the external stigma, or just a label applied to people who are contributing less regardless of intent. For example, someone might call an ADHDer lazy, as they might call a person with dyspraxia culmsy, or a person with myopia and no glasses illiterate. i.e. It’s a label attributed to what is observed, not what is attempted. It’s really hard for a person with dyspraxia to ride a bike, but not for lack of trying.</p>
<p>If an ADHDer has the same intent and applies the same effort to a task, it will not be as good as someone without ADHD. This is not directly observable by a manager for instance. ADHDers need to put forth more effort for the same outcome.</p>
<p>Medicine reduces this burden by manipulating the executive function. This makes it easier to do something the individual deems important, rather than interesting. It doesn’t change the effort someone is willing to put forth, it changes how effective that effort is. This process goes down to the level of holding thoughts to make decisions, which is also not directly observable. </p>
<p>For a truly lazy person, there would be no effort to direct.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
