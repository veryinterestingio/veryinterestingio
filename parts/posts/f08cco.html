		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The basis of a lens is the refraction index (n) (I studied it in Spanish so idk if the terms I'm gonna use are the correct terms in English too) each material has it's own n. Vacuum's n is 1 and air's is a bit more. When light changes from a material to another one with a different n, it &quot;bends&quot; (that's what happens to water for example).</p>
<p>A light source emits light in all directions, a (convex) lens converges all its light rays into a single point (due to it's shape and having a different n), the image point. In case of cameras that point must be in the sensor to be on focus. If it isn't, a single light source will &quot;activate&quot; more than one point in the sensor, and thus, become blurred.</p>
<p>You can't focus the whole scene because objects are at different distances, so the image point is at different distances too. When you focus you change the distance between the lense and sensor. In your case you'd have to move the torch closer or further. (I'm not entirely sure about this last one).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Take a look at <a href="https://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/refrn/u14l5c1.gif" target="_blank">this photo</a>. It is an example of <em>ray tracing</em>, for a double-convex lens. It shows the paths for all the light rays emitting from a single point. Ignore the eyeballs. </p>
<p>The three important rays are 1) the incoming ray traveling parallel to the axis of the lens, which will bend to pass through the rear focal point, 2) the incoming ray passing through the front focal point, which will bend to travel parallel to the axis of the lens, and 3) the incoming ray passing through the midpoint of the lens (intersection of mid plane and horizontal axis), which travels through the lens without bending. For this image, they are the top, second-to-bottom and middle rays, respectively. These three rays will define the intersection point where the image will be focussed. All other ray paths - emitting from that same source point - will eventually end up at that same intersection. <em>(The exact mechanism for how/why the rays behave like this has to do with refraction and geometry, but is not overly important for discussion of focussed/unfocused images.)</em></p>
<p><strong>If you place your camera sensor on the vertical plane where the rays intersect, then you’ll get a sharp, focussed image. But any source/object closer or further away from the lens will have an intersection on a different plane than the sensor, and will look fuzzy and out of focus.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/32/bd/c6/32bdc6da66b327b5e000e6db9cb46f93.gif" target="_blank">Here is a busier image</a> showing how light rays from various points on an object create an (inverted) image.</p>
<p>Projecting an image onto something (i.e. at a movie theatre) is much the same, but instead of a camera sensor you have a wall or screen. The ray tracing is a bit different, but the physics is the same. </p>
<p>Sorry if this is clear as mud. This is a tough question to answer in just a few paragraphs, and from a phone. You could take a semester-long optics class just to answer this. Ray tracing like this - where you bend/refract the light only once in the mid plane of the lens - is only an approximation, and only for <em>thin</em> lenses. If you do actual ray tracing for each surface of the lens, accounting for index of refraction and geometry, you’ll find that the rays do not intersect so perfectly. They’ll be <em>close</em>, but not quite as tight of a point. <a href="http://electron6.phys.utk.edu/optics421/modules/m2/images/mfocus.gif" target="_blank">Here is an example of exact ray tracing</a>, where the rays do not converge to a single point.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every lens has a focal point. A focal point is where the light rays will converge if they strike the lens from very far away (meaning that they are parallel when they reach the lens).That focal point determines how far away an object needs to be in order to be focused. </p>
<p>Your film strip had a lens when it was created. So to project it onto a screen you would need to send the image created by the torch through another lens and adjust the distance frogm the strip to the lens until the image is in focus. </p>
<p>In other words, a lens bends a light ray when it passes through. The amount of bending determines what becomes focused in the image. With no lens, the light rays are going in various directions when they hit the screen so the image is blurry.</p>
<p>Edit: OPs best option might be a pinhole camera (see my explanation below), but the torch might not be bright enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine that the image on your film is a single tiny dot of white surrounded by black. If you shine a torch onto this film, you will not see a tiny dot on the wall behind it, but a splodge of light. The first thing to understand is that this is what the blurred image is made up of - many splodges all overlapping one another.</p>
<p>Why is the point turned to a splodge? Because the bright part of the torch is not tiny. If you trace a ray of light from, say, the top edge of the torch, through the white dot and onto the wall, it will land at the bottom of the splodge. A ray from the bottom edge of the torch traced in the same way will land at the top of the splodge.</p>
<p>One way of making the image more in focus is to use a very small, very intense light. Unfortunately it tends to be impossible to make something very small and intense.</p>
<p>The other way is using a lens. A lens bends rays of light coming through it by different amounts depending on where they strike the lens. You can look up a diagram to see how that works but the upshot is that if you get the right lens and place it at the right distance in front of the film, the two rays of light I described above will be bent - <em>focused</em> - so that they both land at the same point on the wall. No more splodges; no more blur.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of interesting explanations here that focus on lenses. I was an optical engineer, so I’ll try to explain things in a different way. </p>
<p>The image that’s captured on film is probably focused. If you use a very small-sized, but bright, light source, you could project a mostly focused image onto any wall (it doesn’t even have to be flat) without a lens. The problem is, your torch isn’t a small pin-sized light. It’s emitting light from an <em>area</em>. This means the image on the wall is the result of the <em>superposition</em>, or sum, of all the images if you had a small pin-point light at each point on your torch. That’s the blurry result that you’re seeing. </p>
<p>Why did I say mostly focused? Well, it turns out that the way light moves through space causes the image (or wavefront, in optics terms) to change slightly. This is called free space propagation. The way it works follows the same math as a wave propagating through water!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
