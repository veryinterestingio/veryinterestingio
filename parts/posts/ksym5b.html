		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This comes from other things aswell and it's the bodies natural urge to try to force change to irritation on our bodies. When we do this it is a different kind of pain that distracts from the throbbing monotony of what was there initially, also when you inflict a certain amount of self harm the brain stresses out and can send adrenaline through your body, so you could be getting high on like a mild adrenaline rush</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I suffer with chronic pain in my leg.  Causing additional pain in the leg feels better for me as I feel in control of the pain.  I was also told by a doctor it was because it released adrenaline which is a potent pain killer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A loose tooth from the perspective of your body is just an open wound that can't heal. There is obvious advantage in an instinct to agitate a loose tooth to get it to fall out more quickly and let the healing process begin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well at least adding pressure on a painful spot will help because of gate-control theory of pain. Basically pain signal travels with one kind of neurons and pressure travels with other kind. In addition to this both pain and pressure neurons connect with an inhibitory interneuron. Pain neurons inhibit this inhibitory interneuron so all you feel is pain. But if you push the pressure neurons will activate inhibitory interneuron, which will inhibit the pain signal. This is why you feel less pain if you add pressure on the painful spot of your body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>FWIW worth there's a thick nerve in the bottom edge of your cheekbone next to where the jaw bone meets it that if pressed in completely blocks tooth pain. </p>
<p>I discovered it when I had a particularly bad abscess. It completely stops the pain. It's like magic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
