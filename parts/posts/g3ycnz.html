		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The bladder is actually inflexible when full, <em>it cannot stretch to accommodate more urine.</em> If it's truly full, it's in danger of bursting.  Generally, your body starts bugging you to pee at about 30% full.</p>
<p>If you are drinking water and frequently urinating, it's because your body is reacting to the excess water by processing it quicker than normal to expel it.</p>
<p>If you are peeing just a little bit, it can indicate you are dehydrated but your kidneys are processing a lot of waste. Many people notice something like this after taking vitamin B supplements or eating certain vegetables like asparagus.</p>
<p>Also, urinating frequently can be a warning sign for diabetes.  This is similar to above, but your body is trying to remove the extra &quot;sugar&quot; from your blood.  A simple home test for diabetes is to drink a full glass of orange juice and at your next urination, check for a sweet smell coming from the toilet.  People with maids/cleaning service are sometimes diagnosed by the maid noticing the sugary scent from the toilet(s).</p>
<p>Pressure on the bladder can also cause an urge to go, such as an animal or child leaning on it. Pregnant woman often go more frequently as the baby develops and gets larger.</p>
<p>Men can also end up with a strange condition if they ejaculate and pee too closely together, causing a sensation of needing to pee despite an empty bladder.  Because the urethra is used for both, there are muscles activated for ejaculation to prevent urine from coming out.  Those muscles can get &quot;confused&quot; when both happen within a short period of time (varies but usually within 10 minutes).  <em>The muscles can be relaxed by taking a warm shower or with a heating pad, focus the heat in the lower abdomen where the bladder is.</em> </p>
<p>There are a lot of possibilities and reasons, and some can indicate a medical issue. If you don't think your situation is typical, you might want to ask your doctor about it.  If it's really as simple as &quot;sometimes you pee more than other times&quot; it can just be as simple as &quot;you may have been asleep or distracted long enough to distract from the sensation so your bladder could fill more until it became more pressing.&quot;</p>
<p>edit: Clarified &quot;inflexible&quot; meaning. Here's a medical report of a burst bladder from a blockage, preventing urination, for those who are curious.  It can also be caused by binge drinking. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5849873/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5849873/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Because if it did that then you wouldn't have time to find a bathroom, you would just have to go immediately and you would leak while trying to hold it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vaguely remember something from medical school that the nerves fire once to give the sensation of needing to void, but that urge can be suppressed by the micturition region of the brain, but as the bladder fills it will start to fire once again as the volume start to reach the threshold that the bladder can't contain anymore</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
