		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What ensures it won't end back in there? It depends on the country and their waste management policy. One would expect the waste picked up in a beach in Scotland would with all intent, should end in a proper waste management stream i.e it will go to landfill, recycling centre or be incinerated for energy. </p>
<p>Just because trash is removed from a beach doesn't mean it will go back into the sea, it is very possible that the waste collected didn't even originate from the country it was collected from.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
