		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a layman when it comes to physics, so the question may be ill-formed and/or incorrectly framed. I'm trying to really grasp the nature of (flat) spacetime. I'm watching <a href="https://youtu.be/iBTez-nTKes?t=272" target="_blank">this video</a>, and she says how there's no way for the speed of light to be constant for all observers if spacetime were Euclidean.</p>
<p>If I take the speed of light being constant for all observes as axiomatically true, then I feel like I'm close to grasping flat spacetime, but I don't really understand why this statement has to be the case. I'm guessing there's a simple mathematical proof that shows why the spacetime is basically a series of hyperbolic contours -- can someone point me to that?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Space being Euclidean implies it's symmetric under rotations (and translations, but we won't need that). So if you pick two points in space 1 meter apart, for example the ends of a rod, you will measure the same distance between these points now matter how you rotate this rod. In coordinates, this means that if we take a rod connecting (0, 0) and (3, 4), which by Pythagoras has length 5, and we rotate this rod around the point (0, 0) it'll always have the same length, the endpoint ending up at for example (5, 0) or (2, 4.58...) etc...</p>
<p>Now, to go to spacetime we need to add a time dimension. Points in spacetime correspond to events happening at a specific place and a specific time. We can't really have physical rods anymore to connect a pair of events, but we can imagine a pulse of light between them, with one event being the pulse leaving a flashlight, and another event being the pulse of light hitting your eye.</p>
<p>So imagine a two-dimensional spacetime. We can still have coordinates, we just have to be a bit careful with the units, I'm going to assume seconds for the time dimension and lightseconds (299792458 meters) for the space dimension. Now imagine a pulse leaving at (0 seconds, 0 lightseconds) and arriving at (5 seconds, 5 lightseconds). Clearly this pulse travels at the speed of light, 5 lightseconds / 5 seconds = speed of light (by definition of the lightsecond). However, if spacetime is Euclidean, it is again symmetric under rotations, so we can rotate the end event of the pulse around the start event, to make it end up at for example (1 seconds, 7 lightseconds). The spacetime-distance remains the same, sqrt( 5^2 + 5^2 ) = sqrt( 1^2 + 7^2 ), but the speed we measure has changed dramatically, to 7 times the speed of light. By rotating by different angles, you can get any speed you want.</p>
<p>So a fully Euclidean spacetime is incompatible with a constant speed of light. But we do know the spatial part of spacetime appears Euclidean (at least, when there's no gravity!), so if we're going to unify space and time, we will still need to keep that symmetry. It turns out that a very natural way to do so is to keep measuring distances with a formula like that of Pythagoras, but flipping one of the signs. I.e., the distance between (0, 0, 0, 0) and (t, x, y, z) will be expressed as sqrt( -t^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 ). Rotations involving just the x, y, z coordinates behave exactly as in Euclidean space, and &quot;rotations&quot; involving a time coordinate will be interpreted as boosts, changing the speed of your frame of reference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say you're standing next to a railroad, and a train approaches you going 100 m/s.  You see its approaching speed as 100 m/s.</p>
<p>Now, let's say you're on a train next to the railroad mention above, you're traveling in the opposite direction at 50 m/s.  Now you see the other train approaching you at 150 m/s.</p>
<p>Now, let's substitute a beam of light for the first train.  Standing next to the railroad, you see it approaching at 299,792,458 m/s.  Next, you get on a train going 50 m/s.  In this case, no matter which direction you look, you measure the speed of light as exactly the same velocity.  In other words, you don't add your speed to the light speed.</p>
<p>So, in the first example, your frame of reference made a difference in the speed of the oncoming train (this is consistent with Euclidean observations).  But light speed is always the same, regardless of the frame of reference.  And this is why it is non-Euclidean.</p>
<p>This is not at all intuitive (but it has been verified experimentally countless times) - but it is the difference between Euclidean and relativistic observations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
