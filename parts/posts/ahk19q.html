		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;As the top and bottom primary teeth come in, the empty space left behind is gradually filled by growth of the maxilla and mandible, respectively. During the time period when teeth are actively coming in, teeth can displace into the empty space left by other permanent teeth that are no longer there, resulting in crooked teeth.&quot;</p>

<p>I'm 20 now, but still have three baby teeth. For some reason, one of my upper adult tooth never formed, so there is nothing to push out that baby tooth. It is weird to see the x-ray with the perfect tooth sized hole behind it though!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A Primary tooth's roots resorb and the space is taken by the adult tooth that is coming it. It is generally why baby teeth don't have roots when they fall out. The adult tooth starts pushing towards the oral cavity and absorbing the bone in it's path. Before the adult tooth erupts, it is not fully formed. It does not have true roots yet.
When you have braces your teeth move by absorbtion/resorbtion of the bone around them. It is kind of the same process. </p>
<p>Edit: so I guess a mixture of the adult tooth's roots and bone would take up that &quot;empty space&quot;?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Doesnâ€™t it make sense that the GROWTH of your SKULL (maxilla/upper jaw) is what PUSHES your TEETH down? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
