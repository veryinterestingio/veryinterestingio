		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Earth doesn’t lose much water, as the ozone layer prevents UV light from breaking water molecules down to hydrogen and oxygen, the mass of the Earth prevents water vapor from leaving the atmosphere and the vapor condenses and falls back to the surface. </p>
<p>Earth also gains a marginal amount of water from asteroids and the like. </p>
<p>So it technically isn’t a closed system, but the rate of change isn’t significant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Geologically speaking, water is also &quot;lost&quot; as it is subducted into the mantle where it is incorporated chemically into minerals. There's research to suggest
&quot; the silicate minerals of the interior contain most of the planet’s water as hydrogen dissolved in these oxygen minerals&quot; (see source below).</p>
<p>Otherwise that interior water eventually escapes to the surface as superheated volcanic steam, or through hydrothermal activity, etc.</p>
<p>For further readings google Joseph Smyth, a minerologist and crystallographer at University of Colorado in Boulder. He was also an old professor of mine whose research covered this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, many biological processes involve the conversion of water with other junk into organic matter. That alone means that the amount of the earth's Hydrogen and Oxygen that's represented as water at any one time changes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Earth does not significantly gain or lose water. What might be relevant to know, though, is that all water on Earth is not in the same state. It can be solid (ice), liquid (water), or gas (vapor). Depending on the state, the volume is different. So when it transitions states it might increase or decrease in volume. The &quot;amount&quot; of water does not change, the volume of all water on Earth might.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
