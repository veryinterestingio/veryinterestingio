		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What happens is the rough inside later of the igloo melts a little bit at first but the super cold ice behind it which is being kept cold by the outside temperatures freezes it again in to a smooth crust. Because there's now less surface area the warm inside air is less effective at melting the surrounding ice.</p>
<p>So basically it's a constant battle between the fire inside warming up the air and the ice and cold air keeping the structure frozen, and the achieve a balance at some point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm an Inuk from Nunavut and I have experience with this! In the colder seasons of winter often between November to April are the peak freezing temperatures, the snow packs harder from winds and cold making snow easier to pack and build into shape, forming a stronger integrity of an igloo (proper name is ᐃᒡᓗᕕᒐᖅ &quot;Igluvigaq&quot; ) with the cold atmosphere keeps the exterior of the Igluvigaq frozen, the interior warms by the flames of stone lamp called ᖁᓪᓕᖅ &quot;qulliq&quot; melts a thin wall making film of ice. The ice is kept frozen by the outside, making the Igluvigaq insulated and keeping the Igluvigaq nice and toasty! Igluvigaq are often used in temporary shelter when going out to hunt and harvest away from family camps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An important note is that the goal of warming the inside of the igloo is NOT to keep the inside a temperature that you would be comfortable in your home.  It is to make it more comfortable in clothes and blankets.  The structure does melt if the internal temperatures get too high.  As others have said, you want to find an equilibrium so that the melting is not happening faster than refreezing.  If you want the structure to last more than a few days, the internal temperature needs to be fairly low, say 40s or perhaps up to 50s.  This is a welcomed respite from negative temperatures in the arctic.</p>
<p>Snow melt, humidity from your body, and breath will freeze into the cracks, helping to seal the structure and block wind and the elements from infiltrating.  However, ice is a much worse insulator than the packed snow initially used to create the igloo, so you don't want the walls to too thick with ice.  The ice also helps trap moisture inside, thus increasing the relative humidity inside of the igloo.  Super cold air is very dry, and can make it painful to even breathe.  Humid air also holds heat better than dry, so a small heat source can provide a better warming effect when the humidity is slightly higher.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Snow with an ice layer over it is very insulative. That keeps the heat inside and the cold out. It also keeps the heat out of the actual snow and the ice sort of keeps itself cool. It is the same reason that snow that has a crust of ice takes so long to melt even if it is way above freezing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I learned how hard it is to melt snow/ice with fire in an interesting way. My boss told me to we had a “parade” of higher ups coming through. There was a bunch of dirty snow in the parking lot. I went to Home Depot and rented  the biggest kerosene heater I could. Had guys pack it up high and pointed it right at the base. Maybe an hour later very little progress. </p>
<p>One of the guys who reported up through me walked by, called me a dumb fuck and said that’s going to take forever. It was 60 degrees out and he grabbed 2 guys and they broke it up and threw it in a thin layer over the parking lot. Took like 2 hours to melt on its own after that. It would have taken  us a day to melt it all. </p>
<p>Anyway, getting schooled by a technician was fun. Little did he know I just wanted to play with a kerosene heater. But, he did get to call me dumb which was a positive for him and taught me a lesson on how many BTU’s it takes to phase change ice to water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
