		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When something feels hot or cold what you are actually feeling is the heat entering or leaving your body. So two objects at the same temperature might <em>feel</em> different against your skin depending on how easy it is for heat to flow between your body and the object. </p>
<p>It's very difficult for heat to flow between solids and gases. Heat moves from one object to another mostly when the hot atoms hit the cold atoms and pass some energy over. (for the science nerds: yes I'm excluding radiative transfer since it's not the differentiating mechanism between OPs examples). Since atoms are further apart in gases, there's not a lot of gas atoms colliding against the solid object's atoms. However, heat flows better between solid-to-liquids, and solids-to-solids. That's because the atoms in solids and liquids are packed together, so they hit each other and pass around energy really well. </p>
<p>Things like blankets, coats, and the insulation builders put in your house's walls, are filled with tiny air bubbles. That means for heat to flow through them, the heat has to pass from solid to gas to solid to gas to solid... Which is really hard to do. So not much heat leaves your body through the blanket, which makes them <em>feel</em> warm. Additionally, since your body continuously generates more heat, you can actually build up too much heat between you and the blanket since so little heat is leaving (this is why you might start sweating while wearing a winter coat even if it's freezing outside).</p>
<p>However, if you touch a solid or liquid, such as a rock or water, which are at the same temperature as the blanket, they will <em>feel</em> colder because more heat will leave your body because heat flows better from solid-to-solid and solid-to-liquid. </p>
<p>On the other hand, if the rock, water, and blanket are hotter than your skin, the rock and water will feel very hot compared to a blanket because more heat <em>enters</em> your body through the solids and liquids.</p>
<p>This is why it's easier to burn yourself on hot water or metal than with hot air. This is also why you can freeze your tongue to a metal pole when it's cold outside. Sticking your tongue out into freezing air doesn't freeze your tongue right away because the heat flows too slowly (your body's heat generation can keep up). But, when your tongue touches the metal, so much heat leaves the tongue that it quickly freezes tight against the pole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with the amount of air pockets in the substance and the heat capacity of air.</p>
<p>Air has a fairly low heat capacity, meaning it doesn’t take a lot of energy to lower or raise its temperature. </p>
<p>Things like blankets are made of materials that have lots of air pockets. The fuzz or lining or batting fibers interlock and form these pockets. The blanket starts at room temperature, but when you use it to cover yourself your body heat becomes trapped by these air pockets and then warms them up, and the blanket may begin to feel warm to the touch. </p>
<p>Rocks, on the other hand, have relatively few air pockets, if any. They are very dense, and the heat capacity for most rocks is very high, meaning that it takes a lot of energy to change their temperature. The rocks start out at room temperature, just like the blanket. If you were to cover up with them, or perhaps build a house out of the rocks, it would take a lot of energy to heat it up. However, once the rocks got warm, it would also take a lot of energy to cool them off again, so it would stay warm longer than the blankets would after you stopped adding heat through your body heat or maybe a fireplace.</p>
<p>Additionally, the reason that rocks feel cooler when you first touch them has to do with relative body heat. Things that are at lower temperatures than your body feel cool, things that are higher feel hot. A room temperature rock will feel cooler than your 98.6 F body.  But, blankets are made of fibers and air pockets so while they also feel cool at first, the friction between your skin and the fibers generates heat quickly and heats up the air pockets, making the blanket feel warm much more quickly than the rock. This is also why fuzzy blankets get warm faster than smooth quilts or sheets—there’s more friction with the fabric.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>
<p>If two objects of different hotness touch, the hotter one will make the colder one hotter, and the cold one will make the hotter one colder. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your skin cannot feel hotness or coldness. What it can really feel is if it is changing to being hotter or colder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your body is much hotter than things around you. When you touch things, that heat will leave your skin and you will feel it as &quot;cold&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heavy (dense) objects are able to steal heat really fast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Soft objects do not steal much heat, and also don't really touch you much. They trick your skin into <em>thinking</em> you are touching it more than you are. Since you are not really touching it much, you do not lose heat.</p>
</li>
<li>There is normally air moving around like wind, even if you are inside. It is just very small. Blankets stop that wind around you, allowing your body to heat up the air between you and the blanket.</li>
