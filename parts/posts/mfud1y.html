		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These are all part of the Celtic language family. Languages evolve pretty similarly to animals. A long time ago in a mountainous region  far, far away, a group of people spoke a language we call Proto-Indo-European, which is the common ancestor of Indian languages, as well as all European languages. Those people eventually began to migrate across the world, and over the generations, their languages changed as they passed from person to person, being slightly misunderstood each time. Some of those who moved into Europe experienced a language shift to a form we call Proto-Celtic. These were the Celtic peoples, who would spread across Europe, build more sedentary societies and develop their own distinct cultures and languages descended from a common Celtic identity. </p>
<p>At their peak, Celtic languages and cultures were distributed across Europe: On the Iberian peninsula were the Celtiberians and Gallaecians. In Italy and Switzerland were the Lepontic Celts, who were defeated early on by the Romans who were coming in from the Italic cultural group. In France and stretching down through Central Europe even as far as Turkey were the Gauls, Norics and Galatians, who met the Germanic languages and cultures to the North, the Balto-Slavic languages to the North-East and the Greek languages to the South-East. Then there's the Insular Celts, who inhabited the British Isles. </p>
<p>The Insular Celts experienced later cultural and linguistic evolutions that split them into two further categories - the Goidelic (Gaelic) and the Brittonic. At the time of this split, Irish, Scottish and Manx were Goidelic and Breton, Welsh and Cornish were Brittonic. Some Brittonic languages, those spoken in England, went extinct after the Saxons came and fused with Brittonic to make Anglo-Saxon, a mostly Germanic language that would eventually evolve into English. Here's a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Map_Gaels_Brythons_Picts.png/220px-Map_Gaels_Brythons_Picts.png" target="_blank">map</a> of the full extent of the Goidelic (Gaelic) languages (Green), the Brittonic languages (Red) and the Pictish language (Blue) prior to the Saxons' arrival. Pictish is an Insular Celtic language as well, likely closely related to Brittonic, but was absorbed by the Scottish Gaelic language. </p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Celtic_language_family_tree.svg/1024px-Celtic_language_family_tree.svg.png" target="_blank">Here</a> is a diagram showing the evolutionary relationships between Celtic languages. And just for fun, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/IndoEuropeanTree.svg" target="_blank">here</a> is the full diagram of languages descended from Proto-Indo-European, and a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Indo-European_branches_map.svg/1024px-Indo-European_branches_map.svg.png" target="_blank">map</a> of the extents of those languages, with Germanic languages in Red (note that English is a Germanic language, not a Celtic one), Latin languages in kinda browny-yellow (note that these replaced Celtic languages in western Europe after the Roman Empire brought Latin in as &quot;the high class language&quot;), Balto-Slavic languages in green and Indo-Iranian languages in blue, Hellenic (Greek) languages in yellow, as well as Albanian and Armenian as tiny blue and purple spots - these are pretty weird languages that link straight back to Proto-Indo-European with no intermediate ancestors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, but directly relate the terms used in your title:</p>
<p>Celtic refers to an Indo-European ethnolinguistic offshoot, much like Slavic. Historically “Celtic” peoples could be found all over Europe after the migration of their ancestors-the Indo-European peoples. One of the easiest ways to start an anthropology flame war is to ask how they define ancient cultural sites and finds as Celtic when no written records of their languages exist. </p>
<p>In a modern sense, Celtic refers to a group of languages that share a common descent from a parent language that was itself a descendent of what we call Indo-European, a language that gave rise to groups of languages like Germanic, Slavic, Hellenistic, Romance, and some others outside of Europe.</p>
<p>Celtic, as a modern linguistic group includes some but not all of what are called Goideloc languages: Irish Gaelic, Scottish Gaelic, and Manx in the Isle of Man. Another group is composed of the Brittonic languages that you mention, such as: Cornish, Breton in France, and my favorite-Welsh. </p>
<p>What this means is that Irish, Scottish Gaelic, and Manx are all more closely related to each other than they are to the Brittonic languages, who are all more like each other than the other ones. But all of them are more like each other than, for example, a Germanic language like English. </p>
<p>Of course languages borrow from each other, but it’s like looking at a group of different fish and a group of different birds. They are all different but we can infer that all birds are descended from a common ancestor and all fish from a different one, but go back far enough and you’ll expect there to be a common ancestor of all birds and all fish. This is true for biological evolution, and languages evolve in a way as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
