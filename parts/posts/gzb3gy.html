		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I often see articles about breakthroughs in eradicating cancer, only to never hear about them again after the initial excitement. I have a few questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Is it exaggeration or misunderstanding on the part of the scientists about the drugs’ effectiveness, or something else? It makes me skeptical about new developments and the validity of the media’s excitement. It can seem as though the media is using people’s hopes for a cure to get revenue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While I know there have been great strides in the past few decades, how can we discern what is legitimate and what is superficial when we see these stories?</p>
</li>
<li>What are the major hurdles to actually “curing” cancer universally?</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are a few examples of “breakthrough” articles and research going back to 2009, if you’re interested:</p>

<p>TL;DR
Why do we see stories about breakthroughs in cancer research? How can we know what to be legitimately excited about? Why haven’t we found a universal treatment or cure yet?</p></div></div>

<p>There HAVE been many advances in cancer prevention, detection and treatment. (Though obviously there is tremendous work yet to be done.)</p>
<p>Often, new treatment technologies, while genuinely promising, fail to fully live up to that initial promise.</p>
<p>Pop science and medical news reporting often exaggerates or overstates the potential of emerging technologies. Even responsible journalism is often sensationalized to bolster reader interest.</p>
<p>Finally, there are MANY different forms of cancer with wildly different causes, characteristics and disease processes. It is pretty unlikely that we will ever see any single &quot;cure&quot; for all types of cancers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Checkpoint inhibitors which that article talks about have had a massive impact on a wide variety of cancers.  They don't always work, but for some types of cancer they improved survival 20% or more.  That is massive for what probably averages a 1-2% per year increase in survival normally.</p>
<p>I work in the cancer field and a decent percent of doctors still talk a bit in awe of checkpoint inhibitors and how big of an impact they have had.</p>
<p>Likewise you have CAR-T linked as well.  That also for the folks it works on is revolutionary.  It took some cancers with an average survival measured in months and gave them a chance.  Again it is for a limited number of cancers mostly blood cancers (work is ongoing for solid tumors, but proving difficult though recently there has been some promise), but for the cancer types it works on it certainly is life changing for those folks (namely that they will have a life).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple reasons as to why. Each “breakthrough” has different struggles. One of the sources listed says it was able to unlock the genetic structure of a certain cancer or something to that extent. While it is a breakthrough to see how the cancer may develop or spread, it isn’t the whole picture. It’s similar to how you may have pictures of a particular engine, but that doesn’t mean you know how to build the engine or change it in a way that will make it more efficient. </p>
<p>Another source stated a type of T-cell was found that can distinguish between cancer cells and normal cells and would leave the normal cells alone. That is great that we have found that type of T-cell. But without being able to control that T-cell and make it do exactly what we want or to duplicate for the benefit of others, it is hard to move past the “breakthrough” point.</p>
<p>Other examples may be finding a certain drug or treatment that is extremely effective against a certain kind of cancer in lab rats. That is good for knowledge of how it may be used in humans, but human physiology is very different from rodent physiology. It can take a very long time to make the transition between the two. Or after they have made the transition to human testing, they can find it’s no more effective than the other treatments we currently have. </p>
<p>Also, at least in the case of the United States, it can take many years for even simple drugs to go through the multiple phases it takes to go from initial testing to FDA approval. Drugs for more complicated conditions can take longer as they may be more risky and so they start with lower doses and wait longer to see if there are any side effects. With a smaller pool of candidates (like with rare cancers) it’s harder to get a clinical trial going so that can add time as well. </p>
<p>All said, many of the breakthroughs are wonderful things and we can learn a lot from them, but it’s hard to translate this new knowledge into a practical form of treatment that works reliably across multiple types of cancers and the different body types.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>
<p>Many of these breakthroughs do end up being useful but only for specific use cases. For example, you might have a treatment that works well for Acute myeloid leukemia but might not work well for more solid tumors elsewhere. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some science journalists jump on pre-clinical (non-human) research and hype it up before we see what happens in humans. Obviously almost all good clinical research starts with pre-clinical discoveries in rodents, tissue cultures, and other animals (especially when doing toxicity studies for safety) but obviously not everything translates well to humans. </p>
</li>
<li>Sometimes it's a failure on the <em>sponsor</em> of a clinical trial (pharma company, university, research hospital network, etc...). Sometimes they can't perform a robust enough clinical trial or messes up data collection, or has a critical flaw in the study design that ultimately weakens the evidence (even if the study was designed to be <em>safe</em> enough to pass an ethics committee, which they are all supposed to be). </li>
</ul>
<p>Source: I have worked as a science journalist before and I have made mistake #2 here before, my apologies.</p>
<p>If you want a universal cancer treatment, you need to develop powerful technologies around genetic engineering. Small molecule (or even large molecule) treatments will not cut it as a universal treatment. Cancer is a disease of the genome and until we learn how to protect, maintain, and alter (in order to fix errors) the genome then we will never be free from cancer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the media decides what is newsworthy, not the scientists. And a &quot;we struck a major blow to cancer today by discovering and/or creating xyz&quot; is just the kind of story that grabs people's attention. </p>
<p>The ongoing &quot;here are the successful field trials over the last x number of months&quot; follow up stories, however, aren't nearly as glamorous, although no less important (and some might argue even more important). But the media wants to grab your attention and draw you in, ultimately to increase viewership and subsequently sell advertising spots at the highest possible rates...and stories like the latter don't do that. </p>
<p>Doesn't mean that good things aren't still happening. You just have to dig deep to find out the information.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
