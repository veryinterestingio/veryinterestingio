		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The complementary colors are opposites - red/green, blue/(yellow/orange) - as you noted. This is fundamental to why we prefer them together and can be illustrated by &quot;aftereffect&quot; or &quot;afterimage&quot;...</p>
<p>Essentially, when seeing a particular color, the receptors in your eyes that detect that color fatigue and strain -- as they do, they detect less and less of that color. If you stare at a red dot for 30 seconds, and then look to a white area, you'll see a green dot aftereffect. This green dot is the result of the red receptors in your eyes being fatigued and not detecting the red light in the white area -- leaving reds opposite to &quot;over detect&quot; (or appear to).</p>
<p>When we pair these two colors with each other, we in effect, make it easier on our eyes to delineate the contrasting areas. (We strain the opposite receptors at the same time). It leads to brighter contrasts and less blurring in your vision.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have Red, green and blue receptors for colour in your eyes. </p>
<p>Every colour we see is made from a mixture of those three colours, since those are the wavelengths of light that those receptors can detect.</p>
<p>When you see something Blue, your blue receptors start sending signals to your brain that say &quot;BLUE BLUE BLUE BLUE BLUE&quot;.</p>
<p>If you keep staring at something blue the receptors start to get tired, and it's more like &quot;Blue blue... Blue.... still blue&quot; and they get start sending a lot less blue signal.</p>
<p>When your receptors get tired that blue starts to look a bit washed out. If you stare at something blue for a while and then look at a white wall, you will see a yellow after-image.</p>
<p>The reason that you see yellow is because the other receptors - red and green - are still fresh and sending their signals just fine taking turns shouting &quot;RED! GREEN!!&quot;.</p>
<p>White is just a combination of all 3 primary colours. When the blue receptors are tired and all you are picking up now is red and green, they mix and give you a yellow result, which is why you end up with that yellow after image.</p>
<p>Now after you stare at something blue, instead of looking at a white wall, look at something yellow. Because your blue receptors are tired you will see a very pure yellow. Since blue isn't a part of yellow, any little bits of blue light that you see in there are going to alter the colour a bit and make the yellow look sort of washed out (since adding blue to a combination of red and green will just make white).</p>
<p>You can swap any of the complementary colours in this scenario and it still works.</p>
<p>I believe that when you see something with complementary colours like blue and yellow you find it more pleasing because you are getting a more pure colour signal of each being sent to your brain.</p>
<p>As for why your brain finds that pleasing I can't really say, but I imagine it has something to do with your brain being lazy, since most things with your body tend to be about being more lazy (or efficient).</p>
<p>It's probably literally easier on your eyes to look at complementary colours since your receptors will get breaks sending signals as your eyes look at the opposing colours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Since they are polar opposites on the color wheel it means they are the furthest away from each other, Think blue/orange red/green yellow/purple</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
