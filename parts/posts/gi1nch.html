		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whenever I'm looking for recipes online there is invariable a long story about the author's family and which family members like this dish and which ones do not. I'm sure I'm not the only person who thinks this is vey uninteresting and just wants to get to the cookie recipe but I've heard that doing this gives websites better chances of turning up higher in search results. </p>
<p>Why do these stories improve search rankings? Who decided to set the settings that caused this?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another aspect of this search engine optimization is simply content depth and key word frequency.
The exact details of search engine algorithms are closely guarded trade secrets, but we know that page ranking has to deal with two competing problems.</p>
<p>You want sites with lots of on topic content to be ranked higher than sites with less content. But at the same time, you don't want people being able to fake their way up the rankings with a bunch of nonsense &quot;word salad&quot; of keywords.</p>
<p>So search engines count keywords and content depth but they also try to eliminate sites with keyword nonsense. A bare recipe doesn't read like valid English to some methods of analysis and is &quot;shallow content&quot;. Someone's family history with a recipe reads better, increases content depth and still allows for repetition of keywords.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One factor is repeat content. Most search engines tend to view identical or near identical content as a single result, so that they dont serve up a dozen results that are virtually the same. As a result, only one of those identical pages will be considered the &quot;authoritative&quot; source of the information, and itll be the only one that gets served.  </p>
<p>If you're posting a recipe, the likelihood is that your set of ingredients for a dish wont vary much from the next guy, and you all run the risk of being collectively lumped together. If you include a long and unique story introducing the recipe first, you're much less likely to be considered duplicate content, and thus more likely to show up in search results.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
