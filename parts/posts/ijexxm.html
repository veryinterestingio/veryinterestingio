Is this true? I was doing a little of my own research but I am not sure what exact keywords I would use to find an accurate answer.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that’s exactly what happened. The 1918 H1N1 circulated in humans from 1918 to 1957. Then it swapped three of its eight segments with an avian influenza virus, and became H2N2, but that still had more than half of its gene segments from the 1918. Then in 1968 the H2N2 swapped two gene segments, including HA, with another avian influenza and became H3N2, but still had more than half its segments from 1918. </p>
<p>Both H1N1 and H2N2 went extinct in the wild when their successors became pandemics, but in <del>1976</del> 1977 a lab accident in Russia (or perhaps China, no one has confessed) released an H1N1 again, infecting mainly people who hadn’t been previously exposed to H1N1 (under 20 or so mainly). That’s called a “pseudopandemic”. (We can tell this because influenza notoriously accumulates mutations very fast, while the <del>1976</del>1977 virus was very similar to H1N1 circulating in the 1950s and didn’t have nearly enough mutations to account for its missing 20 years.)</p>
<p>In 1918, as well as infecting humans, the virus jumped into pigs, where it remained fairly stable for many years. In the early 2000s, swine influenza viruses underwent a frenzy of reassortment, leading to a hugely complex set of swine influenza viruses.  One of those groups had the HA and NA that were very similar to the original 1918, although many of its other gene segments originated from other sources including avian. One member of that group jumped into humans and caused the 2009 pandemic. It has many gene segments that ultimately originated from the 1918, including the HA and NA, which are similar enough that most of us are probably now immune to the 1918 virus because of exposure to the 2009 virus and its vaccines. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a direct answer but this might help your research by giving you a citation to track:</p>
<p>&quot;All influenza A pandemics since [the Spanish flu pandemic], and indeed almost all cases of influenza A worldwide (excepting human infections from avian viruses such as H5N1 and H7N7), have been caused by descendants of the 1918 virus, including &quot;drifted&quot; H1N1 viruses and reassorted H2N2 and H3N2 viruses. The latter are composed of key genes from the 1918 virus, updated by subsequently incorporated avian influenza genes that code for novel surface proteins, making the 1918 virus indeed the &quot;mother&quot; of all pandemics.&quot;</p>

<p>I also think you might find this review from Morrens (author of the above article) and Fauci interesting. It's from 2007 and they are saying that a pandemic will likely happen soon but they were suggesting avian H5N1 but instead swine H1N1 emerged 2 years later.</p>

<p>“This podcast will kill you” is a most excellent podcast that has episodes discussing many of the topics I see in this thread. </p>
<p>Absolutely worth checking out the hosts are so awesome. They started it when they were both post grad students and it feels like I’m listening to “delicious dish” from SNL back in the day but there is legit science and history in there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
