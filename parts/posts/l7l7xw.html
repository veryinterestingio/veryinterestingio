		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I see someone else yawn it's almost automatic that I will yawn. Even just writing this made me yawn.</p>
<p>But I've noticed that my young children don't do this. </p>
<p>So is my instinct to yawn because there is some innate connection in human brains or is this something I do because grew up around would do it and I learned it from them?</p>
<p>Maybe another way to ask this would be are there cultures that don't have this? (I've seen pop psychology stuff taking about psychopaths and sociopaths but doing it. That's not what I'm referring to, I mean a large majority of a group not doing it)</p>
<p>Edit: My kids yawn, I just haven't seen them yawn because I've of us did.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have something called mirror neurons, which  some psychologists believe are involved in developing empathy. When you see someone sad, your mirror neurons will register the facial expression as sad, and then depending on your upbringing/nurture you will act based on that (maybe you ignore the sad person, maybe seeing someone sad makes you sad, etc) so for yawns it has been noted that these same mirror neurons are at play. Mirror neurons are key to survival, think “monkey see monkey do”. Without copying each other, we wouldn’t have survived. As for your little ones, ultimately while we have the “hardware” for empathy, it is still something that has to be nurtured and developed. Think about how many adults you know that seem to lack basic empathy. As for the purpose of yawning.. Some scientists think yawning is a way for the brain to get more oxygen, but as other people have stated as of yet there is no consensus. It’s very probable that yawning is multi-purpose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
