		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a limit to how far you can &quot;zoom in&quot; on something to picture it. The maximum resolution is restricted by the wavelength of light used to capture the image. You can compensate by using a larger lens, but even the largest telescopes in the world aren't anywhere near being large enough to have anything close to high-resolution photographs.</p>
<p>This question comes up when people ask why we can't use a telescope to see the flag on the moon which is significantly closer than the planets but still very far away. Turns out just to identify that, you would need a telescope with a lens miles in diameter. If you want to look closely at planets, the lens would need to be larger than the diameter of Earth.</p>
<p>Now there are some neat tricks astronomers can use. Not too long ago, astronomers managed to take a picture of a black hole. The resolution to make this picture indeed would require a lens about the size of Earth, making it seem impossible at first. But what they did is synchronize a bunch of telescopes from all over the world then stitch the resulting data back together in software. Thus they were able to create a picture with sufficient resolution to identify what they were looking at. A similar technique could be used for getting some better precision for imaging other things as well, but it takes a lot of coordination and resources, and while it improves resolution, it still wouldn't compare to sending over a probe with cameras to take pictures at a closer proximity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cameras are made up of grids of little light sensitive squares.  If light hits anywhere in the square it gets measured and makes that spot in the image lighter.</p>
<p>Stars are much much much much smaller than one square, but they put out so much light that it's still enough to register as a white spot in the image.</p>
<p>So we know the star is actually somewhere within that square (pixel) but there is no way to know where inside of the square it is. It's a bit like seeing the lights on in a house miles away. You can see clearly that their light turned on so someone is home, but your eyes can only see a spot of light turn on and off.</p>
<p>Even if you are many miles away you can see a light turn on and off but you can't actually make out any shapes.</p>
<p>We can make a lot of very useful observations about a house miles away, we can see the light's color, is it a blue led, is it a warm incandescent light, is it a greenish fluorescent? We can even infer that someone is walking around in front of a window if the light level dips. We can communicate using the window by flicking the switch on and off to send <del>Moore's</del> Morse code.</p>
<p>But ultimately our understanding has no 2 dimensional resolution. There is lots of ways to study a point of light but the stars are still just points.</p>
<p>The surface of Mars can be studied in a similar fashion as the cosmos are studied inspecting Mars as a single point of colored light, but if you want a picture to hang on the wall you need to get closer or build a far larger telescope.</p>
<p>As to why we get pictures of Nebula from earth but not clear pictures of Mars, the answer is that while they are very far away they are so immensely large that the distance makes them appear bigger.   It's much like how how a billboard across the street can look larger than a stamp in your hand.  It's easier to photograph the billboard because it appears larger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many objects that are extremely far away such as galaxies are also large enough (tens of thousands of light years across) that they would actually appear very large in our sky if they were brighter. For example M31: Andromeda Galaxy is over 2 Million Light Years away, but its apparent angular size in our sky is over 3 degrees. By comparison, a full moon is roughly half a degree across, meaning that the full major axis of Andromeda occupies 6 times as much space in our sky as a full moon. The only limiting factor that prevents us from seeing it with our eyes is its dimness, but this can be remedied with high aperture telescopes and cameras that are much more sensitive to light than our own eyes.</p>
<p>Now let's think about planets. For a large portion of the year, Jupiter has the largest apparent size of any other planet in our sky, it varies between about 30-50 arcseconds. An arcsecond is 1/360 of a degree, much smaller than the moon or Andromeda, but not too small resolve a decent amount of surface detail by powerful telescopes with sufficient focal lengths. Pluto on the other hand varies in apparent size from 0.06-0.11 arcseconds, meaning that the limitation on seeing detail on Pluto is not dimness, but size.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
