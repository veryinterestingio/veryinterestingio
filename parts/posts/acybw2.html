		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I recall correctly from music class, though, they originally (i.e. middle ages) only had the naturals (white piano keys: A, B, C, ...) and picking a different tonic allowed for various scales with different feels, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(music\)#Modern_modes" target="_blank">modes</a> today.</p>
<p>Then the Renaissance came, and with it such heretical ideas as playing a scale, but shifted up or down by an interval other than an octave, or even playing notes outside the scale! So they added sharps and flats in order to be able to describe such music.</p>
<p>Edit: You're right, it's too technical. I don't think I'll do a good job at a proper ELI5, but maybe I can explain a couple of terms:</p>
<p>A scale is a cyclic sequence of notes with different intervals between them. Since it's cyclic and irregular, it can be interpreted different ways by picking a different starting point. This &quot;first&quot; note is called the tonic. The tonic also determines what chords are played under a melody. A piece written on X scale is said to be in the key of X, and different keys have different feels to them (e.g. major/minor) which is why you'd want this.</p>
<p>As for the second paragraph: I said the scales are cyclic. The interval between one tonic and the next tonic is called an octave. It is equivalent to a doubling of frequency: C2 has twice as high a sound frequency as C1. You shift something up an octave, you get the same thing again, only a little higher - it's quite a mind-fuck how much it still sounds the same once you start listening for it. So of course it was heresy to shift a scale by something other than an octave, therefore the notes between the naturals just didn't need to exist. Except for emergencies, look up &quot;tritone&quot; for more on that. And playing notes that don't even match the current key... well, I don't even know what to call such evil.</p>
<p>I should probably add that sticking to scales and, in general, more structure and simplicity, is a big part of what makes a tune catchy, so they would have had a pretty reasonable basis for considering un-natural (A, B, C, ...) music evil.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because scales. Let's take C major as an example. It goes like this: C, D, E, F, G, A, B and C again. As you can see, it flows smoothly, without having interuptions. That's because you can follow a formula to form any sort of scale. For the major scale, the formula is: T,T, st, T, T, T and st, where T is tone and st is semitone. From C to D you have a tone, from D to E a tone, from E to F a semitone and so on. If we apply this formula to your typing, it would really go like this: C, E, G, H, J, L, B and C. It looks quite messy. Now talking about sharps/flats. Let's say you want a G major scale. Following the formula, you get G, A, B, C, D, E, F# (here it gets interesting) and G once again. You cannot have F-G because the last step of the formula is a semitone, so you raise the F to F# to get that. If you look over it, it still has the same A through G listing, even though some notes might get sharps or flats. By using this you have a sort of skeleton underlining what you're playing. With only a glimpse over you can see that there is a F# instead of an F, thus knowing what to properly play. By your notation, while glancing over the scale you could easily mistake an J for an I or K for an H. </p>
<p>tl;dr: it's easier to read with a glance</p>
<p>EDIT: tone = whole step and semitone = half step. Just replace &quot;T&quot; with &quot;W&quot; and &quot;st&quot; with &quot;h&quot; and you're good to go!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Way back in the day, some people decided that some intervals sounded good together and others did not.  They gave letter names to the ones that sounded good together in the key of C.  The ones that sounded weird didn't get letters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because music was originally tonal, and based on scales. If you had a piece in C major, the notes you would use for your melody were C, D, E, F, G, A, B. Later, some monks decided to harmonize in 5ths (C to G is the interval of the 5th). But, if you're singing a B, then a 5th above is F#, not F. To sing F was to sing a different, dissonant interval that was not favored.</p>
<p>Thus, the sharps and flats were there as exceptions. No one at that point was thinking about 12 equally important tones. In fact, if you follow the harmonic series, the notes DON'T split into 12 equal intervals. The 12 equal intervals are a compromise so that every scale, or key, sounds as good as the others. If you had a piano tuned to true C major, playing in D major would sound messed up (Actually, because our ears are so used to equal temperament, the true harmonic notes now sound odd to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/6NlI4No3s0M" target="_blank">An example</a>). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
