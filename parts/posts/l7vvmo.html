		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cooking chicken from frozen is perfectly safe, <strong>as long as it's heated to a safe temperature (165 F) all the way through to the middle</strong>.</p>
<p>The difficulty is that if it's frozen, it takes so long for the <em>center</em> to cook through that the <em>outside</em> ends up overcooked and dry.</p>
<p>This problem can be solved by creating a cooking environment that stays not too far above 165F for as long as it takes (which could be hours).  This means using a crockpot (&quot;low&quot; for most of them is around 200F), or poaching (as long as you hold the poaching liquid around 180-200F and keep topping it up), or using a sous vide setup.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best way I have found to cook frozen chicken is to use an &quot;Insta-pot or Pressure Cooker&quot;</p>
<p>Using a pressure cooking method uses trapped steam to cook the chicken ensuring it gets to temperature quickly and also doesn't dry out.</p>
<p>Side benefit, it is fast too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason it is bad is because the outside will cook way faster than the inside so you get tough, dry meat.  However...</p>
<p>I cook all of my chicken breasts from frozen.  Usually twice a week.  I'll cook them on one side, flip them cook for a while longer, <a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQXQHgtlGP-hkWD36k0-jUnZJmXrHOf6hk4uA&amp;usqp=CAU" target="_blank">butterfly them open</a> continue to cook on the now exposed inside and continue until cooked.  Sometimes leaving them as half breasts or slicing them into strips, dicing etc as needed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
