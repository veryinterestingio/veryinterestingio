When I play videos or recordings of him meowing he doesn’t react at all. So, is this because he can recognize his own meow and if true, is this normal for all cats?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As per <a href="https://www.vetsci.org/DOIx.php?id=10.4142/jvs.2020.21.e18#B23" target="_blank">this review paper</a>, it remains to be investigated whether adult cats can recognize individuals by their vocalizations, although <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?db=PubMed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;list_uids=26935009" target="_blank">kittens seem to recognize their own mother's call from that of other cat mothers</a>. </p>
<p>Adult cats also seem to be able to distinguish between the [voice of their owner from those of unfamiliar humans] (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10071-013-0620-4" target="_blank">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10071-013-0620-4</a>). </p>
<p>So, cats seem capable of distinguishing between familiar and unfamiliar vocalizations of both other cats (at least the &quot;chirp&quot; of their own mother when kittens) and humans, but I can't speculate as to why your cat is responding differently to the cat videos as there are competing hypotheses beyond familiarity or recognition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Anyway, I'm not sure.</p>
<p>It would appear that cat's don't recognize themselves, at least not in a visual way as they don't pass the &quot;mirror test.&quot; Although some people think that cats can recognize themself through scent, audio or other ways.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
