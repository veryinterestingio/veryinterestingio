		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because the frequency of the AC current in your house is 50-60Hz (depending on where you live). When this AC current runs through a transformer in your appliances, it causes the iron core to expand and contract <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetostriction" target="_blank">through an effect known as magnetostriction</a>. This expansion and contraction happens at the same frequency as the AC power, and the vibration of the iron vibrates the air as well as other objects it's touching, causing sound to be emitted at that frequency. This is especially apparent when the iron transformer core is bolted to a thin metal sheet, as in that scenario the vibrations are amplified dramatically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>g pitch</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29" target="_blank">The G pitch is at 48.999Hz or 97.999Hz</a></p>
<p>In Europe, the mains frequency is 50 Hz, this introduces some vibration in some of the components of the device, which is then transferred to the air.</p>
<p>Some of the noise emitted is 100Hz, as here is a negative and a positive spike in voltage in the 50Hz wave, and vibration is typically based on the voltage difference between the legs of the device</p>
<p>There are multiple causes for vibration, some electric devices get slightly smaller as the peaks of the voltage push the plates inside it closer together, this causes ceramic capacitors to vibrate. </p>
<p>The bigger cause of vibrations are typically transformers, they convert the electricity to a magnetic field, and it changes every rotation of the AC voltage. This is the most dominating sound when using  a microwave, as they typically overdrive the transformers for cost cutting</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another potential candidate for this one:</p>
<p>It is also possible that what OP is hearing is signal from a ripple control device (such as audio frequency load control). These devices superimpose a control signal (typically for load management) onto the power signal. The frequency for these is usually in the range 1000-1600 Hz. This signal is very audible in motors such as ceiling fans and also in fluorescent lights.</p>
<p>Anyway, you can read about them here:</p>
