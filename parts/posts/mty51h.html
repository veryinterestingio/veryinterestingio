		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do elephants really never forget? Are foxes actually that sly? Just how clever is your dog? In a new series from PBS Digital Studios and PBS Nature, <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDrBsr_KdVw&amp;list=PLnNZYWyBGJ1EwEssKD7m6YN5gjYHxVNQN&amp;ab_channel=PBSTerra" target="_blank">Animal IQ</a></em> helps finally answer the question: how smart are Earth's animals? In each episode of <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDrBsr_KdVw&amp;list=PLnNZYWyBGJ1EwEssKD7m6YN5gjYHxVNQN&amp;ab_channel=PBSTerra" target="_blank">Animal IQ</a></em>, the hosts ask the experts, do the research and measure the smarts of species on a new Intelligence Rubric to determine if other animals can truly think. And if so, just how intelligent are they? Do all animals map their environment and defend their territory? Can they recognize themselves? Do they cooperate? Socialize? Have self-control? Understand death? Feel empathy?</p>
<p>The latest episode, about elephant intelligence, just launched this morning: <a href="https://youtu.be/Nc3mUNkJZZk" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/Nc3mUNkJZZk</a></p>
<p>Answering questions today are the hosts of <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDrBsr_KdVw&amp;list=PLnNZYWyBGJ1EwEssKD7m6YN5gjYHxVNQN&amp;ab_channel=PBSTerra" target="_blank">Animal IQ</a></em>, Natalia Borrego and Trace Dominguez:</p>
<p>Natalia Borrego, Ph.D, (/u/ecologistuntamed) is a wildlife biologist, researcher and educator. She received her Ph.D. from the University of Miami and has spent more than a decade studying the behavior of large carnivores in the African wilderness and at zoological institutions. She is most well known for her studies on big cat cognition and was the first scientist to experimentally investigate cognition in African lions, tigers and leopards. Borrego values making science accessible to non-scientists: she appears in several wildlife documentaries and her work has been covered in publications such as Science Magazine and Scientific American. Borrego is a postdoctoral researcher with the University of Minnesota's Lion Center and a teaching fellow at American University in Cairo. She was recently awarded the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior's Collaborative Research Grant and will join the Institute's Department for the Ecology of Animal Societies as a postdoc.</p>
<p>Trace Dominguez (/u/trace501) is a curiosity explorer, science communicator, Emmy-nominated on-camera host, producer and podcaster. He is the producer and host of <em>PBS Star Gazers</em>, the world's only weekly television series on naked eye astronomy. He also creates <em>Uno Dos of Trace</em>, a video series exploring diverse topics across the sciences on YouTube, and founded, wrote, hosted and produced one of the first daily science shows online: <em>Seeker</em>. He has appeared in programming across the Discovery and Science channels, NowThis, and Animal Planet. Dominguez has a B.S. in Psychology from Western Michigan University and an M.A. in Strategic Communication from American University. He lives in Los Angeles with his wife Flavia and their cats, Carmela and Barley.</p>
