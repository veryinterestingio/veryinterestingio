Depression is more than just in your mind, it is like a mental disorder that actually causes physical changes in your brain's structure and neural network, and it is those changes that can cause the other symptoms you mentioned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a bunch of reasons from a TBI (traumatic brain injury) that causes the depression in the first place with damaged dopamine receptors to “salience attribution”, a state of the brains rewiring due to the depression and the environmental stimulus (say if the conditions causing the depression cause the brain to “maladapt”), or “state transference” where the depressed patient cannot properly reframe/refocus due to projection of the episode onto future events akin to PTSD.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to NiMH, depression is caused by many factors like genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological. Genetic would be your mother or father would have it, biological would be related to life so in this case it would be something about your life, environmental would be like if you grew up in an abusive household, and psychological would refer to your brain and how it works.</p>
<p>The last three I know of well because I grew up in households where people abused me physically and psychologically first hand. Mostly it was drunk step dads not being nice. The one threw a beer can at me and my mom. In my brain what happened was kid me at the time, went into panic mode when we got to our motel for the night because I was scared my stepdad would break the door down and beat us up. Things died down to 100% up until about a month ago, when I was fat shamed for eating 5 eggs because the eggs were small for an omelette, and when the guy's wife found out about it, I had stay at a motel for the night because he was so mad yelling profanities and such.  As soon as I layed down on the bed, I was shaking a little because it was like I was reliving that traumatizing experience all over again. On top of that, the area around the motel gets real sketchy after dark. There were vehicles pulling in and out around 10pm. </p>
<p>Also during the time I had stepdads, I was bullied at school for being slow constantly so this resulted in a deeper depression for me even at one point I was close to committing suicide. The teachers knew about the bullies but did nothing to stop it much so it kept going.  </p>
<p>Harvard says that there are three parts of the brain that appear to play a role in what they call MDD (Major depressive disorder): the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>MDD is also called clinical depression.</p>
<p>The body releases a hormone called cortisol which is released during times of physical and mental stress,  including during times of depression. Problems can occur when excessive  amounts of cortisol are sent to the brain due to a stressful event or a  chemical imbalance in the body.</p>
<p>In a healthy brain, brain cells  (neurons) are produced throughout a person’s adult life in a part of the  hippocampus called the dentate gyrus.</p>
<p>In people with MDD, however, the  long-term exposure to increased cortisol levels can slow the production  of new neurons and cause the neurons in the hippocampus to shrink. This  can lead to memory problems.</p>
<p>The prefrontal cortex is located in the very front of the brain. It  is responsible for regulating emotions, making decisions, and forming  memories. When the body produces an excess amount of cortisol, the  prefrontal cortex also appears to shrink.</p>
<p>The  amygdala is the part of the brain that facilitates emotional responses,  such as pleasure and fear. In people with MDD, the amygdala becomes  enlarged and more active as a result of constant exposure to high levels  of cortisol.</p>
<p>An enlarged and hyperactive amygdala, along with abnormal  activity in other parts of the brain, can result in disturbances in  sleep and activity patterns. It can also cause the body to release  irregular amounts of hormones and other chemicals in the body, leading  to further complications.</p>
<p>Many researchers believe high cortisol  levels play the biggest role in changing the physical structure and  chemical activities of the brain, triggering the onset of MDD. Normally,  cortisol levels are highest in the morning and decrease at night. In  people with MDD, however, cortisol levels are always elevated, even at  night.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did a systematic review on the subject for my masters, all of the mechanisms are not fully known yet. What we found however was that there is a correlation between higher levels of neuroinflammatory markers and cognitive deficits in people diagnosed with depression. So basically, neuroinflammation is associated with cognitive deficits in depressed people. </p>
<p>Higher levels of Interleukin-6 has predicted poorer performance in psychomotor speed in 2/3 studies investigated. </p>
<p>Higher levels of C-Reactive protein have been associated with lower cognitive performance, however there is more research needed to investigate if there is actually a significant association between C-Reactive protein and depression. There were a number of other markers investigated but none were found to be significant-but that may be because the sample studies were not large enough to tell.</p>
<p>Basically, more research is needed but neuroinflammation has been associated with cognitive deficits, and is a reaction to depression. Depression promotes and maintains neuroinflammation by diminishing the sensitivity of the immune system to the glucocorticoid hormones responsible for ceasing the inflammatory response. But also production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (ie: interleukin-6) has been thought to increase in response to negative emotions and exposure to stressful experiences.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
