		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mammalian nostrils (all four of them!) do in fact derive, originally, from the nares, or 'nostrils', of fish. Most fish have two pairs of <a href="http://exhibits.mannlib.cornell.edu/rainbowsplungepools/images/n/nares_large.jpg" target="_blank">nare holes</a>; a forward facing pair letting water in - which eventually became the nostrils on our noses - and a pair of backwards-facing 'exhaust' holes, for letting water out. In modern tetrapods (four-limbed, post-fish beasties), including ourselves, this second set now sit internally, are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choana" target="_blank"><em>choannae</em></a>, and connect to the throat, allowing us to be breathe through our nostrils. It so happens that at some point in the distant past, this second pair of openings migrated backwards through the teeth to where they lie today - indeed, you can see this process preserved, half-way, in fossil <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenichthys" target="_blank"><em>Kenichthys campbelli</em></a>.</p>
<p>Anywho, as for the 'nostrils' you see on many modern fish, they open into a <a href="http://www.koiquest.co.uk/an10.jpg" target="_blank">u-shaped nasal cavity</a> wherein lies the olfactory bulb and other smell-related bits o' machinery. As this cavity isn't connected to their respiratory and digestive tracts, unlike us, it means although the molecular mechanisms of olfaction themselves remain the same, the physical action required to, well, 'smell' are different. We can stand still n' inhale to take a whiff of our surroundings; fish however have to force water into this cavity (usually) by moving (and can't breathe through it!).</p>
<p>So yup, in short, our 'nostrils' are remnants of fish nares, both of which are involved in smell, and in our case have retained their function through evolutionary history despite having since become connected to the rest of our face holes. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tons of great responses already, but I wanted to add this.</p>
<p>It should be noted that on sharks, there are special receptors called &quot;the ampullae of lorenzini&quot; <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Electroreceptors_in_a_sharks_head.svg" target="_blank">in and surrounding the nostrils</a>. These are used to essentially monitor for shifts in in the electromagnetic spectrum to help indicate whether or not other prey animals are nearby.</p>
<p>There is also some research indicating that they can be used to detect temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
