		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe a mirror neuron (how we send signals in our body) fires when a person watches someone perform an activity without actually performing the activity themselves. What I believe happens is that the neuron increases myelination (the fatty coating around a neuron) so that when the observer goes to perform the task themselves they can try to coordinate similar movements... BUT! I believe that the individual would have to perform the task once themselves so that they can myelinate (fatty coating) an existing neural pathway... Basically saying if they perform the task then by watching others it helps to slightly strengthen their ability. But obviously actually engaging in the task will have larger benefits. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's a very good question, as far as I understand, we don't really have a solid understanding of <em>how</em> they work, all the literature about this is essentially regarding correlations and establishing <em>if</em> the effect is there, and possibly about some implications, but not about any mechanics of how that symptom is achieved or implemented by our brains.</p>
<p>That understanding would be key for analyzing how &quot;theory of mind&quot; (your internal model of what/how/why another mind thinks) is implemented - we know that our minds have that &quot;theory of mind&quot;, we know that it's essential for various social skills, empathy, communication, even language, but we don't really know <em>how</em> that works. If we would (and understanding the mechanics of mirror neurons would be a big step in that direction) then that would be also very helpful for designing human-like artificial systems which also need a functioning theory of mind in order to cooperate efficiently with us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
