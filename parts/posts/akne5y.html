		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you can see anything there is light of some intensity falling on it.</p>
<p>As to why neon colours are more visible than other colours.</p>
<p>The colour profile of neon colours is drastically different to surroundings so is more noticeable by humans. Neon colours have very specific and narrow wavelength ranges. Normal colours can be rather &quot;broad&quot; in the colours they absorb and reflect. Neons are &quot;sharper&quot;.</p>
<p>Depending on the material fluorescence may also come into play. Many of the colours we think of as neon are fluorescent, which means that they can emit light of longer wavelength after absorbing light of a shorter wavelength. So a fluorescent colour can absorb a mix of blue, green and red light and emit more green light than it absorbed by converting the blue light to more green. So under low intensity lighting the coloured surface can emit slightly more light of a specific colour than might be expected from simple scattering alone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes, there is light coming from them.</p>
<p>You know how things glow in UV light <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_S7k3e5pzVs/hqdefault.jpg" target="_blank">like this</a>? And you notice that they are not illuminated by any visible light? There's no visible light other than emitted by the UV paint?</p>
<p>That's because some pigments/materials absorb UV light, then they re-emit that light at lower wavelengths which then is visible light. Things that <em>glow</em> in the UV light do emit light. They receive energy from UV lamp and re-emit that energy as lower wavelengths: visibile light.</p>
<p>Neon colors basically are like this. They <em>emit light</em>, not just reflect it. They are pigmets and materials which get energy from UV light and re-emit that light as visible light.</p>
<p>And UV light is present especially in natural light, as the sun radiates UV light. So for example on a overcast day, a neon orange vest absorbs UV light and then re-emits orange light, which makes it distinctly brighter and more saturated than surroundings.</p>
<p>This is also the reason why especially in natural light, normal copy paper is really, really white. They have chemicals which absorb UV light and re-emit it as visible light. Chemicals like this are also used in white textiles and some cleaning agents for white clothes.</p>
<p>So neon colors literally emit light, just like lamps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer... THERE IS LIGHT! </p>
<p>If you can see something... it's reflecting light, even if there isn't very much compared to the levels of light you're used to. </p>
<p>And these things just reflect more of that light than their other surroundings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with several things: Psychology, Biology, and Physics</p>
<p><strong>Psychology</strong>: Your mind can seem them more easily against a darker hued, plainer background. You are always looking for things that stand out, and a neon/bright color object against a natural/dark background is much more obvious to your mind. </p>
<p><strong>Physics</strong>: Bright/neon colored objects are less saturated with their respective color and have a greater &quot;white&quot; component which is the reflection of all wavelengths, and as a result will reflect more &quot;light&quot; back to your eyes making them slightly easier to see in lower lighting</p>
<p><strong>Biology</strong>: You have three major color receptors in your eyes, R G B. These receptors are distributed faaaairly evenly in the center of your eye nerve. There is more energy in blue and green photon wavelengths and this can allow for a greater activation at greater distance and lower light (in the early morning you see a little more blue and purply for this reason.) Depending on the color of the hat, you might gain an additional advantage here. </p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>
<p>Your brain is trained to look for this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>More light is reflected making them easier to see.</p>
<p>In some cases, you eye might even be trigger with less surface. </p>
