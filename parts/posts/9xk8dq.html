		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I understand that a 2-pulley system cuts the load's weight in half and reduces work but nobody seems to be able to explain to me (at least in a way I can understand) how I can pull down 10 feet of rope from the top pulley and the weight only moves 5 feet off the ground. It literally seems to me that you're pulling 5 feet of rope out of thin air, because there's no way the rope gets longer as you pull it but the load doesn't move the distance you pulled.</p>
<p>I don't care about things like work or energy or anything; I just want to know why you pull one distance and the load moves half that. This problem has caused me a great deal of stress over the past 3 years and was one of the biggest reasons I changed majors and I'd like to finally get it so I can move on to the next problem I'll never understand.</p>
<p>EDIT: I'm very much a visual learner so a diagram would be helpful, but so far all the people who have tried to explain it to me either get caught up in talking about how it halves the weight of the load or can't make a diagram that I can understand.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With a two pulley system. The rope goes from your hand, over the top pulley, down around the bottom pulley, then connects to the top pulley. Then the load hangs from the bottom pulley.</p>
<p>The length of rope from the top pulley to the bottom pulley is the same on each side of the bottom pulley. So if you pulley 10 ft of rope 5 ft comes from one side and 5 ft from the other. That means the bottom pulley only goes up 5ft.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, let's look at a 2-pulley system like I've linked at the bottom. When the hand pulls the rope 2 meters down the load only moves 1 meter up. Try to look at the load, see how there are actually two sides of rope? When you pull you reduce the length of both sides. Each reduced by 1 meter equals the original 2 meters, yet since they are parallel they only really move the load up 1 meter.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the rope “loops” around the weight you essentially double the amount of rope you need to move it versus it a single rope attached directly to the weight. Let’s forgot about the pulley part for a minute and say I have a 5 foot rope and a weight on the ground (assume for the sake of the example the weight is somehow completely even with the ground.) If I were attach the rope in a single “strand” my rope is still 5 feet from the ground. Now imagine rather than connecting the rope in a straight manner you loop it through the weight with equal lengths of rope on each side. You are now only 2.5ft from the ground. The same idea applies in a pulley. If I pull a 2-Pulley system 5ft the weight will only lift off the ground 2.5ft because it is looped.  I attached a basic 2-pulley diagram just to reinforce the idea.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Look at u\DoomFrog_ 's image.</p>
<p>The load isn't attached to the rope it rests on it and rolls away from you as you pull the rope.</p>
<p>You bring 10m of rope towards you, and the load rolls 5m away from you.</p>
<p>When you pull the rope it shortens the rope both sides of the load, so you can think of it as taking 5m from each side.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
