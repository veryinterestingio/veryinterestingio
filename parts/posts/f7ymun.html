		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That depends on the shape of the tank.  What matters is the pressure at the bottom of the tank, which only depends on the height of the column of water above the bottom.  It turns out that 34 feet of water produces roughly atmospheric pressure, about 15psi.  I'm pretty sure you can hold 15 psi with your finger, but I'm also pretty sure you'll have trouble with 10 times that.   So if the tank is 100's of feet tall or more, you should worry about it leaking.  If it's 30 feet tall or shorter, probably not a problem, though you'd be better off finding a cork than using your finger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The amount of water makes no difference. Only the height of the column of water. The taller the column the higher the hydrostatic pressure at the bottom. </p>
<p>Not sure how much you could contain with your finger. Maybe 50-100 psi. </p>
<p>For a column of water weighing 8.3lb/gal pressure=0.052 x 8.3 lb/gal x depth</p>
<p>Assuming you can hold 100 psi then using the above formula, anything over 231 ft deep you couldnt hold back the water pressure any more.</p>
<p>These are calcs I use in the oilfield all the time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Head pressure which is what you're referring to. Can be thought of as pressure imposed on a point (say x) from water  (regardless of volume) held above x where water above will cause 10kpa of pressure for each meter above cumulatively. </p>
<p>Example: a hole at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean if only 1 meter deep could be held back by your pinky finger while a straw full of water the height of the empire state building would exert 4430kpa of roughly 6 times what comes out of your average local garden hose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the shape of the tank. What matters is the pressure at the bottom, &amp; the air intake - if any - at the top. Gravity only exerts so much force, if there was no dedicated intake for air to take the place of the water, then water &amp; air would fight each other over the same amount of space, disrupting the flow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the shape of the tank. But let's assume the absolute worst case scenario - that the entire tank is only as wide as your finger and tall enough to hold all the water. Let's also assume your finger is, I dunno, 2 centimeters wide. That gives the hole an area of \~0.0003 square meters. 10,000 (metric) tons of water is 10 million kilograms of water.</p>
<p>Pressure is force divided by area so 10 million kilograms times 9.81 m/s^(2) divided by 0.0003 m^(2). That's roughly 327 gigapascals of pressure, or something like 1000 times more than a water jet cutter (which can go through solid steel like it's not even there).</p>
<p>Don't stick your hand (or any other body part) under a finger-wide column of 10 million  kilograms of water. It's not going to end well for you.</p>
