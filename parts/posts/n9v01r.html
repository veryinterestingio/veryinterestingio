		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Due to its position in a magnetic field, an object will have a magnetic potential energy. This is converted to kinetic energy as the object moves through the field. To re-separate the magnets, you need to apply energy in the form of pulling them apart, thus giving it potential again. This works in the same way as gravitational potential energy; when we lift an object up, we are working against gravity and therefore giving the object energy in the form of potential as when it is released it will travel back to a point where it no longer has this potential (the ground).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer the question I need to correct some wording here.  Magnets don't use energy. Magnets create a field and it's that field that gives objects potential energy, which then gets turned into kinetic energy.   </p>
<p>So where does this potential energy come from. Well, it was inside us all along &lt;3  </p>
<p>A little tangent might not answer the question (I think it touches things that I'm not qualified to talk about)  but will aid in thinking. With gravity, where does the potential energy come from? The conventional answer is when there is a field (like gravitational or electromagnetic) we can give something potential energy by pulling something into a higher energy state. We spend energy rolling a ball up a hill, when we let go that energy is spent making it roll down again. But something from space, that never touched the earth and thus was never pushed against the earth's gravitational field will still fall to the earth, where did that energy come from? I don't know. where did any energy come from? I don't know. But it has it, and as it comes crashing to earth it spends it. This is why it's sort of weird to think of potential energy as an absolute thing, it's sort of relative with respect to things.     </p>
<p>But you asked about magnets, why am I going on about gravity? Because I get distracted easy. But also it's a similar story, here we have a field. One which makes all the electrons spin in the same direction and create its own. This is the sort of potential energy that was inside it the entire time. Much like how a rock floating in space that's never touched earth has this &quot;gravitational potential energy&quot; this hunk of magnetic metal that never touched a magnet in its life has this &quot;electromagnetic potential energy &quot; and it spends it to make it move. To pull them apart we then need to spend energy to give that potential energy again.   </p>
<p>That probably didn't fully answer your question but it's quite a rabbit hole. And I probably made a few mistakes which I'm hoping someone smarter than me can correct. But I hope that it at least showed what sort of rabbit hole it could be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The attraction of two magnets is a transformation from potential to kinetic energy. If you have two magnets which are attracted to one another, you must input energy to pull them apart. This is transforming kinetic energy into potential energy. The magnets returning to a state where they are near one another is the release of the energy which was put into the system by pulling them apart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To explain it simply, the potential energy stored in the magnet is transformed into kinetic energy as it moves... but this is not the same as the magnet losing its magnetism / demagnetising over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
