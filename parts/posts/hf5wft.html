		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your sinus cavities are connected to your nose and mouth by narrow channels. If those channels get blocked, pressure can build up in the sinuses causing pain. If you increase the pressure in your nose by &quot;blowing&quot; with it plugged, you can force a little air through the blockage, opening the channel, and allowing the pressure built up in the sinus to release. However, it can also make things worse if you manage to force even more air in there that also gets stuck and just adds to the pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you hold your nose and blow out you're changing the aornpressure around your sinuses slightly compressing them thus relieving discomfort.  When you go back to breathing normally the pressure stabilizes and the pain/discomfort returns</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s called the Valsalva maneuver, and it’s highly used in aviation and diving since those people’s bodies are frequently subjected to rapid changes in atmospheric pressure. But it’s also obviously used in everyday application too, such as your case.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are inflating your sinus cavities and airways which allows any blockages to be released.  If you are in need of relief, other methods you can try are sinus washing, mewing, exercise, or chewing tough gum.  I created /r/sinus for for the community to share tips on these types of issues.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eustachian tube from the auditory canal connects to sinuses, closing off those and pushing pressure typically relieves clogged ears l, hence the pop. Or covering your ears and expelling pressure can help the sinuses I suppose as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
