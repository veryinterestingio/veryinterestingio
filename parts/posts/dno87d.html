		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is the ELI5 version:</p>
<p>They actually don't know your passwords.</p>
<p>Imagine you want to store some important information in your bank. You could just give it to them and trust they won't look. But what if they do? Or what if the bank gets robbed? So instead you lock the information in a box and save the key at home. Then you give the box to them. They can safely store the box but they don't know what's in the box. So when you need the information you tell them to send the box to you. Then you open it with your key, look at the information, put it back, lock the box again and send it back to the bank.</p>
<p>But how do you know the bank can't just open the box with brute force?</p>
<p>Well the box is made up of a very strong material, lets call it Cryptonite. This is so strong it is practically impossible to break it. Technically you could break it, but you would have to drill for BILLIONS of years until it actually breaks.</p>
<p>This how a GOOD online passwords manager works. So make sure you chose a well known service.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: As many have asked, how do you know this is how the service works?</p>
<p>When you use a online service that handles your passwords there will always be some level of trust involved. They can be lying or they can have vulnerabilities/bug in their software.</p>
<p>A online password manager delivers two services. One is designing the box, the other is storing the box. And when their methods is not completely public, i.e. Open source, you can never be 100% sure it is secure.</p>
<p>So as many have suggested in the comments, use two services to achieve the same result.To continue with the analogy:</p>
<p>Since the bank won't let you know exactly how the box works, you don't want to use their box. Luckily there are box-experts out there that have designed boxes that are completely unbreakable. Also they will tell you how YOU can build them all by yourself, completely for free. So take their instructions and build the box and save the key somewhere only you know where it is. Or if it's a combination lock, just remember the combination. The you can tell the bank to store the box and you can be 100% sure they can't open it.</p>
<p>To leave the analogy, use <a href="https://keepass.info/" target="_blank">KeePass</a> to encrypt your passwords, then save the encrypted file(s) on <a href="https://www.dropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> or <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive" target="_blank">Google Drive</a>. This is completely free.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Quantum edit: One thing that most people get wrong about quantum computing and cryptography is that they can (in the future) break public-key encryption, not symmetric encryption. The example in my analogy uses symmetric encryption so it will be safe against a quantum-computer-attack. Maybe I have to make the key longer but it won't break the encryption.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They never get to see your actual username and password for any of your accounts.  The way this works is that your master password is used to encrypt your usernames and passwords for other sites before they're sent to be stored by your password manager, and your master password itself is never sent to your online password manager.  So, all your online password manager has on their servers is the encrypted version, with no way to decrypt it - the only way to decrypt it is if you know the master password, which never leaves your computer.</p>
<p>Of course, this is based on how they say they do things, so you might also wonder how we know that they're doing what they claim - the answer is that plenty of security researchers have looked into these services and tried to break them.  There have been some minor issues published, but the basic premise that I described above is actually what they're doing, and if it weren't, that would have been published.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Lastpass for example actually recently had a problem with exposed passwords:</p>

<p>If you want to be safe, use a well known offline password manager, and handle the storage yourself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think about when you goto the gym, you may have a locker with a lock where you set your own key on it when you arrive.  The locker is stored at the gym, but you can access it and put your stuff in it for safe keeping, but the gym can never access it because they don’t have your code.  You can get your stuff out whenever you’d like by entering that code and use it as you see fit. </p>
<p>This isn’t a perfect example because ostensibly the gym would have a master unlock, but it gets the point across to a 5 year old.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, your information that gets stored on their servers is scrambled in a very specific way using a complicated equation.</p>
<p>Simplistically, think of it as distilling your vault password down to a number (we'll use 4), your website password to another number (let's say this is 5). Multiply those and store the answer (20) in the vault server.  This is the &quot;hash&quot; of your original password. In reality, this ends up being a string of hexadecimals (0ffa62b4c725ca....)</p>
<p>Because of the actual complexity of the math that created the resulting answer, one can't easily figure out which numbers created that answer.  But for the sake of the oversimplified example...if you know that the answer is 20, and you supply your vault password which was 4, you know the original password that you stored was a 5.</p>
<p>So when you go to a website and have it fill in your stored password, your browser asks the vault for the password hash for this site. Your browser already has your vault password since you logged into it.  It now has the two pieces of information it needs to figure out the missing information, which is your original site password.</p>
<p>Anyone can see your encrypted password and it doesn't help them one bit to figure out the real password unless they have your vault password - the &quot;key&quot; to unlock/decrypt it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
