		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of fat like a savings account, and muscle mass as expenses. If you spend a little more than you take in in a particular month, you can withdraw a little from savings to cover the difference. But let's say you lose your job and have no money coming in (Starvation). Spending your savings is only going to work for so long, but you can extend that length of time by spending less money (reducing the amount of muscle mass). This way gives you longer to find a source of food to save your life. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body breaks food down into two things, the useful stuff you can keep and stuff you can get rid of. What you get rid of is pee'd, pooped, or breathed out and what you can keep is either used up by your organs like your brain, liver, kidneys to make your body work. </p>
<p>When your body has too much of these useful stuff then insulin starts to let your cells absorb these to use and some spesific cells keep them saved up for later. Sometimes that can go haywire and you start storing way more of this reserve than you need and you get fat. Insulin acts as a little key to all of your bodies cells, letting the useful stuff your body wants to use in and out of the cells with the cells that never need much of the useful stuff becoming your fat cells. The effect isn't instant or super duper exact, what you eat takes a short time to go from your stomach to your blood and around your body but insulin is put out as soon as you begin to feel hungry so it both allows stuff into your cells and out of your cells whenever you are hungry and while you are eating. Its sort of a silly thing that just lets stuff in or out so finding out when it starts keeping more stuff than it lets out is never really known.</p>
<p>After about three to four hours without eating your body is considered fasting, you start releasing some the stuff your now fat cells have kept stored because most of the cells that needed the useful stuff have ran out of whatever they got, this is why you get hungry a while after you have eaten. If there isn't enough energy inside those fat cells your body will begin to find other things it can use like muscles which are made from proteins. Your body and your brain still need an energy source even if you are starving so it starts to make sense to take this other stored useful stuff and turn it into the same useful stuff they were made of though a complicated process involving your liver. The same way you might eat a steak or pork chop and keep most of its useful bits is the same way your body decides it needs to burn muscle when its done with fat and when youve switched over to using proteins it can take weeks before your body is back to processing the useful stuff.</p>
<p>N.B NOT for 5 year olds: useful stuff is glucose, your body has a complicated mecanism to convert proteins into two acetone phosphates that can then be converted into glucose. If your body is running on glucose it keeps glucose in fat cells (of which there are only X amount per body, they just get bigger the fatter you get). Stuff like the insulin response and ketone bodies are what you'd really want to look into if you want to really understand this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As for how long it takes to store fat, in a healthy body it stores sugar in the blood almost as soon as it hits the bloodstream, your body likes to keep blood sugar in a certain range, so it releases insulin as soon as blood sugar rises. The speed is fairly quick, I don't know the time in seconds but the pancreas stores insulin for quick release, and the liver and muscles convert blood sugar to glycogen fast, while other cells convert it to fat.  It is probably about as fast as you feel the effects of drinking a soda, which is to say really fast acting. After 20 minutes or so, a healthy person has stored all the sugar from a soda - that number is from memory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The exact answer in time varies from person to person, depending on sex, weight, height, physical activity, and even what type of food you ate. Generally, once the food is digested, and the fuel sources needed for energy during that time are accounted for, the body saves the extra (carbs to &quot;fat&quot; when they're not used for energy soon enough) and vice versa if there is no extra (gluconeogenisis iirc).  The body burns muscle instead of fat during starvation because the energy draw will be universally lower if the muscles are smaller. So to kill 2 birds with one stone, the body will make these muscles smaller, and on top of that, use them as fuel to prolong survival. Think bigger car needs more gas. If you get a smaller car, it wont have as much power as your suburbitank, but you'll spend less on gas.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Humans are remarkable in our ability to adapt, its often overlooked by our intelligence. We would not have been able to survive as long if our body could not handle almost every climate, in almost any season, like have for thousands of years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
