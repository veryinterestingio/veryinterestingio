		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a manager for the TSA equivalent in another country. I can shed some light on this for you. The main reason they make you put your laptop or any other large electronic device (cpap machines, gaming consoles, etc) into a separate bin is because of the way the X ray machines work. They take a top down and side on image of your bag. The screening officers are trained to look for IED components by doing things like tracing wires to their source or finding timers attached to organic masses. So if you have a laptop with a book or a sandwich sitting next to it in your bag it can potentially look suspicious. </p>
<p>The other reason someone already mentioned here is X ray shielding. It is quite common for people to try and hide drugs etc behind dense metal objects like a battery or hard drive. That is also why you are sometimes required to turn on your device to prove it works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I recall there was a short time after 9/11 when TSA rules required you to turn on your laptop to prove it was a real working device. So obviously that led to a &quot;laptops separate&quot; rule. Even when TSA stopped that particular requirement, they kept the &quot;laptops separate&quot; rules, probably for the reasons mentioned elsewhere in this thread (i.e., better scanner visibility, security theater).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They can, but when you have a lot of wires and circuitry all densely packed together things can be hard to see. Remember that the scanner only shows a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional bag.</p>
<p>So, they have you pull out the electronics and lay them in a single layer in one of the bins so they are easier to see on the scan.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>Batteries are so dense that they blow out the contrast in the images.</li>
</ol>
<p>Imagine you're in an unlit room with a window to a bright scene outside. If you try to take a picture of the scene outside, most of the room will come out dim. Try to take a picture of the furniture in the room, and the scene outside will be washed out. The same thing happens when they X-ray your bag. They can see pretty well inside your luggage but if there's a battery in there -- especially if it takes up a big chunk of the image -- they won't see much else as the system adjusts the exposure. And they really do want to see the details of the battery, too.</p>
<p>Yes, there are ways to address this without making me people use separate bins, some intersection of improved technology and better training, both of which cost money.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There have long been suggestions terrorists intend to smuggle explosives onto an airplane by shaping the explosives to fit in a laptop battery compartment. So they're going to get extra scrutiny.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's still a lot of security theater. Somebody says We should scan laptops separately, and everybody says Ooh yeah, that's clever. Nobody wants to be the one suggesting it's unnecessary because What If?</p>
</li>
<li>Horseshit VIP treatment. Get Global Entry or PreCheck or whatever and you can often leave your shoes on and your laptop in your bag. Like terrorists can't exploit that? But the TSA and airports and airlines love having this two tier system. It's literally in their financial interest to make it a hassle to get through security and on to a plane unless you pony up for business class or get their credit card or pay the Feds for the privilege.</li>
