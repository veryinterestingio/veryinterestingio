		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hah!  One of those things people don't think of! YES excellent question.</p>
<p>Sorry, I work with medical devices, and this is a crucial issue.</p>
<p>So lets say we have a scalpel, right?  Simplest medical device there is.  There's a number of ways to make it totally(ish) sterile- gases, steam, dry heat, gamma radiation.  </p>
<p>But as you ask- the little bacterial corpses are still <em>there</em>.  Waiting, one presumes, for tiny necromancers. </p>
<p>The problem occurs when you stab someone with the scalpel, preferably in a medicinal way. The bodies immune system works by identifying certain chemical triggers in bacteria, and has no way to know that, for example, the lipopolysaccharide hanging around in someone's heart is not part of a bunch of living bacteria, but the floating corpses of dead bacteria.  </p>
<p>The dead byproducts of bacteria are called &quot;pyrogens&quot; because they cause (among other things, such as death) fevers.</p>
<p>Where do they go?  Nowhere.  Bacteria are small enough that water has completely different properties on their level.  Beyond rinsing off gross matter and reducing bacterial load, washing can't do much.  </p>
<p>So for things like heart surgery scalpels, there will usually be a second step of &quot;Depyrogenation&quot;  This is the process, not of killing bacteria, but of removing the bits left behind so they don't trigger an immune reaction. This varies widely in complexity depending on what you have to depyrogenate- steel scalpels are easier than an injectable drug, for example.  Typically, the goal of the process is to so thoroughly break down the biological material left behind. </p>
<p><em>ok dang,  Fiddling with this post to answer some common questions</em>  There will be more of the apparently popular TimeNotTheMiles Humor, plz don't turn on me like wild dogs k thnx.</p>
<p><strong>My post on how Depyrogenation can be done</strong>
<a href="https://m.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5640rc/eli5_if_bacteria_die_from_for_example_boiled/d8g6ctk" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p><strong>General Note:  Endo and Exotoxins are types of Pyrogens</strong> </p>
<p><em>For more detail go <a href="https://m.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5640rc/eli5_if_bacteria_die_from_for_example_boiled/d8g9z8v" target="_blank">here</a> where u/aliteralmarshmallow u/Saint_Gainz u/checkhorsebattery and u/Chapped_Assets go into detail about endo and exotoxins using incredibly inappropriate words for five year olds- like &quot;lysed&quot;, and &quot;amebcytes&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Keeping on Chooglin'!</em> </p>
<p><strong>Why not make instruments out of antibacterial materials?  Or 3D print them?</strong></p>
<p>If its a metal, you can just heat it.  From a strictly technical standpoint, thermal heat is not the most efficient way to destroy the dead remnants of bacteria, but from a cost effective standpoint, it's really cheap. So you might as well use steel.  If its a liquid, the issue isn't sterility-sterile is dead germs.  Depyrogenation is cleaning up the germ corpses and the deathjuices they spit out in their hate.  Where it gets technically tricky is working with things like drugs or implantable substances.  IE- stuff that you can't just put in an oven.</p>
<p><strong>Quick run down on terms</strong>:</p>
<p><em>&quot;Cleaning&quot;</em> a medical device is basically doing dishes-getting blood n bits off the reusable ones. (plz dont reuse single use medical devices that makes regulatory professionals sad ?)</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Disinfecting&quot;</em> is using chemicals to get something purty darn clean.  </p>
<p><em>&quot;Sterilization&quot;</em> is killing all* the germs on something</p>
<p><em>&quot;Depyrogenate&quot;</em> is taking bacterial corpses and reducing their remaining structure to a point where your immune system won't recognize it and freak out. </p>
<p>*SALx10^-6 is the typical sterility level for a medical device. one in a million germs/one in a million devices</p>
<p><strong>are my hands covered in bits of dead bacteria?</strong></p>
<p>No your hands aren't covered in dead bits of bacteria.  They're covered in happy, healthy bacteria.  </p>
<p><strong>Then why wash my hands??  I would like to be filthy, but society....</strong></p>
<p>Washing your hands removes dirt and debris that carry the nastiest bacteria.  Sterilizing your hands is a ridiculous notion however- your hands are made of cells, bacteria are made of cells.  Anything that would kill them would kill your cells. Your hands, and literally everything else on the world not currently under direct gamma radiation bombardment, are covered in bacteria.  </p>
<p><strong>Does that mean the Incredible Hulk generates a sterile field?</strong></p>
<p>Couldn't say for sure, but you get to collect the skin swabs. </p>
<p><strong>Am I eating Pyrogens?  Will I die?  Tell....tell Amy I always loved her.</strong></p>
<p>Pyrogens aren't much of a concern for eating. Your mouth is filled with bacteria, so is your digestive tract, so is your skin, so is everyone you love, so is the air EVERYTHING IS COVERED IN GERMS AHH AHH AHH</p>
<p>Basically,your entire body is covered in and filled with teeming hordes of bacteria trying desperately to eat you alive, so your body is used to dealing with it.  Pyrogen reactions are a concern when you put dead-germ bits into places that don't have germs- blood, pleural cavity, brainbox...</p>
<p>Think of your immune systems reaction this way:  You walk into your living room and find a DEAD BODY.  Is it going to hurt you?  No.  Do you freak out anyway?  Yes.  </p>
<p>(Also your wife is named Mary, I'm deeply ashamed of you, <em>think about your life.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>THE EXCEPTIONS</strong> are things like E. Coli, Salmonella (&quot;I barely know Ella!&quot;) and botulism.  In that case, what makes you poo/die is the toxins left behind by the bacteria.  So if you have a piece of rotting meat, you can't just cook it until it is safe, because the toxins are what get you, not the live bacteria. However, boiling CLEAN water (<strong>NOT AN EXPERT ON POTABLE WATER BRAH DRINK AT YOUR OWN RISK</strong> makes it safe to drink because its unlikely (in clean water) that there will be enough toxins (in clean water) to hurt you (drinking clean water well boiled.)</p>
<p><strong>Um, reusable medical devices??  Like, Grody to the max + 1 4EVA.</strong></p>
<p>It depends.  A lot (<strong>LOT</strong>) of effort goes into making reusable devices safe.  A lot of reusable devices have limited re-usability. For example, you <em>may</em> be able to reprocess a scalpel a time or two, but eventually, that edge will start to fade, and the surgeon isn't going to whip out a whetstone mid surgery, are you kidding me it's not the civil war.  </p>
<p>There are, however, serious issues issues with reusing non-reusable medical devices, particularly things like lumens, catheters, shavers, and it gets gross.  It gets really, really, REALLY gross <a href="https://www.publicintegrity.org/2012/02/22/8207/filthy-surgical-instruments-hidden-threat-americas-operating-rooms" target="_blank">you don't want to read this but you will anyway and it will haunt you, welcome to my life</a></p>
<p><strong>One word.  LAZERS.  <em>PEW</em> <em>PEWPEWPEW</em> <em>BZZZ</em> Murica yahhhhh</strong></p>
<p>Take a laser pointer.  Shine it on your hand.  (NOT your eyes, hand) Not much happens.  Flesh is tough stuff, and mostly made of water, which tends to boil away under lasering, requiring lots of energy.  Surgical lasers are HUGE, and full of all sort of dangerous chemicals.  Eye surgery uses lasers because eyes are delicate.  Weak. Cowardly.  </p>
<p><strong>What happens to dead bacteria in nature?</strong></p>
<p>Tiny. Necromancers.</p>
<p>(jk they get et. Bacteria are just little bits of protein. The amino acids that they're made of aren't any larger than the ones that make cow cells.)</p>
<p><strong>I know that bacteria can steal DNA from each other, can they do this with pyrogens, and will this happen inside my body</strong></p>
<p>Not a clue, awesome question, someone make an ELI5. </p>
<p><strong>This isn't a real ELI5!  There are words of multiple syllables!  You don't get the ELI5s like you used too!  I remember I used to go to shelbyville on the ferry, of course, we called it a toot-toot chugalug in those days....</strong></p>
<p>Ok, the real r/ELI5ForActualFiveYearOldsAndNotJustaRedditMetaphorForSimplifiedExplanations :</p>
<p>Germs are tiny gross things that make you sick, and they can be in WATER! EWWWW How do we kill them? Water gets hot!  Real hot!  Wow, SO hot! Bubble bubble!  </p>
<p>But OH NO the germs left their bodies behind! Now, Timmy (Timmy pay attention) we can DRINK the dead germs without any worries, because we have strong tummies (I KNOW I DON'T HAVE A SIX PACK TIMMY OK I WORK ALL DAY DAMN). But what if you had to do important medicine on a person and open then up to help them?  Well, then what can happen is the nasty dead germ bodies can get into someones body! OHHHH NO!  Your body is really smart, and knows that germs have special things in their bodies. (Yes timmy, even germs are special.  Just like you.)  And when your body senses those special things, it goes and attacks the nasty germs- that's what happens when you're sick!  (Yes like when you threw up allll over daddy and woke him up.  Yes, he did say bad words.)</p>
<p>But your body can't tell that the nasty dead germs are dead! It sees the SPECIAL GERM STUFF and it freaks out! OHHH NOOO! Then you get sick without any nasty germs at all, and that kills people to DEATH.</p>
<p>So people who make stuff for doctors use SPECIAL ways of cleaning Doctor stuff to take away the nasty germ bits, so your body doesn't get scared and die.</p>
<p>No you can't have a cupcake, dinners in half an hour.  </p>
<p>(<strong>HAPPY??</strong> )</p>
<p>---<em>edits about how all y'all are awesome</em>---</p>
<p>Edit:  wow thanks!  Um-rude to assume, I know. but if anyone was considering golding me (its happened before) plz dont, I dont use it. Send the money to a charity or something.
Also...how does this have more upvotes than the post? U/doitsarahlee deserves your love too.</p>
<p>Edit:You are all the best.  I'm seriously flattered by the amount of interest in a pretty dry subject, and you've all been absolutely awesome- all the replies, PMs have been incredibly kind and genuinely interested. </p>
<p>You give me hope for reddit, and a disgusting amount of Karma.  Thank you all!</p>
<p>Hour 18: if you have not experienced Reddit love before, let me <a href="http://giphy.com/gifs/dog-saint-bernard-G3cYjFpMS2JOw" target="_blank">explain.</a>
Theyre all so friendly....and curious....</p>
<p>Ill try, reddit.  For you.  For the karma.  I've got an Augean stable of love in my inbox though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to the already great responses, there may be little dead bodies of the bacteria that was killed in sterilization, but evidence of their little habits can sometimes be found too. Like toxins.</p>
<p>See, milk for example. Heat treatment of fresh milk is a great idea because it kills a lot of bad guys. However if those bad guys have been hanging out for a while, they may have produced a lot of stuff that can also give you a bout of diarrhea. This is especialy problematic in countries where cows get milked in one place, and then a non-refrigerated truck takes the milk to a cheese producer 100km away. People not used to eating said cheese, will probably get the runs because their immune systems can't handle it.  </p>
<p>This is why if food has been sitting around for a long time out of the fridge, it's probably not such a great idea to microwave or boiling it, thinking that if you just kill the bacteria on that 2 day old piece of pizza you found on next to the blender you'd be ok eating it. Stay safe!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great responses already, but also consider pasteurization of milk. Same thing happens. Bacteria die, but the remains float around in your milk. It is speculated that this is why some people have adverse reactions to milk like producing extra phlegm (not lactose intolerance). Lactose intolerance is something completely different. There is a strange new surge of people drinking &quot;raw milk&quot; which is unpasteurized but milked from grass fed cows that are relatively clean. Food for thought. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Another way that dead bacteria are a problem is when you treat tuberculosis. Live tuberculosis bacteria hide from the immune system, but dead ones don't hide well, and their insides are poisonous as well, so you start to feel really bad before feeling better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
