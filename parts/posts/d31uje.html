I just want to note that I'm not asking if you can jump a car with a cell phone (obviously no). I'm just asking if a cell phone battery holds the amount of energy required by a car to start. In other words, if you had the tools available, could you trickle charge you car's dead battery enough from a cell phone's battery.</p>
<p>Thanks /u/NeuroBill for understanding the spirit of the question and the thorough answer.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most phones have about a  3000mAh battery, Those charges are energized up 3.6 volts (give or take), which means the battery can supply 10.8 Watt hours. See as a Watt is Joules per second, and there are 3600 seconds per hour 10.8 joules/second * hours  * (3600 seconds/hour) = 38,880 Joules of energy. Lets just call it 38 kJ of energy.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So, how much energy does it take to start a car? Lets say you're car is nice and new, so you might need to run the starter motor for half a second.  Your battery should be charge to 12.6 volts. But how much current will the starter draw? A hell of a lot is the answer. The inrush current to a starter motor might be 700 amps, and then settle to about 200 amps. But lets average it out at 400 Amps for half a second, at 12.6 volts. So 12.6 volts * 400 Amps = 5 kW, for half a second is 2.5 kJ.</p>
<p>Really? I'm shocked by that. So it seems your cellphone battery does have enough energy.</p>
<p>However, you couldn't do it directly. Different batteries have different &quot;C&quot; ratings, which decide how much current they can pass without risking blowing up, and I expect the C rating on cell phone batteries is quite low. Which is to say, the cell phone battery can't supply the 200-700 Amps you need to spin the motor. Furthermore, and more fundamentally, your cellphone battery is too low a voltage to get the motor moving. So you would need to have a circuit that probably was composed of a DC/DC converter, that boosts the voltage of your phone battery, and then 6 or so super capacitors to store the energy that your phone battery trickle into them. I reckon your phone battery can probably supply about 1 amp of current max, [totally guessing that number] at 3.6 volts, which is 3.6 watts, or 3.6 joules per second. So in order to charge up this hypothetical device to 2.5 kJ of energy it would take 700 seconds, or 11 minutes.  Give or take. And this is all assuming your car starts in half a second, and 100% efficiency. In reality, it might take a good second or two, and you'd be lucky to get 80% efficient. In which case it might take over an hour.  </p>
<p>So, TLDR: Most modern cell phone batteries have enough energy to start a typical car motor, certainly at least a couple times, but they can't supply enough current at a high enough voltage to do it. You might be able to build a device that could allow your cellphone battery to start your car, but it would take a bare minimum of 11 minutes, and perhaps as long as an hour, for your phone battery to charge the device.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/NeuroBill seems to have it right, yes, a cellphone battery has enough <em>energy</em> to start the car. But the problem is that the cellphone battery is:</p>
<p>a) The wrong voltage.</p>
<p>b) The wrong 'C' rate. (IE, it can't put out 100's of Amps like a car battery can.)</p>
<p>These things are possibly correctable via use of a DC-DC converter and a bank of super capacitors; but those are kind of specialty components, even today.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>But if your question was, &quot;Can I rig this like MacGyver?&quot; the answer is, &quot;No, probably not.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has wayyy more than enough charge actually.  It simply can't supply enough energy at once to run the starter.</p>
<p>If the vehicle's battery was working, but discharged, you could use the phone to charge the vehicle battery and get it to turn over.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0utNemFsl8" target="_blank">The infamous ElectroBOOM!</a> has done this trick in one of his videos, and he used only two AA batteries!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I'm an eletrical engineer, and I also worked at a car factory for a few years.</p>
<p>If by charge you mean electrical charge then yes. (that's kind of the number of electrons available to use, measured in Coulomb)</p>
<p>But if you're asking if it is feasible, then the answer is no.</p>
<p>Calculating the total amount of energy in the battery is not enough information. You need the energy to be available for use, and the rate of energy transfer/conversion over time is the power. The cell phone battery is not made to have a high power output - it is just not possible to take almost all of its energy out in a few seconds. On the other hand, that's exactly what a car battery is developed for: delivering a huge amount of its energy in less than a second. So, even if the cell battery has enough energy, it would deliver it too slowly to start a car.</p>
<p>It is theoretically possible to transfer that energy to another type of battery and then do it, but you would need more equipment then just a cell battery. And in my opinion, it wouldn't work in real life because you would lose too much energy in the transfer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The very easy answer is, that you do have enough power in the typical battery of a cell phone, and if you transfer it to something that can deliver the necessary amps - in other terms, has a low enough internal resistance - then you can start a car. You'd need a DC-DC converter though to increase the voltage.</p>
<p>Electroboom has a good video on the topic where he uses AA batteries: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0utNemFsl8" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0utNemFsl8</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
