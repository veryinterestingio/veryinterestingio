		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol is a depressant, which means it slows the activity of the brain.  If someone abuses alcohol over a long period of time, their brain will adapt and create more and more sensitive reactive chemicals to try to retain normal brain function even in the presence of alcohol.  This is called tolerance.  </p>
<p>If the person were to suddenly quit drinking, the alcohol that was inhibiting brain reactions is no longer present, but the overly reactive chemicals are still there, meaning the brain is way more active than its supposed to be.  This is a seizure.  Think overloading a circuit with too much electricity - it burns out and misfires.</p>
<p>Tl:Dr: Brain becomes tolerant to alcohol and short-circuits in its absence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you are always driving your car with the parking brake on. The parking brake depresses (lowers) your speed. You adapt by pressing harder on the gas. One day you take the parking brake off, and because you're still pressing hard on the gas you lose control and speed into a brick wall.</p>
<p>Similarly, the brain adapts to alcohol (the parking brake) by removing some portions of the overall braking system (inhibitory GABA receptors) to compensate. When the alcohol is suddenly removed, the usual GABA brakes are so sparse that the brain speeds out of control into a seizure.</p>
<p>EDIT: While seizures are the most common serious complication of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) and can be fatal, most AWS-related deaths are not caused by seizures. The &quot;speeding&quot; of the parts of the brain that control heart rate, blood pressure, and contractility (force of heartbeats) can trigger fatal cardiac events, especially in patients with certain risk factors. These are not the only potentially fatal complications of AWS. Always consult a physician before attempting to detox from alcohol, as they can advise you as to the safest way to &quot;release the parking brake&quot; slowly over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alcoholics drink, a lot. So their bodies regulatory systems (hormones, etc), have adapted/recalibrated to operating in a high alcohol environment, all the time. It has taken years for the body to find a new regulatory balance that keeps everything running while still sauced up. Taking the alcohol away upsets the regulatory balance all at once and the body may not be able to adapt fast enough.  </p>
<p>Analogy incoming:  you are outside and it is 72F out. So you are comfortable in a shirt and slacks. The next day it is 71 out, a little cooler, but you’re ok. A couple days later it drops to 70 so you throw a light jacket on top of the shirt. A couple days later the temperate drops to 69 so throw on a second pair of socks. As the temperature drops, you just keep throwing on more layers, one at a time. So eventually the temperature has dropped down to 0F, but you’re mostly comfortable due to all the layers you’ve thrown on, a little rolly polly, but upright. </p>
<p>Then suddenly the temperature outside jumps back up to 72 overnight and you wake up overheating and sweating. And to compensate you have to take all those layers off, one at a time. And that takes time. So it becomes a race between you dying off overheating versus stripping to your skivvies fast enough.</p>
<p>That is the kind of compensation the bodies regulatory system is going through when someone goes cold turkey after they have become addicted to a drug.</p>
<p>edit - correcting my temperatures slightly so I don't drop from 70 to 70.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a pharmacist at a major medical center so I'll try my best to ELI5.</p>
<p>Alcohol is a downer, when you constantly give your self a downer your body makes up for it with making an upper.   This then puts the balance of an upper and a downer in balance...think of a seesaw. </p>
<p>When you remove the downer (alcohol) you have too much upper...the seesaw tips. This causes the problems with alcohol withdrawal.  The most serious problem is a seizure (over excitement in the brain) and this can lead to death.</p>
<p>I know I will get a lot of comments saying there is much more to alcohol withdrawal than this but this was the best I can do to ELI5.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
