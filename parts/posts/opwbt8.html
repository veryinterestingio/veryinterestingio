		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Documentaries tend to talk a lot about animals and their own younglings, but I never really heard or thought about the grandparent generation. I'm sure it heavily depends on how old the species gets and if they live in a social group or not, but are there some general findings how the grandparent and youngling generations relate to each other? Do they recognise the offspring as their own? Would, let's say, a lion grandpa treat their grandson differently than any other male lion?</p></div></div>

<p>I saw a video ages ago where a family group of elephants were somewhere muddy, the baby elephant (calf?) got stuck in the mud, the mother was going mental and couldn't get it unstuck. The 'grandma' came over and showed her how to use her trunk to pull it out.</p>
<p>I can't provide evidence of this but I seem to remember 'grandparents' are often help out with child rearing because they're the most experienced in the pack/herd/social group.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
