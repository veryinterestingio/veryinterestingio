<p>But what happens in real life , in my imagination it feels like the exact same Force required even though the Math says a different thing</p>
<p>EDIT : I didn't clarify the reason I want Friction to be ignored </p>
<p>If we don't ignore Friction and heat it's no longer a fully Isolated System</p>
<p>Only 1 force is acting on the car , A magical brake force that will work without friction</p>
<p>Gravity and Normal force is ignored too because my focus in on the  x axis</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it is more energy needed. And, yes the braking force is the same for a given deceleration (assuming no drag) </p>
<p>Don't confuse the two - energy is not equal to force. For a given force, the time taken to decelerate from 100 to 50 is the same as 50 to 0. But in that time, the vehicle travels much further in the faster car than the slower car, therefore the energy expended is much higher.</p>
<p>Energy (work done) = force * distance</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Kinetic energy grows in a square. A square that's 50x50 is a quarter of the size of a square that's 100x100.</p>
<p>Going from 100x100 down to 50x50 would mean you lose three squares of 50x50, while going from 50x50 to 0x0 you would only lose one square of 50x50.</p>
<p>So to be precise, you would have to turn exactly three times as much kinetic energy into heat energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even though the speed variation from 100 to 50 km/h and 50 to 0 km/h is the same, the energy involved in the first case is three times the second one. So if you apply the same force to stop the same car in the two cases you will find that the faster car will reach 50 km/h in three times the space of the second case.</p>
<p>You need to add one more constrain to the problem, either time or space to decelerate. If you constrain by time (the car decelerate within the same time on both cases) the point of u/maximuse_ is true, but the faster car will travel more space due to the higher starting velocity. If you constrain by space (the car decelerate within the same space on both cases) you need to apply more force to the faster car due to more energy to dissipate.</p>
<p>This example is by applying force directly to the car chassis, braking will require some equation that will only add more complexity to the problem</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing you're overlooking here: at high speeds, much of the braking is done by road friction and air resistance. You can get from 100 to 50 pretty quickly just by letting your foot off the accelerator. Conversely these forces are much lower at low speeds. Therefore the actual work done by the brakes to go from 50 to 0 may be similar or more, because they have to do more of the deceleration on their own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
