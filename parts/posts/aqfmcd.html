		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nah, Einstein didn't leave off the 1/2 and his equation actually includes it but in a subtle manner. Including object momentum, the full energy equation is,</p>
<ul>
<li>E^(2) = m^(2)c^(4)+p^(2)c^(2)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a fundamental result that arises from how the momentum vector is defined in special relativity. If the momentum is zero, you get back out good-old E=mc^(2). The energy is then the square root of this,</p>
<ul>
<li>E = √(m^(2)c^(4)+p^(2)c^(2))</li>
</ul>
<p>If we divide out the mass, we're left with a function that looks like,</p>
<ul>
<li>f(x) = √(1+x^(2))</li>
</ul>
<p>where x = p/mc. If you've done a bit of calculus you know you can Taylor series expand the function f(x) easily around the situation where x is small. Physically this means the momentum of the object is small compared to its mass. Perfect! This is the non-relativistic situation where we expect Newtonian mechanics and special relativity to match together. Then,</p>
<ul>
<li>f(x) = 1 + x^(2)/2 - x^(4)/8 + . . .</li>
</ul>
<p>It's easy to see that for small x, the higher order terms are tiny and only get smaller. So let's throw them away and just keep the first two.</p>
<ul>
<li>f(x) ~ 1 + x^(2)/2</li>
</ul>
<p>If we undo the substitution x=p/mc we get ultimately,</p>
<ul>
<li>E ~ mc^(2) + p^(2)/2m</li>
</ul>
<p>The first term is just the energy you have because you have mass. The second term is the energy you have due to momentum. Or if we substitute the non-relativistic definition of momentum p=mv, we get the familiar,</p>
<ul>
<li>KE = mv^(2)/2</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore we've shown that the factor of 1/2 in the kinetic energy is well understood as a limit of kinetic energy in special relativity when the momentum is small and the object is not moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have it backwards, the real question is why does the classic kinetic energy equation you're used to have a 1/2 in front.  To give units of energy you must multiply a mass by a squared something with units of speed, but where is the half coming from? The answer, as /u/AsAChemicalEngineer explicitly goes through, is that your equation isn't the &quot;real&quot; full equation, it's just the second term in an APPROXIMATE series of terms where each term in the series has a pre-factor. So (1/2)mv^2 go its (1/2) because it's what you get when you ignore the first term (which is the constant &quot;rest energy&quot;) and the third term and all higher terms in such a &quot;Taylor/Maclaurin series&quot;. You can throw all those higher terms away if (v/c) - i.e. the ratio of your speed to the speed of light - is a very small number because they all depend on (v/c) where the second term, the one they handed you in your physics class, doesn't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nope. For small speeds E = mc^2 + 1/2 mv^2</p>
<p>For bigger speeds you should use full formula for energy.</p>
<p>To some extent constant terms (like mc^2) doesn't matter in energy, because we can only measure differences in energy, and constant term cancels out. But it was interpreted as real thing by Einstein, and proposed that mass can be converted into other form of energy (i.e. binding energy in nucleus, or gamma radiation, etc.).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answers here are good, but I want to add one more.</p>
<p>When deriving results like E=1/2*mv^2 and E=1/2*kx^2, the 1/2 pops up because you do an integral. The force applied by a spring is k*x, and when you stretch out a spring, you apply that force over a distance x. k is a constant, and the integral of x is 1/2*x^2, so that's where the factor of 1/2 comes from.</p>
<p>With E=m*c^2, c is the constant. You're never integrating over c, so you don't get a factor of 1/2.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
