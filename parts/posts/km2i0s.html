<p>Is the virus kept under control by the immune system? Is it hidden by the immune system and undetected? Is it hidden in other cells?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Remember that infections are always an arms race between the host and the pathogen. As evolution occurs, each side tends to develop shinier and newer arms against the other. So for hosts, this is in the form of better immune systems and mucosal defense barriers. For pathogens, this is better means of evading the host immune systems and defense barriers. There are several viruses known to lay dormant inside a host without causing overt symptoms because it's either dormant or the host immune system keeps it in check. One example is shingles, caused by the zoster virus. You get infected with zoster as a kid if you get chickenpox. It lies dormant in your dorsal root ganglia where it's kept in check by your immune system. When you age, your immune system wanes and at some point, it can re-emerge as shingles. That's why we vaccinate older people above a certain age with Shingrix - to boost their immune systems against zoster reactivation. </p>
<p>Herpes simplex is another example (same family as zoster). Herpes infections don't go away - you can treat outbreaks but the virus is still dormant inside of you when an outbreak isn't occurring. </p>
<p>And then there's the case of all the &quot;junk&quot; DNA that we all have inside our genomes. One theory is that they're the result of integration by symbiotic viruses. The DNA doesn't do anything that we can tell but remember that the purpose of any living (or close to living, in the case of a virus) thing is to replicate. If junk DNA is just remnants of ancient viral genetic material, then those viruses have done a great job of replication - each time the human genome is reproduced, the virus is also recapitulated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some pathogens have evolved ways to evade or suppress your immune system, but most of the time it's because the pathogen isn't active enough and flies under the radar.</p>
<p>Symptoms can't be too easy to trigger. Let's make an example with fever.</p>
<p>Your body is constantly bombed from microbes from the outside, but luckily most of them are harmless, either they can't infect your cells (like plant viruses) or they are too weak to overwhelm your immune system. If you got fever from few viruses, you would get it very often, fever evolved so it doesn't trigger with very mild, frequently occuring infections, but only when the infection is serious enough.</p>
<p>This is also necessary to avoid your own defense system damaging you: extreme, 42 Â°C fever literally cooks your protein and kills you, your immune system also causes a lot of damage if it is overstimulated, cough would make it too hard to breath if it was contantly stimulated and so on. If it was too sensitive, it would overshoot and kill or harm you when a serious infection happened.</p>
<p>Many symptons are also triggered by damage to your body rather than the presence of pathogens, this is useful cause pathogens cause damage, but you can get fever from a bad sunburn for example. Since your body is constantly getting some microdamages that get easily repaired, damage can't activate symptoms too easily or you would get fever from bumping against the desk.</p>
<p>(anecdote: mice poison kills them because it blocks coagulation. Overtime, internal micro-bleedings that normally aren't a concern pile up and they die)</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: asymptomatic infections generally happen either because the pathogen hides from or suppresses your immune system, or because the pathogen presence and damages are mild enough to blend in with normal, healthy levels of microbes presence and damage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other comment, it's worth realizing that a lot of symptoms, like fever, are actually your body trying to fight the infection. This means you can be infected, but be missing certain symptoms because your body isn't reacting very strongly, or hasn't detected a problem yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work at a COVID assessment site and have had people say, &quot;'I don't have any symptoms and feel fine, just want to be tested.&quot; However, while going through the symptom checklist some endorse nasal congestion (those which chronic allergies believe it's normal), some didn't know loss of smell was a symptom, some say &quot;yes the sinus pressure/ headache is normal this time of year for me.&quot; Those are examples of some positive covid tests. </p>
<p>I think there is some disconnect from those reporting themselves to be asymptomatic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
