<p>And if I had a vacuum chamber and started filling it with 2 parts Hydrogen and 1 part Oxygen, would water just suddenly appear? </p>
<p>Like I understand it forms a molecule and all because the oxygen has two open slots in its outer layer which the two hydrogen atoms conveniently fill. But aren’t those still two gases, just together? All in all, liquids confuse me.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A molecule is not required to share any characteristics whatsoever with the atoms it's made up from. That's why we can take sodium, which is a soft metal that spontaneously burns when dropped in water, and chlorine, a toxic green gas, combine them together, and get a delicious white crystalline solid (aka common salt).</p>
<p>As for the combination of the gasses, no, oxygen and hydrogen won't spontaneously condense into water if you mix them together. You need something to spark the reaction--literally, in this case; a spark or flame will heat the gas mixture enough to start the reaction going, and since the reaction is exothermic (produces heat) then it will keep going once started until all reactants are consumed. The practical upshot of this is, if you have hydrogen and oxygen mixed together in their ideal 2:1 ratio and you apply a spark, the whole lot will blow up in your face producing hot water (e.g. steam) as the product.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My attempt at actual ELI5</p>
<p>When hydrogen is by itself, it isn't attracted to other hydrogen. So the hydrogens can fly away from each other easily at room temperature, making them a gas. The same is for oxygen.</p>
<p>When oxygen and hydrogen are reacted together (look up hydrogen balloons for what this looks like, kaboom!) the oxygen and hydrogen form a weird V shape where one side is positive and one is negative (similar to a magnet, opposites attract) </p>
<p>Because the water molecule (hydrogen and oxygen together) has a positive and negative side, they attract each other. (like magnets!) so they can't fly away from each other easily. Meaning it is not a gas unless heated A Lot!</p>
<p>To answer the gas chamber question.</p>
<p>Water wouldn't appear, unless you do something to make them react. If you light a fire the hydrogen will react with the oxygen. KABOOM! It will create an explosion with water being left over.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hydrogen and oxygen aren't gases. They're elements. Elements, like all matter, can be solid, liquid, gas, or multiple other phases of matter depending on how much energy the molecules have. The properties of the molecule are different from the properties of the individual atoms, and those properties determine how they molecules bond, what density they'll have, things like that which go into determining what the boiling point of that substance is going to be.</p>
<p>So, for hydrogen and oxygen individually, that boiling point is very very low. That's why they're gases at even very low temperatures. But water has a boiling point of 100 Celsius, or 212 Fahrenheit, so it's a liquid at temperatures below that, and a solid at temperatures below 0 c/32 f.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Yes All solid things are just frozen gas, and all gases are just gaseous solids. Solid water is ice, liquid water is water, gaseous water is steam.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water molecule should be a gas, as similar light oxides (CO2, NO2, etc.) but hydrogen, even when joined to its oxygen atom,  gets attracted to oxygen atoms nearby (from other water molecules).
These hydrogen bonds, are not as strong as those inside the molecule,  but strong enough to retain them together: they form now a liquid.</p>
