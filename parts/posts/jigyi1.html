		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there’s a few possible scenarios for planets in a binary system.</p>
<p>1 - the two stars orbit eachother very closely and the planets are much further away.  Planets too close will get ejected by the gravitational wobbles of the stars, but at a distance they’re effectively one object.  The stars will always rise and set together.</p>
<p>2 - the stars orbit far apart, and the planet orbits close to one of them.  One star will wander through the sky like another planet, the other rises and sets normally, if the planet isn’t tidally locked.</p>
<p>3 - one star is orders of magnitude more massive than the other and gravitationally dominates the entire system.  This isn’t super likely because supermassive stars form and die too quickly to generate stable planetary systems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its possible for stars to exist in pairs, triplets, or even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_Scorpii" target="_blank">up to seven stars in a system</a></p>
<p>From a planetary perspective you wouldn't get twin sunrises, you'd either be an ice ball with two really bright stars in the sky that don't keep you warm, or have one main sun that rises and sets, and another really bright star in the sky.</p>
<p>Alpha Centauri is one of the more tightly bound binary systems that we have measured, but Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B (the two main stars) are 23 AU apart which is a bit further than the Sun to Uranus and a bit closer than Neptune is (19 and 30 AU)</p>
<p>The stars are limited on how close they can get and be stable, if they get too close together the bigger one will start pulling material from the smaller one until you end up with either a single big star or a main big star and a tiny dwarf star</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
