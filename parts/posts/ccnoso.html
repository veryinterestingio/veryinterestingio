<p>Talking about the type of ballons you use with kids. (Made of latex?)</p>
<p>I know that latex, rubber and plastics have different permeability for different gases, but I am not sure whether this permeability can be affected mechanically.</p>
<p>If so, the common stretching of the uninflated ballon before first use might result in it holding less air.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very good question. Depend on the mechanical stress you apply as when you apply stress to a material you will deform it, and this will certainly affect permeability. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>When you kick hard a ball (for instance in a direct kick fault in Football) you are likely permanently deforming the ball and this can have a substantial effect (increase) of permeability.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you don't kick hard (deformation below elasticity limit) and not a lot of time (e.g. more than 100000 times) (thus avoiding fatigue) it should be fine and mechanical stress won't affect permeability.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Another factor is the air inside the ball, which already causes some mechanical strain to the ball. As the permeation depends on the rpessure difference inside and outside the barrier layer, the more the pressure inside the ball, the more the permeation. Additionally the stress in the material will cause some streching (size increase), if you strecht a material you are likely to make it thinner (it will become longer and you need to conserve the volume), and the thinner the barrier, the larger the permeability.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When a balloon is stretched or inflated, it undergoes strain.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The object of stretching the balloon is to make it easier to inflate with human lungs. If you have a pump or another machine, you won't need to stretch the balloon. Stretching the balloon damages the balloon so yes, hypothetically, if a balloon were inflated multiple times, it will stay inflated shorter the more times it is reused.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>All things break down with use. Balloons are commonly made with rubber or latex. Balloons made of latex or rubber are from a class of polymers called elastomers. </p>
<p>Elastomers are macromolecules which have weak intermolecular forces that deform easily but maintain viscoelasticity. Even though it is resilient, each time you stretch the material, a little bit of it is broken down through either stress or friction. These tears eventually allow molecules to pass through. The rate of escape depends chiefly on factors such as how large/numerous the tears are, how much pressure difference there is, and the age of the elastomer amongst other things. To be honest, I'm not sure about the flow rate differential as I don't think anyone has really observed this but this is the logical conclusion.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I don't know about balloons, but I know that condoms are stress and strain-tested. Different condoms have different stress-strain and stress-energy differentials based on the materials and manufacturing process. The permeability of condoms is also studied from a health perspective, as it was found that condoms can allow molecules even as large as HIV through, though it occurs very infrequently.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10556699.1995.10603136" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10556699.1995.10603136" target="_blank">https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10556699.1995.10603136</a></a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>We know that the permeability of materials increase with force, such as in the case of reverse osmosis or jet injectors (or in cases where the material is permanently deformed, such as a bullet entering glass), so I think it's reasonable to surmise that mechanical stress caused by a force would in fact increase the permeability of a balloon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm in the medical field, so don't know much about balloons but I know about gloves which also use latex and nitrile.</p>
<p>We are taught to reglove after heavy use, even with the same patient.  The constant stretching and relaxing during use creates microtears that can let in fluids.</p>
<p>Stretching the balloon before blowing it up won't tear as much.  But you're talking about gases and not fluids.  I wouldn't think it would cause too much damage the first time, but if you were constantly refilling it I imagine it would be a factor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
