<p>So the thing is, if you were on the surface of Saturn and if you could see the rings from the surface (which you most probably can't because they are too small), then it would appear, as if the inner part of the ring rotates in one direction, while the outer part rotates in the other direction.</p>
<p>The reason for this is, that the relative speed of the rings in relation to the surface is different the higher you get from the surface. So from the surface it appears as if some parts of the rings are faster than others. </p>
<p>I read this a while ago in some sci-fi anthology, probably written by Asimov, but i could be mistaken.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
