		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>2nd year neuroscience PhD here. </p>
<p>Dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5-HT), and epinephrine (EPI) are all neurotransmitters used in the brain. They are released from one neuron to signal to other neurons. Exactly what they signal depends on a bunch of different factors, including what receptors are activated, how much of each molecule is released, the current state of the receiving cell, and many other things. </p>
<p>Dopamine, as some others have said, is typically thought of in pop culture as the &quot;feel good&quot; molecule. This is somewhat true but is also a gross overgeneralization. While dopamine <em>is</em> heavily involved in reward and reward prediction, it's dopamine release in a specific brain region (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleus_accumbens" target="_blank">nucleus accumbens</a>) that is primarily responsible for this action. To clarify what I mean, dopamine is also heavily involved in proper movement (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology_of_Parkinson%27s_disease" target="_blank">Parkinson's is a result of the degradation of dopaminergic cells</a>), and the cells that are involved in this function are found in an area called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantia_nigra" target="_blank">substantia nigra</a>, which does not project to the accumbens. Dopamine is also involved in lactation through connections with the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/tuberoinfundibular-pathway" target="_blank">tuberinfundibular nucleus</a>. In short, dopamine does a lot of different things in the brain.</p>
<p>I'm probably going beyond the ELI5 scope here, but I wanted to throw out an example of direct evidence that the &quot;feel good&quot; status of dopamine is misleading and incomplete.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRc_W9xrLW8" target="_blank">Here's a short youtube video that gives good but brief background on dopamine, before going on to talk about a recent paper's findings.</a> There's a great summarizing sentence at 3:27 as well. </li>
</ul>
<p>Norepinephrine is another neurotransmitter, and one that is involved in sleep-wake cycles, as well as attentiveness. It's typically thought that NE levels operate on an <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262609173/figure/fig2/AS:202797980098576@1425362214955/Relationship-of-dopamine-norepinephrine-to-prefrontal-function-At-lower-than-optimal_W640.jpg" target="_blank">inverted-U-type graph</a> (think Goldilocks) in that too little NE is bad (no focus, no attention) but too much NE is also bad (overly fixated on one thing). As with all things in physiology, you want things to be juuust right, more is not necessarily better. </p>
<p>Serotonin is thought to regulate mood, and to some extent, anxiety. The first line of antidepressants is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor" target="_blank">selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</a>, which block reuptake of serotonin by the serotonin transporter and leave it floating in the synapse longer. While the idea that acutely increasing serotonin in the brain is antidepressant is not true, it likely has some sort of role in this process. </p>
<p><del>Have to go back to work now, will return to flesh this out some more and provide some links.</del>
Added some links.  </p>
<p>Edit: thought this was r/askscience and not r/ELI5  sorry. If I had realized it was r/ELI5 I would've simplified my answer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Serotonin, dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine are four of the main neurotransmitters in the brain. When they are released, typically they alter one’s mood, although they do much more than that.</p>
<p>Dopamine is the standard feel-good chemical. When you get an A on a test, or find $100 on the ground, your brain shoots a little bit of dopamine out, causing a quick burst of happiness. Dopamine exists so that we feel rewarded for doing things that help our survival (or that we like, I guess.)</p>
<p>Serotonin is a neurotransmitter which affects both mood and cognition/memory. It is released in steady amounts every day and helps you to focus, stay awake, talk to your friends, or remember someone’s name. It also makes you happy.</p>
<p>Norepinephrine is a neurotransmitter which aids in fine motor control. It helps you control your eyes, jaw, and other muscles in the body. If a lot of it gets released, your eyes may twitch or wiggle back and forth, and your jaw may lock up.</p>
<p>As for epinephrine, unfortunately, I’m not sure.</p>
<p>Source: I’m a drug fanatic and understand a lot about psychoactive, serotogenic drugs and how they work, such as MDMA, classical psychedelics, and opioids.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn’t say those four are the “main” neurotransmitters in the brain, they are more like the special four that have their own unique functions. Glutamate and GABA are actually the two most common neurotransmitters in the human brain, but they are the “basic” ones so nobody really talks about them as much. Glutamate is the excitatory neurotransmitter which stimulates other neurons to fire, and GABA is the inhibitory neurotransmitter that prevents other neurons from firing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Serotonin is a regulatory neurotransmitters keeping you feeling normal, affects the release of a variety of other neurotransmitters and is related to social bonding</p>
<p>Dopamine is responsible for motor control and behavioral sensitization. Makes you feel good and is also responsible for things such as social bonding, drug addiction, cognition, and pleasurable feelings</p>
<p>Epinepherine and norephinepherine are very similar however they do have some differences, both are vasoconstrictors and are released in a stimulating situation. Effects heart rate, mucle contraction, stimulation, and wakefullness</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>MCAT studying, they go into a lot of detail on the neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>A good rule of thumb is that neurons in your body have receptors for a variety of neurotransmitters, but each receptor might cause the neuron to do something different. For example, dopamine acting on an interneuron in the brain will cause that neuron to do something different than if dopamine attached to a motor neuron. The same is true for every cell in your body. Your liver treats epinephrine differently than your eyes do. We sometimes can tell what neurotransmitters do based on where they are found in high concentrations, and by adding radiographic material in some precursors to neurotransmitters that our body metabolizes, then track with an MRI.</p>
<p>Epinephrine and Norepinephrine function as part of the sympathetic nervous system, also known as the &quot;fight or flight&quot; response. They come from your adrenal glands (on top of the kidney). Epinephrine moves throughout your blood and activates different cells in different ways: your liver releases sugars, your eyes dilate, your digestion slows, and a lot of other stuff to increase your senses and ability to act quickly. Norepinephrine is a more local transmitter, but basically does the same stuff. Norepinephrine is also highly linked to alertness and wakefulness. Low levels are linked to depression, and high levels are linked to mania.</p>
<p>Dopamine is very similar in structure to epi and norepi (they are all a category called catecholamines) but it's in the brain. Its part of the reward pathways, and is also found in high concentrations in the parts of the brain that are responsible for posture (low dopamine is linked to Parkinson's).</p>
<p>Serotonin is very active in our prefrontal cortex and the limbic system of the brain, aka the mood/emotion centers. As others have said, serotonin is responsible for a lot of different mood disorders based on how much a person has. One important thing: when we talk about how much of a neurotransmitter someone has, there are a bunch of different processes that factor in. How much gets released, how much actually binds to the receptors, how long does the neurotransmitter stay in the synaptic cleft (the space between neurons, can dictate how long a &quot;feeling&quot; lasts), and how much gets re-absorbed back into the original neuron so it can be re-used later (compared to how much breaks down in the synaptic cleft). </p>
<p>Different anti-psychotics or other brain drugs do a lot of different things in the brain. Neurons use calcium, sodium, and potassium to fire signals, so different medications can influence how many of these ions go into nerve cells. For example, Lamictal is an anti-seizure drug in high doses by regulating how calcium channels work in the brain, basically making them more consistent. In lower doses, it can stabilize someone's mood and is used for bipolar patients. We think it might make serotonin release more consistent, as opposed to other anti-depressants that make serotonin last longer in the synaptic cleft.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
