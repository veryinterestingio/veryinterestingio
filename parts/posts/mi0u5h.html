		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The fancy tripod is probably a total station. What it's doing is sending an infrared signal out at a reflector, and measuring the time it takes for the reflector to bounce the signal back to the device. That allows it to figure out how far away the reflector is from the device. It can also very precisely detect the angle between two different points. </p>
<p>If you set the total station up near a point whose coordinates you know absolutely (such points are called survey monuments,) then you can work out the coordinates of any other point that you can see. The total station can work out its own coordinates based on its distance and angle from the monument, and then can work out the coordinates of other things based on that.</p>
<p>Surveyors use it for all sorts of things - is the building straight. Are we building the forms in the right place. Did we pour enough soil into the foundation. Etc. etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I saw a guy use what must of been a total station (from other comment) to straighten a building. They were putting up a 25 story building. When they got to about 5 floors they had the guy with the tripod at a pre-marked point on the other side of the street giving directions to a guy on the 4th floor that had cross shaped cables with turnbuckles. He would spot and then give directions so the steel girders could be plumbed to perfectly on plumb. Pretty cool operation. I think they did that about every 5 floors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That fancy tripod has a rotating laser that’s been leveled.</p>
<p>You take a ruler with a sensor on it, and move the sensor up or down the ruler, so that the end on the ruler it at the desired level.</p>
<p>You then can go to any point (within the tripod’s  sight) and measure the distance from the end of the ruler to the ground.</p>
<p>Letting you know if your ground needs to go up or down, so when the laser shines into the sensor it makes a sound letting you know you are at the correct hight.</p>
<p>This is what helps make houses level even if the house is a slope.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
