		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pretty interesting question, I never thought about it. It seems this was indeed investigated. Turns out the molecular turnover rate of lipids stored in adipocytes (fat cells) depends on many factors like subcutaneous vs visceral fat, region in the body, whether the subject is healthy, overweight, obese, or morbidly obese, etc. It seems the age of lipids ranges between 2 and 2.5 years. The human adipocytes aren't that long lived, they only last about 10 years before kicking the bucket, and during this time, they change triglyceride content about 6 times. You see, very few things in the body are molecularly constant, because part of being alive means being highly dynamic, for example, we constantly destroy and remake proteins, even if they're still functioning well, our cells constantly divide or are replenished by stem cells, and those cells that are quiescent and never divide nor have stem cells to replenish them, still end up with a high molecular turnover rate because of the degradation and construction processes. Some things do stay constant, like the DNA in a cell that never divides, or some structural parts of teeth, and so on. But for adipocytes, they aren't like that, and even during one lifetime of such cells, the fats are constantly getting broken down halfway and released for use by the body and fats or carbs or whatever from the dietary intake are used to replenish them, whether you're fat or not depends on which one of these processes is happening more. If they're equal, you stay the with the same fat content (but not at the molecular level), if breakdown is higher, you lose weight, and if the other way around, you gain weight. And these processes are also getting regulated by countless hormonal pathways (the end result is simply the culmination of the countless processes tugging in different directions), so it's not even as simple as energy input and energy output, everything needs a signal to happen in the body.</p>
<p>Here is the paper I looked at to answer this btw: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15253" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15253</a></p>
<p>Edit: And here is another: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21947005/" target="_blank">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21947005/</a> where they find mean age of lipids is 1.6 years.</p>
<p>Edit2: okay u/KanadianNinja is right, let me add a simpler TL;DR.</p>
<p>TL;DR: fat cells, like most other cells and tissues in our body, are constantly changing at the molecular level. The fat molecules themselves in those cells only remain there for about 1.6 to 2.5 years. The fat cells themselves only live on average for 9.5 years. So, fat cells change approximately their whole fat content 6 times during this short life of theirs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>How exactly does our body store fat?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fat cells are created by the body when there is an excess amount of food available and it needs to be stored for use later. Once a fat cell is created, it can grow or reduce in size depending on how many molecules of fatty acid are stored in it. But the fat cell itself doesn't die, once it has been created.</p>
<p>This is why people who got fat as children find it extremely tough to lose fat later on.</p>
<p>For the second part of your question: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>does the body keep the same exact fat molecules , or does it replaced every once in a while?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The body continuously requires energy to function. The digestive system only works after you've eaten. The food you ate gets converted into glucose so that all your cells can be fed. But there's only a certain amount that's required by your cells, and your blood maintains that adequate level all through. If you've eaten more than what is required, your body will convert all that glucose to fatty acids and store it in your fat cells. When the blood sugar begins to fall a few hours after eating, your fat is then converted back to glucose to keep feeding the cells  (Except, most people never allow this process to happen because they keep stuffing their faces). </p>
<p>But normally, the fatty acids (lipid molecules) in your fat cells get created and replaced all the time but your fat cells remain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I got a copy from my library. Absolutely eye-opening about how fat is stored and retrieved from fat cells as well as many other facts about fat I've never heard of, for instance do you know fat is actually an organ and that fat cells make a wide variety of hormones? These facts are not easy to describe in a few words.</p>
<p>The book us very well written and the author makes complicated biological processes very easy to understand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR; It is estimated that the fat in a single fat cell will have fully removed and fully replaced the fat molecules with new fat molecules over 2-3 weeks. </p>
<p>This is from the physiology textbook by Guyton. This textbook is the bible for physiology.</p>
<p>Fat is metabolized in your body at a constant rate regardless of your eating habits, i.e. starving, fasting, not fasting, etc.</p>
<p>Fat is metabolized at a constant rate means that your fat cells are constantly releasing fatty acids (the fat molecules used for energy) into your blood for the other body cells and liver to consume as energy. It is estimated that the fat in a single fat cell will have fully removed and fully replaced the fat molecules with new fat molecules over 2-3 weeks. </p>
<p>Imagine fat cells like a bucket of water that is leaking from the bottom at a constant rate so that if it were filled to capacity it would be completely emptied by the end of the 3rd week.<br />
Your fat cells can, however, be filled at a variable rate, it could be slower or faster. So, as new fat molecules enter the cells and mix with the old fat molecules they will dilute the old ones. As time goes on to about 2 - 3 weeks, the old fat molecules would have been fully diluted and replaced by new ones. However, it is important to note that the fat that is being replaced doesn't necessarily all come from new food sources. It could be coming from other fat cells throughout the body that are also releasing their fat molecules.   </p>
<p>This is why some drugs that are fat soluble, like THC (from cannabis) ,can be found in the blood many days after the person has consumed the drug. For THC, it is detectable up to 4 weeks after it is consumed because it attaches to fatty molecules and circulates the blood with them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

What makes you gain or lose fat over time is how you tip towards losing or gaining side of this reaction with stimulus: calorie balance, exercise, hormones, etc.
Same goes for protein balance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
