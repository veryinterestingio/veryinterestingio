		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>because the piratebay is managed in an much more decentralized fashion. take down the person behind the site, and you take down the site. if there isn't an single person behind the site but an group that suddenly becomes insanely hard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a bully at school. It's the same one each day, taking the lunch money of the same handful of kids.<br />
You take note that kids seem bullied, and it's very easy to identify who the bully is, after all you only have to talk to a handful of kids to get something of note, plus everyone is pointing the same direction. You do something about it. Now you shut down KickAssTorrents.</p>
<p>But imagine that you have a school, a very very large school, and there's <em>hundreds</em> of bullies. They're all called Marc. So every time you get someone to tell you who bullies them, it's 'Marc'. They also all look very similar, so you never know who did it today. You never know who is actually to blame.<br />
Worse yet, some of these Marcs live in other states, and due to bureaucracy you can't even get a hold of their parents! And every time you finally shut someone down, a new Marc transfers over to your school! :o<br />
That... is basically Pirate Bay.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TPB doesn't host any of the content it serves, not even the .torrent files, so the whole site can be packaged down to a reasonable sized .zip file and redeployed on a new host under new domain whenever the old one gets shut down. Therefore I don't think they even try very hard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
