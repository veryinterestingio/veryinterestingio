		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is. We just aren't very good at it because there isnt much research being done into it. There really isnt any application to perfecting that kind of technology and a LOT of ethical issues to navigate if you're going to try it with humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is also the question of giving someone a version of &quot;Locked in Syndrome&quot; you have to, have to, be able to give someone the ability to interface with the world, to receive stimuli and to communicate with others. We don't have the technology, yet, to be able to ensure that a person who becomes a brain in a jar has the ability to speak, feel, touch, taste, smell and communicate. If we kept someone alive in a jar without any of that, it would be the most heinous kind of solitary confinement imaginable, one which, the mind inside the jar wouldn't be able to escape.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's something else to consider besides the technical limitations which are fairly numerous. We don't have any kind of long term stable neural interface. (Existing ones just scar over and loose usefulness anywhere from days to weeks) Even if you could technically keep a brain alive what would you do with it?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is theoretically possible - it's what our body does every second of every day, after all - but the conditions to keep the brain alive are so specific and incompletely understood (just look at how damaging mere seconds of oxygen/nutrient deprivation are to stroke or drowning victims) that it'll be many, many years before we could do it safely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
