		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You use different muscle groups when standing and squatting, so ones that were stretched will compress when squatting and vice versa. It also shifts your center of balance so your back muscles have a different strain on them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Relaxing for the muscles that were holding your weight and now aren't. Strenuous for the other muscles that are now holding your weight and weren't before. Especially since those squat muscles have a lot less practice holding your weight than the standing muscles do, so the strain on squatting builds quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You’re relaxing standing muscles, but stretching muscles that are all tight from not squatting.</p>
<p>If you squat more, maybe in the shower or wherever throughout the day, you can just squat and feel relieved from standing.</p>
<p>I’ve heard the term ‘third-world squat’ used to describe simply squatting with you heals down. It takes time to do it, and (sorry) it’s harder if you’re fat in the midsection, but you just gotta stretch and maintain balance to do it. Once your feet are flat on the ground, it’s a relaxing position. It also eliminates the need for balance, because you’re planted.</p>
<p>Someone once tried saying there’re muscular differences in people from different parts of the world, but that’s 100% bullshit. You just need to stretch and get used to squatting. </p>
<p>I still prefer chairs, but you never know when it’s gonna be time to squat. You want to be able to do that. Don’t let life catch you slipping.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
