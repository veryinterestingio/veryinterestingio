		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is to my understanding that UVA radiation is what triggers melanocytes to produce melanin. My skin is relatively tan naturally and growing up (Los Angeles) I rarely applied sunblock and never got burned. When I was 18 i started working outdoors for 9 hours at a time and noticed I began to develop sun burns; as a result, I did some googling and started applying sun block daily. Its been about a year now since I started applying daily sun block and it seems as if any day I don't apply it my skin burns. Growing up I could go hours and hours in the sun without being burnt and now I burn incredibly quickly. Is this a result of  permanent damage done to my skin through the years or is this a result of my daily use of sunblock preventing melanocytes from producing the bodies natural sun block, melanin?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>tl;dr Does sunblock prevent melanin from forming, therefore,  making you weaker to the sun when you do not apply sunblock</p></div></div>

<p>That said, as public service advertising has drilled in to me (Aussie) for as long as I can remember, &quot;tanning is skin cells in trauma, theres nothing healthy about a tan.&quot;</p>
<p>So while consistent sunscreen use can make you more pale, which means you are more likely to burn, being more tanned and tanning rather than burning is not at all better for you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If you are pale, you are at risk of being burned, sure. Stay pale, maintain risk of burning when you forget to wear sunscreen. </p>
<p>But for skin damage including cancer - no. That's a lifetime exposure risk, and is not related to burning. The melanin in your tan is not protecting you from skin cancer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We know sunscreen blocks UV rays thereby reducing the risk of skin cancer, but we don’t know if the chemicals themselves are healthy to put on our skin over a long period of time.  There is a chance they get absorbed and are carcinogenic themselves.  Not to mention sunscreen is uncomfortable, oily and smelly.</p>
<p>I think a better option is to find clothing that covers and protects from UV.  Look for clothes with listed UPF over 30.  I’m a big fan of “sun hoodies” and “fishing hoodies” for hiking, and even wear sun gloves because I burn easily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
