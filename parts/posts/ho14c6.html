		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I frequently run afoul of others who believe that visitors from deep space are buzzing the countryside and occasionally hauling innocent burghers out of their bedrooms for unapproved experiments. I doubt this is happening.</p>
<p>I have written 600 popular articles on astronomy, film, technology and other enervating topics. I have also assaulted the public with three, inoffensive trade books on the efforts by scientists to prove that we're not alone in the universe. With a Boulder-based co-author, I have written a textbook that I claim, with little evidence, has had a modestly positive effect on college students. I also host a weekly, one-hour radio show entitled Big Picture Science.</p>
<p>My background encompasses such diverse activities as film making, railroading and computer animation. A frequent lecturer and sound bite pundit on television and radio, I can occasionally be heard lamenting the fact that, according to my own estimate, I was born two generations too early to benefit from the cure for death. I am the inventor of the electric banana, which I think has a peel but has had little positive effect on my lifestyle -- or that of others.</p>

I don't mean direct contact but something like finding bacteria on Mars or a radio signal clearly emitted by conscious aliens.<br />
Good luck with your mission!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Colombus landed in America, which didn't turn out well for the native americans&quot;</p>
