I found some questions in this subreddit, but they are from many years ago, and I was wondering about the current understanding/latest studies in the subject. And wether or not it is an accepted theory.</p>
<p>I saw a lot of info about complete deprivation of sleep (all nighters). But I'm more interested in chronic sleep loss and subconcious sleep deprivation. For example, if my body naturally needs 8 hours of sleep, and I sleep 7 for months, with some days of 6 hours splashed around, how would that affect my sleep debt and how could I recover?</p>
<p>How much sleep is needed to recover from a months old accumulative sleep debt? Is a few days of unrestrained sleep enough? Or are multiple days of extra sleep across a longer span of time required?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm currently studying the effects of chronic partial sleep deprivation due to electronic media use on cognitive fatigue and preformance. I'm in the early stages of this study and I found an article that has been helpful for teasing apart the idea of chronic sleep restriction (I think it's also called chronic partial sleep deprivation) versus acute sleep deprivation. </p>
<p>In here it was found that psychomotor vigilance task preformance of people who slept 6 hours per night declined over a couple of weeks to the point where they were roughly equivalent to the participants who were totally deprived of sleep for 2 nights. But the chronic partial sleep deprivation crowd were less aware of their preformance deficit (or were less subjectively sleepy) than those who were totally deprived of sleep. Interesting conclusions here.</p>

<p>Hello! I am a doctor in the U.K. and I did a rotation in a sleep disorder ward.</p>
<p>Chronic sleep deprivation or sleep debt has been shown to be a risk factor in developing a variety of diseases - Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and heart disease are the big ones.</p>
<p>One of the functions of sleep is to breakdown the waste proteins that accumulate in the brain during the day and if you are consistently running on very low sleep this function will be impaired. This is neuroinflammatory implications which can lead to Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s.</p>
<p>There are also big links between having sleep-wake disorders (stuff like narcolepsy) and Parkinson’s.</p>
<p>The heart disease risk is mostly to do with obstructive sleep apnoea and the constant hypoxia overnight which can damage your heart. This is actually a very severe risk and if anyone has obstructive sleep apnoea I would urge them to see a doctor and also lose some weight because that will help tremendously.</p>
<p>Here is an interesting study on sleep disorders and Parkinson’s for anyone who’s interested.</p>

<p>Edit: sorry, I realise I didn’t answer part of your question. </p>
<p>Having a couple nights of less sleep is not going to do anyone any serious harm. Ideally you should aim for 7-8 hours per night. There is a very small percentage of people who need less but it’s unlikely to be anyone reading this. </p>
<p>There are no hard and fast rules in recovering from sleep debt. A good nights sleep will probably clear up a lot of it but only getting 4 hours of sleep every night will eventually catch up to you, it just might be in an old age disease but if you don’t take care of yourself then that may happen sooner than then should.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have asked a complex question here… </p>
<p>(for reference I hold a BRPT and ACP-sleep and lecture on the pathophysiology of sleep disorders at a post grad level) </p>
<p>Firstly, the definition sleep deprivation or restriction can vary across the literature. These terms can swing wildly from one extreme of insomnia through to the other ends go the spectrum: partial sleep restriction (eg your alarm waking you for work or staying up late on reddit which postpones your bedtime a little)</p>
<p>Your sleep needs will vary, night on night. But over a longer period and across a broad population we tend to suggest that most of us need between 7-9hrs and typically land on 8 as a general number. This changes as you age too (more as a young adult, less as an elderly adult). </p>
<p>Quality vs quantity plays a role here too. But you can’t easily compare between the two either. What I mean is that a good 4hrs of consolidated sleep with healthy sleep cycling is not able to be directly compared to 6hrs of fragmented sleep. At least not easily. </p>
<p>As others have have noted. the literature suggests that an acute sleep debt can be repaid fairly quickly. It’s not like for like either, in that missing 10hrs over a week could potentially be accounted for with an extra couple of hours over a day or two. However the long term effect of chronic sleep restriction may have a lasting impact, particularly relating to features of metabolic syndromes, neurobiology and inflammation. </p>
<p>The consensus is that these impacts can be reversed for the most part, however some lasting damage may occur but it’s probably relative to the patients age, health and other comorbidities more broadly. This is the part of your question I don’t feel I have seen enough literature to answer with confidence. </p>
<p>Your question seems to relate to mild, and partial sleep restriction and then being able to make up this sleep debt… firstly, yes sleep debt is an accepted theory (I don’t think I’ve heard it called a theory, I’ve always considered it a given). And secondly yes there is quite a bit of literature that looks at making up for sleep restriction, often using catch up sleep on weekends as the model being studied. My understanding is providing you avoid significant chronic long term sleep deprivation, regular catch up sleep is likely to be sufficient to avoid significant health implications from mild cyclic sleep restriction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
