		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On each taste bud, called a papillae, there's a few bundles of cells that actually act as a mediator between your mouth and the gustatory nerves that actually send pulses to your brain.  On those taste receptor cells, there's 4 different proteins that can bind to different things.</p>
<p>TAS1R1 and TAS1R3 bind together and are activated by Left chiral amino acids L-glutamine especially. (This is why monosodium glutamate elicits the flavor it does).</p>
<p>TAS1R2 is the type 2 receptor, it binds to sugar types. Triggered by Glucose, and Aspertame.</p>
<p>TAS1R3 is the third one, it can detect sugars and other chemicals on it's own, but it tens to bind with TAS1R1 and TAS1R2 for different effects.</p>
<p>TAS1R4 type 4 taste receptor protein binds to sour chemicals, and some 'sugar substitutes'</p>
<p>None of them interact directly with a nerve. They have protein mediated cascades through those taste receptor cells. There's one specifically for NaCL which is a sodium channel, but not exactly the same as the nerve sodium channel. The protein is called ENaC. </p>
<p>There's better, and more concise information here.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can't have a solution containing ions of only one charge, there has to be a counter ion to make it electrically neutral. </p>
<p>Neither hydrogen chloride (hydrochloric acid) nor things like sodium hydroxide or other sodium salts taste salty. In (very!) dilute solution HCl tastes acidic/sour, NaOH tastes bitter.</p>
<p>Looking at elements in nearby positions in the periodic table, sodium bromide does apparently taste salty, but so does lithium chloride. Potassium chloride also tastes salty but potassium bromide has a variety of sweet/bitter/salt tastes depending on concentration. So it's the basic overall similarity rather than any specific ion.</p>
<p>I strongly don't recommend tasting chemicals, the above comes from internet data, except for the taste of highly dilute acids.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All these folks talking about how only potassium chloride tastes salty have never had salmiak. Salt flavored licorice with ammonium chloride.  Also did you know if you open your mouth, stick out your tongue and pantomime shaking salt onto it you can trick your brain and taste salt? Try it in the mirror!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
