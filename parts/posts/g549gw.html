		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what you mean by &quot;trouble.&quot; In most cases, trouble means demonitization, the person uploading the video no longer receives money from YouTube for the video, the money goes to whoever makes the copyright claim. </p>
<p>If you are a creator that is actually trying to make money off of YouTube video content this is a problem. But if you're just a fan, don't care about making money (and possibly never even monitized the channel to begin with), it doesn't matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lyric vids quite often end up having the entire audio track removed by YouTube. So they're not immune, they're just usually small fish compared to the vids you're talking about in terms of views.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
