		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In theory yes, bacteria can be crushed just like anything. When using microscope slides it's possible to crush them if you don't do it properly. But those are incredibly smooth surfaces. Your fingers are not. There are visible grooves and grooves and imperfections so small you can't see them. Your fingers also have a fair bit of give to them as do the cells that make them up. So most, if not all, of the bacteria present will not experience much force. Not to say it couldn't happen in the right circumstances though. </p>
<p>To have a good chance of crushing them you need a material that is rigid and so flat that they won't just be pushed into grooves or holes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the other comments address your first question well, but I wanted to add that it is possible to use mechanical forces to kill bacteria.  It's been discovered relatively recently that some insects use a purely mechanical system of nanostructures to kill surface bacteria without having to rely on chemicals or other methods (<a href="https://www.nature.com/news/insect-wings-shred-bacteria-to-pieces-1.12533" target="_blank">article</a>, and original <a href="https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0006-3495%2813%2900003-9" target="_blank">source</a>).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes mechanical forces are used to break open bacteria in laboratories. Depending on the application two common techniques are the French press (same name but not for making coffee) which forces bacteria through a tiny valve killing them with shear forces or a sonicator which uses intense sound waves to kind of shake them apart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>1- No, as to why see 2</p>
<p>2- When it comes to mechanical forces, one of the most important aspect is the geometry of the objects. To this regards the dimensions of the interacting bodies and the contact area as well as the type of materials are what you need to assess the interaction forces along with the motion dynamics of the objects of interest.</p>
<p>When it comes to forces, I saw that many people here tried to calculate how much force is required to kill a bacterium. Well it is not the force but pressure they should be thinking. To mechanically kill a bacteria the easiest way is to disrupt the cell membrane which loses its structural integrity at high local-pressure. I build and use worldâ€™s sharpest tool, which is called an atomic force microscope. It uses a needle with an extremely sharp tip, ideally a single atom at the very end. So in the ideal case, the initial mechanical contact area would be the diameter of a silicon atom (0.21 nanometers) but since most biological molecules are sticky the tip gets contaminated while it interacts with the cell, which makes the effective tip radius ~10-20 nm. In most cases the application of 600 picoNewtons to 1 nN would be enough to kill the cell. But! there are two types of bacteria: gram positive and negative. These two types of bacteria have different cell envelopes. Gram positive has a rather thick and stiff peptidoglycan layer compared to gram negative. Which makes it harder to mechanically kill. </p>
<p>On a practical note: I often use tips with a larger diameter when doing bacterial experiments because the sharper the tip the more expensive it gets, also it is pointless to use super sharp tips as they get contaminated anyways. With an effective tip diameter of ~200 nm it would take about 3-5 nN to disrupt the membrane.</p>
