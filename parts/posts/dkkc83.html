However, there is proof that young children and infants, when deprived of touch, will stop developing mentally and physically. It is called 'failure to thrive'. This happens most commonly in third world orphanages where caretakers do not have the time and resources to hold and comfort the infants, but you can also see it in neglect cases all over the world. Even if a child is fed and diapered and cared for in other ways, it can not develop without human touch and interaction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Consider oxytocin, the so called &quot;hug hormone&quot; which is released during prolonged physical contact with others. Let's say you do not have any such contact, your levels of oxytocin would decrease, together with whatever else that hormone may affect. However, oxytocin is not only related with the touch of other people, but pets can have the same effect. </p>
<p>Here's an interesting article about the effects of oxytocin in mice: <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2019/02/14/mice-love-hormone-oxytocin-warmth-cold-isns/#.Xax3enhR2Hs" target="_blank"><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2019/02/14/mice-love-hormone-oxytocin-warmth-cold-isns/" target="_blank">http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2019/02/14/mice-love-hormone-oxytocin-warmth-cold-isns/</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>TL;DR: went to basic training, DEFINITELY BECAME TOUCH DEPRIVED </p>
<p>Oh boy...when I went to basic training, the recruiters told me that it's an adjustment but after 2 weeks, you kind of get into a rhythm. Your sleep pattern changes, you're away from your phone, Reddit, and really any contact with the outside world except for a few blocks of time. It's all an adjustment. </p>
<p>What they DONT tell you is how fucking weird it is to not be touched by another human being for weeks on end. And not even in a sexual way, just any touching in general usually doesn't happen. I'm not shaking hands or high fiving or hugging anybody, and neither would you. </p>
<p>I didn't even notice how much I missed being touched until we paired up and had to rig up our vests for a range day. I needed a little help so this dude starts adjusting my vest while I'm wearing it. The weird part is that it felt fucking AMAZING to have another dude touching my back. I'm pretty sure I let out an audible &quot;oh yeah&quot;. It felt so good that I purposely fucked it up after he was done and had him re do it. The second time I was leaning into it, eyes closed, the whole works. 10/10 would mess it up again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
