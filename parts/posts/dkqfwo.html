		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Caffeine works by blocking the detectors that your brain uses to figure out if you are tired.  If they get block too often, your brain decides the detectors are not working and simply grows more until their are more detectors than the caffeine can block.  This means you can still feel tired now, but that doesn't stop anything else the chemical may do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you’re awake, a chemical called adenosine slowly accumulates in your brain. Adenosine binds to receptors which slow down brain activity, making you feel more tired at the end of the day. When you sleep, the level of adenosine declines and promotes wakefulness.</p>
<p>Caffeine is very similar to adenosine and binds with the receptors. As it’s not adenosine, no sleepiness is felt. With long-term use of caffeine, your brain responds by creating more adenosine receptors so more caffeine is required for the same effect. Quitting caffeine cold turkey means you would feel more tired than you would have before you drank it. Eventually everything turns back to normal once you stop drinking coffee.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One crucial factor in a lot of your body's reactions is something called &quot;Homeostasis&quot; This is basically a body's tendency to try to stay the same. The word pretty much means &quot;Same Same&quot;. </p>
<p>The best way to describe it is say you and I push our hands together.  The harder I push, the harder you push back to stay where you are. I am the drug, you are your body trying to stay the same. Your body is not very fast at this, so if I suddenly stop pushing, you stagger toward me.  The OPPOSITE thing that you wanted the drug or whatever to do happens.  </p>
<p>Pain killers are a good example of this.  If you take them for a long time, you build a tolerance (your body makes you more sensitive to counteract it), then you stop taking them and you feel like you're on fire, or you ache, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We build tolerance over time to all it's effects, but with various speed. I don't even want to pee as much as I wanted when drank coffee for the first weeks. I experienced shaking 5 years ago, now only feel slightest jitter if drank really a lot. </p>
<p>About the mechanism: I don't know exactly, but assume that there are several receptors that caffeine binds to (Adenosine A1 and Adenosine A2 as well as other minor targets). These receptors are located in various areas of the brain/nervous system and/so their response to habitual caffeine exposure may be different. For example Adenosine A1 will still cause exactly the same heart palpitation, tremor effect, while A2 waking effects will dissappear. It's because Adenosine A2 receptors antagonism (blockade) will cause changes which in turn will cause number of A2 receptors to increase (which is called downregulation) which in turn will decrease actions of caffeine to this area of the brain. So A2 tolerance may develop much faster than A1 tolerance or something like that. Btw A2 is not so directly mentally stimulating itself. A2 antagonism causes striatal dopamine release (which we call &quot;want&quot; chemical, but it's more complicated, it causes some mental arousal as well), acetylcholine release, etc. Dopamine release may be decreased independently from the above mechanism too. You see, brain is quite complicated as a system and it's research is limited in measures and difficult. BTW I may be wrong in my statements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
