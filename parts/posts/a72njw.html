		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Crime was higher everywhere in the US then. It wasn’t just New York City. Crime rates rose until the 90’s, and have since dropped.  No one is quite sure why. There are a lot of theories. </p>
<p>One of my favorites is low level lead poisoning. We know that kids had higher blood lead levels on average back when leaded gasoline was still being used and lead paint was more common. We also know that lead exposure in kids can cause behavior and learning problems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure why no one is mentioning that the city was going broke due to poor management and people moving to the suburbs. The result was almost 10,000 police officers off the streets while corruption for the rest rising. They were poorly paid and supervised not to mention it was a dangerous job that attracted the wrong types of people. Throw in cuts in welfare, loads of crack/cocaine coming from Florida via Columbia and Mexico, rise of violent gangs, closure of psychiatric hospitals and treatment centers, falling property prices, loads of abandoned buildings especially downtown. Not as many people on the streets especially at night made it easier for criminals. The mob took full advantage and contributed to a lot of the violence even though they kept some neighborhoods mostly in Brooklyn safer.<br />
Edit. I would like to add that people left the city in droves back then to the suburbs in Long Island and NJ on the newly made highways commuting back during the day or moved to places like California and Florida. That resulted in less tax dollars. New York had been loosing industry and businesses for years that either relocated or became outdated. TV and film moved to LA. The rise of the financial industry had yet to happen, all those banks and the jobs they created started the 90's.    </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of incomplete answers.  Number one is the construction of freeways and urban decay combined with industrialization. </p>
<p>Lots of money left NYC and went to the suburbs. Falling rents led to poorly maintained properties; dirty old factories closed and went elsewhere (sometimes overseas, sometimes down south or upstate). People employed at the many docks in Manhattan lost out to containerization and the Port of Bayonne; those with good longshoreman jobs moved to the suburbs. People too poor to shop at nice places meant those places closed. So you have the conditions for lots of people with no good jobs, and the City is straining under the loss of revenue and population and more expensive services.</p>
<p>Then, you have lead poisoning. All the cars and expressways that get built pump a lot of exhaust into the air.  With leaded gasoline, that means lead in the air, which means lead poisoning, which makes people dumber, more violent, and with impulse control issues (and if you have a population more inclined to those traits, it will statistically lead to more violent crime). </p>
<p>So you have a lot more people who are impoverished, who can't get a good job, who are more inclined to be violent and impulsive, and you have a city that has less resources available to police them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
