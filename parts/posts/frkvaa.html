		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two things about influenza. First it is an RNA virus (compared to DNA viruses). RNA viruses are more error prone when they replicate so they generate mutations faster. </p>
<p>Second, unlike most viruses, it’s genome is segmented, that is its genome isn’t a single strand, but it’s genes come on different strands. If it coinfects a host with another flu strain they can exchange genes easily, creating another source of variability/mutation. </p>
<p>In this way human flu can gain characteristics of avian flu, for example, crating a virus humans haven’t gained any immunity to yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You say “viruses like influenza”, but in fact it’s not viruses <em>like</em> influenza, it’s <em>only</em> influenza that does this. Influenza is unique in the virus world in its ability to evolve to avoid population immunity. Technically, influenza doesn’t mutate fast than other RNA viruses, but its surface proteins are more tolerant of mutations than other viruses are. See my answer in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/fjk2of/why_do_some_viruses_mutate_faster_than_others_eg/" target="_blank">Why of some viruses mutate faster than others</a> for details and references. </p>
<p>If you think about the vast majority of viral vaccines (measles, mumps, rubella, Yellow Fever, polio, etc etc etc) they do <em>not</em> need to be updated annually. Even RNA viruses like measles and polio are antigenically very stable, in spite of having mutation rates that are very similar to influenza’s, and they haven’t needed to have their vaccines updated in the decades since they were introduced.</p>
<p>The question didn’t specifically ask about SARS-CoV-2, but since the other answers immediately turned to it ... Coronaviruses in general have slightly slower mutation rates than influenza, but they’re still very high. However, while they can and do readily accumulate mutations (<a href="https://nextstrain.org/ncov" target="_blank">NextStrain.com</a> shows hundreds of mutations that the virus has made over the past few months) the default assumption - for good reasons - is that these mutations are neutral and don’t affect the virus function or antigenicity. </p>
<p>If we look at the four endemic human coronaviruses, they show some signs of slow antigenic change, which hints that coronaviruses <em>might</em> be able to tolerate <em>some</em> changes in their proteins, but clearly not to anywhere near the extent of influenza.  If we have to guess (and without data it’s mainly a guess) it seems likely that a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 will be effective for many years, perhaps 5-10 years, before the virus drifts enough that it might need an update. Maybe not quite as good as measles, but hopefully much better than influenza.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason is because influenza has what is known as an &quot;error prone polymerase&quot;.  Influenza's genome is made of RNA, not DNA, and it comes with instructions for copying it's own genome.  That comes in the form of RNA that makes a protein called &quot;RNA Polymerase&quot;.  The RNA polymerase in influenza makes way more mistakes at copying RNA than our polymerase does, which leads to lots of mutations.  </p>
<p>You might think that in order to do that, it would be best if influenza didn't make a lot of mistakes in copying it's genome.  A lot of mistakes means that there are a lot of mutant virus particles produced that are total duds and can't generate a new infection.  But some of the copies of the virus have a mutated version in a surface protein.  &quot;H1&quot;, in fact, is the name of one of the surface proteins. If that mutation causes the surface protein to have a slightly different shape, it might be enough to help that virus escape our immune system.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It seems that SARS-CoV2 does NOT have an error prone polymerase.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reassortment. Some viruses have multiple genomic parts, especially RNA viruses. Influenza segments dont evolve and mutate more rapidly, but since there are eight genomic segment strands, these can recombine in new ways. So you can get an avian HA with a pig NA with a human PA, or <evil chord> the Triple Reassortant. Now you have bits of virus present from three different source species, and if they work, maybe they brought in a completely new antigen to the human species experience. The ones on the outside of the virus change at a different rate than the ones in the inside, since they face host pressure differently.</p>
<p>Polyproteins. Now lets say all your virus proteins are in one genomic strand, and all the coding regions are jammed together, in a polyprotein, like for Hepatitis C. Instead of like flu, you have all your eggs in one basket, and cant change one protein without impact the whole strain. Then the whole thing is locked together. Flavivirus doesnt evolve rapidaly at all. Almost all the outbreak strains from the last west african pandemic are 99% conserved and alike one another.</p>
<p>So when you talk of evolution, you can talk about mutation rate, or site subsitution rate more accurately. Or just about one protein or one site. Some substitutions are silent. And, the end result is always important- whether the Strain is itself different. Different parts change at different rates. I think what you are asking is about the strain change rate. </p>
<p>A lot of change rates contribute to that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
