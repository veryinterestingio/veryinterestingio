		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Contractions are used to get to the next part of a phrase faster, to remove the emphasis of the contracted word. Ending a sentence or phrase is going to feel odd because you're basically rushing to get to... nothing.</p>
<p>&quot;It's what it is&quot; works fine. &quot;It is what it's&quot; doesn't, because we're used to seeing &quot;it's&quot; being connected to another noun or adjective.</p>
<p>&quot;That's who you are&quot; works fine. &quot;That is who you're&quot; doesn't for the same reason. </p>
<p>&quot;If I tell you to show up on time, you'll show up on time&quot; works. &quot;If I tell you to show up on time, you'll&quot; doesn't work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's largely that the word 'IS' is the entire point of the sentence, but you're contracting it away.<br />
&quot;We Are What We Are&quot; vs &quot;We're What We're&quot;<br />
The point is to hit 'ARE'<br />
I am who I Am<br />
I'm who I'm<br />
It's the fact you're contracting the conjugation of the verb 'Be'   </p>
<p>In any case I can think of you can't contract a verb to end a sentence.   </p>
<p>&quot;If you think you'll fail, you will. vs &quot;If you think you'll fail, You'll&quot;  </p>
<p>And in all cases I can think of, its all a conjugation past, present or future of a state of Be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have to evaluate the statement from a rhetorical perspective. For speech to be eloquent, it needs to fulfill three properties: Appropriate according to
1) Time
2) Place
3) Occasion</p>
<p>When any of those properties are contravened against, speech will be off.</p>
<p>The meaning of it is what it is, is to convey that reality is a full package deal, bith its pros as well as its cons have to be accepted and there is no clever way to get around that. You can't have your cake and eat it too.</p>
<p>This is communicated so by means of emphasis where we verbatim repeat the same wording: It( e.g. reality) is(e.g. manifests) what it(e.g. reality) is(e.g. manifests), which in turn has already been abbreviated to its existing form as concealing the overly obvious of what is being talked about(e.g. reality) communicates emphasis of something in a better way. If you were to contract it further, then in addition to disrupting the flow of speech(e.h  it is borderline a tong-twister, which in itself in term sof body language contradicts that you are stating stating the obvious truth that cannot be contradicted) , in addition to that you would be lessing the power of emphasis and stressing of this sentence. When you repeat wording for the sake of emphasis, then repeating it on a verbose way carries more emphasis than repeating it in a concise way. I have clarifued above that abbrevation from reality to stating it instead is fine as concealing the obvious in this way does not contradict emphasis. But going a step further than that to it's what it's would constitute an abbreviation for no additional benefit and would actually go against the demands of emphasis of being verbose.</p>
<p>So the reason why it's what it's is not eloquent speech is because it is an idiom reserved for the occasion where you need to emphasize the hard naked truth which demands for being verbose whereas abbreviation contradicta that. Also the argument of flow where the speech in it's abbrevaited form does not flow well to the extent it becomes more of a tongue twister makes that such speech is not eloquent.</p>
<p>Now, I am by no means a literary expert so if there is a fault with my reasoning and/or others cpuld provide substantiations to what I am claiming then I would love to learn.
Thank you</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
