If I look through that tiny hole by putting the finger very close to my eye this makes the print come into focus.</p>
<p>Why? How does this work?</p></div></div>

<p>When you look through a tiny hole, only the light rays that were already going to meet at the same point get through. The light is already focused.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blurry images are caused by different portions of the lens focusing at different distances.  The tiny opening only lets a small part of the lens function, so the spread in focus distances is very small.  This allows your eye to generate a clear, though not as bright, image on your retina.</p>
<p>Does this make sense?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine uncooked spaghetti sticks shooting out from a point source in all directions, circularly. That's light rays emanating from a light source.</p>
<p>Now imagine you have a tall, slender jar that you catch some of those hard spaghetti sticks in. The mouth of that jar acts as a pinhole lens. The only light rays (spaghetti sticks) you're going to capture in the jar are the ones pointed in the same direction. </p>
<p>The image you see in the tiny hole is from light rays that are all more or less aligned in the same direction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your eye has a lens. When light enters it, the light at the edge of the lens is bent more than the light in the center. This is to create a focal point. Because your eye is an imperfect lens, it cannot create a perfect focus. This is pretty much true for all lenses, so don't feel bad. When you look through a small aperture, you cut out the light rays that need to be bent more, leaving only the more focused light raysb in the middle. Hence a darker, more focused image.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have explained it pretty well, but essentially, this is the same reason that a smaller camera aperture has a bigger depth of field, because of the small opening, the light rays that are hitting the image sensor are traveling more parallel and are relatively more focused over a longer distance, meaning it's easier to keep things sharp</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
