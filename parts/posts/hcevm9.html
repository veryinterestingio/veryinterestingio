<p>One leading idea for what you describe is that there are a cluster of connected neurons that contain the concept of a word in your mind. It is possible to fire off these neurons repeatedly to the point they are momentarily spent and must replenish their reserves. At which point the word seems less familiar to you, since the part of your brain that makes that word familiar is tired out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This experience is called semantic <del>saturation</del> satiation (thank you for the correction /u/lexitrobe22). Languages are made out of individual sounds, called phonemes. When we put phonemes together that are recognizable an assigned meaning, we have words. But there is nothing innate about a sound that links it to a meaning - the language has just agreed to pair the sound with that meaning. Why is a dog called a dog? Because English-speakers agree that it is. The only examples to this rule are onomatopoeia, where the sound of the word matches the meaning of the word. When you say a word over and over, your brain starts to recognize the sound is just a sound, and it loses its meaning. It's like the the language version of manual breathing - when you pay too much attention to it, it goes from something that is instinctive to something that you have to think too hard about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>One way it does this is by ignoring things that never change or that you have actively ignored for too long.  It's why you  an see the tip of your nose when you think about it but any other time you dont evem notice it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
