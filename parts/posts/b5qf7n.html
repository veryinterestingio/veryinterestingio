		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Full disclosure, I'm an optometrist for humans, not for cheetahs.</p>
<p>It's because they (and many birds and reptiles) have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nictitating_membrane" target="_blank">Nictitating Membrane</a>.</p>
<p>It is a transparent ‘third eyelid’ that covers the eye and allows them to see while also maintaining protection over their cornea. From SeaWorld's website: &quot;<a href="https://seaworld.org/animals/all-about/cheetah/characteristics/" target="_blank">A nictitating membrane further shields and protects the eyes during fast sprints</a>.&quot;</p>
<p>Humans (and many other mammals) have a vestigial remnant of this membrane called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plica_semilunaris_of_conjunctiva" target="_blank">Plica Semilunaris</a>. It’s that half moon sliver of tissue next to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimal_caruncle" target="_blank">Caruncle</a> (which is the little yellowish/reddish blob in the very inferior/nasal corner of your eye).</p>
<p>Edits. </p>
<ol>
<li>I'm embarrassed I forgot the vestigial remnant is the Plica Semilunaris (now linked above), not the Caruncle.</li>
<li>Shoutout to /u/OmegaGreed and others for encouraging me to research this a little further, I'm learning so much! There are clearly (and not surprisingly) a wide variety of Nictitating Membranes across animal species, even among cats. While some (most?) are definitely not transparent enough to be useful during hunting, the Cheetah's must be.<br />
This makes sense to me because on the one hand, I definitely agree that a cheetah running at 65 mph will not experience the same shearing force due to air across their cornea as someone sticking their head out of the window of a car, due to the aerodynamics of car vs. cheetah head. Despite this, when you are traveling at speeds anywhere near 65 mph, that shearing force would definitely be strong enough to strip away your tear film. This is problematic because even if their cornea had a different type of innervation, such that this didn't cause them <em>pain</em> per se, your tear film plays a <em>significant</em> role in your visual acuity. In fact, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea" target="_blank">the air/tear-film interface [is] the most significant component of the total refractive power of the eye</a>.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think, in addition to the nictitating membrane that /u/slevayyoung mentioned, (Edit: actually, having thought about it, I'm not sure the nictitating membrane is involved at all) it also has to do with the amount of air being displaced by a car. A car is obviously much larger than a cheetah, so a larger volume of air is being turbulently displaced as the car is moving forward. A lot of this turbulent air rushing past the car is actually moving faster than 65mph (from the perspective of a passenger in the car) as it gets pushed around the car. </p>
<p>Additionally, cars are streamlined, so when you open the window and stick your head out, you are pushing your head directly into this turbulent stream moving around your car. It's a bit like sticking your head into the wake of a motorboat. </p>
<p>Cheetahs displace much less air than a car, and their eyes are also directly at the front of their body as it's moving, so they don't have to deal with any of the wake of the air they are displacing.</p>
<p>Edit: Actually, after thinking about it some more, I'm not convinced the nictitating membrane is involved. Certainly it would be pretty helpful to be able to use it like a pair of goggles, but, <a href="https://www.litter-robot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/900px-Tabby_cat_with_visible_nictitating_membrane-copy.jpg" target="_blank">at least in housecats</a>, the nictitating membrane is not transparent enough to see through like glass. Good eyesight is pretty important when you're chasing extremely fast prey over uneven ground. Cheetahs have long eyelashes and hooded eyes to help keep debris out, and given that they only reach their top speeds for a few seconds at a time, I don't think the wind would be that much of a factor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Top speed recorded using GPS was 58 mph in 367 hunts. Top speed was only achieved for 1-2s in each hunt. The top speed in the majority of hunts was under 40 mph.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
