		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stem cells can grow specific parts of blood in a lab.  Red blood cells?  No problem.   </p>
<p>The problem is that when you grow an ear, you grow it all in one place.   Your stem cells first decide they’re going to become an ear, and they start dividing and become an ear by following instructions in your DNA on how to divide and divide until they reach an ear shape.</p>
<p>Blood is manufactured all over your body.   You need your bones, your spleen, your brain (there’s a gland in your brain that helps blood cells grow), your liver, your kidneys, and your heart to make blood.</p>
<p>Your blood stem cells are stored in your bones.  You have them all your life.  That’s where a blood cell begins its life.  But then it’s kicked out of home to grow up with Uncle Spleen or Auntie Liver or weird cousin Pituitary Gland.   </p>
<p>And that’s just the cells.  Blood is so much more than cells. The other parts - the plasma - that is made in the kidneys, in the lymphatic system, as the heart forces blood through the body.  </p>
<p>Blood is your most dynamic, complex organ.  You need a whole human to make it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blood is, in itself, a fairly complex tissue. It’s not a simple case of throwing some blood cells into a buffer solution and calling it a day. There are all sorts of proteins, hormones and other messenger molecules, assorted nutrients etc. that your body either creates or absorbs, and all of these different blood components are generated by different organs and tissues within the body. Even the blood cells themselves go through a complex differentiation and maturation process that takes place mostly outside of the bloodstream, in organs like the bone marrow and the thymus which have their own unique micro environments specifically for that purpose. Basically, it would take a whole lot of work and resources to artificially make whole blood and you’d probably still get better results from donated blood anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can and we do. I work in a lab that &quot;grows&quot; (cultures) blood cells from stem cells extracted from healthy donors and patients with blood disorders in order to study the mechanisms of those diseases. We have also created cell lines that successfully generate functional adult and umbilical cord blood cells. <a href="https://haematologica.org/article/view/9992" target="_blank">https://haematologica.org/article/view/9992</a>

<p>We're in the process of growing cells from a donor and then re-introducng those cells back into the donor (the RESTORE clinical trial). <a href="https://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk/clinical-trials-unit/current-trials-and-studies/restore/" target="_blank">https://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk/clinical-trials-unit/current-trials-and-studies/restore/</a></p>
<p>The main hurdle at the moment is the huge volumes of cultures needed to grow enough cells to generate a unit of blood (its a lot, and the cost is astronomical).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
