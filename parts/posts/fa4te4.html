However, when I take into account the fact that many languages are read right-to-left, this connection becomes more tenuous. </p>
<p>Are writing systems entirely a function of culture, or is there evidence for biological/behavioural causes?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are there even any instances of abnormal amounts of left-handed populations in history? Probably not many (if any), and definitely not enough to be instrumental in developing writing systems. Remember “writing” didn’t start on paper, so throw out the whole notion of writing being easier one direction or another because of hand dragging and ink smudging.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As far as I am aware, it cultural.</p>
<p>Japanese writes top to bottom (vertical) and right to left, and Chinese is (traditionally) top to bottom (vertical) and right left as well.</p>
<p>Arabic is right left (horizontal) and top down and European languages are mostly  left right (horizontal) and top down.</p>
<p>The old Gaelic script ogham was really weird. Written bottom to top (vertical) and left to right on its surviving stone inscriptions and left right (horizontal) in manuscripts, it is the only language I know of to have started at the bottom.</p>
<p>Ancient Greek used to write inscriptions in boustrophedon some times. That's when writing direction is alternated each line. First left right, then right left for the next line.</p>
<p>Rongorongo (the undeciphered writing system of Easter island) wrote in reverse boustrophedon. It wrote in one direction one line then upside down and backwards on the next. </p>
<p>The weirdness present in written language is incredibly varied. Handedness probably isn't a controlling factor. Keep in mind that writing is an incrediblelly recent addition to our species, and only in the last century or so could a significant portion of the population be taught for lack of time resources. Writing direction is most likely just whatever made the most sense to its first users at the time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
