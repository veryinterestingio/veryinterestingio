		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whats left of the DNA in the food you eat is broken down to the most basic molecules that are part of it.
DNA is made of Nitrogen bases, with a carbohydrate called desoxyribose and a phosphate group.
They are each separated individually and go trough different metabolic process depending on what they are.
Everything you eat ends up being metabolized in the liver to be stored and used when needed.
But no. Your body doesn't use the DNA in your food to build your own DNA. At least not the chains as they are.
It fisrt breaks it all down to the building materials. And when it needs to, it uses the components to help repair or replicate the parts of your own DNA chain.
Or it might not even use them for something related directly to your DNA. maybe it uses them to repair the cells membrane or to produce energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
