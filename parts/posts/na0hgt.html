<p>ELI5: We don't know. Like with anything we don't know there are some theories though. Some smart people don't even think that it matters at all. Some other smart people though think we are all in fact getting dumber. Some other smart people think that our brain is getting more efficient and just doesn't need that much space anymore. Others say, it's because of changing outside factors of the earth, like temperature. Or it might be because of the smaller hip sizes of women that make it harder to birth a baby with a bigger head. And lastly some others think that it is a side effect of domestication.</p>
<p>Domestication is what we call the change of wild animals or plants intended by humans for our own advantage. You could for example take a wolf that is a bit nicer to humans than others and try to keep it around. It's children might also be nice to you. And it's grandchildren might even be nicer. So in many generations you have a very nice wolf, a dog. You have domesticated a wolf to a dog. And we find that a domesticated animal has a reduced brain size compared to its wild ancestor, even up to 34 percent.
I personally really like that theory. We might have become our very own pets. But who knows.</p>

There are many possible explanations for this, but no one can pinpoint exactly why and how this is happening. The type of matter within the brain that we are losing paints an even more perplexing picture. We see an erosion of grey matter, not white matter. Grey matter contains the cell bodies of our neurons, they are the backbone of our brain. This grey matter accounts for our complex behaviors and abilities that are unique to humans such as language, culture, and writing. White matter is the fatty myelin sheath that covers the axons of these neurons, this fatty substance is a support structure but nonetheless essential to proper brain function.  Christopher Stringer, a paleoanthropologist and expert on human origins at the Natural History Museum in London says that “Scientists haven’t given the matter the attention it deserves. Many ignore it or consider it an insignificant detail.”
There are many different schools of thought around the matter. Some scientists think that humans are in fact getting dumber. Some think that the shrinkage is due to the more efficient wiring of our brain. Then there are some scientists that think we have simply been domesticated. Domesticated sheep and dogs, for example, have smaller brains than their wild ancestors. Some credit environmental factors, like the heating of the earth, or physical factors, like the decrease in female hip size, which means babies with smaller skulls and smaller brains. Scientists have flipped over every stone to develop different hypotheses but fitting them all together into a narrative that makes sense is the hard part.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>When we were hunting animals (and been hunted) and gathering berries, we needed some skills like smelling, hearing and finding a good mate. With agricolture we changed the set of skills to include cooking, writing, music, navigating the sea and predicting star movements. </p>
<p>So, in my opinion, we shed some extra weight we weren't using that much anyway to make room for something different, like thinking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
