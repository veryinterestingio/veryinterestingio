		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of other good comments here but I wanted to add my 2 cents as a music teacher to help you hear or feel the backbeat.  </p>
<p>A majority of popular music from at least the past 70 years is in what we call 4/4 time.  Try counting or tapping along to the beat of the song 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4; you will notice that the snare drum is often happening on the 2 and the 4.  This is the general idea of a backbeat, the snare drum (or sometimes another instrument) accents beats 2 and 4 as opposed to earlier styles of music where the stressed or accented beats would often be 1 and 3.  Lots of classical music in 4/4 and marches will stress/accent beats 1 and 3.</p>
<p>If you are listening to pop, rock, dance, hip-hop, jazz, or any other popular style of music from the last 70 years you are probably hearing what would generally be considered a backbeat; although each of those styles is unique the accents on 2 and 4 are pervasive.</p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asgw5kHyRGc" target="_blank">Click here for a video</a> with a few different styles of music.  The presenter does a great job of pointing to all the beats so you can really see/hear/feel how the claps accent the 2 and 4.  I would call all of these examples backbeat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if I can explain it any better than the above comments, but here it goes. The beat is like a heartbeat in the song. When you listen, there are sections where it feels natural to clap or stomp. Those are typically the down beat. </p>
<p>Since it's used for CPR, I'll use the Bee Gees here too. Capitalized parts are the down beat. </p>
<p>ah AH ah AH staying ALIVE staying ALIVE</p>
<p>Uppercase part is where you clap for the down beat. The lowercase part is where your hands are apart for the up beat. </p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Might be a little tangential, but are you familiar with the concept of stressed syllables in poetry? Like... a simple limerick. Consider:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I came this way to meet</p>
<p>With you to feel the beat</p>
<p>I read all your musings</p>
<p>And found them confusing</p>
<p>And all I got was defeat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a certain &quot;bouncing&quot; flow to it, yeah? Can you hear it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I <strong>came</strong> this <strong>way</strong> to <strong>meet</strong> <strong>()</strong></p>
<p>With <strong>you</strong> to <strong>feel</strong> the <strong>beat</strong> <strong>()</strong></p>
<p>I <strong>read</strong> all your <strong>mus</strong>ings | And <strong>found</strong> them con<strong>fus</strong>ing</p>
<p>And <strong>all</strong> that I <strong>got</strong> was de<strong>feat</strong>. <strong>()</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Try clapping at a constant speed and reading this out loud, saying one of the bolded syllables on each clap (pause for a clap on the empty parenthesis, &quot;()&quot;).</p>
<p>See how each line has four claps in it? That pulse, that rhythm, is like the beat of a song. This is why certain lyrics <em>feel</em> right or wrong when you enunciate them the right way in certain songs. It's lining up the stressed syllables with the beats (the claps) of the music. That kind of pattern is naturally pleasing to most people.</p>
<p>Depending on the song, it may be such that some of those beats <em>feel</em> like they're stronger than the others, just like stressed syllables in poetry, but for music. Instruments will often play these specific beats a little louder, or these beats will have very distinct drum hits if there's a backing percussion.</p>
<p>In a waltz tune, for example, which has bundles of three beats instead of four, the first beat <em>feels</em> heavier than the other two, which are kind of weaker. That's reflected in the actual dance of the waltz, where you take a big step on that beat, then sort of tiptoe in place on the other two. Forgive me for my weird example, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1LRi6Ec7II" target="_blank">this video game music track from Super Mario All-Stars</a> has this very easy to pick out. Do you hear how there's a sort of three-step bounce to it? In the background, there's a single low, bold note followed by two repeated high-pitch notes in a repeated pattern. The melody of the song is mostly built of notes that land on that first low note hit. In a waltz dance, these would be the note you step on, while the two quiet high-pitch notes would be the notes you tiptoe in place on.</p>
<p>A backbeat specifically is when the second and fourth beats in a 4-beat-per-measure song (which is basically any song you'll ever hear on a radio these days) hit a little heavier than the first and third one. As some commenters are trying to point out, that slight urge that these beats are stronger give that urge to clap, stomp, sway, or what have you, on those beats. I suppose if I already gave one video game music example (video game music tends to be super useful for basic music theory due to the simple, bold, catchy melodies) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXdm5lTLAKs" target="_blank">the underground theme from the same game</a> should hopefully sell the concept of a backbeat. If you count 1-2-3-4 in a steady pulse, those bold snare drum hits should land on every beat 2 and 4, while a quieter bass drum hit (if you can even hear it) fills in beats 1 and 3. If something were to possess you to clap along to this (it's admittedly a bad example of that, lol) you may be preferential to clap on those beats, in the same pulse as the snare drum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>True ely5, Imagine the oompa loompa doopity do song. That is NOT emphasis on backbeat. OOmpa LOOmpa DOOpity DOO. </p>
<p>Now imagine Lean On Me. The way people typically clap along to that is clap on the backbeat. Lean [clap] me, [clap]. When you're [clap] strong, [clap]. I'll be [clap] friend, [clap]. The claps land on 2 and 4, not 1 and 3. </p>
<p>In other words, if you always did a pattern of stomp, clap, stomp, clap, to the beat of a song, the backbeat is the clap. </p>
<p>Backbeat usually refers to music that has a bit of a groove, though, not a ballad like Lean on Me. So take the clap principle and use it in the intro to Tighten Up. The guitar (not the bassline) is showing you the backbeat. It's a good example because the rest of the tracks layer in gradually.</p>
<p>If you don't know that song because you are five I will play it for you on my phone üôÇ</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
