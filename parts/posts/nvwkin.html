		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>360 is a holdover from ancient geometry.</p>
<p>The ancient Mesopotamians used a numerical system based on 12 and 60 instead of the modern base-10 system.</p>
<p>They did this because 12 is a highly composite number thatâ€™s divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 6 - and 60 is 12x5 and even more highly composite.  You can do a ton of math using only your fingers and knuckles and rarely end up with fractions.</p>
<p>When later mathematicians started laying the foundations for modern geometry, a lot of math was still taught in this way.  360 degrees, or 60x6.0, made a lot of sense.</p>
<p>In practice it still kinda does, as you get lots of nice composite angles.  180, 120, 90, 60, 45, 30...  you can do a lot of geometry without fractions, just as the Ancient Mesopotamians would have wanted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>100 degrees is divisible by 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, and 100, for a total of 9 possible divisors.</p>
<p>360 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 45, 60, 72, 90, 120, 180, 360, for a total of 24 possible divisors.</p>
<p>It's much easier to cleanly split 360 into parts than it is 100 or 1000.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Such a system exists! The gradian is an alternate unit for angles where 90 degrees is 100 gradians, therefore the whole circle is 400 gradians.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not entirely clear, though we do know it goes back to the ancient Babylonians. One theory is that they got their unit of angular measure by dividing the angle of an equilateral triangle into 60 degrees (their numbering system was based on 60, so this was a convenient number for them to use). When you multiply this by 6 to get a full circle's worth of angles, you get 360 degrees.</p>
<p>Other systems of angular measure have been made. The French gradian syatem divides a right angle into 100 <em>gon</em>:  multiply this by 4, and you get 400 gon in a circle. The metric radian system takes a completely different approach, being based on circles instead of triangles: cut an arc out of a circle that's as long as the circle's own radius, and the angle you create by doing so is one radian (a little over 57 degrees).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
