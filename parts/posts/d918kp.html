		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sperm are very basic and the bodily fluids inside the vagina/cervix/uterus are very acidic. It kills off a lot of sperm on their journey. It deteriorates their protective coating. They are also swimming against a current produced by cilia (little hairs that move back and forth creating this wave of motion that moves the egg to the uterus). They can get trapped in this cilia. Another reason is because they only have a certain time period before they die, its just a few days.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR It's a fucking miracle anyone is ever born.</p>
<p>Edit: Alright, I get it, it's not exactly a &quot;miracle&quot; of a process, but I took liberty of expression by exaggerating. It's a lot easier to downplay the process when looking at population growth as a whole. In the end, it's a numbers game, but just because it works for many does not make it any less harder for some to be pregnant, and to them it actually <em>feels</em> like a miracle.</p>
<p>While I'm editing, there's a lot of people who have been kind enough to post good resources on the process in more accurate detail than what I discuss below. I make intentional omissions in some regards for simplicity's sake and I tried to answer as much within the scope of the question as I could.</p>
<p>And so:</p>
<p>Think of the journey of a sperm cell like that one example where <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/01/scienceshot-meet-amazing-waterfall-climbing-fish" target="_blank">fish have to climb a waterfall to mate.</a> In this situation, there's wet rocks, water pouring against the fish, gravity, and a huge distance to travel that work against the fish's favor, similar to how the female anatomy is inhospitable to the sperm cells in similar ways. I'm going to go into a little more detail in the next part, but it will help if you try to keep the analogy of the fish and waterfall in mind.</p>
<p>Let's start at the beginning of the journey, the cervix. It acts like a gate that opens and closes at different times of the month to let the sperm get in. No real analogy here. It's just like a door.</p>
<p>After the sperm get a ticket in, then they have to survive the environment that is usually at a pH that degrades or destroys sperm, so many die at this phase as well. This would be like if, suddenly, the waterfall water turned boiling hot and started killing the climbimg fish.</p>
<p>Another barrier would be the production of mucous that the body creates and expels to constantly clean out the vagina, similar to cerumen in the ears, mucous of the nose, or sweat on the skin. The motion of the mucous tends towards the exit instead of going further in, just like the water and gravity work against the fish trying to climb. They can move upwards as much as they try, but will get pushed back down.</p>
<p>Distance was a factor mentioned by others. Sperm don't have nuclear reactors and many will run out of energy before they reach the egg. That, or they spend too long and are destroyed by the hostile environment of the female anatomy. In this context, think of the fish getting too tired to hang on and succumbing to the other barriers already listed.</p>
<p>Here we say the fish make it over the waterfall and live happily ever after. But it's a little different on the cellular level.</p>
<p>If the sperm DO make the distance, there is still the egg. Imagine this egg like you would a chicken egg; you can't just touch it with your finger and expect to get inside. But what if I coated my finger in acid? The eggs in the female reproductive tract have a similar &quot;hard&quot; shell that is resistant to penetration and resists many sperm. The sperm are equipped with lysing agents that break down the egg so that one lucky sperm can reach the center.</p>
<p>Then there's the matter of why more sperm can't just penetrate the same egg to fertilize it. After initial fertilization, the egg changes the chemistry of the outer shell that was initially penetrable and makes it so it is now impenetrable to further attempts to fertilize it. Imagine like you're in line for a 1-person seat on a ride; after you sit down, they close the gate so no one can follow you in, and the ride begins.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots. The cervix is a physical barrier. And then women have mucus that slows down the sperm. Then the actual distance to travel. </p>
<p>The body is designed not to get pregnant constantly. Although some people are more fertile than others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This goes a little beyond your question, but I have learned a lot about just how difficult fertilization is as I undergo infertility treatments:</p>
<p>-Most sperm are not the ideal shape for fertilization. Many have two heads, two tails, jagged edges, etc. Sperm morphology measures the number of “ideal” shaped sperm. In fact, so many sperm are misshaped that 96% abnormally shaped sperm is still considered healthy. Most men fall in the range of 4-14% “ideally” shaped sperm. Look up images of sperm morphology; it’s kind of crazy. </p>
<p>-The fertility window is VERY short. Once a woman ovulates, the ideal time to fertilize (how long the egg lasts after ovulation) only lasts about 12-48 hours. Now, you can theoretically get pregnant with sperm that has survived for a few days before the ovulation window, but many couples who struggled to conceive can tell you, the 12-48 hour period is ideal.</p>
<p>-There’s other factors that can make it difficult for sperm to reach an egg, like motility. Sperm can be too slow, or, as my doctor recently told me, too fast. A sperm that moves too quickly, according to my doctor, will have a harder time fertilizing an egg. </p>
<p>-A woman’s Fallopian tubes may be blocked or partially blocked, literally creating a physical barrier that prevents the sperm from reaching the egg. There are medical procedures that can help address this. </p>
<p>There are many other factors that make it difficult. These are the ones that first come to mind, based on what our reproductive endocrinologist has told my husband and I. It really is remarkable to think that pregnancy is the result of these seemingly insurmountable odds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
