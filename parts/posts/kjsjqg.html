<p>Why is the Planck Length the &quot;smallest thing in the world?&quot; Or at least I hope I asked it right. </p>
<p>I've read that you cannot go smaller than this length, otherwise blackholes will occur and the world doesn't make sense anymore.</p>
<p>Could you explain the main steps to understanding &quot;length&quot; and it's relationship to energy before diving into the planks length? This concept is super interesting and I really want to understand it. From what I have read, understanding this concept is broken down like this:</p>
<p>(1) What is a wavelength actually?</p>
<p>(2) How are wavelengths and energy related?</p>
<p>(3) Why is the Plancks Length the smallest thing in the universe?</p>
<p>(4) What happens when something is smaller than a Planck Length?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div></div>

<p>It's not. At least, no one is saying that we know it is. Rather, it's the smallest length that we can <em>measure</em> (sort of). The short version is that quantum theory says to measure a length of distance precisely, one needs to put a lot of energy into a small space. As the distance gets smaller, then the energy requirements get bigger. Eventually, one puts so much energy into the space that it would become a black hole according to the rules of general relativity, and that happens at the Planck length. However, no one really thinks for sure that this would happen, but it is past the point at which our known rules of physics break down. It's more like &quot;we have no idea how the rules of physics work beyond that length of distance&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>(1) What is a wavelength actually?</p>
<p>A wevelength is the distance between identical points on a wave. So: the distance from peak to peak, or trough to trough. That kinda thing.</p>
<p>(2) How are wavelengths and energy related?</p>
<p>The higher the energy, the shorter the wavelength. For a somewhat intuitive sense of this, you can consider that a single wavelength (peak to peak) carries a constant amount of energy. If the wavelength is shorter, you can fit more waves into the same space, and thus you have a higher energy. This is not <em>actually</em> how it works, but hopefully provides a good intuitive feel for it.</p>
<p>(3) Why is the Plancks Length the smallest thing in the universe?</p>
<p>Strictly, the Planck length is not necessarily the shortest length possible. See my below point.</p>
<p>(4) What happens when something is smaller than a Planck Length?</p>
<p>Below the Planck length, our currently-understood laws of physics break down.</p>
<p>All our laws of physics apply to certain &quot;regimes&quot;, certain spans of energy. As we've seen above, wavelengths correspond to energies. Above a certain energy, none of our currently-understood laws of physics hold. In the same way that special relativity takes appreciable effect above a certain speed, so &quot;something else&quot; must take effect above this energy cutoff. The value of this energy cutoff corresponds to a length of the Planck length.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For 1 and 2, you need to understand the surprising and absolutely unintuitive fact that energy is quantized. What this means is that you can only have a value among a discrete set of values for energy. To explain it a bit further, let's say you are counting some stuff on a macroscopic level. Measuring water is hard because (without getting into molecular level) it's a continuous stream and the volume can have any value. Counting eggs(or fruits or chocolates, etc) on the other hand, is not. They are neatly segregated into &quot;packets&quot; and your count of them can have only whole number values. So you say they are &quot;quantized&quot; because their total amount should be a whole number multiple of some basic &quot;smallest amount&quot; of them(one egg or one chocolate, etc) while water is not so constrained.</p>
<p>For most of the history of science, we thought energy was like water in that regard. However, recently we've found that energy is quantized: there is some minimum amount of energy that all other energy is a multiple of. This can be explained by the concept of &quot;wave particle duality&quot;. Basically, matter show properties of particles ( like protons, electrons, neutrons, etc) for some things, but behaves like a wave for others. This wave is something like a sound wave or electromagnetic wave (radiation, light, etc)- a propogation of oscillations of some value.  In sound this value is air density, in light it is electric and magnetic field, whereas for matter it is probability. Probability that the matter exists there that is.</p>
<p>See, matter in the microscopic level doesn't &quot;exist&quot; like it does at the macroscopic level. It doesn't have a fixed location that it inhabits. It has a region where it can be, but the only way to find out is by &quot;measuring&quot; it, which causes the probability function to collapse and give a value. But even then, by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we can't be a 100% precise in calculating where it will be. Now, probability and uncertainty here doesn't just mean that we don't know where it is, it means we can't know where it is because it doesn't have a fixed location at all. The square of the probability gives us the wavelength, which gives us the energy of the particle. The more precise we want to calculate its position the more energy we'll have to spend in measuring it. Energy is also equivalent to mass by Einstein's equation. There comes a certain point, where the difference in distance is so small, that if we had to measure it with more precision, we'd have to put so much energy there that it would be so massive in such a small area, that the density would be that of a black hole. Therefore we can't measure distances smaller than that without there being black holes. That length is the Planck length.</p>
<p>I feel I've done a really bad job of explaining it, there may be some parts that you can't understand and even some mistakes, my physics is not very good and I'm a computer science student, not physics. So I hope someone who actually knows this physics properly can correct me and explain it better. But this is basically the gist of it I think.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our &quot;standard model&quot; of particle physics does not take gravity into account, but it should work with weak gravity.</p>
<p>At lengths around the plank length a particle has so much energy density that it would form a black hole and thus definitely have strong gravity.</p>
<p>So the plank length is where our weak-gravity-assumption stops working and hence are no longer sure what happens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>its not, its the smallest  distance that we can measure based on our current understanding of Physics, based on this we just accept that anything below this distance doesn't really possess any notable properties regarding energy, therefore is not detectable with current methods that wouldn't interfere with the experiment.</p>
<p>basically  attempting ot measure a distance smaller than planck's length with our current method would place too much mass/energy in a small space causing it to collapse into a black hole(which shouldn't be a thing based on your understanding of physics, so its said that distance below plancks's length  physics sorta break down as nothing with such small perceived mass shouldn't possess that sort of gravity).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
