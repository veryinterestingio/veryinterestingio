		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is not a black and white question or situation. </p>
<p>Spay/neutering animals benefits humans, not necessarily the animal. Recent push have actually discouraged spaying/neutering animals young due to potentially negative effects on the animals health, and some people are against spay/neutering completely now for their own pets due to negative health effects. </p>
<p>The main push for spay/neutering is 1) to decrease unwanted strays and 2) to decrease unwanted behaviour in pets, such as going into heat for females (yowling, leaving residue when they sit, since animals have something like a period too) or aggressive territory marking in males (peeing everywhere). </p>
<p>Another benefit of spay/neutering is that being in heat and mating season can be a vulnerable and dangerous time. Being pregnant and giving birth can also be dangerous. So the benefit to the animal isn't that the lack of gonads make them &quot;healthier&quot;, its just less dangerous overall for them not to have mating behaviour (such as fighting over mates). </p>
<p>In terms of in humans, there are positives associated with removing gonads as well as negatives. Lower testosterone levels can lead to lower risky behaviour and longer overall life span in men. Generally people don't remove their gonads for no reason, so the removal will benefit the people in some way, otherwise medically they don't get the surgery. </p>
<p>But in a nutshell, there isn't clear evidence that spay/neutering make the animals &quot;healthier&quot; or &quot;happier&quot;, it just makes life easier for the humans.</p>
<p>Also, humans can articulate loss of quality of life from the hormonal change, and go to see medical professionals, and thus we just have more information about how the loss of hormones can affect a humans health. Animals cannot tell you if they feel any different from before the gonads were removed. As long as they are not actively sick, the owners won't take them to get checked. &quot;Quality of life&quot; for an animal is whatever the humans say it is, so we don't know if animals are &quot;happier&quot; from the spay/neutering. Maybe they hate it but just can't tell us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Neutering was heavily pushed and still pushed do to the vast amount of stray and unwanted animals in shelters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Some of it could be lifestyle but as the study suggests when the body doesn't have make a trade-off between reproduction and longevity.</p>
<p>So it may be that we are fixing our animals much earlier then we would for people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
