		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve read before, that we cry to visualize our distress to others around us, so that we can be helped. Imagine before we had language how your body could express to other humans, perhaps in your tribe, that you were experiencing something scary or saddening. You can’t be helped if you can’t communicate. Humans are the only animal that cries tears due to emotions.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans are made to instinctively look at other people's faces to see their emotions. Eyes already have the capability to create tears for other reasons and are located in the face so it make evolutionary sense to use this function to express some kind of emotion as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not just sadness. Tear ducts react to any strong emotional state: tears of joy, tears of rage, etc. It's an evolutionary response to your external environment in times of upheaval. Your body tries to protect itself in case of some potential injury in all the drama. In this case, by flushing your eyes out as a shield against incoming contaminants. Doesn't make a lot of sense in our modern society but it kept our ancestors' eyes healthier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
