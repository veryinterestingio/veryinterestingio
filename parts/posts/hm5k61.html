		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are Criminologists from Birmingham City University and editors on the new book Video Games, Crime and Next-Gen Deviance: Reorienting the Debate. After a drunken debate about the myopic view of video games causing violence after the tragic incident at Sandy Hook we decided to write a book. We argue that such discussion are reductive, inconclusive and frankly boring. We and our fantastic contributors then highlight some key areas in which we can recognise deviancy embedded within video games! The book is open access so free to download electronically and available here: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Video-Games-Crime-Next-Gen-Deviance-ebook/dp/B087BV7H9V" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Video-Games-Crime-Next-Gen-Deviance-ebook/dp/B087BV7H9V" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/Video-Games-Crime-Next-Gen-Deviance-ebook/dp/B087BV7H9V</a></a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Did you see any difference between those who played primarily online multiplayer and MMOs (i.e. Call of Duty, Player Unknown Battleground, Fortnite, World of Warcraft) and those who played primarily single player games (i.e. Skyrim, Fallout, Dark Souls, Assassin's Creed)?</p>
<p>As a gamer that has played a wide variety myself I've noticed widely different communities of players in games. Some are very positive and friendly, while others competitive yet mature. But I've also come across a few that are downright toxic, and obscene.</p>
<p>Have you noticed a correlation with toxic behaviors (such ad bigotry, mysonginy, racism, anti-feminist, homophobic) and video game genre?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the book Hello World by Hannah Fry, she linked people's groceries to certain behaviours (such as, if you buy fresh fennel, then you must be a home cook. Otherwise you wouldn't buy such an item).</p>
<p>So my guess is, in this age, where data is abundant, someone could link certain in-game behaviour patterns to certain behaviour patterns in real life.  </p>
<p>So my question is, what patterns would you, as criminologists, look for in games that would be able to make you recognize whether a person <strong>could</strong> be violent or involved in some kind of criminal activity?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
