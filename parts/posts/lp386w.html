Wouldn’t every bat hear the sounds made by all their bat friends rendering the information useless? (Sorry if the flair isn’t accurate I tried my best)</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huygens%E2%80%93Fresnel_principle" target="_blank">Huygens-Frensel-Principle</a> (which I think is ELI5) the echo sounds just like a sound source shaped like a point, no matter which bat the signal came from. Additionally, bat echolocation just works maybe for a few meters. Beyond that, the echo is too soft for even bats to hear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

There could be 50,000 talking/yelling fans, many of whom are right near you.  And yet you don't have a huge problem chatting with your friend in the seat next to you.  I can hear my voice and my friends voice, despite other voices being around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
