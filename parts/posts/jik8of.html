		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The mechanism we use to keep water from going into our noses is air pressure. You may not realize you're even doing it but you're using a tiny bit of air in your nasal cavity to keep the water from coming in. </p>
<p>When you're facing up or upside down beneath the water, the air in your nasal cavity escapes upwards and the space it leaves behind is filled with water. </p>
<p>If that's strange to visualize just imagine you're underwater with a straw in your mouth. If you look down at the bottom of the pool and blow into the straw, there will be a point in the blowing process where you've filled the straw with air and ejected all the water, but that the bubbles aren't streaming out. The air pressure in the straw is just enough to fill the straw and keep the water out. </p>
<p>But if you did the same thing facing the surface, any volume of air you pushed into the straw would simply float up to the surface, and the straw would only stay free from water for as long as you were blowing (but would fill with water the moment you stopped). That's what is happening with your nose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Take a clear glass, flip it upside down, and push it into a bucket of water. The air likes being above the water because itâ€™s much less dense, but the bottom of the glass + you holding the glass down keeps the air (and the glass) from rising up</p>
<p>Now flip the glass over and watch the air bubbles escape while water fills the glass. The same thing happens in your nose when you flip upside down</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Go fill up your sink or bathtub with water. Take a cup, and hold it upside down, and push it under the water. Notice how the cup does <em>not</em> fill with water. This is because the space inside the cup is already occupied by air, and because air is lighter than water and there is nowhere for the air to escape to, the water cannot force the air out to take its place inside the cup.</p>
<p>Now, take that same cup, hold it right side up, and push it under the water. Notice how the water rushes in to the cup, and displaces the air that was there. The air is lighter than water, and there is a nice big exist at the top of the cup for the air to escape through, so the air floats up and out of the cup, and the water can take its place.</p>
<p>What is happening to that cup is, very roughly, what happens to your nostrils. When facing down, the water cant get in because air is lighter than water, and the air has no way to escape except downward, so theair cant escape and make space for the water to move in to. When facing up, the air (because it is lighter than water) will float up and exit your nose, allowing the water to move in and occupy the space where the air used to be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you are facing up, water displaces the air and is able to enter. When you are facing down, in order for water to enter, it would have to move the air inside your nose downwards, which is very hard to do, as bubbles float upwards.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you're underwater there's a little bubble that lives in your nose. It's job is to stop the  nasty water running up (or down) your nose. Yuk! If you lean too far back underwater that little bubble floats up to the surface to be with all its other airy friends. Then that sneaky water rushes in through your nose! Most people learn to swim by sometimes holding their breath underwater but often you have to slowly blow new bubbles into your nose incase any of them have floated away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
