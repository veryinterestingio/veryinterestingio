		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While benzene isn't particularly reactive with most biologically relevant molecules, our enzymes are very effective catalysts and the oxidation products of benzene in the body are potent carcinogens. Cytochrome P450s in the liver and lungs are thought to initially convert it to benzene oxide, which then spontaneously rearranges to phenol. Another P450-dependent oxidation converts it to hydroquinone, and then reactive oxygen species oxidise this to benzoquinone within the bone marrow, where it can cause leukemia. There are alternate pathways from many of these intermediates, leading to other toxic and carcinogenic substances.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two ways aromatic compounds are carcinogenic.</p>
<ol>
<li>Intercalation. They basically penetrate cells and due to their flat structure <a href="http://what-when-how.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/tmp32C166_thumb1_thumb.jpg" target="_blank">they intercalate between the DNA bases</a>. This can cause errors when the DNA is replicated leading to possibly carcinogenic mutations</li>
<li>The second ways is basically <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/Image/Get?imageInfo.ImageType=GA&amp;imageInfo.ImageIdentifier.ManuscriptID=B313683C&amp;imageInfo.ImageIdentifier.Year=2004" target="_blank">epoxidation of aromatic compounds</a>. that is carried out by some enzymes in our body.  This basically binds an oxigen to the molecule as an epoxide, which is in turn very reactive and can thus react with DNA</li>

It has this ability bc it’s aromatic, planar and fits well between DNA base pairs</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s an intercalating agent.</p>
<p>Basically, your DNA is a series of Adenine/Thymine, Guanine/Cytosine base pairs. These bases have pretty flat 3D structures, so benzene, a similarly flat molecule, is able to stack in between two bases. This causes your DNA to form a bulge, preventing the replication machinery from working properly.</p>
<p>Life has ways of getting around DNA bulges and similar deformations (otherwise we’d be screwed). We have polymerases that can handle these situations and still read through, but they’re error prone and more likely to  introduce a mutation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
