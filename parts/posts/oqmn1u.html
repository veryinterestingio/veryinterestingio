		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is this effect to a slight extent. Of course the thickest parts of the atmosphere are made of air, a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, argon and so forth. At higher altitudes there is a big difference in the chemistry due to the sunlight, so the effects of density are not really seen by comparison. But even higher than that there is basically only hydrogen and helium (going past the karman line).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even without turbulence the kinetic energy of the molecules combined with the lack of interaction between molecules would cause two separate layers of N2 and O2 gas to mix almost instantaneously. The entropy gained would overwhelm any effect of moving of the centre of mass. (The molecules can get from the bottom of a large vessel to the top with minimal loss of energy.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EDIT: Following an educating discussion with u/Kered13 in the comments, I must preface that my original explanation was utter bullshit, and still managed to garner plenty of upvotes because democracy is fucking broken. So embarrassing. I'm editing it without removing the faulty bits so you can get an idea of how sometimes things seem to make sense, but actually, you',re off the mark by an few aircraft carriers.</p>
<p>TL;DR: I ELI5 how winds keep the atmosphere mixed up. While they do help, the atmosphere would still be mixed in their absence due to gases being what they are.</p>
<p>This entire paragraph is bullshit: This would happen on a &quot;rogue&quot; planet. A planet without a star. If Earth was slingshot away from the Sun, it would eventually happen.</p>
<p>Edit: in fact, even in the absence of the sun, gases would stay mixed due to a phenomenon I had not accounted for: they're fucking gases.  That's what gases do.</p>
<p>But with the sun heating up the Earth, and not even always the same side all the time, it causes gases near the ground to rise up. Hot gas takes more space than cold gases / are less dense / rise.</p>
<p>When they do, they push the gas above out of the way. Once up there they cool down / want to come down again but they are sitting on top of a column of hot air that wants to rise... It's a mess.</p>
<p>In creates a complex system of wind that keeps stuff a lot more mixed up than they would be otherwise.</p>
<p>Edit: but even with zero, nada, an absolute absence of wind, the gases wouldn't separate in layers. If you pop an helium balloon in a room, the helium molecules go everywhere, not up. Why? You don't have the math. But here's some keywords: &quot;ideal gases&quot; &quot;entropy&quot; &quot;2nd law of thermodynamics&quot;.</p>
<p>If you get far enough from the ground (the &quot;source&quot; of heat) things calm down and are more stratified. It's actually even called that. Stratosphere.</p>
<p>Edit: now, that is somewhat correct. While gases do not separate by order of density, you still find somewhat more of the heavier ones down and lighter ones up. That's because there are several forces in opposition here, and entropy mostly wins, but not fully.</p>
<p>PS: entropy isn't a force, that was a figure of speech.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unlike liquids, gases always mix, no matter what are the gases, no matter the proportion of each gas, they always mix in one single phase. In atmosphere you have layers of mixtures with different densities stacked, but it is not so much as actual, finite, distinguishable layers, but rather a gradient of density changing with altitude.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
