		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's also some selection bias at issue here. If you are choosing to nap during the day it's because you're already tired. If you decided to nap during the day without being tired then you'll likely have just as much trouble falling asleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think at night there is very little ambient noise so you &quot;hear&quot; every little bump in the night and your brain reacts to that as suspicious and wakes you. during the day there is a lot of noise and your brain filters it out as &quot;just more noise&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My completely uneducated take, is that if I'm napping during the day, it's because my eyes are literally closing by themselves. Rare, but it happens. If I try to go to sleep at a &quot;reasonable&quot; time I might have trouble for an hour or two, cause it's a bit early for me, and that's how long it takes to get to that eyes-closing-by-themselves level of tired.</p>
<p>More scientifically (SOMEONE PLEASE CORRECT ME) I've heard that once you wake up, the waves of &quot;potential REM sleep&quot; are closest together, and get farther apart as the day goes on, after waking. So those waves of peak energy, then a lull, then peak energy, then a lull etc. etc. are farthest apart when it's actually the ideal time to fall asleep. (Which I believe is why it's hardest to wake up, because that &quot;last 5 minutes&quot; actually has a better chance of completing a full REM cycle, when you've already been asleep for 4.5-6 hours.) which is also why people have the urge to nap most pretty close to the time they wake up (1-2hours after waking) and hit a stride of not feeling tired enough for a nap anymore after being awake for 4+ hours. Your body has already accepted its not getting another REM cycle in.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm an idiot, Monophasic sleep is fucking weird, thanks for reading.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
