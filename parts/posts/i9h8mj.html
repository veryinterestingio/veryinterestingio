		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because your immune system is busy, killing off damaged cell before they become cancerous, and new cells are being made to replace them. Every bodily function produces heat, but it’s more noticeable when it’s a combination of large scale and close to the skin’s surface.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sun has UV that fucks up the DNA in cells. Immune cells notice this and quickly kill off the damaged cells/damaged cells actually kill themselves. Both of these process produce heat + there is increased blood flow to the area to clear the waste.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also it's worth noting even though that burn 'fades away' or fades to a 'tan'.... It's not gone anywhere. </p>
<p>The skin remebers the damage caused by the sun permanently. Forever. It is irreparable damage done to the skin cells. </p>
<p>If you get burned in the same place <em>again</em> your really wrecking havoc on your poor poor skin.</p>
<p>If you never apply sun protection, your skin can become allergic (polymorphic light eruption (PLE)) to the sun and rash &amp; blister on immediate contact.</p>
<p>Sun damage is no joke. Take it seriously &amp; Protect yourselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, a sunburn is basically damaged skin by UV light that becomes inflamed due to the damaged cells. And as always, when something is inflamed, it's warmer than the rest of the body, caused by the small blood vessels in the tissue that become dilated, allowing more blood to reach the injured tissue. Hence why it becomes red and warm, a lot more blood flows through the area during the healing process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
