		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Earth DOES slow down!</p>
<p>Its momentum is changing mostly due to the presence of the moon, which creates gravitational drag and is steadily slowing the Earth's rotation.  This effect is large enough that we actually have to insert an extra second into the clock every few years (these &quot;leap seconds&quot; happen for a variety of reasons, but rotational slowdown is the biggest).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you spin a top on your desk, what stops the top from spinning is two-fold:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The drag on the spinning top that the air around it causes.</p>
</li>
<li>The energy lost to the surface it spins on.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Earth is neither spinning on something nor in an atmosphere.</p>
<p>That said, it's worth noting that the momentum IS changing at all times due to core activity and space dust and debris falling into the atmosphere. It's just a very small change.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It does, but very, very slowly.  There's nothing much to slow it down, except for tidal forces (the moon), and that's such a small proportion of the total rotational momentum that it doesn't have much effect.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Without some sort of friction something that is moving, keeps moving.</p>
<p>To slow anything down you need to transfer energy and do work.</p>
<p>So an object spinning about its own axis in complete isolation and a hard vacuum will not slow down since there is nothing to slow it down.</p>
<p>Earth spinning on its axis does actually very slowly slow down, due to the gravity of the moon (and to a lesser degree the sun) causing tides which slows down the rotation. (The moons rotation has already been slowed down this way so that it basically no longer rotates with respect to the earth.)</p>
<p>Some other stuff also help slow the earth's spinning a tiny bit, but the earth is a really huge spinning thing so that it takes extremely large things to really slow it down in a noticeable way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
