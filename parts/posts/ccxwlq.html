		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several causes for lack of trees.  </p>
<p>The meadow may just be in an early successional state where trees haven't grown back yet.  This would be due to a disturbance like a fire or landslide that killed the trees that had been there previously.</p>
<p>The meadow could be growing in a location where the environmental conditions don't support tree growth but do support grasses.  There could be a lack of water, the soil maybe very shallow, or the wind might be too extreme for trees.</p>
<p>It's also possible for grazing animals to keep growth low, so only plants that can come back from the roots like grasses will persist over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A biologist friend of mine loves to point at the boundary between trees and grassland and say “see that? That’s a war zone.”</p>
<p>Trees evolve inhospitable toxins in their leaves that they drop on the ground below, and ally themselves with fungi in the ground that make it hard for grass to grow. Similarly, grasses evolve abilities to break down the toxins and have their own alliances with fungi. It’s an evolutionary arms race for territory, and the boundary between trees and meadows is the front line. </p>
<p>At least that’s the narrative explanation. I’m sure there’s a lot more to it than that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did meadow restoration in the Sierra mountains, and it was the high water table that allowed meadows to exist.</p>
<p>The culverts and drainages created by the road systems in the mountains were destroying the naturally occurring meadows and it was our job to dam up the streams.</p>

<p>Some areas end up filling up over the years,  and clear up as trees die or fires burn away forest.  It happens slowly as trees need to get tall and provide shade for new growth.</p>
<p>There are also natural suppression systems that prevent perennials from remaining long term, this could involve flooding zones, a lack of resources to support larger plants and even something like the sun being to powerful in a particular area to support weaker plants.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some meadows are the results of Beaver Dams.  Beavers come in build their dam and flood an area. Most trees can't handle having their roots flooded and so they die. These ponds and associated wetlands can only exists as long as the beavers maintain the dam. After awhile the beavers move on and the pond silts up creating a meadow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
