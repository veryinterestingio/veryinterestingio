		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So pretend, if you will, that someone is breaking up with you. When the news hits, your nervous system  kicks into gear and triggers your fight or flight response.</p>
<p>Your body starts trying to circulate more oxygen to your muscles..</p>
<p>when you cry or are on the verge of crying, your glottis is trying to stay open in search of that oxygen, but gets forced close every time you swallow(like your saliva). This tension  messes with the muscles in your throat, giving the sensation of a lump.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our bodies responded to all kinds of stress - physical or emotional - by prioritising breathing over eating. As part of this instinct, your <del>trachea</del> <em>windpipe</em> opens. This forces your <del>oesophagus</del> <em>foodpipe</em> to close. When you swallow and you feel resistance, that's you pushing back against your body trying to focus on breathing instead of swallowing.</p>
<p>Your windpipe and foodpipe are joined in your throat, and there's a little flappy thing called an epiglottis that makes sure only one is open at a time. It's much more focused on keeping the windpipe closed usually, since getting air in your tummy makes you burp, but getting food in your lungs makes you choke. When you're stressed, that priority shifts over. </p>
<p>We tend to notices this more when we're sad vs. when we're scared or angry, because of two reasons. Firstly, fear/anger generally means you're more focused on something else, and paying less attention to your body. Second, our eyes are linked to our noses through little ducts (which is why we get snotty when we cry), and our noses are linked to our mouths and throats, so you'll eventually need to swallow some of the tears that go that route.</p>
<p>Edit:
To be a bit more detailed and less eli5: the epiglottis doesn't actually cover your oesophagus (foodpipe), just your trachea (windpipe). But the motion of opening the epiglottis (and thus trachea) squeezes your oesophagus shut. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=epiglottis&amp;safe=strict&amp;prmd=ivn&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk01cB9WMHEkUoFGM622L8at3JoQRLg:1618261355183&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwirxeqpzfnvAhU2QRUIHZ23CgMQ_AUoAXoECAIQAQ&amp;biw=734&amp;bih=651#imgrc=olHUo5gc59QIOM" target="_blank">This</a> is a good little animation of the process. When we get a lump in our throats, you can kind of think of it as the oesophagus 'pre-closing' a bit, to make it easier for the trachea to expand and stay open. It also means the trachea can open more fully, so you get more air into the lungs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stress causes you to unconsciously tighten your throat muscles. This causes your larynx to tighten which prevents it from moving as freely as it would otherwise. This gives you the feeling that swallowing becomes more difficult or in some cases even painful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
