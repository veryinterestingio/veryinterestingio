		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes a cell can't control how fast it divides. The result is a tumor, or just a bunch of cells where they shouldn't be. This is what a skin tag is, but they are not usually dangerous.</p>
<p>The skin in general tend to get these a lot but heavy use or dry areas get them even more often. Genetics and certain diseases like HPV can increase their number.</p>
<p>If you are worried about new or fast growing skin tags, see a doctor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Skin tags are benign, noncancerous, tumors of the skin. They consist of a core of fibers and ducts, nerve cells, fat cells, and a covering or epidermis.</p>
<p><strong>Possible causes:</strong></p>
<p>It is not clear exactly what causes skin tags, but it may happen when clusters of collagen and blood vessels become trapped inside thicker pieces of skin.</p>
<p>As they are more common in skin creases or folds, they may be mainly caused by skin rubbing against skin.</p>
<p>Some people appear to inherit an increased susceptibility to skin tags.</p>
<p>Skin tags affect people both males and females, but they happen more often during pregnancy, in people who are obese, and in people with diabetes.</p>
<p>They have been associated with hyperinsulinemia, when there is too much insulin circulating in the blood.</p>
<p><strong>Skin tags appear to be more common in:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>people who are overweight and obese </li>
<li>those with diabetes </li>
<li>women during pregnancy, possibly due to hormonal changes and high levels of growth factors </li>
<li>those with some types of human papilloma virus (HPV) </li>
<li>people with a sex-steroid imbalance, especially if there are changes in levels of estrogen and progesterone </li>
<li>those whose close family members also have skin tags</li>

<p>I get them taken off by my doctor. Usually snipped off, then the area instantly cauterized with heat or silver nitrate. Stings a bit but the little wounds heal quick.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My son was born with a skin tag on his ear. It was the weirdest but cutest thing ever. The dr said we would have to get it surgically removed when he was older which kinda scared us but otherwise he was healthy so we were happy. When he was about a week old, it just fell off! Never even thought about his tag since then until this post.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
