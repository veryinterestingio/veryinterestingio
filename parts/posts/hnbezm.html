		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's really evolved a lot over time, and old versions of the game contained pieces like the Advisor instead of a Queen, and Elephants. (There were very few Bishops in 7th century India)<br />
The rook was also originally a Chariot, but behaved the same way.  </p>
<p>The original Bishop being an elephant is probably the most changed ruleset, and it had many versions. At times it could move diagonally 2 squares but jump pieces, and in one version it could move to any diagonal square or one square forward.  </p>
<p>But as for how the modern rules developed, it's largely an issue of game balance and interest. The original move sets were slow and very samey. The King, Elephant and Advisor's movesets were very similar, and by contrast pieces like the Knights and Rooks were much more powerful.<br />
Some rules like the pawn moving 2 squares at first and en passant were also introduced to make the game open up quicker.<br />
The rule of Castling your king was introduced, which again speed up the move for King safety.   </p>
<p>A few hundred years after that was when the bishop being unlimited diagonal was introduced and the hyper powerful queen moves began.   </p>
<p>So really the moves just evolved to make it a more balanced and faster game, but the names now and the original names and intentions behind the movements are a bit disconnected at this point for some pieces.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
