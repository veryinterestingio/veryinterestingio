		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most modern displays are LCDs. LCD stands for liquid crystal display. What that means is there is a very thin layer of liquid held between two thin layers of glass. These crystals align in specific ways to make colors. When you press them, they get shoved out of alignment to varying degrees giving you a rainbowy ripple effect.</p>
<p>Edit: This got way more attention so I will elaborate to clean up some confusion. Note I'm just a tech hobbyist and I don't feel too confident talking about this that in depth, so take the word of the people who sound smarter than me replying over mine.</p>
<p>As people have pointed out liquid crystals are really not liquid or crystals in the layman sense. Liquid crystal is actually an intermediate phase of matter. Think of them as tiny controllable filter cells. Little pockets of this magic light bending material we've figured out how to control. They bend light in <em>just</em> the right way if you can control their position and waves right. We get them to move into the right shapes with electricity.</p>
<p>Someone below came up with a great example with polarized 3d glasses. If you hold polarized glass up to a light source and turned it you can see it block out specific bits at different angles. Monitors do this to align the light in a clean array that is manipulated to make a picture.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Think of a bundle of straws. You hold them all and they are all nice and aligned and uninterrupted, this is white light. Push a golf ball into the center of that bundle and the light can no longer travel in the right direction. Depending on the angle  of the light (again this is a really boiled down version) you see different colors. All of the straws are bent to varying degrees around the ball (or your finger).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have stated what LCD stands for - you are moving the liquid around.  </p>
<p>However more and more displays no longer use the liquid crystals. OLED, microled, qdled and similar are basically millions of tiny lights instead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
