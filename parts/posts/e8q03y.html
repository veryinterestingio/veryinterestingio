		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a rotating frame, there are two fictitious forces you feel: the centrifugal force, and the Coriolis force. The centrifugal force is the more well-known one: it's just pushes you outwards. The Coriolis force causes objects to move in a <em>curved path</em>.</p>
<p>Imagine you're standing on a rotate space station and you drop a rock. Ignoring air drag, the rock will now move in a straight line at a constant speed. Because the rock was rotating along with you and the space station, that means it will move in a straight line until it hits the edge of the space station. But because you're still moving and rotating, it looks like it moves in a curved path, and actually ends up behind you. There's a nice little gif on wikipedia <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_effect#/media/File:Corioliskraftanimation.gif" target="_blank">here</a> that might help.</p>
<p>So there really is a measurable difference. If it's strong enough, it might actually cause motion sickness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other people have mentioned the Coriolis force: if you drop something it won't fall in a straight line but will start to lag behind the rotation of the station.</p>
<p>If your entire frame of reference is rotating, a sufficiently accurate gyroscope will let you measure the speed and direction of that rotation.  This has been done with the earth, disproving the flat earth &quot;&quot;hypothesis&quot;&quot;.</p>
<p>The force of &quot;gravity&quot; acts outwards from the centre of the station, so if you hold two plumb lines (a weight on a string) near each other, the weights at the bottom will be further apart than the tops of the strings. Gravity from a massive body acts towards the centre of mass so the opposite is true on Earth: the weights are closer together than the tops of the strings.</p>
<p>The force of &quot;gravity&quot; from a rotating space station will also increase proportionally with the radius from the centre of rotation, so for a station that isn't gigantic you may be able to measure stronger gravity at your feet than your heard.  The radius of the earth is thousands of miles so it's hard to measure differences in gravity over small elevation changes. Even if the scale is enormous, the &quot;gravity&quot; from a rotating station increases linearly with distance and gravity from a massive object changes with the inverse square law, so making three or more measurements will let you work out the scaling law.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>Coriolis force: Moving sideways to the direction of spaceship &quot;gravity&quot; will produce an apparent deflecting force.   Coriolis is tiny on the Earth.</li>
<li>Weigh something twice.  Gravity on the surface of the Earth changes 1/r or 1 part in about 6 million per meter which is, for most practical purposes, constant.  On a rotating spacecraft, say 100 meters in diameter the &quot;weight&quot; change would be about 2% between your head and your feet.</li>
