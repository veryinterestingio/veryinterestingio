		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If it helps, we're already &quot;crushed.&quot; Our species evolved on this planet; we evolved &quot;resistance to crushing of 14.7 psi_a&quot; as part of the process, because otherwise our ancestors would've died.</p>
<p>With regard to the physics, most of our body is water, which is relatively incompressible, so that's not a hazard. What the barometric/atmosphere pressure <em>does</em> push on is the pockets of air in our lungs. Coincidentally, those pockets of air are <em>also</em> at about 14.7 psi_a (except we're actively breathing in/out), so the net force of the atmosphere on our lungs is basically zero. This means that there's no crushing at all; both sides being pushed the same means no net force to collapse our lungs. And our bodily structures, as mentioned above, evolved to survive that pressure, so they won't be damaged. Hence, we are crushed into a ball by outside pressure because we have internal pressure to resist it, and our individual cells/parts don't get crushed because they are individually strong enough to resist this pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's pressure, not weight. It's not a directed force, it's force on every surface. The air pushing in from above has the same force as the one pushing from below, same for left and right, etc.</p>
<p>And yes, we <em>are</em> being constantly squished together by air pressure. That pressure is even necessary for life. Water is only liquid at room temperature because the pressure squishes it together, preventing it from boiling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two things here to think about:  </p>
<p>1) our insides are at the same pressure as our outsides (and are mostly incompressible for that matter).  In other words we are at equilibrium with the air around us.   </p>
<p>2) what makes us <em>feel</em> the sensation of crushing is our bodies getting twisted around or deformed.  This is also how we perceive something has been crushed....its physical form has changed.</p>
<p>Because we are at equilibrium (point 1) we don't perceive any crushing (point 2).  </p>
<p>But why are we at equilibrium?  Well it's important that pressure comes from all available directions.  Imagine a water balloon.  If you poke it with your finger, it would go inward where you poked it.  If you put it between two flat plates and squished, it would compress outward through the gap between the plates.  If you surrounded it completely except for one hole and squeezed, it would push outward through the hole.  All that is deformation and it's &quot;crushing&quot;...if the balloon had nerves it would feel it, and you can see it happen.  </p>
<p>But if you surrounded the balloon completely with no gaps and pressed.  It's made of water, so it wouldn't go inward really because water isn't very compressible.  It'd remain the same shape.  If it had nerves it wouldn't really feel it because there would be no change in the shape of the balloon to detect.  The balloon doesn't have any gaps to be pushed into, so it doesn't change shape, so it doesn't get &quot;squished&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
