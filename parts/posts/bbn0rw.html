		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honey often contains botulism spores, growth of botulism is suppressed when there is low water activity (such as in honey), and it's suppressed when the pH is low. It needs to get 125'C to kill the spores. Botulism produces one of the most toxic poisons  known to man when it grows.</p>
<p>The temperature to kill botulism is too high for honey (it would ruin it). For adults this is a non-issue because it doesn't grow in honey, and when you eat it your stomach acid prevents it from growing. Babies don't have a low enough pH in their stomach (not enough stomach acid basically), so botulism can grow in a babies stomach after it mixes with water in their stomach which could be deadly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honey can carry the spores of bacteria responsible for botulism (a deadly disease). </p>
<p>The bacteria in honey is not harmful for people over 1 year of age because the developed gut-bacteria disallow the botulism-causing bacteria to grow from spores and release the toxin in the process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to note - itâ€™s an issue for babies up to the age of 1, so not really a problem for toddlers in general (although some babies may be toddling at 12 months). Once they are over 12 months it is considered safe.</p>
<p>In babies under 1, the worry is the possible presence of botulinum toxin, which can cause paralysis. In older children and adults this can be defeated by the bodies natural defences so it becomes much less dangerous at that point. In adults the same toxin is used in cosmetics (Botox).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
