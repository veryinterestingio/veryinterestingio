I found information that longer babies do become taller adults, but nothing about weight differences in the normal range (not talking about underweight babies).</p></div></div>

<p>In Danish army recruits</p>
<p>&quot;There was a strong positive association between birth weight and adult height&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378378217304905" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378378217304905" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378378217304905</a></a></p>
<p>Associations between birth size and later height from infancy through adulthood: An individual based pooled analysis of 28 twin cohorts participating in the CODATwins projecy</p>
<p>&quot; Birth weight and length are positively associated with later height from infancy to adulthood&quot;</p>
<p>Also another study linking body composition;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/0801743" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/0801743" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/0801743</a></a></p>
<p>An adverse intra-uterine environment, as measured by birth weight, is associated with more subcutaneous and abdominal fat and less lean body mass in adulthood.</p>
<p>Also lots more studies which I haven't linked to.</p>
<p>Anyhow is there a association? I would definitely say so. Causation/correlation? Probably, but the evidence isn't as strong to suggest this, mostly because of confounders, but I definitely wouldn't discount it as others here have.</p>
<p>EDIT; To provide a more direct answer to OPs question, the obvious direct correlation between birth length and birth weight makes it very tricky to arrive at an answer to &quot;do heavier babies make taller adults <em>whilst adjusting for birth length as a confounder&quot;</em>. Hence why there aren't any/many (that I found - not my field of expertise I might add however) studies which investigate this. Furthermore there is more to &quot;frame size&quot; than just height - e.g. clavicle length giving broader shoulders, wrist and ankle circumference etc. In this regard genetic deteminants come more into play. That said there is increasing evidence that epigenetic changes <em>in utero</em> can also influence things if, for example, there is compromise of the maternal environment (e.g. nutritional deficiences, alcohol intake)</p>
<p>My original comment was mostly addressing the others in this thread who seem to think there exists no relationship between the two.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nope. A tiny bit maybe on a population level, but there are way too many confounding factors to ever say for sure about a single specific baby.</p>
<p><a href="https://ebmcalc.com/HeightPotential.htm" target="_blank">Mid-parental height</a> is a pretty good estimate. It's basically an adjusted average of both parents, adjusted upward or downward depending on whether the baby is male or female.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn't perfect either - it only tells you someone's full genetic potential. If the baby has significantly stunted growth while in the uterus, then they may not be able to &quot;catch up&quot; to reach their full genetic potential. Same goes for any significant medical conditions that could stunt their growth at any point in their life.</p>
<p>Also, it assumes that the parents' heights are purely the result of their genes. If one of the parents had stunted growth, the MPH will underestimate the baby's potential, since the genes the parent can pass on actually contained instructions for a taller height.</p>
<p>But no, birth length and birth weight have essentially nothing to do with future height in a healthy full term baby.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
