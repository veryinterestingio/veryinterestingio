		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, the intensity of the reflected moonlight from a full moon is about 300,000 times weaker than that of direct sunlight (the exact number depends on various conditions such as location on Earth, where the moon is in its orbit, etc...).</p>
<p>So in order to get the same amount of UV radiation as you'd get from 15 minutes of direct sunlight, you'd need to be exposed to the moonlight for 8.5 years. In this time, the skin's limited self-healing capabilities are easily able to overcome the damage.</p>
<p>Your eyes are safe as well, because even looking directly into the moon is orders of magnitude less bright than looking at the sky on a cloudy day. It's even well below the intensity of dimly lit interiors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, but I'm kinda sure you could damage your eyes looking at the moon with something like a Dobson telescope, just because it's so bright.</p>
<p>After a minute of looking, when you look away you notice you can't see much only still see a massive light resembling the moon, everywhere you look, just like staring into a strong light bulb for a while.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Your eyes will be dilated at night, then suddenly filled with very bright light. Not immediate blindness, but not great for them long term.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>UV damage is not proportional to intensity.  It's worse.</p>
<p>When a single high-energy UV photon hits an electron in a molecule, it knocks the electron away, but the electron is likely to come back, restore its bond, and result in no damage.  When multiple UV photons hit electrons in a molecule, then those electrons are more likely to to escape, break a bond, or cross-link and bond with a neighboring molecule.</p>
<p>The chances of a molecule being struck by multiple photons, goes up nonlinearly with the number of photons in the vicinity.  This is why intense sun is so dangerous, and sunscreen is so important.  A small increase or reduction in intensity has a big impact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
