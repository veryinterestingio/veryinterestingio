		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Boiling or microwaving will KILL the bacteria. What it won't do is REMOVE the dead bacteria. That means there is dead biological material that's just food for more bacteria. The more you sanitize the sponge, the faster more new bacteria will grow... ELI5-when you kill bacteria it becomes bacteria food.  </p>
<p>Edit: Wow. So. Heat, UV, bleach &amp; desiccation(alcohol/sanitizer) can all kill bacteria. But there is no practical way to clean the material out of the deep pores of a sponge without destroying it. Nothing is as good as a clean sponge.   </p>
<p>A short video of a single celled organism dying that demonstrates this concept:<br />

<p>When I asked an engineer this they said:</p>
<p>Microwaving and boiling do sanitize better than no measures at all but you don’t kill everything in them and they repopulate quickly. Boiling and microwaving also don’t release the trapped food particles inside that lead to future infestations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The secret I've found to long lasting good smelling sponges is to always rinse them out after use, wring them out, and store them so they can completely dry out (I have a basket that suction cups to my sink).
