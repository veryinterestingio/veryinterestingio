		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Reddit! We're the team of researchers behind the world's first fully synthetic protein &quot;switch&quot; that can control living cells. It's called LOCKR, and it's a general building block to create circuits in cells, similar to the electrical circuits that drive basically all modern electronics (Wired called this the &quot;biological equivalent of a PID algorithm&quot;, for any ICS people out there).</p>
<p>Imagine this: A patient gets a traumatic head injury, causing swelling. Some inflammation is necessary for healing, but too much can cause brain damage. The typical approach today is to administer drugs to control the swelling, but there's no way to know the perfect dose and the drugs often cause inflammation to plummet so low that it impedes healing.</p>
<p>With LOCKR (stands for Latching Orthogonal Cage Key pRoteins), you could create &quot;smart&quot; cells programmed to sense inflammation and respond automatically to maintain a desired level - not too high, not too low, but enough to maximize healing without causing permanent damage. BTW, we've made the system freely available to all academics..</p>
<p>We're here to talk about protein design, genetic engineering and synthetic biology, from present efforts to future possibilities. We'll be on at 11 AM PT (2 PM ET, 18 UT). Ask us anything!</p>

<ul>
<li>Hana El-Samad - I am a control engineer by training, turned biologist and biological engineer. My research group at UCSF led the task of integrating LOCKR into living cells and building circuits with it. Follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/HanaScientist" target="_blank">@HanaScientist</a>.</li>
<li>Bobby Langan - I am a recent graduate from the University of Washington PhD program in Biological Physics Structure, and Design where I, alongside colleagues at the IPD, developed the LOCKR system to control biological activity using de novo proteins. Follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/langanbiotech" target="_blank">@langanbiotech</a>.</li>
<li>Andrew Ng - I am a recent graduate from the UC Berkeley-UCSF Joint Graduate Program in Bioengineering. I collaborated with Bobby and the IPD to test LOCKR switches in living cells, and developed degronLOCKR as a device for building biological circuits.

<p>EDIT: Hi, Reddit, thanks for all the great questions. We're excited to see so much interest in this research, we'll answer as many questions as we can!</p>
<p>EDIT 2: This has been so much fun, but alas it's time to sign off. It's energizing to see so many curious and probing questions about this work. From the whole team, thank you, r/AskScience!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, congratulations on this amazing accomplishment! I have little knowledge of the subject at all, but it seems like this could be pretty ground-breaking. I have a few questions: How did you guys originally come up with the idea to design these proteins? Would a treatment using LOCKR still have side effects like drugs do? And you used the example of acute inflammation from a TBI; could these proteins be used for other kinds of inflammation as well, such as the chronic inflammation found in autoimmune diseases?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I did not see an explanation as to how protein transcription is achieved - it is endogenous, right? How is the code implemented into the genome or is it ? How is transcription (or protein expression levels) regulated?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Do you guys know yet when LOCKR could be in commercial use? Even a ballpark guestimation would be interesting.</p>

What advice do you have for an undergrad, looking to change the world someday?  Have any living trials been conducted yet?  Will there be any applications in an orthopedic surgical setting, like with joint replacements, to reduce post-op swelling?  What about for chronic joint inflammation?  Can this also be used in place of immuno suppressants after an organ transplant?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
