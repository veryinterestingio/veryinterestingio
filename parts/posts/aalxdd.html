		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From <a href="http://www.espn.com/blog/detroit-lions/post/_/id/29571/promoting-bone-marrow-donation-awareness-a-lifes-passion-for-lions-linebacker" target="_blank">this ESPN article</a>, quoting &quot;Mary Halet, the director of donor services at “Be The Match,”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are other restrictions, too, including heart and lung health, prior cancer diagnoses and having suffered a series of concussions. Concussions are an issue <strong>because of the drug administered in injections to stimulate cells</strong>. Halet said there have been some clinical experiences of <strong>people with concussion histories suffering brain bleeds as a side effect of the drug</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The drug in question is part of (one specific) bone marrow extraction process, not concussion treatment.  They give you a shot to prepare your bone marrow to be extracted.  Having a history of traumatic brain injury (EG Concussions) makes your brain more likely to suffer a 'brain bleed' in response to receiving this shot.</p>
<p>However, there are multiple types of marrow donation with various medications and risk factors involved.  If you are concerned about the risks of marrow donation, talk to your doctor and/or nurses.  </p>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Having had a small number of concussions, or mild concussions in the past may increase the risk of severe complications, but does not disqualify you from marrow donation.  Please talk to your doctor, visit a donation clinic or check out these resources below for more information.  Don't let this post discourage you; everyone should ask their doctor or visit a clinic to donate bone marrow ASAP.</strong> </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Having had a single concussion doesn't make one ineligible, the <a href="https://bethematch.org/support-the-cause/donate-bone-marrow/possible-match/medical-guidelines-when-you-match-a-patient/" target="_blank">National Bone Marrow Donor Registry</a> sets their eligibility threshold at <strong>six concussions</strong>.</p>
<p>While they don't specify a reason on their site, repeated concussions cause brain injury and create a &quot;vulnerable brain&quot;. Post-concussive symptoms including cognitive impairment, rash judgement, dizziness, fogginess, etc can persist for months - and clinicians and patients should be generally cautious during this time. </p>
<p>More specifically, bone marrow donation involves the donor being placed under anesthetic. This always comes with some risk, but definitely comes with additional risk in a brain that has been concussed, as there are known changes to cerebral metabolism, auto-regulation of blood flow, and other &quot;silent&quot; brain functions [<a href="https://www.apsf.org/article/is-a-concussed-brain-a-vulnerable-brain-anesthesia-after-concussion/" target="_blank">Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation</a>]. It is recommended that anesthesiologists proceed with heightened caution and awareness in patients who have suffered brain injury, and it's probably just better safe than sorry when it comes to allowing donors to take elective risks like that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two types of bone marrow donations. Peripheral blood stem cell PBSC)  donation and bone marrow harvest. </p>
<p>The PBSC procedure uses filgrastim which is the medication that stimulates cell growth and can cause brain bleeds in people with a history of more than 6 concussions or a concussion with symptoms lasting more than a couple of days.</p>
<p>Bone marrow harvest, as in the surgery, does not require filgrastim and therefore someone with a history of concussions is still eligible for.</p>

<p>Source: I was matched recently to someone who needed bone marrow and learned a lot through the selection process. My history of concussions disqualified me from the PBSC procedure and the reasons were discussed in detail with me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. just got approved to donate bone marrow and I’ve had 3 concussions - but only through bone marrow harvest rather than with Peripheral Blood Stem Cells. That method uses blood and puts it through a separation machine, rather than taking bone marrow directly.</p>
<p>This method isn’t allowed if you’ve had a concussion with symptoms over 72 hours, because the 3 day process of injections before they take your blood can cause issues if you have, or have had brain bleeds that you didn’t know of. I was told that it may bring up issues that wouldn’t have happened naturally, so I wasn’t allowed to do that method. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
