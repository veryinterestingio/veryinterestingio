<blockquote>
<p>In addition to the prostate stagnation hypothesis [7], a number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain an inverse association between ejaculation frequency and PCa. More frequent ejaculation may influence the function of peripheral-zone epithelial cells, hindering the metabolic switch from citrate secretion to citrate oxidation known to occur early in prostate tumorigenesis [33]. Alternatively, more frequent ejaculation may reduce the development of prostatic intraluminal crystalloids, which have been associated with higher risk of PCa [34,35]. Higher ejaculatory frequency may be linked to lowering of psychological tension and central sympathetic nervous system suppression, which could dampen the stimulation of prostate epithelial cell division [36]. Given the lack of modifiable risk factors identified for PCa to date, the specific biological mechanisms underlying these associations are worthy of further investigation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(PCa = prostate cancer)</p>
<p>Those are some of the main proposed explanations, if there is a causal link (which is unproven, but suggested by data so far).</p>
<p>And yes, it is difficult to demonstrate a causal link.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the difficulty in answering that question is that medical studies such as these are very often conducted via measurement of correlations. Ethically, it's very difficult to ascertain the level and directionality of causal relationships in humans because in order to be definitive, there needs to be some amount of manipulation of variables. Since we're talking cancer, you can't manipulate people's behavior to see if cancer pops up, because if your hypothesis is correct, you just caused (or failed to prevent) a life-threatening illness. There are ways to get around this, such as statistical models (which appear to be fairly accurate in their predictions) and animal models. There's more to it, and there are always drawbacks to each method (hence testing and retesting being super important), but that's the basics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
