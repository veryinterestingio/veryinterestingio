<p>How does this work? Does our body truly act like it received 4-5 hours or is it all mental?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Welcome to the 70s... again. Deprivation tanks are basically just soundproof, light proof bathtubs filled with body temperature water and a shit ton of Epsom salts. The water gets super dense, meaning even a bodybuilder would float like no body's business. With no light, no sound, and super heavy water at the same temp as you, you basically feel like you are floating in the middle of nothing. It's really conducive to meditation and relaxation. Some people hallucinate, some fall asleep, some feel like they are in an altered state. It doesn't REALLY replace a lot of sleep, that's a biological process that takes the same time no matter what. It is just very relaxing. Well.... for som e people. Some people really can't take it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's less that you get 5 hours of sleep in 45 minutes and more that the sleep quality is improved because the tank is meant to create the perfect environment for sleep and meditation. People normally don't get perfect sleep between the physical and mental ailments or bad sleep habits they may have. Sleep apnea can nullify literally like 8 hours of your sleep making you feel sleep deprived no matter what you do for example. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most things athletes use to enhance their performance don’t have measurable benefits that would fall outside of the margin of error in a scientific study. A great deal of it is really placebo effect. Some of it actually works, but the benefit is astonishingly small.</p>
<p>But remember, these are ELITE athletes. For someone who is a layperson, that tiny advantage won’t make us appreciably better. But with, say 100 elite athletes who are all at the top of their professions, the smallest advantage can have a marked effect on their performance. Even if it doesn’t have an actual benefit, the placebo effect can still make a major mental difference, and a mental edge can be every bit as effective as a physical one.</p>
<p>The Freakonomics podcast has done a series on sports and their most recent was on this mental game.</p>
<p>Athletes and teams will spend millions chasing a 1% edge. But often times they’ll ignore the data telling them what they should do, even if it gives them a bigger edge, because they don’t want athletes or coaches second guessing themselves ... confidence is such a big factor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can help answer this. I worked at a major blue blood  college football program athletic training department and have looked into the research behind it and have given a presentation on it. Basically it doesn’t really give you 5 hours of sleep in 45 minutes. But what it does do is make that 45 minutes of sleep a perfect 45 minutes of sleep. When you sleep on a bed, no matter how firm/soft/expensive it is. Your muscles are always working to maintain posture and fight gravity. With the sleep tank, you are completely suspended in the water, so all those small postural muscles can relax. Also, since there is almost no sensory input, there is nothing to pull you out of deep sleep like a car driving by your house or sunlight peaking through your blinds. Sleep is incredibly important to athletic performance, mental function and physical rest/recovery </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
