		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Traditional heating elements use electrical resistance to generate heat. As high voltage electricity is forced through a relatively unconductive material, the electrons bump into the atoms, losing some of their energy as heat.</p>
<p>Induction cookers use electricity to heat metal in a less direct way. By using AC current, the induction cooker actually creates a magnetic field that switches back and forth very rapidly. This has a heating effect on metal, as the atoms are continually excited by the magnetic field jerking them around. However, the glass that the heating element is placed under, as well as your hand, is made of nonmetals, so the magnetic field has nowhere near the same magnitude of effect on them, which keeps it cool to the touch.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In an attempt to simplify the accurate explanations that were already given to the level of a five year old:</p>
<p>A traditional heating element uses electricity to make itself warm, like a hot lightbulb. The pan then becomes warm because you put it on top of something warm.</p>
<p>An induction cooker instead uses an electromagnet to make the pan warm directly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>The short answer</strong>: The cooker makes your pan into one coil of a transformer, inducing a large electric current inside the the pan.  Some cool physics confines that current to a very thin layer of the pan, which means the pan has a lot of electrical resistance.  That makes the pan heat up the same way the element of an old-style electric stove does -- but without a direct wired connection to the wall.</p>
<p><strong>A longer answer</strong>:</p>
<p>Induction cookers work by inducing electric currents in the pan.  Under the glass stovetop is a large coil of very fine copper wire.  The cooker sends alternating current electricity into the large coil.  That makes a rapidly vibrating magnetic field right over the coil.  It vibrates something like 20,000 to 50,000 times per second -- right above the highest pitches you can hear.</p>
<p>When you put a pan over that vibrating magnetic field, it induces an electric current in the pan.  That's why the cooker is called an &quot;induction stove&quot;.  The <em>changing</em> magnetic field induces an electric current in the pan.  That effect is the same physics used by the power station to make the electricity you use: changing the magnetic field near a wire pushes electricity through the wire.</p>
<p>The electric current in the pan is over 1,000 times stronger than the current in the copper coil, because there are over 1,000 loops of wire in the copper coil, and just one loop of &quot;wire&quot; in the pan.  That's because current grows until the magnetic field from the one loop of current in the pan bottom cancels out the magnetic field from the 1,000 (or more) loops of wire in the stove. </p>
<p>The current through the pan can be immense:  thousands of amperes, compared to the <em>one</em> ampere that a typical 100W old-style light bulb uses.  Pushing that much current through the pan makes the pan heat up.</p>
<p><strong>Why does the pan get hot and the stove doesn't?</strong></p>
<p>When you pass an electric current through a piece metal (like a wire), the metal heats up.  The amount of heat depends on the strength of the current, and also on the &quot;resistance&quot; of the metal.  The resistance depends on how thick the wire is (it gets less for thicker wires) and also on how long the wire is (it gets more for longer wires). </p>
<p>There's a really neat effect that happens when you induce an electric current into iron, in particular.  Remember, magnetic fields &quot;like&quot; to be inside iron (that's why magnets stick to iron).  A side effect of that fact is that, if you induce an electric current in iron (by changing the magnetic field around it), it takes a fraction of a second for the electric current to spread through the iron.  At first, the current exists only on the surface of the iron.  </p>
<p>The reason the induction stove reverses its magnetic field so fast is to keep the immense induced current in a thin layer on the surface of the pan.  That raises the effective resistance of the pan -- it conducts like a thin layer of iron foil, instead of like a thick block of metal.  The current has to flow through a layer that is about 10 microns thick (about the size of a cell in your body) instead of the full 5 millimeters or so of the pan body.  That increases resistance by a factor of about 500.  </p>
<p>The stove doesn't get hot because the &quot;skin effect&quot; in copper is much less, and because the copper coils use braided wire that is made of very thin strands, so that it's all &quot;skin&quot;.  So the resistance of the wire is a lot less than the resistance in the pan, and all the heat gets dumped in the pan.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you need special pans for an induction stove?</strong></p>
<p>Incidentally, that skin effect is also why aluminum and copper pans don't work on an induction stove.  Aluminum and copper aren't magnetic, so they don't have nearly as strong a &quot;skin effect&quot; as iron or steel does.  So the induced current can conduct through the whole body of the aluminum pan, which keeps the pan's electrical resistance low.</p>
<p>That's also why you should never put aluminum foil near the surface of an induction stove.  Aluminum foil is very thin, so no skin effect is needed -- it's so thin that currents induced in the foil can make it hot or melt it.  You can test that by placing a single sheet of aluminum foil in a flat glass dish, filling the dish with water, and placing <em>that</em> on the induction stove.  The aluminum foil will get hot, and (depending on your stove) may even be able to boil the water in the flat dish.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not an answer to the question (there are already good answers) but a warning to all 5 year olds. Whilst the induction plate doesn't get hot in order to heat the pan, that hot pan will conduct heat back to the induction plate and it will indeed get hot. Don't touch. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A normal cooker works by passing electricity through a wire called a heating coil. As you pass electricity through the wire the energy will be converted to heat. You then place a pan on top of this heating coil and the heat will be transferred through the bottom of the pan into the pan. As you are doing this the air will also get heated so some of the heat is lost. An induction cooker works slightly differently. It is based on the concept of conductivity transferring electricity. This is the same technology used in electrical transformers and wireless charging. By using a high frequency signal in the coil of wire it will form a varying magnetic field. You can then place another loop of wire on top and it will start conduct electricity. So instead of having the heating coil in the cooking top you have the heating coil in the pan. You do not technically have to shape the wire as a coil either but most sheet of metal will work. This is why you can take your grandmothers old frying pan and use it on a modern induction cooker. By moving the heating element to the pan, closer to where you want the heat to go, you are not loosing as much heat in the transfer. However the electronics required to change the mains power to high frequency power for use in the induction coil does waste some energy and these elements needs to be cooled. So the induction cooker still gets hot but not as hot as a traditional cooking top and the heat is usually produced in the back in the power supply.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
