		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tinnitus is not just a high pitch ringing.  Its explanation was a mystery until recent decades, since it also arises as white-noise rushing, hums, etc.   &quot;Tinnitus is commonly described as a ringing in the ears, but it also can sound like roaring, clicking, hissing, or buzzing. It may be soft or loud, high pitched or low pitched. You might hear it in either one or both ears.&quot;  Keywords to try:  low-frequency tinnitus.</p>
<p>The unknown sources of tinnitus are starting to fall before modern research.  In the last two decades it was discovered that ears are not like passive microphones, but instead involve <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1672293014500177" target="_blank">sound emitters and active feedback.</a>  Human hearing employs a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378595510002467" target="_blank">mechanical amplifier</a> in the cochlea, and the brain regions involving tinnitus <a href="https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7007-7-80" target="_blank">are starting to be explored.</a></p>
<p>As with misbehaving audio systems, ears with too much gain at the wrong frequencies can break into oscillation.  Cornell's infamous Thomas Gold mentioned the original mystery which attracted his own attention in the 1950s:  some tinnitus is a genuine sound, today known as OAE <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=otoacoustic+emission" target="_blank">Otoacoustic Emission</a> and can be recorded <a href="https://asa.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1121/1.385481" target="_blank">using a microphone inserted into the ear canal.</a>  The WP article notes that most humans don't detect their own spontaneous OAE sounds, but 1-9% do perceive it as tinnitus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mine is all sorts of tones.  Had it as long as I can remember thought everyone experienced it.</p>
<p>High pitched squeal, oscillating tones.</p>
<p>I remember sticking things in my ears to make it stop as a kid.</p>
<p>Now I only notice it if I listen for it or think about it.  It's always there, you can get used to it.</p>
<p>It's like my dream top. If I hear it I know I'm awake.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As for the people saying it's the hairs, that's not the full story. I had a full labyrinthectomy in 2008 and still have tinnitus 24/7. I have no middle ear and am completely deaf.  I still have ringing/humming/pounding in my deaf ear. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mine is like the high pitched sound you used to get from CRT Tv's when they first switch on.
It is louder when my surroundings are silent.  Nothing really exacerbates it but I notice it more when I have been somewhere noisy and move into somewhere quiet.</p>
