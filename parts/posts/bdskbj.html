		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our findings published on April 1, 2019, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences demonstrate that cocaine trafficking, or 'narco-trafficking, through Central America to the United States is as widespread and difficult to eradicate as it is <em>because</em> of interdiction, and increased interdiction will continue to spread narco-traffickers to new areas in their pursuit of moving drugs north.</p>
<p>We developed a simulation model, called NarcoLogic, that found the result of the 'cat-and-mouse' game of narco-trafficking and counterdrug interdiction strategies is a larger geographic area for trafficking with little success in stopping the drug from reaching the United States. In reality, narco-traffickers respond to interdiction by adpating their routes and modes of transit, adjusting their networks to exploit new locations. The space drug traffickers use, known as the 'transit zone', has spread from roughly 2 million square miles in 1996 to 7 million square miles in 2017. As a result, efforts by the United States to curtail illegal narcotics from getting into the country by smuggling routes through Central America over the past decades have been costly and ineffective.</p>
<p>The model provides a unique virtual laboratory for exploring alternative interdiction strategies and scenarios to understand the unintended consequences over space and time.</p>
<p>Our paper describes the model, its performance against historically observed data, and important implications for U.S. drug policy: <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/03/26/1812459116" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/03/26/1812459116" target="_blank">https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/03/26/1812459116</a></a>.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you looked at alcohol prohibition because I'm wondering how general the model is with respect to different drugs and different geographical distances.</p>
<p>Also, does you model predict anything about how these trafficking organizations wind down after a drug is legalized? Perhaps it might give some insight on the demographics of the people involved so we might better transition them away from violent behavior when we grow some sense and abandon this disastrous policy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
