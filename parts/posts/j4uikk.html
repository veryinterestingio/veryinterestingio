		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As you say,  electricity takes the path of least resistance,  not the path of shortest distance. It travels through air,  which does not have a consistent density, pressure, humidity level,  concentration of O2 or N2, particulate levels, or a any of a bunch of other factors, between the points of discharge and ground.  Even minute variations in these may result in greater or less electrical resistance, and the discharge will always take whatever path offers least resistance. Just like whenever you go anywhere, you take the roads because they are the path of least resistance, because the straight line through the obstacles of buildings,  trees,  streams, hills,  etc. would be much too difficult.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think your question isn't so much why does it arc (ionising the air) as why isn't it a straight line?</p>
<p>Air density, oxygen concentration, temperature and moisture content isnt constant. Electricity will find the path of least resistance through the optimal path. That's not always the shortest.</p>
<p>To try to visualise it, when there's mist you can see tiny water droplets. There are always tiny water droplets, they're just usually too small to see. Electricity can &quot;see&quot; them and will find them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The path of least resistance is not a straight line because the properties of the air are not constant everywhere.</p>
<p>If that was the case then yes it would be a straight line.</p>
<p>But since air is not 100% the same everywhere it's possible that the region to the right or to the left has less resistance then the region in front</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
