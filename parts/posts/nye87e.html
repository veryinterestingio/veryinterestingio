		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A little more simple:</p>
<p>One thing is to see and other is to process the image.</p>
<p>One part of the brain processes the action of seing, plane and simple</p>
<p>Other part of the brain allows you to process the image and let you know what it is exactly.</p>
<p>This Translates in some illness allow you to see a person and knowing is a person, but you are not able to know if that person is a random person or your mom.</p>
<p>So, when you stare into the vacuum, you lose your mind and you are SEEING, but your brain does not processes what you are seing, and when you come back from your trip, your brain again uses energy to understand what you are seeing.</p>
<p>P. D. Sorry for the bad English, that is the best I can do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
