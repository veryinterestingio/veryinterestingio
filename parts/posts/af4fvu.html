		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can't go underwater with out a massive life support system. Professional divers can go down to only about 200 feet deep. Sunlight only goes down to about 600 feet, after that it's very dark. </p>
<p>Scientific subs can go down very deep, but they're only down there for an hour or less and can only see as far a their flood lights will let them. What happens in that same spot the remaining 23 hours? Or the 365 days? What happens 30 feet over from that spot?  Or even 30 feet up or below from that spot? The ocean is a large area but it's also a very large 3d world. Everything from the ocean floor to sea level is a large space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s also the needle in the haystack aspect.      From what we’ve seen from the exploration we have done, there is not much going on on most of the seabed.   It’s basically very very deep mud punctuated by  rare oases of life (black smokers, whale carcasses, coral reefs etc).    And as alluded to above, most of the ocean itself is a massive body of utterly dark (“aphotic”), cold water, which also doesn’t support much life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Don't take the 10% too literally, different methods to count that lead to vastly different results.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
