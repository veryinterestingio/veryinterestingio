		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok so tolerance to alcohol is multi factorial.</p>
<p>The first factor is that your liver upregulates enzymes that break down alcohol when you repeatedly expose yourself to alcohol. There are two main methods for this: alcohol dehydrogenase and the cytochrome p450 (CYP450) family of enzymes. The CYP450 family of emzymes has many different members, a couple of which break down alcohol. Alcohol dehydrogenase mainly breaks down alcohol but has a few other chemicals. It's this latter enzyme which is <em>sometimes</em> missing in people who are chinese/japanese/korean etc. (I'm not going to say Asian as in the UK we would use that to deacribe Indians/Pakistanis/Bangladeshis etc.).... Which is why your Chinese friends sometimes go red and get giggly when they have one drink.</p>
<p>Anyway the other way you develop tolerance is that your brain/nerves get used to the alcohol. Alcohol generally supresses the signalling pathways between nerves. Basically nerves release molecules to talk to each other. Each of. Those molecules has a special receptor on the cell it's trying to &quot;talk&quot; to. </p>
<p>Alcohol does a lot of things to different bits of the brain but <em>on the whole</em> alcohol surpresses the signals that make a nerve cell fire. So, in order for the cells to functiom properly they  make more receptors and release more signalling molecules. Think of it as alcohol pressing the brake pedal of the brain and your brain putting on the accelerator to get to the same speed. (this is my rather simplistic-for-the-sake-of-explanation description of what u/namesarehard4 was saying about downregulation). </p>
<p>This is the problem with withdrawl. When you remove the brake pedal the accelerator is still waaay way down. So the &quot;go&quot; signals are up-regulated... This doesn't mean you think more quickly and have superhuman cognition. It means that the nerve cells making it up make a lot of &quot;noise. &quot; This leads to tremors, confusion/delirium, sweating and seziures. Which is why people have to come off alcohol slowly or with a carefully dosed substitute, so the &quot;brake&quot; can be taken off slowly.</p>
<p>Edit: there's probably other things that happen in tolerance but these are the main two...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On a biological pov: </p>
<p>Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) is a pathway that metabolizes alcohol, and therefore helps to sober you up. I think a few people have already talked about this already. </p>
<p>There is another aid in alcohol consumption called the microsomal ethanol oxidizing system (MEOS). This system is activated by the liver when too much alcohol is present for ADH to deal with. MEOS essentially does the same thing as ADH, but requires extra energy input. The activity of MEOS increases with increasing alcohol intake, meaning that heavy drinkers will develop a tolerance due to the extra activity of MEOS. </p>
<p>While ADH accounts for about 90% of alcohol metabolism, activation of MEOS allows for greater efficiency and rate of metabolism. This means you would be able to drink more than the average bear; however, I'm not exactly sure what &quot;more&quot; quantifies to. </p>
<p>Reading the other posts, I would say that your body does a wide range of things in response to regular alcohol intake. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What I can tell You for sure is that the first part is correct. Alcohol is metabolised by one of cytochromes p450, cyp2e1. However, it has a peculiar property of accelerating the way cyp2e1 works. So alcohol speeds up its own elimination.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The brain becomes more &quot;resistant&quot; to drugs via a process called &quot;downregulation&quot; (of receptors). In this process, the number of receptors on a neuron that a particular drug binds to gradually decreases in response to repeated administration of the drug. In the case of alcohol, GABA-A receptors (and probably others, as alcohol affects a number of other receptors) &quot;downregulate&quot; over time, so your neurons become less sensitive to the effects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
