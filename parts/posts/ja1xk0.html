		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends.  </p>
<p>Sometimes they are strictly sequential like you describe. Other times they might number them by block, the buildings on the first block on a street may start at 100, the buildings on the second block would start at 200, etc, even if there aren't 100 buildings in each block. Another method used in some places numbers buildings based on a formula that represents distance from the beginning of the street....something like 742 may be roughly 0.75 miles from the beginning of the starting point.  </p>
<p>Most of the time though they still stick to evens on one side and odds on the other.  </p>
<p>tl;dr - There's no enforced standard in the US for building numbers. They generally do follow a specific pattern, but it can change from area to area.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Chicago, the thousands and hundreds place tell you how many blocks you are from the grid origin at State St and Madison St. Every 800 addresses, or 8 blocks, is one mile. The tens and ones places increment by two for every lot from the corner. They start at 00 on the West and North side of each street and from 01 on the East and South side. Lots are usually 25 feet wide, so most blocks end at around xx50 before starting over at the next hundred. On the South Side, many streets are numbered to match the block number, going south. For instance, Obama's house is the last one on the block starting at 50th St, and the address is 5046 S Greenwood Ave. But the next street, which starts the 5100 block, is actually E Hyde Park Blvd.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is literally no one single explanation, since states, counties, cities, etc. will have different policies and criteria.</p>
<p>Or, it could all be meaningless and marketing-driven. Street names and addresses are sometimes set by the construction companies building the houses and developments. Their naming and numbering schemes are designed to sell the houses and their associated lifestyles.</p>
<p>That's how you end up with wacky, meaningless names (e.g. I lived at &quot;35 Greco Aisle&quot; which was neither the 35th of anything, not Greek and not an &quot;aisle&quot;), and how you also avoid having really poor names that no one would want to live at, like &quot;1313 666th Street, Helltown, USA.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it all depends on the area. in my neighborhood, the numbers denote which avenue/street you live on. if you live at, say, 416 70th st, you live on the 70th street above 4th ave. but, if your address was 7016 4th ave, you live on 4th ave, between 70th and 71st street.</p>
<p>for obvious reasons, this only works if the neighborhood is almost entirely numbered, and the few that aren't have numerical equivalents.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
