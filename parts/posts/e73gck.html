		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In simple terms, sleep is surprisingly a very active process. Your brain sends millions of signals and messages when you are asleep - dreams and the like. The brain moves between phases of activity, and during REM sleep actively prevents your limb muscles from moving. </p>
<p>Anaesthesia conversely reduces the activity of your brain. Everything slows down and high levels of anaesthesia drugs can stop all significant electrical activity in your brain (isolelectric EEG). Comas are similar and have varying levels, but in essences yout brain activity is reduced when you are in a coma.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>sleep is the body doing repair work on the brain - it's very easy to wake up a sleeping person</p>
<p>unconsciousness is an emergency shutoff, usually due to trauma - low blood pressure and brain swelling are the usual candidates. - It's (near) impossible to wake up an unconscious person (and usually it's pretty dangerous to do so)</p>
<p>A coma is when, for whatever reason, you don't wake up from being unconscious. This is usually because whatever caused you to go unconscious doesn't go away (this is where brain damage happens, and can turn people in vegetables), and less often because the thing that's supposed to wake you up just... doesn't. - It's impossible to wake up someone in a coma (that's what separates a coma from unconsciousness), and a lot of the treatments for non-traumatic comas are basically just the same drugs you use to wake up unconscious people turned up to 11</p>
<p>anesthesia is for you brain like what happens when you unplug a desktop computer. The drugs just turn off your brain, and it will stay off until the drugs are scrubbed from your system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unconsciousness is a broad term. Being conscious means reacting to outside stimuli. A sleeping person is technically conscious because they still react to light, sound, pressure, etc. Someone in a coma - medically induced or otherwise - typically will not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of conscious and Anesthesia like a dimmer switch on a light. The lower the switch the dimmer the light. If the switch is broken (coma) the light still works and there still is electricity but it can’t get to the light. Anesthesia basically temporarily changes the dimmer with drugs and when the drugs go away the dimmer goes back to the original setting. To what conscious is can be difficult and becomes very philosophical as we don’t really understand how the original dimmer works we just know if we interact with specific receptors in the brain (I.e. GABA receptors) it artificially activated the dimmer and when we stops the dimmer goes back. Anesthesia providers talk about consciousness in terms of 4 stages. 1st being light sedation (sleep) where I describe to my patients as you can be asleep but might remember things around you (think of napping on the couch at a family gathering). 2nd being an excitatory stage which is the most dangerous part of anesthesia and a side effect of the drugs we have to use (think of a plane taking off or landing). 3rd general anesthesia were you don’t respond to highly stimulating things (like surgery). 4th is essentially the lowest setting on the dimmer, there is brain activity but not much (coma). The dimmer gets broken because of many things could be injury causing swelling, not enough oxygen in your blood, not enough blood in your brain (related to oxygen), or drugs. Luckily thru experiments in the past we now have drugs that can lower the dimmer to a level we want but not so much we break the dimmer.
