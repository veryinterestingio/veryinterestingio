		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever seen someone splitting logs with a too-small axe? They'll take a swing at the log, but the axe gets lodged in the log. No problem, they pickup the axe and the log together, flip it around so the axe head is down and the log up, and swing the whole thing down onto the block.</p>
<p>The axe stops dead, and the mass of the heavy log is pushed down onto the axe, splitting it every time. </p>
<p>Now think of someone's head being hit by a club. The person's head is heavier than the club. Yes, the club does lots of damage to the skin, or even the person's skull, but all of that absorbs the impact. The person's head doesn't move much, so the force on the brain is low enough so the brain's defences - a layer of liquid around it, for instance - protects it. There may be some injury around the impact site, but he brain learns how to work around that damage.</p>
<p>But turn this around - the person is now falling, the head is moving at high speed, and it hits the solid ground. The skull stops dead. Like the log pushing down onto the axe, the person's brain is now thrown hard onto the inside of the skull. This is what does the damage to large areas of the brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So it very much depends on how you get hot on the head, how lucky you are, and how quickly you get medical attention.</p>
<p>Let's quickly look at the brain. It's a large, squishy and very delicate mass of jelly floating in a few cm of fluid and sealed inside a solid mass of bone. When something hits the brain, hopefully the bones and liquid absorb the shock. However, if you hit your head with enough force, you'll bruise your brain at the point of impact, and, if you're hit hard enough, you brain will smash against the bone on the other side of the skull, bruising it a second time. The brain has loads of tiny blood vessels, so when it bruises, it bruises bad. The area swells up pretty significantly, and if the bruise is bad enough, you can start having a bleed within your brain. Both these things are bad, because you don't have very much space inside your skull, so swelling and bleeding put more pressure on to your brain, which damages it further. On top of that, if the bleed is bad enough, then parts of the brain may die from lack of oxygen cos the vessels supplying it aren't doing their job any more. </p>
<p>Now, when you get impaled in the brain, there are a few big differences: first off, your skull is no longer sealed, which means that your brain actually has somewhere it can swell to. This is still not an ideal situation, and it may cause damage to specific areas of your brain, but it's less likely to cause the entire system to fully shut down. Second, you've (hopefully) managed to make your area of damage a lot more localised, so you may have completely destroyed your language processing center, but the rest of the brain is relatively unaffected. On top of that, the object now lodged in your brain is stopping you from bleeding out for as long as it stays loged there. Yay!
Finally, and I think this is probably a significant factor, bias. If you manage to impale your head, there's a much higher chance of you dying instantly or on your way to getting medical aid. Surviving a brain implement also makes for a cool news story, so you're more likely to hear about it. I'd guess you're also more likely to be around other people when you impale your brain, which means you may get medical attention faster. On the other hand, hitting your head is something that's very easy to do by yourself at home. If you slip and fall in the shower, it's likely no one will be around to call the ambulance straight away. As such, you're more likely to get medical assistance a lot later, which will massively impact your chances of recovery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Damage to the spine caused by trauma in a fall is often what leads to paralysis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My step uncle was helping his son tie his rollerblades while having rollerblades on himself. Upon tying the skates for his son; he stood up, lost his balance and fell hitting the back of his head on the concrete and died instantly. Complete freak accident. From what I heard it wasn’t even a bad fall. Just slipped and was dead. I know this doesn’t answer your question at all but it just made me remember this happening. Life is crazy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
