		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Live vaccine: measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) and chickenpox vaccine.  These are attenuated, meaning they are weakened but can still cause the disease.  These are not given to immunocompromised people.  Intranasal flu is live, but the shot is not.  Normal flu shot is inactivated.</p>
<p>Inactivated vaccine:  these are killed, then injected, and create enough of a response to provide immunity.  Example of this would be polio vaccine.  You might need a few doses to become immune, but you can not get the disease from an inactivated vaccine.</p>
<p>Toxoid Vaccine:  this uses the toxin, just weakened, to create an immune response.  Things like tetanus and diphtheria use this method.  You might need boosters to continue with immunity.  But these aren't even the bacteria, they are just the weakened toxin from the bacteria.  So can't cause the disease.</p>
<p>Subunit vaccine:  basically a chopped up virus or bacteria.  So enough parts in there that the body will mount an immune response.</p>
<p>Conjugate vaccine:  a little more complicated.  These add little flags called antigens on the outside of a bacteria that usually has a sugar coating around it to disguise itself.  So now the new flags help the body recognize and fight it.</p>

<p>Ask questions if I wasn't clear and I will try my best to clarify or answer new questions.</p>
<p>Edit:  My post now makes fireballs and has helping hands on it, and I'd like to say that this is very cool.  Thank you for this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes: live vaccines can be a risk to elderly people and immunocompromised people.  However, there are Inactivated Vaccines, that do not use pathogens that do not have this risk, because the pathogens are specially designed to be unable to reproduce.  </p>
<p>Sadly, these inactivated vaccines create a much reduced immune reaction from the body, which is why most people are recommended to get a live vaccine if they are low risk.  While immunocompromised people get better odds from inactive vaccines, things like booster injections and herd immunity also helps keep them safe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. It happened to me - I caught polio from the oral polio vaccine. It’s on the WHO pages as <a href="https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/poliomyelitis/endgame_objective2/oral_polio_vaccine/VAPPandcVDPVFactSheet-Feb2015.pdf" target="_blank">vaccine associated paralytic polio</a>. It’s very rare, at 1 in 2.7 million doses. </p>
<p>(Am still pro vaccination).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple vaccine types. There is the live attenuated virus, which contains live but weakened viruses. Immunosuppressed people should not get these. There's also the recombinant vaccines, where they basically make a bunch of virus antigens in the lab. These were never whole viruses to begin with and do not contain viral DNA/RNA. There's also inactivated vaccines, which is where the viruses are all killed and these are safe to use in immunosuppressed people. There are some vaccines based on the toxins the bacteria produce.</p>

<p>TLDR if you are immunosuppressed don't get the live virus vaccines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Possible, but only for a certain class of live vaccines. </p>
<p>In the US that pretty much means MMR, Rotavirus, and chickenpox which are all given quite early. In the event that the child has a depressed immune system the vaccines are either postponed or skipped entirely, which is why it's not a laughing matter when people don't vaccinate their healthy kids, because full strength measles out in the wild will put the sickly kid in the hospital.</p>
<p>For other vaccines, either a dead virus is used, or in the case of most modern vaccines they used cultured viral proteins with no viral genes included. </p>
<p>The new mRNA vaccine platform as an example is essentially a string of code that gets some of your cells to produce key protein fragments required for Covid to bind to and enter cells. Those fragments register as foreign generating an immune response. Thus, when you get exposed to Covid you should have neutralizing antibodies targeting that one particular spot on the Coronavirus preventing the infection of your cells.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
