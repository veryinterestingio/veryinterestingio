		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the moisture content of the air in that layer.  If there is a lot of moisture, a contrail will form, that is basically an artificially created cloud.  That cloud can then be dispersed by upper level winds, so the length of time it remains varies.  When you see a jet overhead at high altitude and the contrail disappears almost as fast as it forms, that means that it is pretty dry in that layer of air, and there isn't enough moisture to form a strong enough cloud to maintain itself, though the disturbance in the air can condense it for a short time.  It is not the exhaust of the engines that forms the contrail, it is the disturbance of the air causing moisture to condense.  That is why propeller-driven aircraft can form a contrail at high altitude as well, and a contrail can form from the wingtip vortex created by the wing moving through the air in addition to the disturbance from the engines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>they are called contrails - meaning &quot;condensation trails&quot;.   </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrail" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrail</a></p>
<p>They are tiny water/ice droplets from the vapor in the engine exhaust and the ambient air - depending on the temperature and humidity they could freeze into ice crystals or re-evaporate.     The really short-lived ones you often see trailing off the wing of a plane and disappearing rapidly are condensing water from the air in the low pressure vortices coming off a wing - as soon as that pressure normalizes they go away (like, in seconds).    The high altitude ones that last are icy and can hang around until they just diffuse widely enough that you can't make them out.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
