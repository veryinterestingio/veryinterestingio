		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Secondary question: Do we intrinsically know if a smell is ours (IE safe) with scent alone or is it because of association (Like I know I just farted so that smell must be from me)</p>
<p>If my girlfriend gaslighted me into believing her fart was actually mine, would I stop being repulsed by it?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you can't really catch diseases from yourself, and an aversion to bad smells came about evolutionarily to protect you from going near things that can harm you. These are mostly pathogens from byproducts of other people, other animals, their festering wounds/open sores, corpses, rotting food etc</p>
<p>and because you're used to your own stench for the most part, so all you really smell is the differences/changes as like a self-assessment of your own diet/health/hygiene compared to how it usually is. If it all just smelled awful, you wouldn't know if you had to do something about it. If it smells worse than usual, you do</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because out brain associates the smell from others as sickness and thus it is avoidable, when it comes from ourselves the brain knows what we smell like so it is a &quot;smells like home&quot; sort of effect thus making bareable</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're used to your own stink. Sort of how if you hear your voice played back it sounds differently than how you hear it. Your perception is not equal to others perception of you. This is why it's good to get feedback from others.</p>
<p>Or just get married and your wife will give you plenty of feedback when you're full of shit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
