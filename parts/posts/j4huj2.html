		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My assumption here is that you are referring to a dishwasher appliance. The dishwasher uses a heat dry cycle, but the plastic that the tuperware is made out of does not retain that heat as long (less mass) as ceramic dishes or metal pots and pans so the water that is on it does not evaporate as quickly. There may also be more factors involved, such as there is more water that sticks to the plastic after rinsing compared to metal or ceramic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>After a dishwasher cycle, the plates and glasses are usually dry, whereas plastic boxes and cups remain wet. The difference is due to the different materials’ ability to absorb heat, also known as heat capacity.</p>
<p>Porcelain, glasses and cutlery have a much higher heat capacity than does plastic, while glasses, porcelain, and cutlery generally also consist of thicker materials than plastic, and can hence contain much more heat.</p>
<p>Plastic is also a relatively poor heat conductor and so the thermal energy is not passed effectively to the surface. Porcelain, stainless steel and glass are good at conducting heat, so they can make the last water evaporate from the surface.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like these answers are incomplete. I would expect the tendency for water to bead on plastics (it is a petroleum product) has a greater impact than how hot the item itself is.  If the water can never run off, it will always be wet.</p>
<p>This would explain why dryer addictives make things &quot;dry&quot; better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
