		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Was keeping an eye on earphones that were listed at 49.99. They went on sale for 33.99 (deal price) and then amazon changed the normal price to 59.99 to make the discount seem better by saying &quot;you save 26.00&quot;. How can they do blatant misleading marketing?</p>
<p>Edit: I realise I wrote Recommended retail price price</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The $49.99 price may have been their normal selling price, not the price recommended for sale by the manufacturer (which retailers rarely use, since they have to compete for business). The price now listed may be that recommended retail price (MSRP in the US). A screenshot of the problem would have helped to address the issue better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Amazon is terrible with this!  Last year before Christmas I was waiting for the $60 Nintendo switch controllers to go on sale for my son. Finally they put them on &quot;sale&quot;, at $60, a discount of $20 off the &quot;normal&quot; $80. No time in-between at the &quot;new&quot; price.  Total scam.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've seen guitar center and musician's friend do this.  Both companies are owned by the same group and some of their products are special versions made for them and thus have a unique sku number. The day before one site puts an item on sale the other will raise the price. And as the sku is unique to their two websites if you try to do a price comparison by searching the sku online you will always see the sister website as your top result giving you a false sense of the items value. They advertise these items in limited time sales creating a sense of urgency in hopes that most customers won't have time to do more in depth research into the product. </p>
