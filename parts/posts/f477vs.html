		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most birds around here have very slim legs without any real protection from wind and snow. It's also pretty cold in winter (-10 -20C). I understand that they probably don't have alot of muscle tissue in the legs, mostly bone, tendons and skin right? But those still require bloodflow and need to stay reasonably warm. Intuitively their legs would freeze almost instantly. How do they manage with such a large surface area and in relation to the volume of their legs?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Penguins have their leg's veins routed as close to the surface of their legs as their anatomy allows to help protect them from the cold, they're aquatic though so they're an extreme example but I believe it is just an exaggerated form of the same system that all birds use to protect themselves, as long as they have warm blood to supply them protected by their amazing quality of insulation for their core body, they have a low chance of losing tissue to frostbite like unprotected mammals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are indeed cold. Duck feet are cold as heck (as low as 1C). Their venes (cold blood going from the feet to their heart + low oxygen) and their arteries (warm blood coming from the heart + high oxygen) are really really closely together. This way the warm blood in the arteries „warms“ up (through heat transfer) the cold blood in the venes on their way back to the heart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They actually can freeze. It is a well known phenomenon that if people in seriously cold areas find a hurt bird and let it &quot;warm up&quot; in their tent or house and then release it again those birds can get frostbitten legs and toes just like humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding to the weaving of the veins and arteries (which I didn't know! So cool!), their heart rates are much faster than ours, which moves their blood more quickly through the legs, giving it less time to lose heat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
