		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I once read that it was because when your stomach is empty, the alcohol proceeds straight to the intestines to be absorbed into your blood stream.  But if there was solid food in your stomach, you stomach's sphincter would be closed, forcing the alcohol to wait there before being absorbed.  This spreads out the absorption time, reducing the intoxicating effects, like others said, but also gives time for some of alcohol to be broken down by enzymes in the stomach and be rendered non-intoxicating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So basically with drugs the quicker something enters the blood stream the bigger the high. I had a professor explain it to me like imagine getting to 100 mph it feels way more exciting going from 0-100 in 6 seconds than slowly going through the gears.</p>
<p>Like others have said the food slows the process of ingestion of the alcohol so you don't a big hit of it at once. You will still eventually get all the alcohol just in a more measured manner so you don't feel the big rush of getting loads dumped into your blood stream</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It slows down the intake of alcohol in your small intestine, because alcohol is “watered down” by food, so its effects are lessened and prolonged in time. Otherwise, if you take a shot on an empty stomach, it gets sucked in almost immediately, and all at once, assuring you get a hard hit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol absorbs into your body all through your GI tract. Your intestines absorb it the quickest, while the stomach absorbs at a much slower rate. When you eat before, your intestines are more full so the alcohol spends more time in your stomach, slowly being absorbed into your body. When you drink on an empty stomach, the alcohol makes its way to the intestines where it's absorbed much quicker.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nope. First you need to know alcohol is absorbed in the large intestine rather than the stomach. When you're belly is full it takes longer for the alcohol to get where it needs go go and there's more stuff to deal with for your body.</p>
<p>Jn other words your tolerance is the same, stay up long enough and all the extra booze you drank will keep you entertained. :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
