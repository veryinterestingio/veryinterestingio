		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This... Is pretty complicated. Gasoline engines and diesel engines, while similar in design, actually work quite differently. A diesel engine has no spark plugs and fires off of compression. Because of this, diesel engines can be very hard to start in cold environments if they do not have adequate glow plugs (device to heat up the cylinder area) for the temperature. So one reason, is cold starting. There are alot more, but another major one is torque. Diesel engines have much more low-end torque than gasoline engines, which makes diesel the go-to option for any application that involves lots of torque, such as hauling a heavy load.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the US at least:</p>
<p>Emissions regulations are more stringent, or at least focus more on specific pollutants that are an issue for Diesel engines. This has led to a few high profile scandals where companies rigged their engines to put out fake performance while being tested for emissions. The engine modifications to make engines compliant with US, and Canadian IIRC, laws reduce some of the other advantages (fuel efficiency) and add an up front cost premium.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Diesel is usual cheaper to run because it burns less fuel to get you from point A to point B than petrol. That's its main advantage. It's main disadvantage is that the engine is inefficient if used for short drives, and may break down faster if you don't take it for longer drives at higher speeds often enough. That's the gist of it, explained like you're five.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
