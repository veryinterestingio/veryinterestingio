<p>For example if I have a virus particle on my hand and touch a rail presumably they &quot;die&quot; after a certain period, but what other than physical destruction governs this? </p>
<p>Doing Biomed at uni but we don't cover viruses much (all the micro is mostly bacteria / fungi as obviously a bit more benign than playing with viruses).</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The integrity of their genetic code, in short, the viability of their capacity to infect healthy cells and reproduce using that cellular machinery. Often the way that viruses will be inactivated (that's the word you're looking for, not &quot;killed&quot;) in the wild involves exposure to UV light from the Sun, predatory microorganisms, physical trauma, dehydration, and exposure to volatile compounds in the environment. Some viruses have the capacity to remain active far longer than others outside of a host because they have protective layers, others are inactivated shortly after being shed or expelled from a host.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For a virus to replicate, it has a DNA/RNA core. DNA/RNA is very delicate and will easily be destroyed (by heat, UV, pressure, everything) if not protected in a a safe capsule. It must also be intact and transferred to another cell (like a human cell or bacteria) in order to replicate. Surrounding the core of every virus is a protective layer called a capsid (some viruses also have an additional layer called an envelope). If this capsid (and envelope) were to be damaged, the DNA/RNA could be released and be damaged as well, leaving a &quot;dead&quot; virus behind.</p>
<p>Side note: this is how many viral vaccines (known as killed or inactivated) work. By removing the DNA/RNA and keeping the outer layers intact, the virus is not able to replicate but the proteins on the surface of the capsid/envelope (which are specific to the virus) induce an immune response.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have formal training in biology and virology, I know a lot of biologists, and I've talked about this with most of them: Viruses aren't necessarily &quot;not alive&quot;. They evolve, they reproduce, and they have a life cycle. They're obligate predators and parasites. They're part of an ecosystem. They compete with each other and with their prey. Ask me, that counts as alive. A cell biologist might disagree...but there's such a thing as a scientifically-sound opinion. Whether it's alive or not isn't science, it's philosophy. </p>
<p>As for your question, that depends. There's a sheath of proteins around them that acts as a kind of cell membrane analog--called the capsid. That thing is made up of lots and lots of proteins. It's a shell that kind of acts like the capsule of a syringe, holding the contents before injection.</p>
<p>If that breaks, essential components will likely be lost because the virus doesn't have a lot of replacements for most of its payload for delivery. Their entire survival strategy is to pack light and make a <em>lot</em> of offspring, with very few exceptions. Further, exposure to DNA-degrading substances and conditions can make the virus unable to function even if its payload gets injected into a cell, and this is more likely with RNA-based viruses because RNA is inherently more unstable than DNA.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most viruses are made up of just DNA/RNA and protein. You can think of this as genetic material in a protein shell. Over time, either the shell breaks down due to outside influences or the genetic material itself breaks down over time due to instability. After this kind of breakdown, the virus is no longer able to infect a cell and is essentially “dead.”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Veterinary student here.  The main component (at least from a medical standpoint) behind virus resistance to destruction is presence or lack of an envelope.  This is basically fat (lipid) that can be easily destroyed by a variety of common disinfectants (which break down that envelope), stomach acid, etc.  It surrounds the important parts of a virus. It is important for medically relevant viruses to know if they are enveloped or not.  Take a look at parvovirus for example, which causes bloody diarrhea, heart disease, and nervous system problems in dogs and cats.  This is a non enveloped virus so is resistant to a huge amount of disinfectants and can stay in the environment for months since it isn't destroyed by many things.  On the other hand, viruses in the orthomyxoviridae family (flu viruses) are enveloped, which is why washing your hands with soap destroys that virus so easily.  The soap binds to the envelope and exposes the virus' insides to the world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
