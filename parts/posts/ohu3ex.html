		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With respect to sounds, this is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misophonia#Classification" target="_blank">misophonia</a>. </p>
<p>There's a small but growing body of research to suggest it's a psychiatric disorder. <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/misophonia-sounds-really-make-crazy-2017042111534" target="_blank">This piece</a> describes two physical findings in the brain: </p>
<p>&quot;The team’s important finding was in a part of the brain that plays a role both in anger and in integrating outside inputs (such as sounds) with inputs from organs such as the heart and lungs: the anterior insular cortex (AIC). Using fMRI scans to measure brain activity, the researchers found that the AIC caused much more activity in other parts of the brain during the trigger sounds for those with misophonia than for the control group. Specifically, the parts of the brain responsible for long-term memories, fear, and other emotions were activated ...,</p>
<p>&quot;The researchers also used whole-brain MRI scans to map participants’ brains and found that people with misophonia have higher amounts of myelination. Myelin is a fatty substance that wraps around nerve cells in the brain to provide electrical insulation, like the insulation on a wire. It’s not known if the extra myelin is a cause or an effect of misophonia and its triggering of other brain areas.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Then again I'm the type that has my headphones in even when I'm not listening to anything so maybe I'm the exception here lmao</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can barely handle touching certain towels or paper products such as toilet paper, paper towels, napkins, etc. it physically hurts my teeth and makes the muscles in my shoulders, neck and face to twinge. Not sure why this could even possibly happen. I despise it everytime it does though. Same thing happens with very specific sounds. Silverware on plates and certain <em>clanking</em> sounds of various metals hitting each other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There have been a few studies on this but the most common conclusion seems to be: frequency.</p>
<p>The frequency of some of the most hated noises (nails on a chalkboard, styrofoam rubbing together, forks/knives screeching across a plate) are all pretty close to the frequency of infants crying. </p>
<p>We’re programmed to feel the need to “do something” when we hear an infant in trouble. That skin crawling feeling is our limbic system telling us “hey, go help!” Only with these noises, there’s nothing to do but wait it out, so it takes a while for the feeling to pass. </p>
<p>Bonus: for people who have issues with these types of noises, getting up and moving around a bit can help the skin crawling feeling pass sooner.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
