		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the fungi u/drkirienko mentions, tardigrades also clearly act as hosts for various bacteria.  However, it's more difficult to say which of these are beneficial, neutral, or antagonistic to their hosts.</p>
<p>This is a little tangentially related to your question, but it's an interesting story nonetheless.  When the first tardigrade genome (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypsibius_dujardini" target="_blank"><em>Hypsibius dujardini</em></a>), was sequenced by <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/112/52/15976" target="_blank">Boothby et al. 2015</a>, it was reported to have a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/112/52/15976/F1.large.jpg?width=800&amp;height=600&amp;carousel=1" target="_blank">large percentage of genes with bacterial origin</a>.  This was initially considered to be evidence for horizontal gene transfer on a pretty unprecedented scale, which was pretty interesting but also led to some <a href="https://v1.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/165220-Scientists-Have-Sequenced-the-Genome-of-the-Tardigrade-Finding-it-Contains-More-Alien-DNA-than-Any-Other-Animal" target="_blank">rather garbage science reporting</a>.  </p>
<p>However, as you will have noticed if you looked at the Boothby paper carefully, these results have since been challenged by many.  <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/113/22/E3057" target="_blank">Arakawa 2016</a> and <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/113/22/E3054" target="_blank">Bemm et al. 2016</a> both suggest that the bacterial DNA actually came from, well... bacteria.  I.e., they think that the tardigrade samples were contaminated, which does seem like a more plausible explanation.  Bemm et al. were even able to assemble the entire <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/113/22/E3054/F2.large.jpg?width=800&amp;height=600&amp;carousel=1" target="_blank">genome of an unknown type of bacteria</a> from the published tardigrade data.</p>
<p>Of course, those bacterial contaminants were not necessarily actually living in the tardigrades, and may have been introduced some other way.  Fortunately, some other studies have looked in more detail into actual associations between tardigrades and various microorganisms.  <a href="https://academic.oup.com/zoolinnean/article/178/4/846/2691467" target="_blank">Vecchi et al. 2016</a> review reports of bacteria living in the heads, skin, and guts of tardigrades, and also point out that they can act as vectors for certain bacteria which infect plants such as <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Xanthomonas_leaf_spot.png" target="_blank"><em>Xanthomonas campestris</em></a>.  The same group published a more detailed study in <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00248-017-1134-4" target="_blank">Vecchi et al. 2018</a> which identified several distinct groups of bacteria.  Neither of these studies were really able to say much about the exact nature of the relationship between these bacteria and the tardigrades they live in though, so it's still somewhat unclear whether they are symbiotes, pathogens, or neither.  And of course, these roles may fluctuate depending on the conditions even for the same bacterial species!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Surprisingly, a web search turned up the following article,  <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3758693?seq=1" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3758693?seq=1" target="_blank">https://www.jstor.org/stable/3758693?seq=1</a></a> , which reports a tardigrade that was infected with a fungal pathogen. The most surprising part is that the paper is over 40 years old. I didn't even realize people studied tardigrades back then.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just a reminder (or introduction) about the stasis-like ability that tardigrades possess: it does not make them invincible, and they are not normally extremophiles. They have to enter stasis and dry out in order for it to be effective, and they are normally quite weak beings.</p>

(Citations are provided to both nematodes and tardigrades near the bottom of this discussion)</p>
<p>This seems relevant considering that you appear to be suggesting that tardigrades would have some special reaction other animals would not to a viral infection, and their stasis is the only thing I could see being relevant to a layman in that regard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tardigrades are animals, they are multi cellular eukaryotes.
They are susceptible to viral, and fungal infections as well as bacterial attacks, like the rest of us. While they can &quot;survive&quot; extreme conditions, they are not imortal and can die quite easily if they're exposed wrong.  They are, like most microorganisms, bound to water. Outside of water, and in other environmental extremes, they go into a dormant hybernation like state of rest where they slow their metabolism and harden themselves. That is the state where they survive extreme pressures, radiation, heat/cold, etc, etc. A live, awake Tardigrade does not enjoy those conditions and goes dormant untill the conditions improve. They can die from infections/disease as you suggest, but also predation, being squished physically (on a slide), lack of food, or any other general causes of death that aren't environmental.   Unfortunately their not immortal in the slightest. Bacteria can be extremeophiles, hydras and polyp jellies are actually &quot;immortal&quot;, but when it comes to animals tardigrades are some of the most <em>resilient</em>, especially when in cryptobiosis.</p>
<p>It's worth noting some bacteria and single celled eukaryotes are similar in size to tardigrades, so rather then a bacterial infection, its more like predation in some cases. Viruses infect an organism cell by cell to modify its dna and reproduce, so they work on this scale to even more effect than on macro-animals. Tardigrades are susceptible to other microorganisms, to answer the question</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well yeah. Tardigrades are susceptible to everything that other organisms are outside of their stasis which is only activated when their bodies have been desiccated. Otherwise tardigrades are just tiny bug things that eat algae juice and get eaten by slugs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
