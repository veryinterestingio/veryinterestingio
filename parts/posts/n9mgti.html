<li>The things your body wants are determined by evolution.</li>
<li>Evolution is very very slow.</li>
<li>Result: Everything about your body and mind are honed by millions of years of evolution....to be <del>perfect</del> well suited for the conditions that existed like 50,000+ years ago.</li>
</ol>
<p>There's the problem. Up until very VERY recently evolution-wise, food was always scarce, or at least <em>unpredictable</em>. Even more rare was high calorie food like fats and sugars. Therefore having the trait &quot;<em>if you engounter high-cal food, eat as much as physically possible</em>&quot; was overall a very good, advantageous trait to have. Individuals with this trait would have been more likely to survive a drought, a famine, the winter cold, getting sick, being wounded, etc, many of the various things that were killing humans. It only becomes problematic if you encounter so much food (and spend so little energy day-to-day) that you become obese. But for our hunter-gatherer ancestors, there just wasn't enough high-cal food for this to be a problem. So humans ended up with this trait, because it was over all good for us. We even got a brain program that gives us a dopamine hit when we eat fats and sugars!</p>
<p>Fast forward to the last \~200 years (or even 100 years really) and now fatty sugary foods are everywhere, available very easily all the time for cheap, often cheaper than healthier foods. This is not at all the environment our food-behaviours were designed for. The cravings that kept our ancestors alive for literally millenia are now NOT self serving. We absolutely <em>could</em> run off fat reserves, but evolution simply hasn't had enough time to re-write the program we're all running that says &quot;see fat = eat!&quot;.</p>
<p>At least not yet! If humanity survives long enough, we may see our junk-food cravings get weaker in the next 100,000 years since there isn't as much evolutionary pressure favouring it any more. In fact with heart disease etc from obesity, there may even be some pressure against gorging</p>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> We evolved to crave calories because food was unpredictable. Now food is cheap and easy so it's backfiring. 100 years of supermarket junkfood is NOTHING vs how long we'd been adapting, and evolution is SLOW.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The fireman gets a load of coal (food) and either shovels it into the engine (your body's metabolism) or shovels it into the tender (your fat reserves).</p>
<p>Hunger is the fireman saying &quot;hey, just so you know I'm not getting any coal right now... could be an issue.&quot; He doesn't care that the tender has plenty, just that no more new stuff is coming in.”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quite a few good answers here, because really it’s down to a multitude of reasons. I haven’t seen anything about the hormonal side of things so I thought I’d add that... </p>
<p>Your body runs on a series of feedback loops. In the example of thirst, your body has cells that recognise its low on water, and in response will release hormones that make you feel thirsty, and decrease the secretion of water in your urine to keep us much fluid as possible in the body. Once those same cells detect there is enough water, it will decrease the secretion of the “thirsty” hormones. The low levels of “thirsty” hormones circulating triggers a “hydrated” hormone to be released, which will trigger normal kidney function and allow you to urinate fluid out as normal again. This is a constant process and keeps us hydrated. </p>
<p>There is a similar loop in hunger and fullness, and the sensation of hunger comes on because of an “I’m hungry” hormone that has been released to tell us we need food, and then when we’re full an “I’m full” hormone will be released which will tell the body to decrease the level of the “I’m hungry” hormone. Unfortunately if there is a history of over-eating this feedback loop is redundant because you have essentially over-ridden it. If you keep eating past the point of feeling full, and your body keeps releasing the “I’m full” hormones and you don’t respond to them by stopping eating, eventually your body learns to ignore the “I’m full” hormones and so you’ll never feel full. This is known as resistance to that hormone, as your body no longer recognises it. Because your body is no longer recognising the “I’m full” hormones, the feedback loop doesn’t work properly, and the “I’m hungry” hormones are released constantly, giving that constant sensation of hunger. This is why (especially obese) people feel like they eat a lot of food and never feel full afterwards - because their body’s never tell them that they are full, and just that they’re hungry all the time. It’s not that the body can’t run off it’s own fat reserves, it’s just broken the mechanism that tells you how much to bring in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body needs more than fat to be healthy.  It also needs things like vitamins.  Without vitamins a lot of your body's functions won't run properly.  Your teeth, for instance, could fall out.</p>
<p>So will you starve to death if you're overweight and stop eating for a while?  No.</p>
<p>Will you start to suffer from health issues, some of which could be life threatening?  Sure.</p>
<p>There was a guy who didn't eat any food for about a year.  He did this under doctor supervision.  The doctor made sure that he took supplements so he'd stay as healthy as possible while he didn't eat and lived off his fat reserves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Evolution: food used to be very scarce, so you almost always ate something if you could.<br />
Mental: eating makes you feel good and lets you ignore the glaring problem of your own weight. It becomes a vicious eat-shame-eat to suppress shame-eat cycle.   </p>
<p>We think that the body is very ineffective, but in reality it is stupid effective. One kg of fat is 9000 calories. You would have to spend 12-15 hours of vigorous cardio to burn that off (<a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/diet-and-weight-loss/calories-burned-in-30-minutes-of-leisure-and-routine-activities" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/diet-and-weight-loss/calories-burned-in-30-minutes-of-leisure-and-routine-activities" target="_blank">https://www.health.harvard.edu/diet-and-weight-loss/calories-burned-in-30-minutes-of-leisure-and-routine-activities</a></a>)   </p>
<p>As for whether the body can run off its own reserves, it is complicated (I would like to say, yes it can, but in reality it converts the fat into a smorgasbord of different things). If you supplement all the vitamins and electrolytes you can easily survive by not eating anything at all. But you do need water, because lipolysis (fat breakdown) requires water.  </p>
<p>When I say the body is able to survive just on its own fat I really mean that the body can basically synthesize all it needs from triglycerides alone (granted you have adequate micronutrients either stored or you supplement them). Body has three main ways to produce energy: glycogenesis (energy from sugar), glyconeogenesis (energy from protein) and ketogenesis (energy from fat).  </p>
<p>Some organs do need glucose to function and other can just get by with ketones which are produced from fat. If the body breaks down triglycerides (certain type of fat), it also gets a small part \~10% of sugar from it in the form of glycerol, which can then be used to fuel those organs that need sugar to function. The remaining products can also be used to synthesize certain proteins. Other ways your body converts fat into sugar are the buildup of lactic acid in your muscles after workout and the way your testicles (seminal vesicles) make fructose so your swimmers can Michael Phelps their way down the Egg Avenue.  </p>
<p>TL;DR<br />
If the body has enough micronutrients stored up or if you supplement them and you have enough water, you can easily survive by not eating because your body is an amazing energy factory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
