		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The words in the brackets are words that were not part of the original quote, but are needed so that the quote makes sense to the reader without the larger context of the whole conversation.</p>
<p>Say an article quoted a guy:</p>
<p>“And then I saw him after he ran out of the place, and he proceeded to run down the street.”</p>
<p>Without any broader context, it would be difficult for the reader to understand what they were saying.</p>
<p>So an article might actually print the quote like this:</p>
<p>“And then I saw [the robber] after he ran out of the [bank], and he proceeded to run down the street.”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are quoting people. However the quotations are not printed in their original contexts and may not fit as well. So they change the quote a bit to make them easier to understand. However as to not deceive the reader they mark the text as altered. This is typical when the original quote have gestures pointing to different people or directions which can not be printed or when the quote was part of a longer statement and therefore used pronouns. It is also possible that the quote used either the full name or an indecent term for someone and the editor does not want that printed. Brackets are therefore a way for the editor to signal that he modified the quote without changing its meaning. It is also possible to use for example ellipses to mark where you have shortened a quote.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said it's something that is not technicaly part of the quote but may need mentioned to clarify.</p>
<p>Although there are some examples above, here are a few other places it may be needed.</p>
<p>If someone  said they arrived at 8:00 and the quote   &quot;John said I arrived at 8:00&quot; could be misleading as it may not be obvious to the reader if John arrived at 8:00 or if John was claiming the person that is  now speaking arrived at that time.</p>
<p>It can also be useful when typing spoken quotes as people speak differently than they write, in spoken language it is very common to intentionally leave words out and meaning is still clear, but on the typed page it just looks nuts.</p>
<p>Somewhat related you will sometimes see [sic] after a quote (or a single word.) This means the quote is exactly as it was delivered even though it may not make sense. If I mispeak or misspell something in my original message and you later quote that, someone reading might not know if I misspelled it originally or if you did whole transcribing it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
