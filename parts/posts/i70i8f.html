<p>Actually, no! Most marine mammals get all the freshwater they need from their diet; water is a common by-product from the metabolic processing of fats and carbohydrates*. The salt content of their blood and internal tissues is pretty much the same as any terrestrial mammal, and so they'd dehydrate and perish in the same way as, say, us if they were to regularly drink the saltwater they swim in.</p>
<p>Of course, plenty of it does ends up inside them incidentally as they eat anyway, but they're capable of filtering much of this excess salt out by utilising their modified kidneys to produce very concentrated, very salty urine. In which case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>how good are their kidneys?</p>

<p>Not as good as you'd think they'd be! Surprisingly, for most tasks, they're structurally not much better than those of any terrestrial mammal. The real difference comes in <em>how</em> they use them; it's changes in hormonal regulation that helps them rapidly produce concentrated salty urine. The modifications we see are likely more to do with their need to dive deep (and also their large body size, in whales) than anything to do with their salty marine environment.</p>

<p>^(* Indeed, I've heard it said dolphins are unable to distinguish between feeling hungry and thirsty as, to them, they're the 'same thing'. As such, it's said one could (cruelly)^) ^(have a dolphin drink from a hosepipe and think it just had a full meal.)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know I'm a bit too late to be seen, but marine mammals were my focus getting my zoology degree and I've dissected quite a few cetaceans and pinnipeds in my day. I figure I can help add some more detailed information. </p>
<p>The kidneys <em>are</em> somewhat structurally different than most terrestrial mammals due to the ingestion of saltwater (fun fact, the intentional ingestion of saltwater is called mariposa and is considered a very rare behavior in marine mammals). Most marine mammals have what are called &quot;reniculate kidneys,&quot; which means they are comprised of many small lobes called reniculi. You could easily distinguish a human kidney from a dolphin kidney <a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQLWYWJLZmgryG-v5-r3R4_30JRpKatxzPrTA&amp;usqp=CAU" target="_blank">at a glance.</a> Each of these reniculi function like a mini kidney, increasing their ability to filter and excrete excess salt. </p>
<p>Marine mammals also have a thicker medulla in their kidneys, which allows them to reabsorb more water with much more efficiency, further concentrating their urine to excrete more salt. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sauropsids (reptiles incluiding birds) have as a rule kidneys well suited to eliminate nitrogen byproducts (generally as uric acid), but aren't as good as salt regulators. However, they have a tendency to develop salt glands, which basically secrete brine, and thus they are able to drink salt water. Crocodile tears, the apparent tears of the sea turtle that had a straw stuck up its nose in that viral video.</p>
<p>Mammal kidneys aren't generally as efficient eliminating nitrogen (due to using urea), but they are DAMN solid at salt control, due to Henle's loop. Still, marine mammals function as if they were in a very arid environment: they get fresh water out of their prey, and have similar adaptions to water managements as camels do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
