<p>For instance, if there were another outbreak of swine flu, could we infect a bunch of pigs then make an antibody serum from blood extracted from them?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not only would antibodies against the same protein be different if they came from different species, they would probably also be different if they come from two identical twins. </p>
<p>The amount of variation possible in antibody sequences is literally astronomical, <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/decoding-variety-human-antibodies" target="_blank">up to a quintillion different possible antibodies</a>. The body can’t possibly hold all those possibilities, so a relatively tiny subset (maybe billions) of those are actually produced. The ones that are actually produced are generated (mostly) randomly, which means the chances of you having the same antibodies as your identical twin is very low. </p>
<p>Antibodies with very different sequences can still attack the same target - there are many paths to effective binding - and actually looking at the sequences used by genetically identical mice (the equivalent of identical twins) shows that they often get to the same effective place with completely different antibodies. </p>
<p>There is some overlap with identical animals, but not much; less (but still some) with members of the same species that are not genetically identical. In some cases it’s possible to identify patterns in the antibody sequence that might help identify its target, but this is still a very new and uncertain field. </p>
<p>Antibodies from different species are also different in other regions of their proteins, not just the parts that interact with their targets, and that’s why you can’t easily swap antibodies between species. Your body knows what human antibodies look like and so it doesn’t make an immune response to them. It doesn’t know what horse or pig antibodies look like, and would generate an immune response to them - not necessarily (but sometimes) a problem on your first exposure, but definitely a problem if you get them twice. This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_sickness" target="_blank">serum sickness</a> and now is rarely seen except occasionally when people are treated for snakebite.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, starting from the molecular aspect, antibodies are a type of γ-globulin called immunoglobulins.</p>
<p>Their structure, at least in humans, is that of a heavy chain coupled to a light chain. There are at least two of these pairs, but there can be up to 10.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is a variable portion and a constant portion.
The variable portion, which binds antigens, is randomly generated, and is therefore different between antibodies; however, the variable portion of antibodies binding the same antigen is most probably very similar if not identical.
The constant portion determines other properties of the antibody, such as attachment to other proteins or the degree of diffusion; the constant portion is different between antibodies created by the same organism/cell, so I would say that it will definitely be different between different species.</p>
<p>So, if we could examine a particular antibody, we could most probably determine its antigen, but it would be very hard to determine the organism of origin</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They would be very different for the reasons that other people have said. If I were to design an ELISA to detect if a pig had antibodies that are specific to a certain pathogen, I would coat a plate with a particular antigen from the pathogen or the whole pathogen itself and detect with anti-swine detection antibodies. The coated antigen grabs pathogen-specific antibodies and the species-specific detection antibody binds to the antibody of interest and is labeled with something to give a signal  (usually fluorescence or a change in color).  Using anti-human detection antibodies, for example, wouldn't work. It's possible to remove specificity of the detection molecule for a particular species by using something like Streptavidin which binds to a region that's common in all antibodies regardless of species but this approach generally isn't as commonly used unless non-specificity for a species is needed.</p>
<p>TL;DR The antibodies would be very different and the assays to detect them would be designed differently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well they would be different in both the variable region, and the constant region because they are different species. The variable region, the part that actually binds antigens, is randomly generated, and therefore is likely different between individuals, let alone species.</p>
<p>Immunotherapy with sera from different species, isn't the most advisable because our immune system would react to the antibodies. Resulting in anything from neutralizing them, to inducing an allergy in the patient.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
