		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some will say that the water soaks into the soil and makes it hard for them to breathe, but the more likely reason is that earthworms don't usually move about on the surface because it's so dry that THAT makes it hard for them to breathe.</p>
<p>Worms breathe through their skin and need that skin to be moist. It's easier to move around on the surface than underground, but usually the surface is too dry, so when it rains they can take that opportunity to move around easier and not dry out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

(they generate vibrations that the worms can feel). This lures them up so the gull can get at them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Basically~~ the ground and their tunnels fill with too much water~~ because they can since it’s the only time it’s really “safe” and they can get to one place to another quickly. If you’re fishing, you can stab a stick into the ground and wack it with the other stick to make it simulate rain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
