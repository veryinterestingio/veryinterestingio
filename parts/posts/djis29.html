		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I understand all plans are different and other plans may cover a vasectomy at 100%, but mine does not.  </p>
<p>I called my insurance company to find out what's covered for each thinking they'd probably be about the same.  Nope!  The more invasive and riskier procedure is fully covered, while a &quot;little snip&quot; comes out of pocket first before they start to pay. </p>
<p>Not looking for any political diatribes, just wondering if anyone can explain why what seems to me (and I could be wrong about it) like a simpler, safer procedure wouldn't be covered like the tubal ligation.</p>
<p>EDIT: Just adding that this is in the U.S. since I know people from other countries may wonder why someone is asking this.</p></div></div>

<p>If the ACA didn't mandate it, it wouldn't be paid 100%. Trump added a religious exception, but <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/womens-guidelines/index.html#2" target="_blank">normally all FDA approved contraceptive methods must be covered. Including voluntary sterilization.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The rationale is fairly straightforward.  If a women gets pregnant, that is a health issue for the woman - the insured person is the person's whose health is protected.  When you get a vasectomy as the insured person, your health is not protected.  It's 100% risk (procedure) and no prevention (for the insured party).  </p>
<p>The insurance company incurs no obligation for health costs of the person <em>you make</em> pregnant, just of the insured themselves.</p>
<p>Edit:  Yes, I typo'd women instead of woman. SORRY! And...no, you haven't educated me on what is proper. Holy crap people love to pounce.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ACA requires that tubal ligations be 100% covered, as it is preventative care in the form of permanent birth control. I don't believe that vasectomies need to be covered under the ACA. Your insurance is likely doing the bare minimum requirements in order to meet ACA standards.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's quite simple really.</p>
<p>You can't get pregnant.</p>
<p>Just because you get clipped doesn't mean that she can't.</p>
<p>If the insurance company's goal is to reduce claims by reducing the number of pregnancies, they'll do a much better job of that by paying for women to get their tubes tied than they will by paying for men to get clipped.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
