<p>Here's a link to <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiab147/6179975" target="_blank">&quot;Human rhinovirus infection blocks SARS-CoV-2 replication within the respiratory epithelium: implications for COVID-19 epidemiology&quot;</a>.  </p>
<p>A brief summary is that the HRV appears to inhibit transmission of SARS-CoV-2, possibly due to the former triggering an increased production of interferon.  </p>
<p>TL;DR: The cold will win.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The main cause of death from HIV isn't the human immunodeficiency virus itself, it's secondary infections that can run rampant thanks to the AIDS part (acquired immunodefficiency syndrome).</p>
<p>For COVID specifically, secondary infections do appear to be an issue, including viral infections. See e.g.:</p>
