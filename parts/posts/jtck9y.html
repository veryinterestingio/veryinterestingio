		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What cruise ships are emitting is sulfur dioxide.  The reason they are emitting sulfur dioxide is because they burn bunker fuel rather than gasoline or diesel.  This isn't unique to cruise ships, all large ships burn bunker fuel.</p>
<p>There are two reasons that ships burn bunker fuel:</p>
<p>1) Bunker fuel has a very high sulfur content.  When it burns its creates sulfur dioxide.  Sulfur dioxide mixes with clouds to produce rain that is <em>slightly</em> more acidic than normal rain.  Car paint, building exteriors, and roadways are fairly sensitive to the acidity of rain - rain that contains small amounts of sulfur eventually ruins all 3 of those things.  People don't like it when their car paint gets all fucked up or the roads that they're driving on get pitted.</p>
<p>To reduce the amount of sulfur dioxide in the rain, most countries ban using bunker fuel while on land.</p>
<p>There are no cars, buildings, or roadways in the middle of the ocean.  Having rain that is slightly more acidic than normal falling in the ocean has no impact on the ocean whatsoever.  </p>
<p>2) Bunker fuel is produced as a byproduct of oil refining.  If you want gasoline, plastic, fertilizer, pharmaceuticals, or basically anything else that comes from refining oil then you will end up with large amounts of bunker fuel.</p>
<p>That means that you can't just ban bunker fuel and expect that it will go away because there is literally no way to dispose of it other than burning.  So you have to burn all of that bunker fuel <em>somewhere</em>.  You have 2 choices for where to do that: at the oil refinery where you'll have all of the problems associated with acid rain, or out in the middle of the ocean somewhere where it won't have any effect at all.  </p>
<p>Fortunately we don't have to dump all of the bunker fuel into the ocean and set it on fire because we've found a use for it.  That use is powering ships, including cruise ships.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
