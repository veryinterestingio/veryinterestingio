		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) operates on the principle of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). When a charged particle* with nonzero spin is placed into a magnetic field, the magnetic dipole moment of the particle can align either with the field or against the field. This creates two different energy states, <strong>with the energy difference proportional to the magnetic field</strong>. </p>
<p>The MRI machine emits radio-frequency energy to excite the nuclei from the low-energy state to the high-energy state. Then, it listens for the energy emitted when the high-energy state decays back to the low-energy state. The characteristics of this emission can be used for imaging (this involves some complicated math I won't get into here).</p>
<p>But basically, the stronger the magnetic field, the greater the energy separation of spin states, and thus the better the signal. In addition to field strength, field uniformity is also very important for a consistent signal (edit: as u/GamblingTheory mentioned, field gradients are used to focus on particular areas for imaging. What I mean by &quot;uniformity&quot; is for the main field, disregarding the gradients.)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you put a hydrogen atom in a magnetic field, the nucleus starts wobbling like a top at a specific rate. This rate depends on a lot of things, but is pretty heavily dependent on the immediate environment of the nucleus (which is why you can use it differentiate different tissue types).</p>
<p>If you observe a large collection of these nuclei, you'll see that in general, there are 2 different populations. Some wobble in a way that's aligned with the magnetic field, and some wobble in a way that's opposed to the magnetic field. The aligned nuclei are in a lower energy state.</p>
<p>If you expose the nuclei to the right kind of radio frequency waves, some of the nuclei at the lower energy level will get excited to the higher energy level, and when they relax back down, you'll get a signal. This is what's being measured during the imaging.</p>
<p>The success of this technique depends on the difference in occupancy of these two populations. The larger the energy gap between the levels, the better signal and sensitivity you can get. </p>
<p>So how do you increase the gap? It turns that the energy difference is proportional to the magnetic field!  So if you have a larger magnetic field, you'll get a large energy gap between the 2 populations, and better imaging results (huge simplification).</p>
<p>This is what's been driving the push towards high and higher magnetic fields.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ah thank you for the clarification!</p>
<p>So since chemical shift is responsible for the frequency differences is it not the primary reason techniques such as SPAIR, mdixon and water excitation are possible which are commonly used in examinations?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
