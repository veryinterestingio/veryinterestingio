However when you pull over to rest you have to put conscious effort into falling asleep, when less then 30 seconds ago you were fighting to stay awake.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For most of us, driving is a mundane task that we can do on autopilot. As a result, your mind isn't focused and the tiredness can prevail. When stopping to take a nap, you're now focusing on something (trying to nap) and this keeps your mind active. Similarly, you may have sleep anxiety because you know you need a nap.</p>
<p>This applies to other things like falling asleep while watching TV then being wide awake once in your bed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I forget the specifics, but the main reason seems to be micro-vibrations in your ears/cranial nerves cause a relaxed-perhaps hypnotic-state.  This is seemingly why the old “take the baby for a drive” trick works so well... not because car rides are a mundane activity for babies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The road plus the stuff going past you and the constant humming of the engine can be very hypnotic, coupled with the fact that you tend to be bored often.. simmilarily train crews struggle with this also it's a very monotonous job staring at the rails watching them go past puts a guy to sleep fast we often have to get up and walk around the cab or talk to each other constantly to stop from sleeping. You wouldent think something loud like a train would do this but let me tell you that engine is the most relaxing thing ever for some reason but only when you dont want it to be</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the book mans search for meaning - author talks about logotherpy and parts of it have been proven. Specifically, when you actually want to have a certain outcome, it’s sometimes more effective to try to make the opposite happen. </p>
<p>For people with sleep anxiety and issues falling asleep, it’s easier to fall asleep if you try to stay awake while in a comfortable spot. I’m not sure the science of it but when I’m sitting in a meeting/driving/sitting at my desk at work and I’m trying my best NOT to sleep, I get so fucking tired it’s unreal. Then when I’m in my comfortable bed wanting to sleep my mind races.  Could be this opposite effect thing working it’s magic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
