<p>Field lines are just a useful way to visualize the direction that the electric field points, since we can't reasonably draw a map with an infinite number of little electric field vectors on an infinitely dense grid of points. The field line is just a 'tracer'- the path a charged particle would take if dropped into the field. Admittedly when we draw them we try to keep them evenly spaced at constant potential for symmetry and readability, but a proton doesn't have some 'number' of field lines coming away from it because field lines are just our language for describing electric fields (and not actually a part of them)!</p>
<p>The flux as the 'number of field lines' is just a useful approximation for teaching some physics and helping people solve homework problems about Gauss's law. Ultimately what we care about is the integrated field at the Gaussian surface (ie the flux), and 'counting field lines coming out of this sphere' is a good enough representation of this for students who haven't had calculus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
