		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don’t just fry the ice cream. The ice cream is covered in a layer of crunchy bits like oats and crushed corn flakes and such. You start by making ice cream balls, covering them in the crunchies and freezing them to very firm. Then you dip them QUICKLY in the hot oil, which browns the crunchy layer but doesn’t have time to melt the ice cream. Then you add toppings (whipped cream, fruit, chocolate syrup, maraschino cherries, etc) and there you have it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It does, but the oil solidifies and incases it so quickly that it only half melts and you end up with a great treat with a cruchy outside, melted inside, and heart disease on the side.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know the secret. The ice cream is kept in a special freezer in a deep freeze. The outside is funnel cake dough that cooks quickly. It's only in the frier for a minute tops and the ice cream doesn't melt but becomes the regular temp for ice cream.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ice cream doesn't stay in the oil long enough to completely melt.  Only the outer layer (usually covered with a batter or some other coating) has time to reach high temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>2 or 3 layers of egg/bread crumbs/cinnamon/sugar and frozen between layers. Then frozen solid, dipped in hot oil. Gets crispy and stays fairly in tact  and gets soft after it's taken out of the oil.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
