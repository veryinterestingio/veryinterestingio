You might send your own tax collectors there, but you might also send the ones who previously did, just that they now collect taxes for you. A conqueror might also mint new coins, which would probably be noticed by the population. Coins were in fact one the most important means of propaganda in the ancient world. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ancient communication was generally done by messengers, either on horse or on foot. Certain empires (like the Persians) were noted for having well organised systems of messengers to transmit news from one end of the land to the other. Rulers would transmit messages to their subject nobles who may or may not transmit it further down the chain to the merchants and peasantry etc.</p>
<p>News also spread through informal messengers, basically anyone who was traveling from one place to another could be asked for news. My vague understanding is that part of the concept of ancient hospitality was that in exchange for shelter you would provide the latest news from wherever you'd come from.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, if you're a rural farmer living in a tiny village (and statistically for most of history, you probably are), you'd usually find out the next time you tried to sell your surplus crops and crafts at market in the nearest population center and found it either besieged or under new management. If you lived in said population center, you usually find out when a bunch of guys ride through town destroying your stuff and murdering/pillaging indiscriminately. This may be after starving you out for a while.</p>
<p>If we're talking about Rome, you'd find out when some guys in scale armor came through your village building a road and maybe some baths/a temple/literally just some columns. There's also about a 50% chance they'll enslave you and/or start taxing the hell out of you.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An empire usually expanded through conquests or marriage.  If there is a set of battles leading to the expansion you would understand this from the foreign army attacking your village and taking it over.  And if the ruler married a neighbouring princess you would have also known that as there would have usually been celebrations.  So even if you were in an ancient kingdom and werenâ€™t able to understand a word from the local language and your ruler changed, believe me, you would have noticed the noise that surrounded the change</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
