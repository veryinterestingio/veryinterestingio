		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We had the first nice day out that was above 50F in Canada and there were already flies buzzing about. I didn't think they could survive the deep freeze of the winter and didn't think there was time for them to grow from eggs or maggots this early in the season. Did they just hide out all winter or do they freeze and thaw like amphibians and reptiles do in the colder climates?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Insects have many strategies for surviving the winter period. As insects are ectotherms, this often is depent on using the external environment to their advantage (i.e. finding a warm or insulated spot). Many enter a phase of either diapause or hibernation, and remain in little crevices or other shelter somewhere until the cold weather is gone.</p>
<p>Flies specifically are one of the more 'cold tolerant' species of insects, meaning they have physiological traits that mean they are able to deal with cold temperatures and less reliant on &quot;escaping&quot; the cold conditions. 'Cold tolerant' insects can produce certain proteins which reduce the possibility of ice crystals forming within their bodies. Another mechanism is the ability to produce high levels of glycerol which is a sort of antifreeze. I assume that in a &quot;deep freeze&quot; situation, a cold tolerant species such as flies will have to take advantage of both their physiological traits, as well as the simple act of finding insulated or warmer spots to take shelter in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few ways. As some have mentioned, sometimes they take shelter in tree bark. They also have adapted (evolution) their eggs to survive the winter and hatch in the spring. And we can't forget the good ol method of survival that is breed like crazy. One concern with the more mild winters the we in the Midwest have received lately is that it is not getting cold enough to kill of portions of these eggs. The more that survive, the worse it gets. There just isn't enough predatory creatures to bear the burden that winter is supposed to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some flies bury deep/lay eggs in decomposing matter. Decomposition creates heat, and that decomposition will occur as long as the material isn't completely frozen through.</p>
<p>A big pile of organic material may still have warmth in the center, even if covered in a layer of ice and snow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
