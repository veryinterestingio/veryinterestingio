		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two potential reasons. One requires the wind to be cooler than the object, which we will assume is you from now on.  The second requires some moisture on the object.</p>
<p>First, the rate of heat loss is what makes you feel cold. This rate increases with wind because the wind reduces the temperature gradient between your skin and the air.  In still air, a thicker layer of warmer air stays near your skin and heat is lost more slowly. Fun fact, the hair on your body stands up a bit &quot;goosebumps&quot; to help trap that insulating layer when you are cold.</p>
<p>Second, any moisture on your skin will evaporate faster as the vapor is blown away by the wind, making you cooler . Fun fact, the reason the wind-chill is less when it is humid is because the more moisture is in the air the less quickly it will evaporate from your skin.</p>
<p>edit: as others have rightly pointed out, neither of the points above capture the increased convective heat loss wind creates.  That is, physically moving the warm air near your skin away from you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's primarily just a higher rate of convective heat transfer. Convection is caused by fluid motion against another medium, in this case the air against you. As the particles of air collide with you, they also take heat with them, assuming they are a lower temperature than you are. So, the higher the wind speed, the more collisions, and thus more heat transfer from you to the air, making it feel colder. There is also humidity and whatnot to factor in but another answer explains that better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simple short answer : you don't feel the temperature, you feel the heat coming out of you. When the wind is stronger, more heat is coming out of you =&gt; you feel colder.</p>
<p>This is where the &quot;experienced temperature&quot; comes from. It basically corresponds to the temperature of the air (with no wind) that would result in the same heat loss as the current weather (with wind).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's kinda like putting your extra hot hand on a cold metal surface. Your hand gets a bit cooler and the surface heats up a lot. So you move your hand to a different part of the surface and the situations plays out again. Your hand gets a bit colder; surface heats up. Keep doing that a lot and you'll get a constant feeling of cooling off.</p>
<p>Blowing air is doing the same thing, but instead of you moving your hand across the metal surface, the surface moves under your hand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Veritasium made a great video showing the difference between the actual temperature of something, and how warm/cold it feels. It doesnâ€™t talk about the wind but it does a good job showing that we feel as temperature is really just a rate of change, not an absolute temp.</p>
