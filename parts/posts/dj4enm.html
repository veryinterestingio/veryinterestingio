		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cigarettes contain some radioactive elements.</p>
<p>This is not unusual. Many objects around you are slightly radioactive to some degree or another. You are exposed to radioactivity from anything from concrete to bananas to even being near other people.</p>
<p>Usually the doses are so low to be not being worth worrying about and in most cases the radiation comes in a from that won't be able to penetrate your skin anyway.</p>
<p>However smoking means that you inhale the stuff and instead of being protect by your skin you ar irradiated from the inside especially your lungs where much of the stuff that you inhale ends up.</p>
<p>With cigarettes the thing many people worry about is polonium, which is in cigarettes and gets into your lungs and may end up giving you lung cancer.</p>
<p>You may wonder why there is radioactive polonium in your cigarettes, it turns out it comes with the tobacco plants which are coated with it. Why are tobacco plants coated with that stuff? Because it is the product of a chain of radioactive reactions occurring in and above the fields, the original source of that apparently comes with the fertilizer people put on tobacco fields.</p>
<p>Cigarettes would give you cancer in other ways even without it but it makes it worse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have given excellent answers, but I'd like to add one: smoking causes lung damage and inflammation that makes it more likely for particles to get caught in your lungs instead of breathed in and out normally. Smooth, healthy lungs just breathe it out. Rough, blackened, unhealthy lungs can't. So smokers are also more susceptible than non-smokers to normal radioactive particles in the air, like from the radon decay chain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A question I can answer! Health Physicist here.</p>
<p>The radiation that is absorbed from tobacco is not found in the plant but rather from the environment. When farmers use phosphate fertilizer it contains elevated levels of radioactive Polonium-210. This element cannot be feasibly separated from the fertilizer. The tobbaco plant has millions of tiny hairs that the polonium sticks to.  When someone smokes the tobbaco it gets inhaled. If chewed it gets absorbed in the gums.</p>
<p>Polonium emits radioactive alpha particles which are harmless unless they come into direct contact with organs (lungs or gums). </p>
<p>Further information can be read from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) by searching for Radiation Studies - Smoking and Radiation. </p>
<p>Hope that helps ðŸ˜Š</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically yes. Google says, smoking 40 cigarettes a day for a year will expose you to as much radiation as 250 x-rays of your lung. There is polonium in the tabacco.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Radioactive isotopes give off multiple different types of radiation.  The three main types are alpha decay, beta decay, and gamma decay.  All 3 can pose risks to your health.  But you can protect yourself from these radiation types by not letting the radioactive isotopes get &quot;on you&quot; or &quot;in you&quot;.</p>
<p>The main radioactive isotope of concern in cigarette tobacco is an isotope of polonium which undergoes alpha decay.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, alpha particles cannot enter your body easily because your skin is thick enough to stop them--so getting an alpha emitter &quot;on you&quot; isn't so bad.  You still want to get it off of you, because almost all alpha emitters also give off some amount of gamma radiation (which your skin cannot stop).  On the size scale of these radioactive particles, an alpha particle is HUGE, and your skin, a piece of paper, even a few inches of the air we breathe is all it takes to stop that relatively large particle in its tracks.  We inhale radioactive isotopes every day that give off alpha particles thanks to radioactive radon gas that is naturally found in the atmosphere (it comes from rocks that naturally contain low levels of uranium.  But these inhaled isotopes that give off alpha particles are at extremely low levels, and normally you don't have to worry about the risk that poses to you.</p>
<p>But when you smoke, you are taking a solid source of radioactive particles (the solid polonium in the cigarette tobacco), making it airborne in the smoke, and pulling it inside your body right into your lungs, where there is no protective layer to stop the alpha particle from damaging your body.</p>
<p>The health risk posed by radioactive decay is pretty much just related to an increased risk of developing cancer.  Extreme high doses of radiation will kill you much faster than you can develop cancer, but low doses can damage the DNA strands in your cells.  The damage to those DNA strands might lead to an issue where an attempt to replicate that DNA strand (for the purpose of making a new cell to replace the old one) produces a flawed and damaged DNA strand.  That new, damaged DNA strand might develop into a cell that is also damaged, and that damage might make the cell cancerous.  Our immune systems do a great job of handling these damaged cells all day and every day, but the more of them you produce: the more likely it is one survives and becomes a tumor.</p>
<p>So:  that's why smoking cigarette tobacco is a radiation dose risk higher than just, say, holding a cigarette in your hand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
