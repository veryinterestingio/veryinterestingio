		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hereâ€™s a handy chart from Randall Munroe (XKCD): <a href="https://xkcd.com/radiation/" target="_blank">https://xkcd.com/radiation/</a></p>
<p>You may notice that cell phones and other tech are not on this chart. This is because the radiation emitted by these devices is so weak, they are not capable of altering your cells (non-ionizing radiation). Bananas, on the other hand, do emit ionizing radiation (just a very, very, very small amount. You do not need to be worried about bananas). So you might explain to your parents that bananas are more dangerous than cell phones, and ask them if they know anyone who has died suspiciously after eating a couple bananas</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, it is not.</p>
<p>Phones and other devices that broadcast (tablets, laptops, you name it ...) emit electromagnetic (EM) radiation. EM radiation comes in many different forms, but it is typically characterized by its frequency (or wavelength, the two are directly connected).</p>
<p>Most mobile devices communicate with EM signals in the frequency range running from a few hundred megahertz (MHz) to a few gigahertz (GHz).</p>
<p>So what happens when we're hit with EM radiation? Well, it depends on the frequency. The frequency of the radiation determines the energy of the individual photons that make up the radiation. Higher frequency = higher energy photons. If photons have sufficiently high energy, they can damage a molecule and, by extension, a cell in your body. There's no exact frequency threshold from which point on EM radiation can cause damage in this way, but 1 petahertz (PHz, or 1,000,000 GHz) is a good rough estimate. For photons that don't have this much energy, the most they can hope to achieve is to see their energy converted into heat.</p>
<p>Converting EM radiation into a heat is the #1 activity of a very popular kitchen appliance: The microwave oven. This device emits EM radiation with a frequency of about 2.4 GHz to heat your milk and burn your noodles (while leaving parts of the meal suspiciously cold).</p>
<p>The attentive reader should now say to themselves: Wait a minute! This 2.4 GHz of the microwave oven is right there between the &quot;few hundred MHz&quot; and &quot;few GHz&quot; frequency range of our mobile devices. So are our devices mini-microwave ovens?</p>
<p>As it turns out, 2.4 GHz is also the frequency used by many wifi routers (and devices connecting to them) (which coincidentally is the reason why poorly shielded microwave ovens can cause dropped wifi connections when active). But this is where the second important variable that determines the effects of EM radiation comes into play: intensity.</p>
<p>A microwave oven operates with a power of somewhere around the 1,000 W (depending on the model), whereas a router has a broadcast power that is limited (by law, in most countries) to 0.1 W. That makes a microwave oven 10,000 more powerful than a wifi router at maximum output. And mobile devices typically broadcast at even lower intensities, to conserve battery. And while microwave ovens are designed to focus their radiation on a small volume in the interior of the oven, routers and mobile devices throw their radiation out in every direction.</p>
<p>So, not only is EM radiation emitted by our devices not energetic enough to cause direct damage, the intensity with which it is emitted is orders of magnitude lower to cause any noticeable heating.</p>
<p>But to close, I would like to discuss one more source of EM radiation. A source from which we receive radiation with frequencies ranging from 100 terahertz (THz) to 1 PHz or even slightly more. Yes, that overlaps with the range of potentially damaging radiation. And even more, the intensity of this radiation varies, but can reach up to tens of W. That's not the total emitted, but the total that directly reaches a human being. Not quite microwave oven level, but enough to make you feel much hotter when exposed to it.</p>
<p>So what is this source of EM radiation and why isn't it banned yet? The source is none other than the Sun. (And it's probably not yet banned due to the powerful agricultural lobby.) Our Sun blasts us with radiation that is far more energetic (to the point where it can be damaging) than anything our devices produce and with far greater intensity. Even indoors, behind a window, you'll receive so much more energy from the Sun (directly or indirectly when reflected by the sky or various objects) than you do from the ensemble of our mobile devices.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. Most evidence says it isn't true.</p>
<p>Radio waves are a form of electromagnetic (EM) radiation and the term &quot;radiation&quot; scares a lot of people, but EM radiation also includes the heat from the sun, visible light, radio waves, and x-rays. Some of these are more dangerous than others. In a lot of cases people in medicine and physics talk about &quot;ionizing&quot; and &quot;non-ionizing&quot; radiation. &quot;Ionizing&quot; radiation means that it can knock an election lose (making an &quot;ion&quot;) and break a chemical bond. Since our DNA is a large molecule this type of radiation can change the structure of DNA and create errors in the DNA which can cause cancer. Non-ionizing radiation can't do this. Radio waves, and visible light are all lower energy non-ionizing radiation, while ultra violet light and x-rays are ionizing radiation.</p>
<p>Now, having said that, obviously enough heat will cause burns. Microwaves are non-ionizing, but enough of them can boil water and cook meat, so it isn't enough to just say that &quot;non-ionizing&quot; means that it's safe. Now a microwave oven produces 500-1000 watts of EM radiation, while a cell phone produces at most 0.7-1 watt (some old ones could go up to 3 watts, but in practice cell phones try to send a weaker signal to conserve battery life, so even the 0.7 watt is very rare). A 1000 watt light bulb will really hurt your eyes while a 1 watt bulb isn't enough to read by, and it's a similar for cell phone -- very low power doesn't appear to be a concern.</p>
<p>Now, one other problem is that In addition to the strong chemical bonds (e.g. ionic and covalent), there are also weaker bonds (e.g. hydrogen bonds) that don't actually require ionizing radiation to break them. Now breaking a hydrogen bond in DNA doesn't change the structure, but it can unzip the DNA, and cause different genes to be expressed. Every cell in your body has the same DNA, but your liver and your skin cells read different parts of the DNA so they make different proteins, which means they look and act differently. Some non-ionizing radiation can affect this (e.g. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2633881/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2633881/</a>) and while this is the same general range as the airport body scanners, the scanners probably don't provide enough energy or for long enough to show this effect. However, some of the new 5G cell phones, and some high-speed wireless (that some phone companies are rolling out to simplify connecting new houses, not the normal WiFi), also use similar EM energies and they would involve much longer exposure times so should probably be studied better.</p>
<p>For a long time there was concern about living near high voltage power lines, since they also produce EM radiation (of the non-ionizing type). It turns out that people who live under power lines get cancer more often, but when this was analysed more carefully, the problem is that poor people tend to live under power lines and poor people tend to get cancer more often. We still don't know exactly why poor people tend to get cancer more -- it could be don't know if this is this is due to stress, food, chemicals from clothes, or less access to health care, but we're now sure that it isn't due to the power lines).</p>
<p>Nothing is absolutely, provably, safe in all cases, and it is worth continuing to examine new technologies, but as far as wee can tell there's more danger from not getting enough sleep due to staying up playing on your phone than there is from the radiation from the phone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
