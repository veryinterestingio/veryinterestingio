		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it's safer to know, than to just go really fast and have no idea how fast you are going.</p>
<p>(There was a period in US history where car speedometers could not be marked up beyond a certain speed, I think?)</p>
<p>The way car gearing works, you want to be able to use sixth gear at highway speeds for good fuel economy - so your engine is at low revs. But you can always go to maximum revs in sixth gear, which would equate to a very high speed. You can limit cars' top speed electronically, but not really mechanically.</p>
<p>Plus, you can always take your car to a private racetrack where you are legally allowed to go as fast as you want.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve heard it’s the following combination of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Accuracy - as others have stated the car generally goes that fast and the speedometer is just a measuring device not a governor/limiter. </li>
<li>this puts typical freeway speed at almost the 12 o’clock position, so faster than that ‘feels’ like speeding if you look at the speedometer.</li>
<li>sales: ppl buying a Buick lesabre are probably not super stoked; seeing the car goes up to 140 subconsciously reassured them that it’s a powerful car, whether or not that speed is actually attainable.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an instrument that measures speed. It doesn't judge, it fulfills it's purpose.</p>
<p>Edit: This comment was removed. I'm a trained instrument man, albeit I work in avionics. Speed limit or not, a speedometer's job is to measure your rate of speed, legal or not. It's just that simple.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They used to be limited to 85 in the United States, which just lead to certain people going over 85 without knowing their speed. At the end of the day, you need to know how fast the tires are turning.</p>
<p>Also some fancier speedometers don't have units paired with the numbers, and people will definitely go past 120 km/h once they set it to metric.</p>
<p>Will an economy car ever hit 180 MPH on the open road? Probably not. A sports car on a track could. Driving fast is not always illegal or &quot;highly&quot; dangerous.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
