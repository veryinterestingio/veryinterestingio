I have found a number of new genetic causes of short stature as well as two genes that lead to precocious puberty.</p>
<p>Through clinical research and pediatric partnerships/growth consortiums, we aim to solve previously undiagnosed height disorders and provide treatment for children with short stature. We are figuring out new approaches to diagnosing and treating growth disorders. One project we're working on with the NIH is using the power of electronic health records and intersecting them with genomic studies, such as whole-exome sequencing, to identify and treat high-risk patients early on and throughout their life. These partnerships serve as engines of innovation since they accelerate research, enhance medical education and improve, or at least inform, pediatric health outcomes.</p>
<p>I have spent the last 18 years learning about pediatrics, endocrinology, genomics, and clinical research having earned my MD and Masters in Clinical Research from Harvard Medical School. I've published close to 70 studies about genetic causes of growth disorders and early puberty. I am happy to talk about anything related to genomics, pediatric endocrinology, growth, puberty, working in a Children's hospital-or about science and medicine. I'll be on at 1 PM (ET, 18 UT), ask me anything! </p></div></div>

<p>Thanks for the AMA! </p>
<p>What height range is considered normal for a growing child? Do you use their height on their growth charts to determine if a child is short of stature? Or is your focus primarily on obvious cases (in utero findings) and follow up after birth? </p>
<p>Edit: Do you have a favorite gene mutation discovery? Or one with an exciting story?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Have you looked into the epigenetic factors regulating your reaserch and if so, what are they? </p>
<p>Additionally. For someone going down a similar career path, what career path did you chose to go down?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
