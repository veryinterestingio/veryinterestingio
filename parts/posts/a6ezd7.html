<p>It <em>is</em> very, <em>very</em> toxic though, so even if we pretend it was as caustic as something like AR or a piranha, there's absolutely no chance you'd survive contact with enough of it to eat your face off and not die from the cyanide poisoning itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hydrogen cyanide is not very caustic and would definitely not eat your upper jaw away. The way it kills you is similar to Carbon monoxide: Cyanide (after losing a positively charged hydrogen) will outcompete oxygen for its binding sites in hemoglobin (blood) and myglobin (e.g. muscle).</p>
<p>Which means that either you won't get any oxygen to your muscle and brain even if you breathe - or, even if you did it still couldn't be used there. So you would, in a way, suffocate despite breathing. Also, the stuff smells like almond.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
