		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;More powerful&quot; probably isn't the right word here. Free base (neutral) drugs have different physical properties to their salted forms (e.g. cocaine vs cocaine hydrochloride). The two most striking and relevant differences for drugs are solubility and volatility, which both play a part in a parameter called bioavailability. The solubility is how well the drug dissolves in water. Salts will have higher solubilities than non salts. Volatility is how well a drug goes into the vapor phase. Essentially, all salts will be non-volatile (i.e. cannot be vaporized). Bioavailability is the measure of how well a drug gets absorbed by the body and varies by administrative route. Bioavailability can be measured in %'s which represent how much gets absorbed vs released/excreted.</p>
<p>With all that laid out, the main difference between free base cocaine and cocaine HCl is that free base can be volatalized. When it's heated, it goes into the vapor phase and can be breathed in. The bioavailability through inhalation is pretty high. If you heat up cocaine HCl, it will get hotter and hotter but never become a gas. It will eventually get hot enough to break down chemically, at which point the cocaine will be destroyed.</p>
<p>Different routes have different bioavailabilities, onset times, and risks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel I should add that a big part of what is perceived of crack being more &quot;powerful&quot; than cocaine is the environment in which the substance is used.</p>
<p>Usually, crack is a cheaper drug, which means it can be bought by people who are more socially vulnerable. These conditions tend to potentiate the addiction mechanisms and are the reason that forced treatments tend to fail in comparison to improving the addict's life condition.</p>
<p>Two good entry points for understanding this better are the <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Rat_Park" target="_blank">Rat Park studies</a> and the <a href="https://www.thersa.org/press/releases/2015/taking-responsibility-for-your-own-wellbeing-is-key-to-drug-and-alcohol-recovery" target="_blank">co-production approach to addiction recovery</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cocaine molecules stick to each other less strongly when it's in freebase form. That makes it turn into a gas easier than cocaine as a salt. That change makes it more smokable. As for power, the freebase needs to reach your brain to exert its effect. The faster it does that, the more powerful it seems. The freebase is better able to spread itself around in your lungs as a gas and penetrate into your bloodstream. Once inside your blood it's likely transformed back into a salt as it makes it's way to your brain. Finally, it needs to flip back to a freebase to cross your blood-brain barrier. So cocaine in crack form really helps with the initial absorption in your lungs. Everything else after that is the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
