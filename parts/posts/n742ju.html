		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When sexual reproduction occurs, there is a random mix of the genes of the two parents.  Traits may be passed on genetically but may not be.  Which is why all of the children of parents do not have the same color hair, eyes, etc. or be the same height.  There is genetic variation in the offspring.</p>
<p>So you would clone a large number of the species.  You would then have them reproduce.  And you need 2 different sexes to sexually reproduce.  You have a lot of them produce a lot of offspring.  Even though the original clones may only have 2 different sets of genes, the offspring will have varied genes.</p>
<p>Some offspring will have bad genetic combinations due to inbreeding but others will not.  So you prevent those with bad genes from further reproducing.  You let the good ones continue to reproduce, with more genetic variation.</p>
<p>So basically it is a numbers game.  Clone a lot of them and you will get enough healthy offspring to continue reproducing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

You would have to clone another specimen of the opposite sex to breed it with or continue cloning the same specimen if you don't have any more samples to work with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
