		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First: saliva is 99% water, so anything in it will be in very low concentrations (which is why you should chew thoroughly before, so you can mix the saliva and help with very small portions).</p>
<p>Second: most of the enzymes present are for breaking starch and fat, both of which are not found in the outside of our thumbs.</p>
<p>Third: our <del>thumb</del> thumbs (and most of the body as well) are protected by the skin, made primarily of a protein called keratin (it rhymes). This is a very hardy structural protein, the same in our nails, hair and in some animal horns.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It does, but the enzymes in saliva aren't particularly effective at breaking down protein (which happens to be what your skin is made of). Salivary glands produce salivary amylase which breaks down starches, and salivary lipase which breaks down fats. There isn't a lot of Starch on the surface of your skin, so the amylase doesn't impact it much. The lipase probably does break down some of the lipids in your skin, but the proteins will remain more or less intact and unaffected leaving you with a fairly robust barrier to further damage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the shortest answer is that the way saliva breaks down food doesnt work that well on living human skin. the slightly longer answer is that there isnt much in the way of enzymes (the stuff that breaks stuff down) in saliva and what is there isnt good at breaking down the stuff our skin is made of. its like how soapy water can help break down stuff on dirty plates, but it wont break down the paint or the plate itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
