This seems to have been happening since the ancient Greeks, if not before. Aren't we going to run out of large pieces of marble?</a>

This happens in houses across the world - custom cut marble slabs for counters. If you could re-use marble I would understand, but these all seem to be new sheets.. How are we not running out?</p></div></div>

<p>Total marble production is roughly 10 million tons per year, about 3.8 million m3. That's a cube of marble about 160m on a side. That's a big rock, but it's not even the size of a decent sized sports stadium, let alone a mountain. And we've literally got mountains of marble.</p>
<p>And the total production includes a lot of marble for applications outside of large dimensional mable like we use for tiles and countertops.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Marble is metamorphosed limestone, there's a lot of marble in the world, there are some entire mountains made of limestone</p>
<p>You're worried about counter tops so run the numbers.  If we give everyone (even the children) their own 5 meter x 1 meter x 5 cm thick countertop so its a chonker then each countertop needs 0.25 m^3 of marble, times 7.7 billion people and you're at just 1.925 km^3 of marble.  That's not even 2 full 1km x 1km x 1km cubes stacked on top of each other, that's a fairly small mountain if turned into a dome.</p>
<p>Its difficult to really conceive of the scale of parts of the Earth.  All those countertops amount to 5.4x10^12 kg of marble, but even if we suppose that just 0.0001% of the Earth is marble then we only need to mine 0.0001% of the available marble to meet our needs of giving everyone a fresh countertop.  The Earth clocks in around 6x10^24 kg which is really too big for your mind to grasp</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
