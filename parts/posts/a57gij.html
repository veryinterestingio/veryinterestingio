		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fast may not be the correct term here. They are quick. Most small prey can accelerate and change directions very quickly, but can't run all that fast in a straight line. They look fast, but if you put them in an open area, a coyote or something similar could easily run them down.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They may be low to the ground, but their legs aren't as short as their ground clearance. Their range of motion for their legs start at about the height of their spine, which is on the upper surface of their body, which makes their legs much longer than they appear and allows them a longer gait than you might expect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they have a very low body weight as well. </p>
<p>Think of humans. A 4'10'' skinny person and a 6'8'' fat person decide to have a race. If you look at just limb size, the 6'8'' person should win the race because he has longer legs. However, the increased body weight means that he will probably be slower than the 4'10'' person despite the difference in length of stride.</p>
<p>The same principle can be applied here. Smaller creatures, such as rats, aren't slowed down as much by their shorter limbs due to their equally low body weight.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you are comparing it to something like a human, the difference between 2 and 4 legs matters as well. 4 legs are generally better for sprinting shorter distances while 2 legs are generally better for running over a long distance.</p>
<p>Edit: Also, their lack of body weight allows them to accelerate quicker, but they aren't really fast. From what I can find, rats generally get exhausted at 40 feet per minute. Not that this is not their top speed but rather the speed at which they will become exhausted at if running over a long distance. Their top speed is around 8mph, but that is only in quick bursts. Humans can easily run at 20 miles per hour, which translates to 1760 feet per minute. A housecat can run even faster than humans, at around 2400 feet per minute, granted, they can only do that for a short period of time. If you made them actually run for an hour, a human can run around 8-9mph easily but the cat would not be able to keep up despite having a faster burst of speed.</p>
<p>So, smaller mammals aren't really faster, they just accelerate quicker and have bursts of speed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
