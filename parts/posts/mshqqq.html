		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's complicated. </p>
<p>So, the good news is, a small number of female genes will always be passed on down the female line. This is something called mitochondrial DNA. Sexual reproduction only applied to nuclear DNA - DNA contained in the nucleus. Mitochondrial DNA is not in the nucleus, it's in a separate part of the cell called the mitochondria, and you get all your mitochondria from your mother - they come with the pre-fertilised egg cell. So as long as each woman in a lineage has at least one daughter, that mitochondrial DNA will always be passed on down the generations. Sons won't pass on the mitochondrial DNA though cos sperm get rid of all their mitochondria just before launch. And because mitochondrial DNA is always passed on completely, every single human on earth can trace their lineage back to a single prehistoric human we called &quot;mitochondrial Eve&quot;. The mitochondria of every human alive today are the same mitochondria as mitochondrial Eve, give or take the occasional random mutation. </p>
<p>Similarly, men will always pass on their Y chromosome unchanged to male offspring. Y chromosomes are necessary to produce a male child, and they can only be gained from male DNA. The Y chromosome is integral to male-ness, on the genetic level. If you have one you're male and if you don't you're female, give or take the occasional developmental disorder. That Y chromosome is passed on to 50% of children on average, and any male child will have it. So as long as a male lineage keeps having sons, that Y chromosome will keep being passed on. And just like mitochondrial eve, that means that all human men alive today can trace their Y chromosome back to a single prehistoric male human called Y-chromosome Adam. Although for the record, despite their names, Mitochondrial Eve and Y-Chromosome Adam were separated by several thousand years, and were the result of two separate genetic bottleneck events on the human species (events where the available gene pool is drastically restricted). </p>
<p>So no, it will never reach a point where they're <em>nothing</em> left, except in the case of fathers and daughters, as daughters don't pick up that Y chromosome and therefore will eventually end up having their X chromosomes diluted by endless generations of sexual reproduction.</p>
<p>However, it's also a bit more complicated than that. Genes aren't inherited as just a direct proportion of the whole. Genes are packaged into things called chromosomes. We have 46 of them (arranged into pairs, like 1a 1b, 2a 2b and so on), and we pass 23, chosen by pair, on to each child. Any given chromosome has a 50% chance of being passed onto a child. That's not the same thing as 50% of one origin of DNA being passed on. It's theoretically possible for every single one of those 23 chromosomes you give to your child to end up in one of your grandchildren. It's also theoretically possible that none of those chromosomes end up in a grandchild. The chance is extraordinarily low (0.5^23) but it is still there. So, <em>on average</em> your grandchild will have 25% of your DNA, but any given grandchild could have as little as 0% of it or as much as 50% of it. Plus because chromosomes are packages, the minimum un-dilutable quantity is 1 chromosome. Once you get to that one chromosome point, it's just a straight 50/50 chance. That's not going to get halved again, it's just a 50% chance of having 2.17% of your DNA and a 50% chance of having 0% of your DNA. Of course, on average those children will have 1.09% of your DNA, but that's because half will have none and half will have 2.17%.</p>
<p>There's also another thing called Crossing Over by which chromosomes exchange genes with their paired chromosome, but that makes this so complicated that it becomes hard to explain and the effect still ends up roughly the same anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, because DNA has a finite number of genes in it. Your full genome contains about 6 billion base pairs (the smallest unit of DNA information), meaning that on average there will be less than one left after at most an average of log2(6,000,000,000) = 32.4 generations, or about 800 years.</p>
<p>This is slightly (well, okay, grossly) oversimplifying, because genes aren't passed <em>quite</em> independently of one another, but it's a good enough back-of-the-napkin estimate. This would imply that most people who lived before about 1200 AD have not passed any genes to modern humans (they may have living descendants, but none of them carry their genes).</p>
<p>The main exceptions are the Y chromosome (you always inherit the same one from your dad if male, because he only has one to give) and mitochondrial DNA (you always inherit mitochondria from your mother). In those cases, aside from mutations, your genes will persist as long as you have male-line or female-line descendants.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically yes, but actually no.</p>
<p>True, there is a finite number of genes in the genome, so at some point none of the original genes would remain. However, this will not happen for 2 reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Number of humans is not doubling each generation. At some point, both parent of new children would be distantly related to the original person in question.</li>
<li>The original person is not the only carrier of a given copy of gene. At some point, his descendants, who &quot;lost&quot; original copy of the gene will have their children &quot;regain&quot; it from the other partner.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eventually yes as the genetic information gets overwritten by all the other genetic information. It's a roll of the dice each generation. There's not even a guaruntee  that the first offspring will pass on even a quarter of the original genetic information of a particular parent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a little confused by one thing regarding some of these explanations. So let's say that with each generation, the DNA passed from you is halved. What is the assumption then of where the other half comes from? Other people, yes?</p>
<p>So far enough down the line it is assumed that my DNA is no longer passed on, but then whose is? </p>
<p>When I pass DNA, it's not MY DNA, it's a combination of my parents who are a combination of their parents, etc. So even if in miniscule amounts, that would imply I must necessarily still have some DNA from every ancestor, ever. </p>
<p>If I'm not mistaken someone pointed out that this is true with the X chromosome, through mitochondrial DNA but some people have neanderthal DNA and we've traced back to a common male ancestor some thousands of years back, so the same must be true of the Y chromosome as well.</p>
<p>Therefore none of this is my DNA, or even my parents DNA, it's a recombination of DNA from the 'first population' of homo sapiens.</p>
<p>Alternatively, it's all mine the moment I'm born and while I pass on my DNA, it stops being mine as soon as my child is born so no one ever passes DNA beyond one generation.</p>
<p>No?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
