		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe DNA primase has a counting ability. It terminates after ten or so nucleotides. And it often generates bursts after that, also in units of ten. There are some proposed mechanisms for this phenomenon, and here is an excerpt from an article:</p>
<p>Mechanistically, how might primase count? Ultimately, counting requires either that the enzyme remember where it began, that it keeps track of the number of phosphodiester bonds that it has formed, or that primase initially binds DNA in a manner that inherently limits the length of the product. For the hexameric T7 primase, Richardson et al. have proposed an elegant model based on structural studies and mutagenesis (Figure 3 [38]). In this model, the Zn+2 finger domain of one primase molecule interacts with the polymerase domain of the neighboring primase molecule to provide this polymerase domain with a limited amount of template.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The mechanism is unclear still but eukaryotic primase actually switches to dNTPs after ~10-11 RNA nucleotides and will synthesize as much as 100bp of actual DNA before falling off. I believe this is due to processivity however I will do a literature search today to confirm there isn’t another mechanism at play.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Peralto-Castro et al 2017 show that a plant mitochondrial Helicase/Primase has so called &quot;cryptic&quot; initiation sites; meaning they are required for DNA polymerase recognition but do not lead to encoding new DNA.  It could be that once DNA polymerase binds, its processive proofreading activity simply digests the primer, no matter the length.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>as i recall, it does. do you mean why isn't it subject to the same segmented okazaki fragment formation as on the lagging strand?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>leading strand replication is continuous because after the RNA primer attaches, helicase is always unravelling the leading strand ahead of the polymerase. These processes occur in concert so new RNA primers (\~10-ish nucleotides) aren't binding in between the two (if it did, the polymerase would meet a double-stranded section and stop - just as it does on the lagging strand). Replication ends at the 5' end of the copied leading strand. </p>
<p>Were the polymerase to stop for whatever reason, it would require a new primer to attach right at the 3' end of the single leading strand (ie where the double strand has stopped) to allow further polymerase on that strand and later fusion by DNA ligases to generate functional DNA.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Lagging strand replication occurs in sections because it is occurring towards the lagging strands 5' end, AWAY from the helicase. So once the primer binds (near helicase), polymerase works backwards until it reaches a double stranded section (the lagging strand + an okazaki fragment) creating a new okazaki fragment. In the meantime, helicase has opened up more of the DNA for a new primer to bind and another okazaki fragment to be created. These then get ligated so that each strand is now a copy of the original 2-stranded helical DNA.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is all me trying to recall basic biology course, so may have some errors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think what OP is asking is why does DNA primase only add one primer on the leading strand, rather than continuing to add primers for okazaki fragments all the way along like it does on the lagging strand? My molecular biology is scratchy so I'm not going to attempt to answer, haha. Are its binding sites backwards on the leading strand?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
