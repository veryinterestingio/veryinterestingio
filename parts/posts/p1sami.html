Some have argued that leaded gasoline was responsible for reducing the iq of generations of people. It has now been a while since leaded gasoline has been banned worldwide. </p>
<p>Do we see any non-negligible difference in levels of intelligence in people before and after the lead ban? </p>
<p>(I know IQ is an imperfect measure of intelligence it is just one data point. And I use it for a lack of a better metric)</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Average IQ is always 100, so technically no at least as you asked the question. But yes youâ€™re right that exposure to exhaust from leaded gasoline impairs cognitive function and there is a lot of research to back that up. <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2613157" target="_blank">This 4 decade long study</a> which followed hundreds of children who grew up after exposure to leaded gas showed they had lower cognitive function and lower socioeconomic status by the time they were middle aged. This is still far from definitive and its too small of a sample size to draw conclusions about entire generations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Look up the Flynn Effect, IQ scores in developed countries have been increasing steadily for a long time (although it looks to be leveling off). They're probably numerous reasons for it, but it's possible some of the increase is due to unleaded gasoline.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>We also know for a fact that levels of lead in blood decreased significantly following the phase out:</p>

<p>There's pretty good evidence that lead exposure from fuel is linked to an increase in crime:</p>
