		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bicycles are power and endurance limited by the cyclist so minimizing friction and drag are paramount. </p>
<p>Racing cars on a track with curves is typically grip limited (ie tires lose grip before engine max power). So wider tires that improve grip reduce the time it takes to go around the track.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fast cars need a lot of traction, which means they need a lot of surface area on their tires. Otherwise, they spin out really easily thanks to the high speeds and power. </p>
<p>Bicycles don't really have that problem because you aren't going fast enough for it to matter. Thinner tires weigh less and weight is a big selling point for bicycles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The tire choice depends on what you want to do with it. If you have low acceleration and don't take many corners (and are able to lean into corners) you don't need very wide tires, so you go for the lightest.</p>
<p>If all you do is accelerate, brake, turn into a corner, accelerate again, take a high speed corner etc you want all the grip you can get so you go for wide tires.</p>
<p>This is combined in drag racing, the rear wheels are the ones that transfer the power of the engine to the road surface and 'push' you off. The front wheels are not used for acceleration <del>and braking</del> so they are very thin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A really fast car with wide tyres would most probably be even faster with narrow tires, it would just suck at turning and accelerating, which is important things for most fast cars.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
