		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One  side of the clip has a light and the other has a sensor. When you clip it on your finger, it shines both red visible light and infrared light through you finger and it hits the detector on the other side, after passing through your finger. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. Saturated hemoglobin (full of oxygen) and unsaturated hemoglobin (not full of oxygen) absorb different amounts of infrared and visible light, so by comparing the ratio that the sensor detects to the ratio that was emitted, it can tell how much of the hemoglobin in your blood is saturated and how much isn't.</p>
<p>Edit: As others have pointed out, it can only tell whether hemoglobin is saturated or not. Someone with carbon monoxide poisoning will still show normal saturation because the hemoglobin is saturated with carbon monoxide. (Edit to this edit: apparently newer pulse oximters can measure carbon monoxide as well).</p>
<p>Edit 2: A lot of people are asking about the kinds on watches or other fitness devices. My description above is for the <a href="https://www.maxiaids.com/Media/Thumbs/0008/0008237-oxywatch-talking-fingertip-pulse-oximeter-350.jpg" target="_blank">finger clip pulse oximeter</a>. The ones ones on watches and whatnot work the same way, except the light is reflected back instead of passing through the finger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a nurse. I'm not necessarily an expert on exactly how it works but I have a basic understanding. Basically the little red light that the finger clip lets off goes through your finger and hits the sensor on the other side. Using the power of science the sensor can tell how much of the light was absorbed by the blood going through the finger, and it uses this to math out what percent of the hemoglobin has something bound with it. Hemoglobin (the part of the blood that carries oxygen) absorbs different amounts of light depending on if it has something on it or not and the computer can use that to figure out what percentage of the hemoglobin is bound with other compounds. </p>
<p>It's a handy tool for a quick reading but it isn't perfect and has its drawbacks. If someone has fingernail polish on the light won't go through the finger properly and you won't get a good reading. Similarly, if you're really cold or have poor finger circulation for some other reason there won't be enough blood going through to get a reading. In that case, you need a special probe that can be stuck to the forehead or somewhere else to get a reading.</p>
<p>Another problem is that it can only tell you how much oxygen is bound to your hemoglobin as a percent of total hemoglobin. So if you're bleeding out or your hemoglobins low from something like anemia, the sensor will read as though you are properly oxygenated even if your cells aren't getting enough oxygen. For example, say your hemoglobin is crazy low, like... 2 (normal is roughly 12-16 for females and 14-18 for males). If you're still breathing ok the sensor will read 100%. But that doesn't matter because 2 hemoglobin isn't enough to give your body the oxygenation it needs even if every bit of it is bound with oxygen.  </p>
<p>One other issue with it is it only reads what % of your hemoglobin has <em>something</em> bound to it. Not just oxygen. Hemoglobin binds to other things besides oxygen. A common example is carbon monoxide. The reason for this is that if you breathe in both oxygen and carbon monoxide, Hemoglobin will bind to the carbon monoxide <em>before</em> it binds with the oxygen. This has to do with chemistry and whatnot but basically the hemoglobin has a greater affinity for the carbon monoxide than it does with the oxygen. So if you end up in an ambulance with carbon monoxide poisoning and they put a pulse ox on you, it will probably read as normal. This is because the machine just reads that the hemoglobin has something bound to it, it doesn't realize it's something that you can't breathe. </p>
<p>Pulse ox's are a good tool but their just machines that can be fooled and have problems. True low readings are bad and should be treated, but high readings don't necessarily mean the patient is ok. That's why there's a common saying in healthcare to always treat the patient and not the machine. People get super caught up in treating numbers like O2%, blood pressure, etc. without looking to see if those numbers match what the person is experiencing. If your heart monitor says the person's heart isn't beating but they're sitting on the edge of the bed talking to you, it's usually wise to troubleshoot the equipment before trying to do CPR.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It shines a light through your finger, on the other side of an eye that's really sensitive to color. The color of blood is different when there's oxygen in then when it's not in there. So the eye can see the color and determine how much oxygen is on the blood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
