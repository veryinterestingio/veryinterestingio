		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Crying is communication that alerts others you need help. Adults have the experience to evaluate that they don't need help for minor injuries like bruises and scrapes, and they prioritize other ways to seek help for worse injuries when they are able. But with a bad enough injury, we all cry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Emotional Control. As we age we learn how to influence our response to stimuli of all kinds, pain just being one of them. When you tell a 2 year they canâ€™t do something they stomp their feet and pout. You tell a 32 year old the same, and their reaction is more controlled and rational (well, it should be at least). Same goes for pain - as we grow older we are able to better control our response and not cry as a result of the pain. We might wince or swear instead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I like to remind folks that as adults we have a lifetime of experience to draw from in everything we do and everything that happens to us. When a child gets hurt, it very likely is the worst pain and the most scared they have ever been. Crying is a reaction that we have in most situations when our emotions are at their highest.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Crying releases chemicals in your brain (endorphins) which make you feel better and act as a painkiller. As a child you would be more sensitive to pain (no tolerance) and have a bigger need for those feel good chemicals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because when you're a kid, and you get hurt, you think it's more serious than it really is, and you might die or something, so crying is a way to get adults to help you, but when you're an adult, you know you are not going to die from pain, and if if you did die, the number of people who would care is finite.  :(</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
