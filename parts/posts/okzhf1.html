		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not only possible, it has happened. It's very rare, especially since organ transplant screenings tend to be rigorous.  But some things slip through the cracks. </p>
<p>It's not really the DNA that's the issue, it's what's on your cells. Everyone has these proteins on their cells that are unique to them, it helps your immune system identify what is or isn't your body. Yes, your DNA codes for these proteins so it's indirectly involved but that's the only involvement. When you get a transplant you are given immunosuppressive drugs that you take to ensure your immune system doesn't kill the new organ. This means that if cancer does arise in the organ it will be a lot harder for the body to fight it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a wild story about a Columbian man who died of non-human cancer. He was immunocompromised from HIV/Aids and experienced a tapeworm infection. The tapeworm got cancer and the tapeworm cancer metastasized into other parts of his body. </p>
<p>It seems completely plausible that a transplant recipient (who typically take immunosuppressors) would be susceptible to cancers not normally dangerous.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am currently dealing with this exact issue. I have a transplanted kidney with a mass on it. They aren't sure if it is cancerous or not and are they trying to get better images of it. If it is inconclusive or they think it is cancerous, they will remove my transplanted kidney intact. The doctor said it is not worth the risk of trying to remove the cancerous part of the kidney. They are concerned with it spreading due to being on immunosuppressive medicines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. If it can evade the immune system enough in the host organ, it could adapt to avoiding it in other tissues.</p>
<p>The DNA really doesn't play into equation, as cancer is already slightly distinct from the host.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not only yes, but that's not actually how cancer works. Cancer starts from a single cell that goes bad. That single cell multiples into more cells, that mass of cells is 'the cancer'. So when cancer spreads, it's that original cell's descendants spreading, with no care to the healthy other body cells. </p>
<p>If fact, the Tasmanian Devil has a really fun form of cancer that is spread when one Tasmanian devil bites another. The cancer from the infected biting devil take root on the bite victim and now that victim will develop the cancer (and most likely spread it by biting others). Unfortunately, this biting thing is part of normal behavior for them so upwards of 80-90% of wild Tasmanian devils are afflicted with this cancer despite almost all of them having perfectly healthy DNA.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
