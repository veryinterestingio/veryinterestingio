		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pigeons are domesticated/ feral rock doves.  They were originally found on cliff surfaces and similar habitat.  Cities are basically man made cliffs.  They can also be found in old silos for the same reason.  When people domesticated them originally they made large rock piles with small nesting caves. Then cages.  Now they use our window ledges and roofs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pigeons are cliff dwelling species. Look at cities - the buildings and structures are all man made cliffs!</p>
<p>As humans moved from caves (which are in cliff faces) to creating their own dwellings, many species followed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As another commenter wrote, this was natively a cliff-dwelling species. Human constructions simulate this very well in urban environments. Highway overpasses, bridges, highrises. That is the type of structure where they want to nest.</p>
<p>Humans also provide easy food sources. I have hunted city pigeons many times in NYC and in my home town of Charlottesville and what I found in their stomachs again and again has been bird seed and things like Cheerios.</p>

<p>That said, sometimes pigeons are found in rural areas. Usually in a situation where there is an abandoned barn where they can nest, with nearby grain being grown and/or fed to cattle. The predator situation also tends to be more robust in rural areas, with more hawks in particular. I used to drive past such a farm every day for several years, watching first a few hundred pigeons perched each morning on power lines along a farm with a pair of hawks also perched nearby. As time went on, the pigeons were reduced to a smattering while the hawks did their work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
