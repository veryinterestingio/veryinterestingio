		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In plastic lighters, it's not so much that it's getting divided but rather that it's getting structurally supported. The divider is a web of crisscrossed struts that reinforce the integrity of the lighter, whose contents are under a lot of pressure.</p>
<p>You would never want, say, a lighter to explode if you left it outside in the hot sun. This is what prevents it from doing that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
