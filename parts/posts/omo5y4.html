		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The body does not kill bacteria with fever.</p>
<p>The body kills bacteria with Leukocytes (White blood cells) and Antibodies (proteins that bind to the outer membrane of bacteria and clump them together / inactivate them or incapacitate them).</p>
<p>The fever is there to slow down the reproduction process of the bacteria so your initial response has a better chance to be sufficient. </p>
<p>Your body has other peculiar responses to infection furthermore increasing it´s efficacy: you will store iron inside cells, not allowing it to be ''eaten'' by bacteria who NEED it in order to replicate. Copper levels also tend to fluctuate during infections and so on... (more about this <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-29353-2" target="_blank">here</a>) </p>
<p>Our body will just try and deprave itself of those ''luxuries'', not vital for itself but vital for other microorganisms. A good example of us learning to approach infections with the ''it does more harm to them than to us'' technique was the use of ARSENIC before antibiotics. Yes, it kills us... but it kills the bacteria faster. (More about it <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0251-8" target="_blank">here</a>)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body is betting that his own regeneration and recuperation mechanisms are better than that if the bacteria, which is most of the cases true.
Chemo works similar. It damages everything in your body, but since cancer has accelerated cell growth and divisions, it affects the cancer more than you.</p>
<p>Imagine putting an enemy with you in an airtight room, because you are pretty sure you can hold your air longer and he dies first.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The fever doesn't kill bacteria. The fever makes most chemical reactions run faster. The body is like a factory where many chemical reactions happen all the time, and chemical reactions depend strongly on temperature. </p>
<p>For this reason it can be dangerous to increase temperature too much or too long, because it will cause some processes to not work very well, or too well and that causes imbalances. However the imbalances and the fact that some processes work faster can help fight bacteria and viruses and also puts the body in emergency mode.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The body can handle it far better than the bacteria or viruses can.  In addition, a low grade fever isn't particularly dangerous.  </p>
<p>Whenever you get a fever high enough to actually be dangerous, that's when the disease is so bad that if the fever doesn't work, you are dead anyway.  You can't get deader than dead, so killing you with a fever doesn't actually cause any harm.  </p>
<p>Or wouldn't if modern medicine didn't exist.  But your body is optimized in most way for before medicine existed, so sometimes the way the body works, which would be great in the hunter-gather days is bad for you in modern life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
