		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I'm understanding your question correctly, it's because when you bring two orbitals on separate atoms close together, they mix because the symmetry of the total system is no longer that of a single atom.  Every orbital (in molecular orbital theory, at least) will have a symmetry that depends on the symmetry of the molecule as a whole.</p>
<p>That's a consequence of the symmetry requirements of the overall wavefunction, where  <strong>?</strong> (a,b) = -  <strong>?</strong> (b,a).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The orbital of an atom is represented by a wave function which has a phase, similar to a transverse wave. That phase may be either positive or negative. If both atomic orbitals (AOs) are in phase (both positive or both negative) there is constructive interference and we get a bond. If the AOs are out of phase (one positive, one negative) the wave functions destructively interfere and there is an antibond. So from the interaction from two AOs there will always be a bonding MO and an anti-bonding MO which represent both possible states.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to understand what you're asking here!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Two orbitals, let's call them a(r) and b(r).</p>
<p>They have an overlap, or an operator matrix element, between them:</p>
<p>O_ab = &lt;a|o|b&gt;</p>
<p>I'm assuming this is what you mean by &quot; single interference&quot;. This is a just number, not an orbital. The reason why you have just one of these is because you have just one orbital pair. Well, actually you actually have two such things because you can make</p>
<p>O_ba = O_ab^(*)</p>
<p>as well. But it represents the same thing physically. </p>
<p>You can take the matrix element of an orbital with itself also to get</p>
<p>O_aa =  &lt;a|o|a&gt;  and</p>
<p>O_bb =  &lt;b|o|b&gt;</p>
<p>which are also just numbers. These are not &quot;interference numbers&quot; as above that are properties of the orbital pair, but rather &quot;expectation value numbers&quot; that are properties of each orbital.</p>
<p>Together the four numbers O_ab, O_ba,  O_aa and O_bb can be arranged as a 2x2 symmetric matrix.</p>
<p>To make molecular orbitals you take weighed sums of the atomic orbitals, say</p>
<p>x(r) = c_xa a(r) + c_xb b(r)  and</p>
<p>y(r) = c_ya a(r) + c_yb b(r)</p>
<p>where the coefficients can be thought of as vectors</p>
<p>C_x = [c_xa, c_xb]</p>
<p>C_y = [c_ya, c_yb]</p>
<p>and they contain also just numbers. These are the eigenvectors of the 2x2 matrix we formed above. There are <em>two</em> such eigenvectors.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Do you understand anything of what I just wrote? Have you had linear algebra in school?</p>
<p>Do you understand that an &quot;interference&quot; is not the same as an orbital?</p>
<p>Do you understand that with N orbitals you have N(N-1)/2 &quot;interference numbers&quot; (one for each pair of orbitals)? And also N expectation values?</p>
<p>And by putting them into NxN matrices you get N eigenvectors each of which contain N orbital coeffecients?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
