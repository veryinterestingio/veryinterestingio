		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine the tape is a massive flat piece of wrapping paper, they spray adhesive onto one side if it and then roll it up tightly, the adhesive is on the inside of the roll. This long tube of adhesive covered wrapping paper is then sliced up into thin slices and you have your roll of sticky tape. Differing adhesives and ‘tape’ materials change the properties, like electrical tape doesn’t stick to much but itself, masking tape sticks to a lot but with less adhesion, duct tape isn’t really more sticky if you buy low quality stuff, but good stuff just has more/better adhesive - probably tuned to the expected application of ducts... so tape to metal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In essence, it isn't so much that tape is &quot;sticky&quot; in that the two surfaces really like to be stuck together, it has more to do with the fact that the adhesive can deform a bit when you pull on it. When you try to remove the tape, it absorbs a lot of energy, a lot like how the front of a car is designed to crumple and absorb all the energy to protect you. So, since the tape is absorbing all this energy, it is much harder to remove, this making it &quot;stick&quot;.</p>

It has to stick to the bottom of the tape but not the top, or else when you pulled some tape off of the roll, the glue would stay behind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
