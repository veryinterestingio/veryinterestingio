		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The vacuum of space will quickly dry out food and make it unsuitable for any particularly tough bacteria/fungi that have survived being depressurized.</p>
<p>So no, things will not rot in space.</p>
<p>Whether you’d want to eat it is a very different question though.  This isn’t just freeze drying, this is a <em>hard</em> vacuum with the frozen abyss on one end and the ultraviolet rage of a star on the other.  The food is completely dehydrated down to a shriveled mummy and blasted with solar and cosmic radiation, pulverizing the surface at a molecular level.</p>
<p>So it’s not moldy, but it’s soon reduced to a state that’s not food either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I guess my question is, If you had any object that was hot in the vacuum of space, wouldn't it stay hot?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
