		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, something like 99.99% of his wealth is actually in his stock ownership of Amazon, the company he is CEO of. Anybody (not just Bezos) will not be taxed on their stock holdings unless they sell it. If Amazon stock is worth $1,000 on January 1st but $2,000 on December 31st, Bezos may have “made” $100 billion in the year. But, it wasn’t income and he did not realize the appreciation of his stocks by selling it yet, so he doesn’t have to pay any taxes on it. If he sold his stocks, he would have to pay taxes on it. But, he can get a loan from the bank for virtually no interest and his stocks as collateral, meaning he can “spend” that money without ever actually spending it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you don't have taxable income (in a particular calendar year), you don't owe taxes on it. If you've got a lot of cash in the bank it's pretty easy to live off that for a while. You don't need a salary or to sell assets.</p>
<p>Note: Bezos pays quite a bit of taxes. According to the recent 'exposé', from 2014–18 he had $4.22 billion in income, on which he paid $973 million -- 23%.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>He’s the owner of a company and sets his own salary. The salary he set for himself is something like 70k/ year. That’s the money he pays taxes on like the rest of us. He also owns billions of dollars in stock, and if he wanted to sell stock it would be taxed at a much lower rate then income tax. However, there’s a cheaper option for him too. He’s Jeff Bezos, he’s the richest man in the world, and banks know this. So he can go into a bank, and take out a $100 million loan, and they’ll gladly give it to him because he’s Jeff Bezos. To pay it off? Get another loan. He’ll lose some money through the process but it’s pennies compared to what he’s keeping by not not paying income tax or selling stock.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>He paid nearly a billion in income taxes on $4.4 billion total income.  His salary is only ~$80k. </p>
<p>Most of his income was from selling stock, which is taxed at capital gains rate of 20%.  Assets != income. You only get taxed on capital gains when you sell stock, you don't get taxed just for owning it.</p>
<p>For those that say income taxes were 90% in the 1960s.... Capital gains were only taxed 25% then too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not that he doesn't pay any taxes, it's that his overall tax rate is very low. This is due to how taxes are levied on businesses and investments compared to wages and salaries. When you go to work and collect wages, your wages are taxed first, and then you spend money with what is left over.</p>
<p>For a business, or an investor, they earn revenue, and spend money, and they pay taxes on what's left over. In particular, money spent on an investment isn't taxed until the profits from that investment are 'realized', in other words, when you start selling the thing you bought. So, let's say you're going to buy a donut shop. You spend money on your bakers, servers, rent, equipment, utilities, etc. All that money is deducted from the money you earned, and only money after those expenses are accounted for is considered income.</p>
<p>This principle is also applied to equity investments. So, instead of running a donut shop yourself, you buy shares in a donut chain. You are now part owner of the business, and if the business does well, its value increases, but you're not taxed on that increase in value, unless you sell your stake to someone else.</p>
<p>So, Jeff Bezos owns a <del>majority</del> stake in the company he founded, Amazon.com. So, when Amazon.com has a really good year, his net worth can skyrocket, but if he doesn't sell his stake, he's not taxed on that increased amount of money. In the recent leak of IRS data, it was divulged that between 2014 and 2018, Jeff reported $4.22 billion dollars in income, and paid $973 million dollars in tax. The value of his ownership stake of Amazon increased by $99 billion dollars. If you take his reported income, $4.22 billion dollars, he paid a tax rate of about 23%. But Pro-Publica is computing his income as the increase in the value of his company, Amazon.com. Against that figure, they compute that his rate of tax is 0.98%.</p>
<p>Here's the problem: If you just taxed Amazon.com's net value each year, as opposed to the income drawn <em>from</em> it, Jeff would have to liquidate a significant percentage of the business every tax season. So, let's step away from Amazon and look at a slightly different scenario. You're a farmer. You grow, I don't know, pecans. And your pecan farm is at the edge of a growing suburb. The income you earn from growing and selling pecans is relatively stable. But, it turns out that developers have been buying up property around your farm, and the price of your farm is going up, and now to account for that change in your net worth, the tax man comes and demands that you start selling off your property. See the difference?</p>
<p>The same legal principle, by the way, protects your home (if you own one). If the house you live in jumps up in value, that's not considered income, until you sell it, and there are dispensations as well to protect your money if it's going right back into a different house.</p>
<p>Something else to consider is this: All economic activity is reciprocal, which means that for each buyer, there is a seller. So, in addition to paying whatever income taxes Jeff pays, he also pays the salaries of all his employees, his share of their employment taxes, and his part of the sales taxes of the products Amazon sells to their customers.</p>
<p>So, be wary of any sophistry you encounter regarding how little taxes are paid by the wealthy. Should they pay more? That's definitely an angle you can take, and I would probably agree. But are they really paying less than one percent on their income? No. They're paying less than one percent of the growth in their net worth.</p>
<p>Edit: Evidently Jeff Bezos' current stake in Amazon is 10.3%.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
