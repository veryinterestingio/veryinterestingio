		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a form of code switching, and we do it all the time! Not just for babies and animals, but those are more exaggerated examples. </p>
<p>Code switching is when we change our speech according to the situation. Think about the way you'd talk on the phone with customer service vs with a close family member. You're using the same language, and many of the same words, but there are subtle differences. The coolest part to me is one you mentioned - we do this without really thinking about it!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>So even though we can't tell them we're friends, we can sound reassuring and friendly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Baby-directed speech and pet-directed speech are similar because it actually does get the animals/baby's attention and it holds it for longer than normal speech patterns. </p>
<p>However with baby-directed speech we tend to exaggerate the pronounciation of words but we don't so this with animals. so this suggests that it can also be a tool to help teach babies to speak. </p>
