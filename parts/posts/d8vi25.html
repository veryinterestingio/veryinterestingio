		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chefs hats (think the big white one with all the folds) started in France, you traditionally earned a gold for every technique of cooking eggs. An apprentice chef would wear a floppy “toque” until they started mastering techniques. Current day you’ll see a lot of skull-caps, worn to keep hair contained with a cool-vent top to promote air circulation because it easily gets to 120+*F in restaurant kitchens depending on where your restaurant is located. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Side note, I believe it wasn't until well into the 20th century that hat-wearing stopped being the default. In most of the Western world, it used to be that when you went outside, you wore a hat, period. There's old photos of street urchins wearing miserable rags instead of shoes, and they've all got battered, hand-me-down hats. Chaingang prisoners in stripey suits, the same.</p>
<p>A lot of job-specific hats are from a time when every uniform came with a hat, for the same reason it came with pants and a shirt. The hat became a symbol, and remained even as the rest of the uniform changed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some are just fancy and part of a tradition, like those little ones that grocery store, pharmacy, candy shop or milkmen wore.</p>
<p>Others (almost certainly all hard hats) are associated with their professions because it's just practical and safe. Construction workers have hard hats in case things fall on them, or if they're getting up after bending underneath a beam. Foresters are much the same except they have full-brims to keep pinecones and scruff from falling down their jackets in the back of the neck.</p>
<p>Slouch hats, fishermen's hats, those Asian sorta-cone-shaped hats are all to keep the sun/rain off in otherwise normal outdoor conditions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Read this interesting kids book on how Stetson invented the cowboy hat. Basically it keeps sun off and when it rains it pours the rain out front and back. It was ten gallons because I think it held water too.</p>
<p>A welder wears a cotton skull cap thing with a small cotton bill because of the welding shield that is constant raised and lowered and for protection.</p>
<p>Baseball cap keeps the sun out of your face.</p>
<p>Painter's cap is paper and disposable. It keeps paint out of your hair and can be thrown out when too much paint is on it.</p>
<p>Construction hard hat for protection. </p>
<p>A helmet for safety.</p>
<p>A beekeeper hat with netting do you don't get stung by bees.</p>
<p>Is that a good start?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Australian military slouch hats keep the sun off but also could be pinned up on the side of the dominant eye for sighting rifles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
