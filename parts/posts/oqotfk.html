		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if the proposition is accurate.</p>
<p>Firstly, depending on who hosted it, it has either been very profitable or a massive loss. Take the Beijing Olympics, it made a net profit of USD 1.4 billions vs Brazil's net loss of 2 billion (citation below).</p>
<p>Countries usually want to showcase more than just the theatres which people would view the sport in.  The Olympics acts as a massive PR campaign to signal to foreign investors that the country is open for business and investment. So there is the sense of long term returns beyond the potential for profit or loss.</p>
<p>There is also a prestige associated with being able to host the Olympics. Countries do want to give the impression that they are successful, open to tourism, or change negative stereotypes of the nation held by the international community. A poorer nation might want to show case that the country is safe to travel too, whereas a rich country would want to demonstrate that the country has a uniqueness in it's infrastructure and technology. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bragging rights, plus international attention focused on a small area. I’m a Utah native, I was 10 years old back in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. All of the sculptures and monuments to the Olympics are still here and maintained after nearly 20 years. Utah was already famous for its snow, but it brought even more attention to our outdoors. Worth the investment in the long term probably.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's just being looked at wrong. Not everything is about pure economic return. A five year old might have a huge birthday party with rides and inflatables and a clown that costs $1000 to have and only get $150 in gifts from attendees. </p>
<p>That doesn't make it a loss.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are loads of benefits, others have talked about the wider economy, I'm going to mention the sporting legacy one because I do think it's overlooked or even sneered at sometimes.</p>
<p>I'm British and do a sport not in the Olympics, but we sometimes use the same facilities as an Olympic sport.</p>
<p>Before London 2012 there were two man made centres of note in England and none in Wales (and another couple of really poor ones in England), both subject to frequent rumours of closure. Once we got the Olympics those rumours disappeared, both got renovations instead (one only minor but the other was a substantial redevelopment), two more world class facilities got built (one in England, one in Wales). </p>
<p>Some of this may have happened without the Olympics, in which case the money would have been spent anyway, but as it was done in the name of the games I assume it comes into the &quot;cost&quot; of London 2012, to the tune of some £50 million. </p>
<p>9 years on none of these centers have closed, they are excellent facilities for multiple parties - the Olympic sport they were built for, related sports like those I do and recreational facilities for the general public. They also continue to bring economic benefits to the surrounding area, people travel to them to train all year round, they continue to host national and international events several times a year. </p>
<p>I've no idea how it is for other sports, but many sports in the UK benefited from the renovation or building of new facilities, not just to host the games but those built around the rest of the UK as training facilities. </p>
<p>For me I see the sporting legacy that London 2012 promised to leave as real, far more so than I expected when it was first promised (I never expected it would benefit people like me, as a normal person who casually enjoys some sports in non competitive and definitely non elite manner).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
