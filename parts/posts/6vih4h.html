		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Take any (solved) Sudoku puzzle, check which number is in the center square. If it isn't a 3, proceed to swap all the 3's in the puzzle for whatever number is in the center square and vice versa. Voila, now a 3 is in the center square, but the actual puzzle remains unchanged.</p>
<p>The number 3 has no special meaning in a Sudoku puzzle, nor do any of the other numbers. You can swap numbers in the way described above or even replace all numbers by letters or symbols and nothing changes.</p>
<p>So the only valid answer is that the chance of the center square of a Sudoku puzzle being 3 is exactly 1/9.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ask your SO's dad if swapping 1-9 for a-i makes a difference. Now ask him if c has to be in any particular place.</p>
<p>1-9 in a Sudoku puzzle aren't numbers, they're just placeholding symbols. The numerical properties of 3 can't be relevant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You could equally well play Sudoku with the symbols being &quot;1&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;α&quot;, &quot;ℵ&quot;, &quot;⊢&quot;, &quot;𐤀&quot;, &quot;ᚠ&quot;, &quot;𐡀&quot;, and &quot;अ&quot;</p>
<p>(that's the first symbols of the positive integers, the capitalised Latin, lower-case Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Ogham, Phoenician, Elder Futhark, and Imperial Aramaic scripts, and the first (well, top-left) vowel of the Devanagari script. </p>
<p>What order would you put them in? What's special about any of them? Nothing, right? So it wouldn't matter which one we put in place of 3? In particular, the probability of any one of them being in any particular position is exactly 1/9. </p>
<p>However, given a particular Sudoku puzzle that already has some values placed, the probability is not necessarily 1/9: it's either 1 or 0 (assuming it's a well-formed Sudoku puzzle with a unique answer): for example, if there's a 3 already in that row/column/square, it's 0. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have commented, each puzzle with a 3 in the center can be rearranged in 9 ways with the numbers swapped, so 1/9 is correct.  What is a more interesting question, and what your friend may have been to say, is to ask the probability of a 3 being in the center of <strong>any of the nine smaller squares</strong>.   This makes a very interesting puzzle that takes the sudoku's uniqueness into account.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1 in 9 there is only one square in the center of a sudoku puzzle.  Without any further data on the surrounding squares or the rest of the puzzle, 1 in 9.  Tell him his maths teacher friend agreed just like you will because it is not worth the time to explain it to him now that he has his mind made up.  Don't confuse people with facts once they have their mind mad up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
