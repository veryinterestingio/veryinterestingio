		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Had my teeth cleaned manually (none of the <del>fancy automatic drill thingies</del> tool called scalers and not even saliva suction thingy because it was a public clinic) and the experience was pretty alarming. I could have sworn I almost felt one of my tooth get yanked off along with my tartar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Things I learned so far (from this thread):</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1) It is less about the material and more about the frequency of contact (Prophylaxis = once a year; Brushing = thrice a day)</p>
<p>2) Enamel is harder than steel (5 MOHS &gt; 4 MOHS)! While silica microbeads in toothpastes can scale up to 7 MOHS! Baking soda is apparently safe at 2.5 MOHS?</p>
<p>3) The MOHS (hardness scale) tells a material's resistance to scratching. Lower-scaled materials cannot scratch higher-scaled materials </p>
<p>4) It's called microbeads/silica not granules</p>
<p>5) Microbeads are harmful to the environment</p>
<p>6) <del>Most modern clinics use scalers instead of metal thingies, and scalers use some ultrasonic voodoo to remove the tartar.</del> </p>
<p>Metal hook thingies used in manual cleaning are called hand scalers, but most modern clinics nowadays use ultrasonic scalers that are much less damaging to the teeth. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/aiyom9/eli5_how_come_granules_in_teeth_whitening/eery9gl" target="_blank">Details</a></p>
<p>7) If you have sensitive teeth, hand scalers may be preferable to ultrasonic scalers.</p>
<p>8) Ultrasonic scalers might be detrimental to your hearing as they produce 120dB</p>
<p>9) Once enamel is loss it can not be remade. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/aiyom9/eli5_how_come_granules_in_teeth_whitening/eerrnqu" target="_blank">But there are various dental treatments that could help remineralize/strengthen what enamel you have left.</a> Might be expensive though. (Link is a reddit comment)</p>
<p>10) If you're concerned about your enamel, <del>fluoride helps remineralize enamel.</del> (<del>Fluoride apparently do not have proven benefits.</del> Controversial!) You might (still) want to look up fluoride rinse after brushing (and decide for yourself).</p>
<p>11) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/aiyom9/eli5_how_come_granules_in_teeth_whitening/eervmw6" target="_blank">You can gently and inexpensively whiten your teeth using 3% Hydrogen Peroxide. Click me to redirect to the detailed comment.</a> It also helps with gingivitis as it kills bacteria. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. This post kind of turned into general dental hygiene thread, I hope I didn't inadvertently cause nuisance to mods. I think this subreddit has a rule about parent comments are only direct answers to the title? Watch out~</p>
<p>P.P.S. Please take my brief summary above with a grain of salt especially if it's a bit controversial.</p>

<p>if you put a dripping faucet over a rock, given enough time, <a href="https://www.panorama.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Villa_Gregoriana_-_erosione_nel_calcare_1020860.jpg" target="_blank">it will go through the whole rock.</a></p>

<p>Given enough time, even very small changes can build up.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The benefits of having your tartar removed overweight the few scratches you get from the metal since you do it once a year.</p>
<p>Using every day, 3 times a day, a toothpast with brushing granulates can erode your enamel in the long run. A toothpaste that degrade your teeth even if it takes 10 years is not a safe bet as a toothpaste.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a hardness scale known as Mohs hardness scale.  Things with a higher hardness will scratch things with a lower hardness.    </p>
<p>Tooth enamel has a hardness of 5, the same as glass.</p>
<p>Steel has a hardness of 4.5 so it won't scratch enamel, and pure calcium carbonate (the main abrasive in most toothpastes) has a hardness of about 4.  Unfortunately, small amounts of feldspar (hardness 6) and quartz (7) are also often present in mined calcium carbonate. This &quot;grit&quot; scratches your tooth enamel and can scuff it away. </p>
<p>Edit: A cloth won't rub the paint off your car.  But put a few grains of sand on that cloth, scrub away, and you will notice that the finish is scratched pretty quickly.    </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
