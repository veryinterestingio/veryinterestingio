<p>My current app shows my surrounding air pressure as 1014 hPa, what does this mean to me? Can I use this information in my day to day life?</p>
<p>I tried googling but it wasn't very helpful.</p>
<p>Can you explain what this means for me?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Edit: so I read all of your responses and they were pretty helpful. I tried jumping up and down lifting my phone in the air and even going down an elevator. It was fun seeing the pressure change. Thanks to everyone who helped me learn and discover something new. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you guys know of any other fun stuff I can do with sensors on my phone.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of the sensors, tell me if any fun is possible and I will definitely try it.</p>
<p>Gravity Sensor</p>
<p>Ambient Light Sensor</p>
<p>Proximity Sensor</p>
<p>Gyroscope</p>
<p>Compass</p>
<p>In-Screen Fingerprint Sensor</p>
<p>Hall sensor</p>
<p>laser sensor</p>
<p>Barometer</p>
<p>Infrared sensor</p>
<p>colour temperature sensor</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Edit2: I realised that people would be interested in seeing how I can see my pressure so I have taken a screenshot. <a href="https://m.imgur.com/a/lAxiXSF" target="_blank">link</a></p>
<p>Edit3: A lot of people have been asking me what phone this is. I am using a <strong>Huawei mate 20 Pro.</strong> </p>

<p>I wanted to reply to specific comments but for some reason I am not able to see them. I see your notifications but when I go to answer them, it shows empty. Probably a weird reddit glitch or something but it's pretty annoying as I don't get to read all of your comments.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Barometric pressure is commonly used to measure elevation, as air pressure changes with elevation. One caveat is that air pressure also changes with weather, so elevation measurements incur error as conditions move from nominal. For greater accuracy you can recalibrate your elevation at a known location (e.g. sea level, or a survey marker), which will give you consistency of measurement for the conditions you find yourself in.
As another commenter mentions, barometric pressure is useful for determining weather conditions. A key use case would be, when hiking on a mountain and you notice the barometric pressure drop considerably. This would indicate bad weather is approaching and that it would be a good idea to think about where you might find some shelter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The barometric pressure can be used as a rudimentary weather forecasting tool. In general, falling pressure is indicative of poor weather (rain, etc...), whereas rising pressure tends to indicate better weather (sun).</p>
<p>Compared to modern weather models the predictive value of the pressure is very limited, but in a pinch it could give you a decent indication of whether you're looking at a storm or clear skies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In an article about Google Nexus, which has barometer:</p>
<p>Says John Celenza, the lead meteorological developer at Weather Underground, &quot;the barometer is probably used on the phone to aid in correcting altitude measurements by the GPS.&quot; In other words, the barometer is more likely than not intended to be a source of supplemental data for the GPS sensor, adding altitude measurements for increased accuracy. The atmospheric pressure is directly related to elevation, so a barometer can very easily be used as an altimeter, measuring your altitude.</p>

so in your case the boiling temp would be about 100.02°C (212.036°F)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
