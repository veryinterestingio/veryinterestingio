		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My work was featured in the new documentary &quot;H20: The Molecule That Made Us&quot; which premiered last night on PBS. You can stream the film on <a href="http://pbs.org/" target="_blank">pbs.org</a> or on the PBS Video App on your Smart TV. <a href="http://pbs.org/molecule" target="_blank">http://pbs.org/molecule</a></p>
<p>Greg Asner the Director of the ASU Center for Global Discovery and Conservation Science in Hilo, Hawai'i. Dr. Asner's scientific research focuses on interactions between society, climate and ecosystems through a combination of extensive field work and community engagement, aerial and satellite-based mapping, and computer modeling.  His work has uncovered rapid human-ecological change throughout the world's forests and coral reefs.  He has published more than 600 scientific articles.  Dr. Asner has served in numerous national and international programs, including as a Senior Fellow for the U.S. State Department.  Asner is a recipient of the Presidential Early Career from former president Bill Clinton in 2000.  He was elected to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 2013 and he won the Heinz Award for Environment in 2017. </p>
<p>Because &quot;H20: The Molecule That Made Us&quot; is partnering with PBS series NOVA for outreach around the film, I'll be posting under NOVA's account: u/novapbs. Looking forward to answering your questions about my research and observations. I'll be on at 3pm ET (19 UT), ask me anything!</p></div></div>
