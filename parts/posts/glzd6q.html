		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In March 1980, new magma began to intrude beneath Mount St. Helens. Over the next 2 months, the north flank of the mountain began to bulge up to 450 feet (~150 m) outward. At 0832 am, Sunday May 18th, 15-20 seconds after a M5.1 earthquake, the north flank collapsed in the largest recorded landslide, allowing the pressurized magma to explode outward in a lateral blast and pyroclastic density current that levelled ~230 square miles of forest. Over the next ~9 hours, about 0.3 cubic miles of ash and pumice erupted explosively. That ash was distributed locally as highly destructive pyroclastic flows and hundreds of miles away as ash fall. The eruption had profound impacts on the science of volcanology, volcano monitoring, hazard communication, and hazard mitigation.</p>
<p>The Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program (<a href="http://volcano.si.edu/" target="_blank">volcano.si.edu</a>) is here to answer your questions about Mount St. Helens (<a href="http://volcano.si.edu/projects/sthelens40/" target="_blank">volcano.si.edu/projects/sthelens40/</a>) and volcanoes in general. We'll be on at 7 pm ET (23 UT), ask us anything!</p>

<p>Nice to meet you! I'm a geologist from the Philippines. I'm currently studying igneous petrology and geochemistry, but I'm deeply interested in volcanoes as well. I've been to some famous volcanoes in the Philippines which you might have heard of: Pinatubo, Mayon and Taal.</p>
<p>The eruption of Mt. St. Helens in 1980 paved the way for the deposition of classic debris avalanche deposits (DADs) as well as carving up a well-developed amphitheater along the flanks of Mt. St. Helens. Did the same eruption also deposit ignimbrite? Considering the volume of displaced material along with pyroclastic density currents, were you also able to see different layers depicting an ignimbrite deposit (e.g. thinly bedded layer, surge, massive base)?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
