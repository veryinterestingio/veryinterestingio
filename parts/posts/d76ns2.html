		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Magnetism comes from the poles of atoms oriented in the same direction. Traditional iron magnets are made of iron atoms, which loosely orient in a direction. However adding neodymium forces the iron into a fixed structure, with almost all the atoms are oriented more efficiently. So the new crystal structure amplifies the magnetism of iron as neodymium magnets are made out of  neodymium/iron/boron.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neodymium magnets are actually a mixture of neodymium, iron, and boron in a ratio of 2:14:1 atoms, so neodymium magnets are mostly iron. However this mixture can be better than iron at making magnets for a few reasons. Neodymium has more unpaired electrons than iron whose spin can align with the magnetic field so you can put more magnetic field through Nd2Fe14B before it starts fighting back. (The boron is needed to hold it all together.) Also that specific ratio corresponds to a regular pattern of atoms or crystal lattice. Normal iron magnets are made out of a ferrite crystal lattice. The Nd2Fe14B lattice is ... oh god, it's a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257989469_Relationships_Between_Crystal_Structure_and_Magnetic_Properties_in_Nd_2_Fe_14_B" target="_blank">complete mess</a> but it's kinda layer-y if you squint. These layers prefer to magnetize in a specific direction which is good for us. When you make a permanent magnet, you apply a strong magnetic field and try to essentially freeze the magnet's crystal lattices all in a direction so their magnetic fields add instead of fight each other, so the fact that this lattice has such a preferred direction makes this work especially well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a very very wide road and traffic can go in any direction. If a lot of traffic goes in one particular direction, a magnetic field is induced. When you add neodymium, you give lanes and directional constraints to the flow of traffic, which increases the flow of traffic in the direction which will induce a magnetic field. </p>
<p>Think of neodymium as a road divider or several blocks of stone set to distinguish lanes. You can't drive on them, but they are used to facilitate driving.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
