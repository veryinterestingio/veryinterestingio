<p><strong>[Q1]</strong> <strong>Is there any data about prevalence of these problems among those who have been vaccinated?</strong></p>
<p>Since some of the vaccines, notably the one developed by Oxford-AstraZeneca, report ok-ish efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19, but very high efficacy in preventing severe COVID-19, I'm also interested in how does this vaccine fare in comparison to the ones that have higher reported efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19. So, to phrase that as a question: <strong>[Q2] should we expect to see higher rates of Long COVID among people vaccinated with vaccine by Oxford-AstraZeneca than among those vaccinated with vaccine by Pfizer-Biontech or Moderna?</strong></p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there's still ongoing debate and study to better understand the risk of developing long term chronic consequences of covid 19 infection (and what those complications may be) particularly amongst those who have clinically asymptomatic disease versus symptomatic disease.</p>
<p>One particular important aspect to the vaccine trials, which not a lot of people talk about seemingly, Is that only the astrazeneca trial Tested a subset of participants for asymptomatic disease. It was shown to statistically reduce both asymptomatic and symptomatic infections.</p>
<p>The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines did not study this and thus can only state the statistical reduction in symptomatic infections.  Of course the caveat to all this is that without further study we can't conclude whether modern and Pfizer vaccines also reduce asymptomatic infections.</p>
<p>To conclude I can say  that the evidence suggests astrazeneca vaccine will reduce the chances of you getting long term covid 19 complications as it reduces the overall infection rate.</p>
<p>However experts caution that more data is needed to confirm that trend</p>
<p>References</p>
<p>&quot;To look at transmission, the researchers at the University of Oxford conducted weekly coronavirus tests of participants in the U.K. enrolled in a vaccine trial and found that the rate of positive results declined by about 67% after participants received one dose. Testing negative means no virus is present and makes it less likely a person is infected, even asymptomatically. People without detectable virus in their respiratory tract can't spread the virus&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't confuse 90 plus percent efficacy with only okay results. The bottom line is the vaccines, even after only the first dose, drastically reduce your likelihood of getting covid-19 of any type, long, asymptomatic, death, etc.</p>
<p>The data are very clear that the vaccines are highly effective and highly safe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If we're defining &quot;Long Covid&quot; to be &quot;ongoing symptoms after infection&quot;, then <strong>yes</strong>: the vaccines look to be very effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19, and if you don't get symptoms, you can't have ongoing symptoms.</p>
<p>If we're defining &quot;Long Covid&quot; to be &quot;potential damage to organs after asymptomatic infections&quot;, then we don't know yet, but probably.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
