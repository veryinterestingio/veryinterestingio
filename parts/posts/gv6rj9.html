		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are spherical galaxies! We call them &quot;ellipticals&quot; though - they have a bit of angular momentum, so they tend to be somewhat &quot;smushed&quot; or &quot;stretched&quot; spheres.</p>
<p>There is nothing stopping stars from orbitting all over the place - and when disc galaxies merge, often the stars get so stirred up that it forms an elliptical galaxy in the end. However, stars tend to <em>form</em> in a disc. We only have disc galaxies because the stars are basically staying in the configuration they started with.</p>
<p>While stars can orbit any way, <em>gas</em> tends to form a disc. Stars almost never collide with other stars (except if they form together as a binary etc), but gas particles in space do actually collide with each other quite often. This means that you can't just orbit anywhere you want - the gas particles will bump into each other and lose energy. Eventually it settles down into the lowest energy configuration you can get while still conserving angular momentum - and that's a disc. The stars then form from the gas of this disc, and tend to stay roughly in a disc.</p>
<p>Over time, the stellar disc does stir itself up a bit, and ends up a bit thicker than the gas disc. Generally, we have a &quot;thick disc&quot; of older stars, a &quot;thin disc&quot; of younger stars, and a very thin disc of gas.</p>
<p>As a side note: the supermassive black hole isn't really important here, as far as gravity goes. The vast majority of the mass is in dark matter, stars, and gas. Stars orbit within their own shared gravitational potential - they aren't affected by the supermassive black hole unless they're basically right on top of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that due to conservation of angular momentum it will be hard to compact the shape further along the plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation. However the object in question can sometimes be compacted in all other directions due to gravity. That’s why solar systems and planetary disks are flat. That also explains why some spiral galaxies are flat too. The elliptic galaxies that are spheroid in shape because they don’t have a lot of gas or stars left in them. </p>
<p>For a cool visual explanation see <a href="https://youtu.be/tmNXKqeUtJM" target="_blank">this minute physics video</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Galaxies</strong> <strong><em>are</em></strong> <strong>spherical!</strong> The majority of galaxies' mass is composed of dark matter, which is in a spherical 'halo.' The gas where most of the stars form, however, is in a disk. </p>
<p>Galaxies form via gravitational collapse, and this ends up in galaxies having a net angular momentum. Collisions between gas particles results in the the motion of particles being aligned, and loss of kinetic energy so that they settle into a disk. The dark matter remains in a sphere because dark matter particles are collisionless (or at least the collision cross-section is negligible).</p>
<p>Galaxies do have <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/93830/why-the-galaxies-form-2d-planes-or-spiral-like-instead-of-3d-balls-or-spheric/93844#93844" target="_blank">central bulges</a>, that are as you describe (stars orbiting around the black hole in a much more spherioidal configuration)! These stars tend to be older. So what's happening here? Gravitational disturbances (i.e., merging with another galaxy) disrupt and randomize the orbits of stars, so they end up outside of the disk, and stars are more like dark matter than gas in terms of collisions, so they stay in those orbits. The gas, meanwhile, goes back to a disk configuration and stars forming more stars -- so we see younger stars in the disk.</p>
<p>Some other details and a nice little sketch are in this <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/93830/why-the-galaxies-form-2d-planes-or-spiral-like-instead-of-3d-balls-or-spheric/93844#93844" target="_blank">stack exchange</a> post. </p>
<p>Aside: Since it's what I study, I feel obligated to mention that there's also gas that extends far beyond the disk, called the 'circumgalactic medium', that has a roughly spherical, lower density component.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A non-rotating galaxy would be spherical.  But as soon as you start rotating a galaxy, centrifugal force pulls stars out and away from the center - the closer to the plane of rotation, the more centrifugal force, and the more the star is pulled out from the center - this flattens the galaxy like a pancake along it's axis of rotation.</p>
<p>A star that is straight up, or straight down along the axis of rotation will feel no extra force, and will remain exactly as it would be if there were no rotation at all.  This is why a galaxy will look thicker at the center than at the edge.  The edge is where the centrifugal force is greatest, while the center is where the force is least.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
