		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're talking about the lingering pain in your stomach then it's due to the fact that the testicles originate in the lower abdomen and when they descend they are still connected to the nerves in that area. That's a very basic explanation though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two types of nerves in your body, myelinated and unmyelinated.  Myelinated nerves are wrapped in a protective sheath, and can transmit signals much faster with higher fidelity.  When these nerves are injured, the pain is immediate, usually sharp, intense.  Whereas unmyelinated nerves transmit much slower, the impulse “creeping” its way to your brain.  When these nerves are injured, the pain is slow, often dull, broadly aching.<br />
Your balls are full of unmyelinated, slow nerves.  So that’s the sensation when injured.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some people seem to be confused by my question, thinking that I implied there isn’t any immediate pain when getting hit really hard in the balls. I didn’t say that at all. I’m merely commenting specifically on that lingering pain/soreness that surely arrives after, regardless of if there’s a jolt of pain at first or not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
