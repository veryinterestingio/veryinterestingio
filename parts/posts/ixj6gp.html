		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nerves feel stretch (baro) temperature, pain, pressure. You can only feel one at a time. Pressure beats all in this game of rock, paper, scissors. When you cut yourself and squeeze the cut finger hard you feel the pressure but not the cut. Rubbing hard is a form of pressure, beating out pain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It’s actually a proven phenomenon which can easily explained as if you are 5, called ‘gate control theory’. </p>
<p>Basically two types of nerves: pain and touch, which merge into one and transmit the signal to your brain. By rubbing the area, the touch nerve is overstimulated and ‘shuts the gate’ to the pain nerve so you therefore get preference to the touch sensation felt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason is that the nerves leading to the brain only have a limited &quot;bandwidth&quot;. So if the &quot;cables&quot; have more than just pain data coming in, it can only pay so much attention to it if there is other signals coming in. This is why when you have a headache, a massage or masturbation can make it lessen. The sensory data coming in has to compete with the pain data coming in, and the brain makes the choice which data to prioritize.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A pressure on a nerve on the skin creates a signal to the brain, and inhibits the signals from nearby nerves. This is mainly aimed to increase the presicion of locating the stimulus. When rubbing, many nerves are activated at the same time, which send signals and inhibit other nerves. So rubbing also inhibits the nerves that transmit the pain of a recent accident.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The nerve fibres that are stimulated by rubbing inhibit the nerve fires that are stimulated by pain, so touching, rubbing, etc Inhibit pain. </p>
<p>This is called gate control theory of pain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
