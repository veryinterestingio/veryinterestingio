		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cave systems can be present deep underground in sedimentary rocks under the right conditions.  One way is to have a layer of limestone at the surface long enough to form a karst (cave) topography, then subsequently subside and be buried by thousands of feet of sediment.  The caves will still exist, but have no connection to the surface.  One place this occurs is some parts of Texas, where those deep caves can be a significant drilling hazard in oil and gas exploration.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like all these comments, one of the best examples is the Naica’s Selenite Crystal Cave in Mexico. This cave is home to the biggest known crystal selenite in the world. Single selenite crystals that are larger than telephone poles. Scientists theorize that the cave formed 26 million years ago when a nearby volcano forced mineral rich water into the limestone. For pictures of this cave, a thousand of feet below the surface, <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/api.nationalgeographic.com/distribution/public/amp/news/2017/02/crystal-caves-mine-microbes-mexico-boston-aaas-aliens-science" target="_blank">National Geographic Article</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh yes, and boy can they be interesting. In South Africa geological conditions caused a rise in one area. I don’t remember the exact details, but there is an excellent book, <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Cradle-Life-Story-Magaliesberg-Humankind-ebook/dp/B07VR1K9TC/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=Cradle+of+humankind&amp;qid=1587360885&amp;sr=8-3" target="_blank">Cradle of Life: The Story of the Magaliesberg and the Cradle of Humankind</a>. The result was a variety of cave systems. The entrances to these cave opened and closed at various times (rock slides, etc.) and in the late Nineteenth, early Twentieth centuries the economy is SA needed lots of lime for construction. Many caves were opened by blasting, including the one where Australopithecus Sediba was found my Matthew Berger.</p>
<p>Most of these caves were created by water flow eroding for dissolving the earth, and there will be caves that have never opened to the surface.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there can be caves only connected to the surface by tiny cracks. The Nullabor in Australia has these. </p>
<p>Fun fact: caves move up. Every now and then, part of the ceiling collapses to the floor. The cave just moved up. </p>
<p>Not so fun fact: when they get close enough to the surface, a large area can collapse, leaving a &quot;well&quot; tens of metres deep and tens of metres across. So if you're driving across the Nullabor, stick to the tracks. Otherwise, you might go all Thelma and Louise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
