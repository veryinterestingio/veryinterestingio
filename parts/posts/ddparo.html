		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first experiment designed to test whether atomic orbital angular momentum was quantized is called the Stern Gerlach experiment. In it they used silver atoms that have one unpaired election orbiting the outer shell. They passed them through an inhomogeneous magnetic field to deposit into a collector plate. When they checked the plate after the experiment to see if they could detect quantized splitting the plate appeared blank. They thought they had failed.</p>
<p>But back in this day the scientists could smoke cigars in the lab (!!!)
Cheap cigars emit more hydrogen sulfide. After looking at the plate for a while trying to see anything, the sulfur from their breath reacted with the silver creating a black silver sulfide later that became visible. The silver had been there but such a thin later it couldn't be seen until they &quot;developed&quot; it like a photograph with their cheap cigars.</p>
<p>What they found was the silver deposit was split into two distinct bands indicating that orbital angular momentum was quantized into discrete orientations in space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on temperature, relative humidity, and concentration of hydrogen sulfide.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010938X85901040?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">This abstract</a> mentions that at 4 ppm, it took 500 hours for the rate of sulfide incorporation to drop 2 orders of magnitude (or down to about 1/100 of the original rate). It's hard to find information that isn't behind paywalls, but it seems to me that the conditions that would cause silver to tarnish instantly are not something you're going to find outside of a lab.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
