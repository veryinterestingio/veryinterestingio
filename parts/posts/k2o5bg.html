This means that the bladder is semipermeable membrane. So, if there is a higher concentration of solutes in the surrounding cells, there is a possibility of the water(solvent) can leak out of the bladder and into the surrounding cells.</p>
<p>I may be wrong, and my train of thoughts might have an incorrect link, please correct me.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A thoroughly washed bladder means that all of the cells have been removed, so the remaining bit is extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM is composed of large secreted proteins like collagen and elastin, and it makes up about half of the mass of the tissue. It's a mesh work, so fluids can pass through it easily, and solutes can too depending on their size. The cells lining the bladder provide the bulk of the impermeability of the membrane. Plus, the  concentration of salts and urea in urine is much higher than in the surrounding cells (which is why they're being excreted), so if anything, water would be drawn into the bladder. But, that won't happen on any reasonable time scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Not a live one, though.</p>
<p>Human bladders (and I assume most mammals as well) have multiple layers of tissue. The innermost layer is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitional_epithelium" target="_blank">urothelium</a> which is a layer of tightly-packed cells with impermeable apical membranes (the part that faces inwards towards the urine). The entire bladder also highly elastic, which allows it to hold impressive volumes without rupturing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if there is a higher concentration of solutes in the surrounding cells</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How would this happen in a living animal? If a condition arose where hyperosmolar liquid would surround the bladder, it would draw water from the other tissues around it in the pelvis and eventually be absorbed.</p>
<p>In practice, there is zero chance of the bladder leaking water through osmosis in a living animal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s a reason why thoroughly washed in order to have that effect though. Most cells are already being removed in that process of washing, so that all that remain are the transmembrane proteins and some extra cellular fluid/matrix, where fluids can now easily permeate, as opposed to the relatively higher difficulty for fluids to do so in the original pig’s bladder, before being washed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not really.  It is true that, in general cell, membranes are permeable. But this is not true for every cell surface (think of your skin). The cells of the bladder lining form a fairly impermeable barrier to urine and its solutes. This permeability layer is at the top layer of what is called the &quot;urothelium&quot; which is just a fancy word for the cells that line your bladder.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8898019/" target="_blank"><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8898019/" target="_blank">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8898019/</a></a></p>
<p>Keep in mind that permeability is often depend on the conditions that a material is in. Perhaps this same lining becomes more permeable under conditions not found in the body (like high pressure, for example).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
