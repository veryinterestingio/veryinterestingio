		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most answers here are at best partially correct. Here is the correct answer.</p>
<p>Venture capital invests in companies that are typically based on some innovation or novelty, that are young and have a strong future potential to earn 100x the money invested. The VC model is that 7/10 of these investments will fail completely, 2 will become zombies i.e. just about successful but never really breaking out and 1 will be so success it will pay for all the other failures as well as creating a big profit. Venture funding amounts start at seed stage with a few hundred thousand dollars and can go as high as 100 million. Venture capital is high risk and potentially high reward investing. As an analogy, VC investors build new houses with new designs in sometimes marginal areas that are currently undervalued.</p>
<p>Private equity investors are less risky. They are looking for mature businesses with steady cashflows that provide stable returns on their investment. They are also looking for ways to operationally restructure or financially engineer the investment to release more value. For example they may see ways to get hard cash from the business by selling off some areas or restructuring operations to reduce the amount of cash stuck inside the business in the working capital. They can literally deploy billions for the right invesrment, but often hold for relatively short periods, 2-4 years, while they improve the business and then sell it on. As an analogy, PE investors buy old houses in nice neighborhoods, fix them up and sell them on for profit.</p>
<p>Hedge funds invest in ways that try to ensure they make money no matter what happens, by investing in both positive and negative outcomes of the same investment. Hedging is the practise of investing in both positive and negative outcomes, typically using different means, for example by buying a stock and using derivatives like options or futures to offset any negative movements in the future. Hedge funds invest in highly liquid markets typically, so they can react quickly to changing circumstances, and are typically very private and highly sophisticated investors, using lots of technical ways to balance or even better exploit risks. Again they can command massive sums - tens if not hundreds of billions in some extreme cases, because a small edge multiplied by a lot of money equals a big profit. As an analogy, if a hedge fund bought a house, it would also buy some kind of insurance in case the value dropped below expectations. The expected growth would cover that extra cost, and the insurance would make sure they covered any potential drop in value.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Venture capital is a form of private equity. Hedge funds are a bit different. Ignore venture capital for a second and lets just focus on private equity. </p>
<p>Private Equity is an industry of companies that specializes in purchasing other companies <strong>temporarily</strong> (they would be holding companies if they bought companies permanently) and then selling them for a profit. The value add of PE is they use their experience and skills to improve the company they buy in some way. Poorly run business is never of shortage. The reality is more complex, but that is for an ELI6. </p>
<p>Venture Capital is a type of PE with a more specific focus. Traditional PE normally focuses on buying existing companies that are poorly run, or where they see an opportunity to run them better. Venture Capital on the other hand focuses more on ideas and companies in earlier stages of their life-cycle. Hence the name venture. It is still private equity because the company funded is still private and the funding company (the venture capital firm) is taking an equity stake...hence private equity. But in this case the company getting bought or funded is less sort of...proven. Doing venture capital is just a more specific focus of PE that has some unique characteristics. Time horizons for returns are typically longer for example. </p>
<p>The slightly more complex reality is PE is not just a dividing line between traditional and venture, its more like a spectrum with many companies specializing in the various areas of the spectrum. Some bigger PE firms specialize in more than one area. </p>
<p>Think of Hedge funds as higher risk mutual funds, trading on public securities markets. Though the appeal isn't necessarily to provide better returns than the market, but more like uncorrelated returns, but that is an ELI6.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Venture capitals invest in startups. Their investments have extrememly high risk and return. A VC could invest in 10 companies, 9 fail, but the 10th one makes them 15x more money than they put in</p>
<p>Private Equity includes VCs but usually refers to a firm that buys and sells either up and coming semi-mature companies, or failing large companies. Their goal usually is to re-organize, re-strategize a company for a few years and flip it for a profit. Think of them as home renovators except for companies.</p>
<p>A hedge fund honestly can be anything. The main quality of a hedge fund is that it falls under certian SEC exemptions that allow it to invest in...well basically anything, at the cost that all it's investors must be 'accredited' which basically just means rich. This is to ensure if the hedge fund tanks (most of them do) the investors can afford the risks. If you're not essentially a millionare they legally cannot take you in. By anything i mean anything...equities, derivatives, futures, commodities, etc. It just depends on the fund&quot;s strategy. A hedge fund isnt nessecarily high risk, it just has more tools avalible than a long-only mutual fund. For example, hedge funds can bet against the market</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Publicly traded companies trade thier stocks on a stock exchange. </p>
<p>Some companies are not (yet) publicly traded.  They can sell shares or give shares (equity) to private 8ndividuals. As private companies they have less reporting legal requirements and greater co trip if who buys thier stock than a public company</p>
<p>Private equity is buying equity/shares in those companies. It might be buying a controlling stake ( intended to take a companies board over )  or an investment in the hope of either good dividends or reselling shares at a profit later.</p>
<p>Venture capital is a type of PE where investors try to get in early on new ventures.  It's like a talent spotter seeing a artist or sportsperson in the early days and investing time or money in them.  9/10 of those investments may burn out/fail but occasionally somebody finds an apple or Amazon before they were famous.</p>
<p>Hedge funds I &quot;think&quot; are funds ( ie a place where people invest thier money  under the control of a fund manager )  the hedge manager tries to spread thier bets/investments to make a profit  in  variety of outcomes.  There are different financial tricks ( insurance ) that can make money for the fund even if something bad happens. So the manager hedges thier bets. They may not have the highest gains but equally they don't have bad losses. Hedge fund managers might buy public stock or I think bonds / gilts</p>
<p>In all cases it's just variations on different types of horse betting, but with companies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
