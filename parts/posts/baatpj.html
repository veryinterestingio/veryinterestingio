		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The bad pen can stop working if you touched the paper with sweaty on greasy hands. The oil reduces the traction between the ball on the tip of the pen and the paper (it stops rotating as you move the pen, so the ink doesn't get out. The good pen doesn't have this problem because the tungsten ball is better and the ink is more liquid, not much, but enough to get out more easily. I am not the pen expert, this is just my 2 cents :) .</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have noticed this using cheap paper, a long time ago I watched a documentary on paper making and apparently they add granite dust to the paper to make it more gritty so that the pen ball will roll over it rather than sliding. My guess is that there are places on the paper that did not get treated as evenly as others and that is what leads to the un even writing experience. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you find this happening on a <em>clean</em> piece of paper, it is probably cheap paper.  Cheap paper can have an uneven &quot;finish&quot; so that part of it will be &quot;matte&quot; and part of it is &quot;glossy&quot;.  Most pens are designed to write on &quot;matte&quot; paper.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a small ball in the tip of most &quot;ballpoint&quot; pens. As you drag the pen across the paper the ball deposits the ink on paper from the part that is in contact. As you continue the ball rolls and the portion that deposited the ink rolls up inside where it comes in contact with the ink in the reservoir. Sometimes the ball gets stuck. Sometimes you move it in a way (small circles) that the depleted portion of the ball doesn't have a chance to get re-inked</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
