		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have mentioned, bacteria has lipids (basically oil) on the outer layer of their cells, your hands also have oils, and bacteria can deposit on your hands with ease...</p>
<p>The main issue is the fact that oil and water don't mix (you can try that at home, put oil in water, and they will be separate. You can mix that, and for a moment they will seem mixed, but leave them and they will separate).</p>
<p>So, passing water over your hands to clean them won't do much. That's where soap comes in play! The structure of soap is basically a long chain (think like a beads necklace you can wear but open it up and lay it down) with atoms on one end which like water (hydrophilic) and atoms on the other hand that dislike water (hydrophobic).</p>
<p>When you mix the soap on your hand, the end of the soap that dislike water (hence likes oils) tends to mingle and stick to the oils/bacteria on your hand. Then, when you pass water on them, the end of the soap that likes water, tends to stick to water, and since water is moving, it will drag the soap with it and the soap will drag the bacterial/oils away from your hand as you rinse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your skin has a layer of oil on the surface that bacteria sticks to. Soap sticks to the oil and pulls it away from the skin along with the bacteria. That's why so many soaps have moisturizers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Soap molecules are kind of like a magnet. One side loves water, the other side hates water. So when soap and water are together one side of the soap molecule will attach to anything it can (except water) and this is often dirt, bacteria etc.
Then, when the soapy water is washed away, the bacteria / dirt goes with the soap down the drain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's a bit more complicated though, and I go into it in the video</p>
