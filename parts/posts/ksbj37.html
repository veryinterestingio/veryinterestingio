		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually, the big food manufacturers have done some research and testing on their recipes. They'll get 100 people, and feed 50 of them the 25g sugar recipe and the 30g recipe, and the they'll feed the other 50 the 30g recipe and the 35g recipe, and ask both groups which they liked more, and then refine and repeat this process until they've found a (no pun intended) sweet spot, where raising <em>or</em> lowering the sugar makes the testers score it lower.</p>
<p>And, no surprise, the sweeter recipes seem to score highly, even in recipes where it's offset by something tart or bitter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>But that yoghurt <em>without</em> the sugar would taste different. Sugar balances out acidity and makes it more palatable, and generally makes people like things more, even if the sweetening is not obvious.</p>
<p>You can try it for yourself - get some plain, unsweetened yoghurt, taste it, then add sugar and taste again. Or even better, get someone else to mix up two different bowls of yoghurt and taste them without knowing which is which.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sugar is addictive and your body wants it, even if it's not just a mouthful of sugar.</p>
<p>Any kind of packaged food is tested and engineered to make you want to eat the most of it for the cheapest price they can produce it. If something has X sugar, it's almost always because they tried it with X-1 sugar and X+1 sugar and people didn't like it as much those ways.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You CAN taste it, but oftentimes in a carefully balanced way so that your body doesn't recognize &quot;this is sweet, I'm devouring sugar.&quot;  If it was stripped out of your favorite processed foods, you'd notice.<br />
It also can impact your body without you realizing what's happening.  Addiction is powerful, and sugar can help make you crave a certain food, without your mind saying &quot;hey, I want something sweet.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
