		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That theoretical limit is called the shockley-queisser limit. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shockley%E2%80%93Queisser_limit" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shockley%E2%80%93Queisser_limit</a></p>
<p>It has to do with the fact that photons that are absorbed by a semiconductor (silicon most commonly for solar cells) with a specific band gap.  For silicon that band gap is 1.1 electron volts. when light is shined on a solar cell, an electron is excited in the semiconductor material by the energy of the photon.  If that energy is high enough, the electron is excited to the conduction band, and it leaves behind a mobile, positively charged energy state called a hole.  Electrons and holes migrate to opposite electrodes in a solar cell to generate power based on their voltage difference.</p>
<p>Photons with energy lower than the band gap do not excite electrons enough to get over the band gap, and thus don't produce power, and photons with energy higher than the band gap will be absorbed, but relax back to the band gap energy before being transported to the electrode.  This relaxation process is complicated and has to do with the continuum of energy states accessible to electrons in the conduction band.  Those nearby energy states allow for nonradiative relaxation back to the band gap energy.</p>
<p>So, the sun shines with a certain spectrum, and only a fraction of the photons will be high enough energy to be absorbed productively, and those above that energy will relax back to the band gap as well.  </p>
<p>With this in mind, even a perfectly efficient cell at converting photons to electrons is limited in its overall efficiency because semiconductors have a specific band gap, and only a certain fraction of the incident radiation from the sun can supply that amount of energy.  The specific % limit will be different for semiconductors with different band gaps (CIGS, CdTe, perovskite, GaAs, organics etc), and would also theoretically be different if we had a different sun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shockley%E2%80%93Queisser_limit" target="_blank">Shockley-Queisser Limit</a>.</p>
<p>Caveat: This limit is for ideal single np-junction solar cells. </p>
<p>The main problem lies in the band gap (the energy difference between the conductive band and the valence band of the materials).</p>
<p>Very briefly, you face two main problems: </p>
<p>If the energy of the incoming photon is below the band gap, then the photon won't be absorbed by the solar cell. The photon has not enough energy to pump an electron from the valence to the conductive band. </p>
<p>If the incoming photon has an energy above the band gap you lose energy due to band edge relaxation. In short, while the photon will excite the electron, the excess energy above the band gap is converted to heat and therefore lost for our purpose. </p>
<p>This band gap problem alone imposes a maximal efficiency of about 48 % for sunlight. </p>
<p>Then there are some thermodynamical considerations, limited mobilities of the charge carriers, non-radiative recombinations, etc...  that cost you another 12 to 15 %. </p>
<p>Therefore, the highest possible efficiency value for a single pn-junction solar cell is about 33 %. </p>
<p>Theoretically, if you can produce a multilayer cell with several band gaps that cover the whole energy spectrum of sunlight (and therefore mitigate the band gap problem from above), you could go up to 77 % efficiency.</p>
<p>So, there still is room for gains.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
