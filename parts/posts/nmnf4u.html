		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If an employer ever tries to tell you that you are not allowed to discuss your wage with other employees:</p>
<p>Employers may not prohibit employees from discussing compensation according to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and an April 2014 Executive Order from President Obama.</p>
<p>Why do you think it is that people usually get paid more if they leave their job and find another one in the industry instead of staying at their current employer? The answer is simple. When you are looking for a job and applying at multiple companies, the companies must compete with each other and offer a competitive wage to attract good employees. If you have multiple job offers or are still in a job, the company who wants to hire you needs to beat those other offers in order to win your services. That's the essence of the free market.</p>
<p>However, once you become an employee of said company, the rules change. Companies highly discourage employees from discussing their salary and will go so far as to say it is not allowed or is highly frowned upon because they don't want to offer competitive wages to established employees. If you've been working for your company for several years, and they hire a new candidate who has a similar amount of experience to you into a similar role, there is a very strong likelihood that person will be paid more than you as the open job market dictates higher wages for reasons mentioned above. How would you feel though if you had been a loyal productive employee for 5 years and the guy they just hired makes 10 to 20 percent more than you? You'd think it was bullshit, and you'd either demand a raise or else leave.</p>
<p>That's why it is in the company's best interest to keep employees ignorant of what their coworkers make. It allows them to lowball existing employees when it comes to raises and pay increases and not offer a competitive wage like they would if the employees were in an open job market. </p>
<p>I have first hand experience of how this works. I started as a temp for a company and was hired on full time. Over the course of 3 years I got a couple promotions and then there was a corporate restructure where a bunch of people on my team got new titles, but it didn't come with a pay increase. However, there were a few employees who had that title prior to the restructure, and luckily one of them was willing to share what they made with me. They made about 25% more and had the same title as me and did the same job, with maybe 1 more year experience. </p>
<p>I went to my boss and told her I wanted a pay increase since my job title had changed and people who were previously in that role were making considerably more than those of us who recently had our title changed. She asked how I knew that, I told her that I asked, and she said that was highly inappropriate and I shouldn't be asking about other peoples' salaries. Needless to say I didn't get the raise, and I turned in my 2 week notice. </p>
<p>A month later I found a new job with a new company, similar title making 30% more than I did at my previous job. I had no idea I was so under-payed because my previous company did their best to keep us all in the dark, and it wasn't until I found out what someone else made in that role, that I knew I was being screwed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While it is true that employers greatly benefit from the practice of not sharing wages, I think the issue is employees not wanting to feel like they're being undervalued. The potential embarrassment of exposing to your coworkers that you've been taken, or being the one to tell them you're being paid more than them, can be daunting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because employees knowing each other's wages makes it impossible for employers to pay everyone badly while making them think they're making more than others. Thus, it's in their best interest to discourage it.</p>
<p>The stated reason is often that there will be discontent and strife due to envy when one worker is paid more than others, and others don't realize why. In my experience, this doesn't happen if everyone is paid well, but the people paid less may ask for a raise, which again, is what employers want to avoid.</p>
<p>Talking about your wages is protected by law in the US, and employers that try to ban or overtly discourage it can get in trouble with the NLRB.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
