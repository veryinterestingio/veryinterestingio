		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because of historical reseasons.</p>
<p>The first vitamins were classified as water or fat soluable with alphabet designation A, B, C, D, E, F, K, H, I, J, K, G etc</p>
<p>While analyzing Vitamin B then designated as Thiamin - Researchers Smith and Hendrick realised that they are dealing with two substances so we renamed vitamin B to Vitamin B1 and B2. Then similar divisions hapenned with other vitamin B's and some older designates like vitamin H or vitamin F were reclassified (H is biotin B7 and vitamin F are EFA's)  and the whole alphabet soup of vitamins went to hell and we are left with todays classificaiton.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wish I made it to this post a few hours sooner so I could flex that &quot;The research I did for my PhD all revolved around Vitamin B12&quot; muscle, but alas most of the key points have already been made. </p>
<p>The one thing I would like to point out (that's not entirely related to your question) is that Vitamin C and Vitamin B12 do not get along well. I always joke about them being mortal enemies, but C always wins the fight (based on amounts encountered) and you shouldn't supplement them at the same time. In fact, you should always use a dissolving sublingual tablet for your B12 (unless you are one of those unfortunate souls that needs injections, in which case you should look into methylcobalamin rather than the typical cyanocobalamin for increased activity and less frequent stabby stabby times) so that Haptocorrin can do its thing. Otherwise the bioaviability of the is about nill.</p>
<p>Anywaaaaaaaaaaays, if anyone is curious about the wonderful world of cobalamins, just ask away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Change in the structural complex at a molecular level in B-complex vitamins vs. Vit.C.
Whereas you find B-complexes in similar foods like cruciferous vegetables, you will only find Vit.C in the most acidic foods also because Vit.C itself is an acid i.e Ascorbic Acid.</p>
<p>Also, B-complex vitamins are all water soluble  but endophillic vitamins that readily mix in our body tissues and stay there for months and years and also function as very important co-factors (helpers) in our teensy tiny (but very important) bodily functions </p>
<p>Whereas, Vit -C is mostly an antioxidant. It kills harmful free-radicals generated from our daily metabolism in cells ( much like smoke coming out of cars). So here Vit.C functions like a catalytic converter, in purifying this smoke to some level.
Vit.C also helps in our wound healing and plays an important role in making our very fibers (ligaments and tendons) of our body.
Vit.C is a hydrophilic compound which means it loves water and you lose it as you lose/refiltrate your body water. This is why you need to replenish your body's Vit.C levels almost every few days.
Because of these very big and obvious differences in the functioning and mechanisms of these vitamins, they are paired separately.</p>
<p>Edit: Vit.B are water soluble</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
