		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Measure the temperature difference of the first 20 seconds of water. That can make a huge difference to taste. Ground water is often cooler than the extra house piping needed to reach the bathroom.</p>
<p>Aerators often found in bathroom taps to prevent splashing change the taste too (and get gross, they need removing &amp; cleaning). </p>
<p>Your kitchen faucet probably cost twice as much as the bathroom fitting, and is more likely to use ceramic valves and noble metals that don't impart a bad taste. As the most frequently used faucet it will hold fresher water too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In UK houses of the past, kitchen cold water came direct from the rising main, as we called it. Direct from the water supply coming in from the street. It is almost always running water, on the move, so it's fresh, not stagnant.</p>
<p>The bathroom  typically upstairs, would routinely be supplied from a cold water tank, typically in the attic space. This was water that had been standing around for ages, and was not regarded as drinking water. Fine for washing, bathing, flushing, but only suitable for spitting out once you'd brushed your teeth.</p>
<p>You may have a similar arrangement, without a description of your plumbing, nobody can say.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It shouldn't, unless your kitchen has a hard water faucet. </p>
<p>Not all kitchen sinks do, but some have an extra faucet on the side that only puts out cold hard water that hasn't gone through the water softener. That is what we used as drinking water as it tasted better than softened water and is apparently better for you because of the trace minerals as long as the well water doesn't have anything bad in it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
