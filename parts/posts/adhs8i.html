		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an invention by humans. </p>
<p>The Babylonians had a <a href="https://xjwfriends.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/babyloniannumbers.jpg?w=616" target="_blank">base 60 number system</a>, giving us 360 degrees in a circle. That number 60 was useful for counting days in a year (nearly 6x60), had enough factors to make most fractions they would need for practical purposes, and gave them a fairly good resolution for the kind of angular resolution they could produce or measure. That system survives today in geometry, and makes its way to us as the 60 second and minute intervals on a clock, being useful subdivisions for the face of a clock. As a tangent, clock <em>faces</em> originated around the 13th century or so, and were adapted from the sundial so that mechanical timekeepers would show the time in a familiar format. </p>
<p>The 24 hour day is slightly different and has muddier origins, being in use in some form all over the world for centuries and being recycled by culture after culture. Some authors point to the &quot;12 hours of the night&quot; of the ancient Egyptians as a possible origin. That was a set of 12 rituals that must be performed every night in order to guarantee the reincarnation of the sun-god in the morning. </p>
<p>As another tangent, since the length of the day and night changes throughout the year, summer 'night hours' were shorter than winter 'night hours,' since the night was made to be exactly divisible by twelve. Since sundials didn't work at night, they used 'clepsydra' which means 'waterclock.' They work by the same principle as an hourglass, just with water instead of sand. As a basin drains (or fills) the markings on the inside are used to track the water level, and thus time. So the next time you see an Egyptian vase at a museum, look closely on the inside. If you see sets of dots along the inside which all have their own spacing, you may be looking at a waterclock <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Clepsydres-sections-borchardt.jpg" target="_blank">marked with hours of different lengths for each month.</a></p>
<p>Anyway, virtually all old world civilizations had need for subdividing time and having practical daylight hours, so it was only a matter of time before they converged on a standard.</p>
<p>But there is one more number that shows up in the natural world, 29.5. That's the length of the lunar synodic period in days. With a simple visual aid in the sky, the moon phases give us 12 months (common etymological root with 'moon') which very nearly divide a year, and are thus the basis for almost all calendars on earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's possible to count to sixty on your fingers. The knuckles on the fingers of one hand, and using the 4 fingers and thumb on the other to touch each one as you count. </p>
<p>Also works pretty well to keep track of time in seconds since movement becomes muscle memory... You can keep track of seconds passed far more easily than you can by saying 1-1000 2-1000 etc... </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This is not just true of time; the ratios between many pre-metric units are divisible by 6.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
