This doesn't directly affect your question, since either way the expansion is just things in the universe getting further apart, but it's interesting to think that there might not even be &quot;places the universe hasn't reached&quot; at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best metaphor for this is to imagine the universe is 2D, not 3D, so it's basically on a plane, like stars are painted on a sheet of paper. Now imagine it's not a sheet of paper but the rubber surface of a ballon. Now imagine the ballon is inflating. More and more space (the surface) is created, it is expanding, but it's not like it is expanding &quot;over&quot; empty space: the space itself is expanding.</p>
<p>(This metaphor creates some misunderstanding as well, but works well for your question. Here is where it fails: it leads you to think you need some &quot;3D&quot; space outside/inside that 2D &quot;universe&quot;; you don't actually need that to explain our universe).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a little late, but I think I can add a good analogy as to how space can expand when it is infinite and there's nothing outside of it. Imagine a number line. You're sitting at 1, and I'm sitting at 2. Now, we &quot;expand&quot; our number line by multiplying every number by 2. So you're now sitting at 2, and I'm sitting at 4. The distance between us has increased, but we haven't &quot;moved.&quot; Space itself is expanding beneath us!</p>
<p>But as to what space is expanding &quot;into&quot; it's expanding into itself. Where did 5 go? It expanded to 10. Where did 100 go to? It went to 200. Where did 9,825,651,057,241 go to?  Well, you get the idea. Because there's no limit to infinity, you never &quot;run out&quot; of space to expand &quot;into&quot; and there's no edge that needs to push some boundry. Where things were, well, they're farther apart now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we say the universe is expanding what we mean is that space itself is expanding. And space itself is not expanding into more space but rather there is just more and more space in among all the other space. So the new places that the univers expands into is evenly distributed thorughout the universe and is brand new. The places that the universe expands into did not exist before. If you were to measure the distance between two far away galaxies very accuratly an then repeat the measurement some time later you will find that there are now more space between the galaxies even if they have not moved in relation to each other. There are just more space, more places that have popped into existance between the galaxies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
