		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While grooming seems to be the primary reason, there may be other reasons for the behavior.  One idea is that the rubbing helps regenerate an even magnetic field or <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/news/2015/07/electric-fields-signal-no-flies-zone.page#:~:text=Professor%20Newland%20explains%3A%20%E2%80%9CWhen%20a,as%20opposite%20charges%20were%20attracted.&amp;text=The%20effect%20on%20the%20wings,changes%20in%20their%20brain%20chemistry." target="_blank">remove static</a>, giving them improved flight abilities.  Another is that they are simply sensing the environment more, kinda how a dog sometimes licks its nose over and over while smelling something.  Each &quot;rub&quot; may give them a new whiff of the area.  These ideas are based on the fact that flies have been found to have built in magnetic sensors that act like <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/can-fruit-flies-see-magnetism" target="_blank">compasses</a> and evidence shows they may even <em>see</em> magnetism, even <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/2/1216" target="_blank">imprinting beneficial locations to offspring through genetic changes</a> that guide the fly where to go.  So keeping their sensors clean may still be only part of what's going on.</p>
<p>TLDR: Removing static and getting a better look at where they are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
