		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of it comes down to budget as well. Blizzard puts out crazy sexy looking cinematics and it would look great on the big screen but Blizzard has also said that if they were to make a full length feature film that looked as good as the cinematics that it would be the most expensive movie ever made. </p>
<p>At the end of the day the only reason companies don't make something is because it wouldn't make enough money to be worth it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Money. A beautiful cinematic trailer will get you to buy a game that is likely around $60 usd.</p>
<p>A beautiful full-fledged movie will get you to buy a ticket for $15 and cost more than the entire production cycle for a video game most of the time.</p>
<p>The goal of both products is to get your money not make you happy. When you already make video game money, it doesn't make financial sense to go and make movie money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The storytelling and writing is different. The writing in games works in games, but the same writing sucks for a movie because games are meant to be played, not watched. That's the main reason why games that are turned into movies suck, and why movies turned into games suck. </p>
<p>You wouldn't want to see a 90 minute movie of Master Chief shooting a bunch of flood creatures, but you would like to shoot flood creatures for 90 minutes. A cinematic should be used to transition from event to event and then go back to shooting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
