		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For example if someone ate a protein bar that is small in size but contains 20g of protein, 23g carbs, and let’s just say it has many other vitamins etc that you need daily. How does that compare to how your body reacts to eating a much larger amount of food but with less nutritional value and how does that affect how soon after I will be hungry again?</p>
<p>I know it seems obvious that the more you eat (no matter what it is) the longer it will take to feel hungry again, but I’m wondering if the size of the meal matters less than the nutritional contents of the meal in terms of hunger.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are actually two different ways to feel 'full'. There's one that makes you stop eating when you're sitting at the table and feel that you have had enough, and the other is basically the lack of hunger for a certain period after the meal.</p>
<p>In order to stop eating, you need both a certain amount of volume to stretch your stomach and a release of peptides. Peptides are released when your body is breaking down nutritious food, and that's something that you won't achieve by just drinking a lot of water for example, even though you have a full stomach.</p>
<p>That's also why drinking water together with a meal can make you feel full more quickly. A small protein bar on its own does have enough nutrients, but it won't fill your stomach.</p>
<p>Volume without nutrients = not feeling full</p>
<p>Nutrients without volume = not feeling full</p>
<p>Volume + nutrients = feeling full</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a combination of factors, but vitamins certainly don't exist in large enough quantities to have an effect.</p>
<p>Non-soluble/non-digestible fiber will really add bulk to a meal and make your belly feel full. It will also add to chewing time, which signals to your brain that it is getting fed. For example, if you ate 2 whole heads of iceberg lettuce, you would feel more full than eating a fun size snickers bar, but you wouldn't come close to the same number of calories.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are lots of factors that go into &quot;feeling full&quot;!
two of the main mechanisms involved rely on stomach distention (stretching) and Blood sugar!</p>
<p>a meal that has a good amount of nutritional value, and has a sufficient amount of calories in it to last X amount of time, will leave you feeling &quot;sated&quot; for much longer than the same size meal with less nutritional value, and this is one of many reasons that some people overeat.</p>
<p>so to answer your question succinctly, both are important, foods with lots of low-complex carbs such as sugars will make you feel fuller faster, as well as large portions! drinking can also contribute toward the feeling of fullness.</p>
<p>for a little bit more detail: The hypothalamus in your brain reacts to signals from sensory neurons near/within your stomach in response to the stomach lining stretching, this lowers levels of a neurotransmitter (neurohormone) known as Grehlin, other hormones such as amylin, or insulin (which changes depending on blood sugar) also signal to the hypothalamus to contribute towards a feeling of fullness.</p>
<p>Hope this helps :)</p>
<p>EDIT: to give some more specifics to your example, if you ate a nutritionally diverse meal, such as the japanese tend to (i.e eating untill you are not quite full, 80% seems to be the common number to go for ) will result in you eating a smaller portion size, but levels of Grehlin and other neurotransmitters and neurohormones tend to spike around 30-60 minutes after beginning to eat, this means taking your time with your meal can often lead to a more &quot;full&quot; feeling despite eating less.</p>
<p>You could instead eat a far larger meal in a smaller timeframe, until your stomach is distended to the point where you are physically full, or have eaten to the point where your stomach tells you to stop, but you will generally reach that level of &quot;satiety&quot; or &quot;fullness&quot; provided you have eaten enough food to trigger the raising of these hormones in your blood</p>
<p>The feeling of fullness is a combination of signals from your stomach, only one of which is directly related to the physical displacement of what you have eaten, i.e stomach distention. other neurohormones will remain high in response to higher nutrient levels in the blood, and can lead to the feeling of cravings, or a strong desire for say, salty foods, or protein rich foods.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
