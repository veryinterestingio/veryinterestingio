		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Analog or sound waves can be combined using a special math equation into a single sound wave that can be unmixed at the destination. It’s not like people speaking over each other, but more like how if you press multiple keys on a piano you can hear the combined sound and a maestro would know which notes are being pressed together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is multiplexing. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.elprocus.com/what-is-multiplexing-types-and-their-applications/" target="_blank">There are many ways to do it.</a> </p>
<p>In really simple terms, you can put multiple individual 'data streams' into the same signal by various means. You can give each data stream its own frequency or its own time slice on the channel etc and then reassemble them back into the individual streams on the receiving end.</p>
<p>A really simple eli5 example of multiplexing over fiber would be to give a different colour laser to each stream and shoot them down the fiber. The receiver could then use colour filters to single out the individual colours again to recover each stream.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In metro areas data is transmitted mainly via one of two different cable types: Fiber Optic and Coax.  Get back to these in second. </p>
<p>Interference in data transmissions come from Radio Frequency (RF). The biggest source of RF noise that causes inference is power or electricity.  One of the easiest ways and common to cut down on interference is to keep power lines away from data transmission lines. This is why if there are power poles in an area then the data lines are buried. Or the other way around if there are telephones poles then the power lines are buried. </p>
<p>However keeping power lines away from data lines is not always possible. So that is where the two different cable types come into play and they treat interference completely differently. </p>
<p>Coax is older technology and has been around for awhile. This is the same cable type that brought TV and Cable to the home since the 1960’s. Coax addresses interference basically through a ton of shielding wrapped around the central core cable. If you ever cut into a coax cable. There is a central copper wire surrounded by thick plastic and then a metal jacket and then more plastic. It is only the central copper wire that carries data. The plastic and metal surrounding the copper wire protect the copper wire.  There are several grades of Coax some with more metal and plastic protection that limit interference even more. Coax is cheap and easy to produce and the transmission of tried and technology. </p>
<p>Fiber is newer technology and is based on the transmission of light (lasers). Great thing about Fiber is that the light is virtually immune to RF interference because light is different then radio frequency. Power lines literally do not change the direction of light therefore you can for the most part ignore interference when it comes to fiber lines. </p>
<p>So why not do everything over fiber?  Well for the most part that is the direction data transmission is going. Fiber used to be very expensive both in the cabling and the equipment needed to use fiber. It has only been in the last decade or so that fiber has become cheap enough to be used everywhere. Coax has been around for a long time and there is a lot of it. It will take time to replace the Coax with Fiber. This still may not happen completely because Coax technology is still being improved. </p>
<p>This plays into the getting fiber to the home or getting cable to the home. </p>
<p>Probably still way more then an ELI5, but what I could come up with. RF is hard to explain. Think of it as static on a radio station. If there is too much static then you can’t hear the music. Electricity is the main source of this static when it comes to data transmission.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I guess it depends on what sort of setup you are talking about. I am a telecommunications engineer in the UK.
How things are fed here is you get dial tone from the exchange in a pair of wires that are twisted together. The twists help resist any interference from other circuits. </p>
<p>These cables generally go to a street cabinet which, again generally speaking, will be close to your house.  </p>
<p>At the green cabinet there is a DSLAM which is a box that had a fibre connection in it that your phone line runs through fibre ports which then when it comes out it has your dial tone and broadband service on it.  </p>
<p>This is then on a pair of wires to your house via different connections. In your house you should have a micro filter which is really a splitter that splits the different frequencies the one you can hear for the phone and one that's beyond your hearing range for broadband.<br />
I have worked on lines that have a lot of cable above ground on poles and when  using my test phone I can hear the radio on the line. But this can be filtered out by phone sockets. </p>
<p>TLDR. Basically from the exchange you have one pair of wires all they way to your house.
Having them twisted makes a big difference in reducing any interference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not a matter of not having interference, it's a matter of keeping the level of interference low enough that the signal can be recovered at the other end. A more technical term would be &quot;Signal to Noise Ratio&quot; SNR.  Here are a few techniques you can use to work around noise:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>shielding</strong>. co-ax cables and shielded cables use a foil or mesh layer surrounding the signal wire. Outside electromagnetic interference is absorbed by the shield and never reaches the signal wires on the inside. It's the same principle as a <em>Faraday Cage</em>, just extended over the whole length of a wire. Cable TV typically comes over a co-ax wire.</li>
<li><strong>twisted pairs</strong>. Take two wires and twist them together, so that any electro-magnetic interference affects both wires equally. Send your signal down one wire. At the receiver, you subtract the value of the &quot;dummy&quot; wire from the signal wire, giving you a clean signal again. Telephone and ethernet cables use twisted pairs (and wires for very long distances also have shielding around the twisted pairs).</li>
<li><strong>repeating</strong>. After fixed distances, receive the signal into a device, and re-transmit the signal again with more power and no noise. Since SNR is a function of distance in the wire, keeping your wires short and repeating the signal can help avoid problems.</li>
<li><strong>modulation</strong>. There are three basic modulation schemes you can use to transmit a signal over a wire: amplitude, frequence and phase. The first two are used by AM and FM radio, respectively. AM can be susceptible to noise while FM  is more resistant (which is part of the reason why music stations tend to use FM while talk stations tend to use AM, and why AM radio quality decreased gradually with distance from the antenna while FM tends to either be perfect or static with nothing in between).</li>
</ol>
<p>Fiber optic cables don't have to worry so much about electromagnetic interference. Glass fibers have multiple layers which reflect light back into the center of the fiber, and then are surrounded by shielding to keep external light out. You can get longer distances with fiber optics than you can with most metal wires, but you still need repeaters to keep the light intensity high.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
