		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, whether or not the signal gets sent from your brain to the limb.  Interestingly, a lot of the brain activity in the brain is similar when we think about something as when we do it.  Might seem kinda obvious, but it goes deeper than you think.  If you scan a musician's brain when they actively listen to music, it will light up in a similar way as when they are <em>playing</em> the music.  This is different from someone who doesn't play an instrument listening to it.  Or when you listen to someone speaking, part of your understanding comes from imagining yourself making those sounds, and working out what words you'd be saying if you did that.  This is why you see some people mouthing along as they listen to someone speaking.</p>
<p>Edit: thanks, kind strangers.  Hopefully you meant to actually press the award button, rather than just <em>thinking</em> about it...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Relatively recently, scientists discovered there is a part of your brain (mirror neurons) that is active both when you move, and when you see someone else move.</p>
<p>Most of the ideas about what these neurons do involve thinking about other people, but I think there are some that just involve thinking generally, so there are motor neurons that you use to perform an action (consciously) and mirror neurons that are involved in thinking about it, whether or not you are performing it.</p>
<p>And, of course, there are plenty of motions that happen that we only are aware of as/after they happen, dimly or not at all.</p>
<p>Edit: like other people have pointed out, there is a lot of debate around this topic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain is partitioned functionally into lobes. Each lobe is responsible for a specific function with some overlap in areas known as association cortex that integrates several senses/pieces of input together. An example would be cooking bacon... one part processes the smell, another the taste, one the sight, one for the sound and a last one for the sensation of it (in your hands and mouth). When all integrated together in this association area, this creates your perception of &quot;bacon&quot;. The area of your brain that is responsible for movement of your limbs is the frontal lobe. Simplified, there are two key areas in your brain for movement within the frontal lobe: the premotor cortex/gyrus (gyrus = raised bumpy areas you see on the outside of the brain) and the primary motor cortex/gyrus. The premotor cortex plans out movements which is why you can &quot;think&quot; of moving before you do. Your premotor cortex talks with your motor cortex when it has definitively decided on enacting the movement. There are some additional detours for enacting movement too. These two areas of the frontal lobe talk with the Basal Ganglia (collection of neurons deep to the outside area you see when looking at a brain) which suppresses any excess movement that accidentally got signaled while planning to make movement crisp/seamless and the Cerebellum which aids in this effort but is more important for motor learning/correction. The cerebellum looks at the movement that your body produced vs what was intended (such as missing a basketball shot) and corrects it, which is why practicing physical activities hones your skills. On the way down the spinal cord to your muscles, everything from the brain (frontal lobe) also has to pass through the thalamus (kind of like a train station) which can also prevent any talking from the brain to the body (this mechanism is why when you sleep and dream, you don't flail about from thinking about moving)</p>
<p>*edited to add TLDR; 1 area of brain plans movement and talks to area of brain that initiates movement but because areas are different, thought =/= movement. Also ancillary brain areas exist to make sure movement comes out perfect</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not at all obvious that the thought prompts the movement. </p>
<p>It could be that the movement (or in your case non-movement) comes before the thought. The <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwid8cnlr8nuAhUaHM0KHXpUACIQFjALegQIARAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.informationphilosopher.com%2Ffreedom%2Flibet_experiments.html&amp;usg=AOvVaw1_ceL--bHM1V0lalCRLGzd" target="_blank">1983 Libet experiments</a> certainly suggested that. Perhaps our brains are simply creating narratives for what has happened. Would explain a lot about about human nature if that were the case.</p>
<p>I know those experiments have been criticized. So the question of what's really happening is still open. This does, however, open up a counterintuitive (even mind-blowing for some) way of looking at it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
