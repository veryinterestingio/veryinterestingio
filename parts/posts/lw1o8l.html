		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blue is a soothing color, and it's also very contrasting to the color red (blood, internal organs).  Apparently scrubs changed from white to blue/teal/green at some time in the early 1900's.  <a href="https://www.livescience.com/32450-why-do-doctors-wear-green-or-blue-scrubs-.html" target="_blank">Article</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nobody has written the actual answer so far! Yes we have now built up an association between blue/green and medicine via pure exposure, but why did blue/green become so pervasive in healthcare? Its much more practical than you might think.</p>
<p>When you continue to expose your eyes to one colour, your photoreceptors become overstimulated, and they lose sensitivity. The physical photopigment chemicals undergo &quot;bleaching&quot; (ELI5 they become depleted/unavailable to function).</p>
<p>If you stare at red for too long, you actually lose physical capability of seeing detail in red things. This is obviously not ideal for surgery. This photoreceptor sensitivity is also the biochemical mechanism that causes <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/7/30/9075331/optical-illusion" target="_blank">color-inverted afterimage illusions!</a> (Which are also not helpful during surgery.)</p>
<p>Blue/green are the other colours for which our eyes have cones, and so time spent looking at blue and green material gives our red cones a rest and gives our eyes time to regenerate the pigments for sensing red again. It is therefore an advantage to maximise the amount of blue/green material to ensure a surgeon's red-sensing capability is as optimal as possible.</p>
<p>This is the reason why healthcare started turning to blue/green.</p>
<p>Once the switch was made, the growing association in people's minds plus the simple realities of economies of scale meant you'd produce &amp; sell healthcare equipment in blue/green even if you weren't supplying for surgery / anything bloody.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have a history, but at this point it's an industry standard, basically. That shade of blue now signals &quot;sterile&quot; in all ORs and procedure rooms around the US (maybe abroad, but I can't speak to that). So when you see drapes and material in that color you know you shouldn't touch it without the right equipment.</p>
<p>I'd imagine scrubs are the same color for similarity and association, but that's far from universally true. Rush in Chicago has pink scrubs for their surgery department. Often nurses have personal scrubs they like to wear. I've worked at hospitals that have light green, dark green, dark blue, and light blue scrubs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
