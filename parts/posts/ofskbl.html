		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gatling guns had rotating barrels because it handled loading, ejecting the cartridge, and reloading the barrel. The innovation of ejecting the cartridge using exhaust gas hadn't been developed yet. The Gatling gun was faster than a bolt-action gun.</p>
<p>More modern miniguns have multiple barrels to reduce overheating. Each barrel only fires a fraction of the shots, meaning you can fire more rounds before overheating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR - Single barrel shoot fast, multiple spinning barrel shoot crazy fast (10x faster)</p>
<p>Gating guns and rotary cannons are distinctly different from machine guns</p>
<p>Your <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Browning_M2HB_Normandy.jpg/1280px-Browning_M2HB_Normandy.jpg" target="_blank">standard machine gun</a> has a single barrel, a single breach, and does not spin.</p>
<p>Gatling guns spin so they can pull off stupid high rates of fire.  A 6 barreled weapon like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M134_Minigun" target="_blank">M134 Minigun</a> has basically 6 of everything - barrel, breach, and bolt.  This duplication means that one barrel can be firing while a couple others are unloading and others are loading the next round and preparing to fire.  Instead of having to make one gun that can fire, reload, and fire again extremely quickly ($$$), the duplication allows for each barrel to fire/reload much slower letting things be a bit cheaper and run a lot cooler.  The reduced barrel temperature is more important for big guns like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M61_Vulcan" target="_blank">the 20mm M61 Vulcan</a> shooting 6000 rounds per minute</p>
<p>There are other spinning weapons like Revolver cannons which have a single barrel but duplicate the breach assembly so one round can be firing while others are loading/unloading.  They can't shoot as fast as a Rotary Cannon but they're a lot lighter since they don't have big spinning barrels.  They're less common because standard style completely non-spinning weapons are almost as good and easier to work with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>2 reason:</p>
<p>1: what everyone else says. multi barrels = multi loading, letting you load much much faster than single barrel, as you need to clear the chamber before firing again. in multi barrel design you dont need to immediately clear it, just cycle to the next and fire.</p>
<ol>
<li>when you have 1 barrel, all your bullets are going to come out of there. when you are shooting the amount of lead a vulcan is, at the insane rof of 6k+ rounds per min, you are going to destroy/warp the barrel regardless of what alloy you use. but when you have 6 barrels. instead of shooting 24,000 rounds down 1 barrel, you are splitting it to 4,000 round per barrel. greatly prolonging the life expectancy of the gun. Because unlike games, changing the barrel is a pretty tedious task.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In simplest terms, firing at extremely high rates of speed creates a tremendous amount of heat. Firing that many rounds through one single barrel would likely Heat it to the point of very likely melt or distort the metal. By using multiple barrels, that distributes the heat over a wider range and prolong the life of the weapon. Second, it's a simplified mechanism that allows the gun to operate at a high rate of fire while at the same time reducing extreme movement of the firing mechanism that would otherwise be required.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
