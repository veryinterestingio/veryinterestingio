		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The science seems clear that some people are night owls and some are morning larks. This is a natural rhythm that while it can be adjusted, is often done to the detriment of the individual. </p>
<p>A night owl no longer having commitments to wake up for at the arbitrary time of 8am will default, if allowed, to a more natural sleep and wake pattern. I say this as someone who works with an early morning wake up time but is about to fall asleep at 5:22 am local time. Night owls often see health implications by being forced to adapt to a morning lark schedule. </p>
<p>People do seem to just be one way or the other however it also adjusts with age. Older people tend to sleep less hours and tend to drift closer to that of a morning lark for instance. </p>
<p>There is no reason to think that people in the past were any different however without modern lighting it was likely harder to be awake and productive at night.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People can be divided in three natural groups. Morning birds, night owls and group in the middle. The division is roughly 25% for groups of early and late wakers and 50% for the people in between.</p>
<p>This seems to be a natural inborn adjustment. There was a study of <del>Amazonian</del> African tribe where for 20 days all tribe members were constantly monitored. Through out that period there were just few minutes when all tribe members were asleep. So thanks to that naturally spread sleeping hours someone was always awake and could be on guard for the entire tribe.</p>
<p>So most likely when you stopped to force yourself to wake up outside of your natural hours, your organism reverted to it's natural rhythm. At the same time some people who were naturally morning birds just kept their physiological rhythm.</p>
<p>EDIT: I found mentioned study: <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2017.0967" target="_blank"><a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2017.0967" target="_blank">https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2017.0967</a></a></p>
<p>It was 18 minutes in total during 20 days when everyone was asleep and the tribe was Hadza from Tanzania so I wrongly remembered they were from Amazon and fixed that in original post.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
