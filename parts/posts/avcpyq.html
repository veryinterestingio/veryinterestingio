		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually very interesting topic, whilst a good number are just insults, the majority of English language swear words are Germanic origin words as opposed to Latin origin words; when the french-speaking Normans conquered England, they would include more french words when they spoke, whereas the Anglo-Saxons, which made up the majority of English population, had all been including German origin words. Wealthy people (both Norman and otherwise) wished to seem more Norman in order to get further ahead in life, so shunned German origin words; eventually this evolves into &quot;only a poor person says that&quot; meaning a proper person looking to forward there standing in society would never sound so common, then just flat out rude as people continued to emulate the &quot;proper people&quot;. Example: cunt is a germanic origin word for vagina, and it's predecessor can be found in 13th century poetry, yet became considered slang, then by the nineteenth century it had the same vulgarity as it does now.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>TLDR: Swear words tend to become swear words because poor people used to say them.</p>
<p>Edit: I love that my most upvoted comment is explaining the origin of the word cunt. I'm a true fucking Scotsman</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apparently apes have swear words too. They are cries of alarm. Swearing when something bad happens is a good social behavior because it alerts others in your tribe to danger. A good swear word tends to be a short one syllable word.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Swearing is so useful that it seems to be hard-wired into a circuit in our brains. This is the mal-functioning circuit involved in tourette's syndrome.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Obviously as society has gotten more complex so has swearing behavior. But I think the above is a good starting point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
