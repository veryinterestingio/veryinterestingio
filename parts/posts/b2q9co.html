My wife hates cobwebs, so removes its newly spun web every few days, but the little fella always spins another. I can never see anything on the web, and I doubt it could hold a fly, even if one flew into it. But Incy is still there, spinning away. So what is it eating and how is it catching it, if not on the web?</p></div></div>

As for why that spider is still there and surviving despite you never seeing bug carcasses it is because it is drinking the water left behind. Incy can survive a long time on just water. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
