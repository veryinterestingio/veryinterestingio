<p>This will depend a lot on where you are. As an example, lets take a look at a super simplified geologic map (a type of map that shows the type/age or rocks at the surface in an area) of the <a href="http://www.codex99.com/cartography/images/national/geology_1970_lg.jpg" target="_blank">USA</a>. The colors here are keyed to age (and rock type for some), so if you broke off a piece of bedrock in South Dakota (which is mostly green colored on this map), then there's a reasonable chance it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous" target="_blank">Cretaceous in age (so between 145-65 million years old, or Ma)</a>, but if you broke off a piece of bedrock in Maine, chances are it might be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silurian" target="_blank">Silurian (443-419 Ma)</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devonian" target="_blank">Devonian (419-358 Ma) </a>. But even then, it will depend a lot on location, e.g. in South Dakota if you picked up a rock from within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_River" target="_blank">Missouri River</a>, then it could be the age of any rocks within the area upstream of the river as rocks are eroded and transported by rivers. Similarly, in Maine, if you picked up a rock from a glacial deposit left after the retreat of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurentide_Ice_Sheet" target="_blank">Laurentide ice sheet</a> at the end of the last glacial maximum, it could be a rock transported from somewhere in Canada (and likely be much older, as much of the bedrock in Canada is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precambrian" target="_blank">Precambrian</a>). Finally, as an extreme example, if you went to Hawaii and to some areas that had recent lava flows in 2018 and chipped off a piece of that bedrock, the rock would be 2 years old and more generally, if you were on the big island of Hawaii, no rock would be much more than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauna_Loa#Geology" target="_blank">1 Ma</a>. <strong>In short,</strong> there is no unique answer and it will depend on where you are and what rock you're picking up, i.e. is it from the local bedrock or is it in a deposit that includes rocks moved by something like a river or a glacier.</p>

<p>Rounded rocks are indicative of transport, usually by water. Let's imagine the life of a rock. It starts out as intact bedrock that may fracture as it is pushed towards the surface. These fractures will allow for a piece of rock to break off, forming what we would call a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clastic_rock" target="_blank">clast</a>, i.e. a piece of loose rock, but this clast will be very angular. Eventually, this clast will move down hill via a variety of processes (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downhill_creep" target="_blank">soil creep</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_wasting" target="_blank">mass wasting</a>) and reach a river. It will still likely be pretty angular, but depending on how it moved down hill, some of the sharpest edges may have been broken off (forming smaller clasts, but also progressively softening the original form of the clast we're tracking). Once in the river, the clast will be transported down stream where this clast will be rolled or bounced along the bed of the river and bump into other clasts. This process will progressively round the rocks as sharp edges are preferentially broken off, but will also progressively decrease the size of the clasts as you move down stream. As for the timescales, this can vary a lot, but generally, we consider sediment transport times short compared to other timescales in geology (i.e. 100s to 100,000s of years), but as with the first answer, it really depends on the specific location/river system.</p>
<p>Finally, a point of clarification. When we talk about the age of a rock (whether it's intact bedrock or a loose clast) we mean the time at which the rock became rock (e.g. crystallized from a magma, or was deposited as sediment and lithified into rock). So if a 100 Ma piece of bedrock breaks off and gets rounded while being transported in a river and you pick it up, it's still a 100 Ma rock, i.e. the erosional process doesn't reset the age. Now, if this 100 Ma clast is deposited and formed into a sedimentary rock, we can talk about the age of the sedimentary rock (which will be younger than any of the clasts that make it up) but also the ages of the original clasts that make up this new sedimentary rock.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to the answer regarding <strong>crustal</strong> rocks, I thought you might find <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/2008_age_of_oceans_plates.jpg" target="_blank">this link</a> interesting. The earth is covered by some 70% ocean, and under most of that is Oceanic Crust, made up of geologically recent rocks. </p>
<p>An eyeballed average is around 60 million years for Oceanic crust.</p>
<p>Of course, continental crust has a much larger range of ages, stretching far back in time. Australia has a wide range of ages, as you can see <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Ausgeolbasic.jpg" target="_blank">here</a> (note the numbers are <em>millions</em> of years), mostly in the past billion years - however, there are large areas that are 2.5 billion years old.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The top comment currently sums it up very well. I would just also like the add, a phrase commonly uttered among geologists is &quot;The older the rock, the greater the chance it no longer exists.&quot; This is because on Earth most rocks eventually get weathered, eroded, or subductured beneath the crust and melted. This is why some places like Australia are so important to paleontological studies of early life on Earth, since the regional geology there caused massive rock uplift that let rocks as old as 3.5 billion years old still be preserved today. Along with evidence of microbial life, but this is still controversial depending among the scientific community.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the youngest, an igneous rock can be several hours old if magma just solidified. Sedimentary rocks and metamorphic rocks, on the other hand, are formed by processes that take several million years, so they youngest they can be is several million years old. As far as the oldest rocks, they are 3.8 billion years old I believe, with individual crystals being even older.  Rock ages will vary widely based on where you're located. Rocks near the center of a continent (called a craton), will be billions of years old, with rocks generally (but not always) getting younger as you get closer to the edges of the continent. This is because continents started as small volcanic island chains billions of years ago, and slowly accreted new land. Seafloor rocks are never older than 200 million years, since they are constantly being subducted and destroyed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
