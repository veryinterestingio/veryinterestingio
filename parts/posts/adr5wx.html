Holes big enough to put an arm in and rummage around in the cows stomach. I just feel like if it were done to humans there would be physical and mental damage, but these dudes just don't seem bothered at all. Is it something to do with the hide of cows or wHatbRo?</p></div></div>

<p>For the cows, they don't feel any pain other than normal post-op pain while the incision heals. The lining of a stomach doesn't really have the same type of pain receptors as what we have in our skin (just imagine how much your stomach would hurt all the time considering it has a pH of 2) so they don't really &quot;feel&quot; you exploring, and the rumen is massive and usually filled with a LOT of grass so I imagine they don't notice too much.</p>
<p>ETA: The stomach does have pain receptors, they are just very different than what we have in our skin so they don't respond to the same things and you can't really &quot;feel&quot; the inside of your organs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is called a fistula! They often do this in cows for research purposes or to use the cow's rumen juice to replenish the rumen flora (bugs) in another sick ruminant (transfaunation).  It is like any surgery, with risks of infections and complications, but the cows can live a long and apparently happy life once it is all healed up. I guess you could compare it to earings or port-a-caths, where the pain is usually gone onces everything heals. Basically, what they do is cut a circular hole where the ribs end (the paralumbar fossa), suture the rumen to the body wall, let it heal, and then cut a hole in the rumen and put in the plastic piece you often see in these cows.  Here is a video of what it looks like: <a href="https://youtu.be/-ban6fHArBU" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/-ban6fHArBU</a> </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
