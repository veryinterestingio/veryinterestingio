		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For ELI5 purposes, you can think of an atom as being made up of three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Protons, which have a positive charge and have a relative mass of 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neutrons, which have no charge and have a relative mass of 1.</p>
</li>
<li>Electrons, which are negatively charged and have a relative mass of basically zero. (It's actually 1/1836, but for our purposes we can say it's negligible.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The protons and the neutrons chill out together not really doing much in the centre of the atom -- what we call the nucleus -- and the electrons exist in variously shaped clouds floating around the nucleus. You can think of them as buckets, if that helps; more electrons will always, <em>always</em> fill up these buckets in a particular order, which give them predictable properties. (We call these buckets 'orbitals'.)</p>
<p>So, how do you put together an atom? Well, the golden rule is that for it to be an atom, it has to have a neutral charge. Given that there are only three particles to choose from, and only two of them have a charge -- +1 for every proton, and -1 for every electron -- that means you have to have the same number of protons and electrons. Stick an electron to a proton, and you have an atom of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_atom" target="_blank">hydrogen</a>. (You might remember <a href="https://img.purch.com/o/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uZXdzYXJhbWEuY29tL2ltYWdlcy9pLzAwMC8yMzcvODYyL2kwMi9JTUdfMTI0NC5qcGc=" target="_blank">Doctor Manhattan</a> in <em>Watchmen</em> burning <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Dr_Manhattan_symbol.svg/550px-Dr_Manhattan_symbol.svg.png" target="_blank">a symbol</a> onto his forehead; that's a representation of a hydrogen atom, with the proton at the center and one electron at the outside.) Adding a new proton, then, means that you have to add a new electron to keep things balanced -- and that's why elements act differently.</p>
<p>Remember earlier, when I said that electrons fill up those orbitals in a particular order? Well, only the ones on the very outside can interact with other atoms. (It's not exactly a <em>correct</em> model, but for ELI5 purposes you can think of these as being like the layers of an onion; that's how they're often taught, especially at lower levels. We're only really interested in what the outer layer is doing at any given time.) When it comes to reacting with other elements, each layer of an atom has a specific number of electrons that it wants to have in it -- two electrons in Layer 1, closest to the nucleus, and eight electrons for every subsequent layer. We call the number of electrons in this outer shell the <em>valence</em> of the atom. (It's <em>slightly</em> more complicated than this, but for the most part it holds up.) When these electron shells are full, the element is very unreactive.</p>
<p>But that's OK! Atoms are perfectly happy to share electrons in order to get these shells full. Think back to the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Dr_Manhattan_symbol.svg/550px-Dr_Manhattan_symbol.svg.png" target="_blank">symbol for hydrogen from earlier</a>. You have one electron in a shell that really wants two, and so two hydrogen atoms come together to make one molecule of hydrogen, sharing their electrons so <a href="https://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large-5/bond-formation-in-hydrogen-molecule-animate4comscience-photo-libary.jpg" target="_blank">they both have two in their outer shell</a>. This is called a <em>covalent bond</em>. When you talk about a chemical bond, you're <em>usually</em> talking about this.</p>
<p>When a chemical reaction takes place, it does so by breaking and forming these bonds. Everything from using the energy in the food you eat, to breathing, to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4pQz3TC0Jo" target="_blank">dropping alkali metals in water</a>, to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnoG1XdRM4M" target="_blank">thermite</a>... it all depends on how many (and which type) of these bonds form, which is directly related to how many electrons you have -- which is, as we've seen, directly related to how many protons you have. (Sidenote: you'll sometimes hear about the 'noble gases' -- helium, argon, neon and so forth -- and how they don't react; that's why they're called the <em>noble</em> gases, after all. The reason for this is that their outer electron shells are full, so they can happily exist on their own without any interaction with other elements. It's for this reason that argon is used in welding, because the high temperatures involved would make the metal you're welding react with other gases, such as the oxygen in the air, which you <em>do not want</em>.)</p>
<p>The number of electrons in an outer shell can also change the <em>shape</em> of the molecule. It's easy to think about electrons orbiting the nucleus in rings, like a solar system where <a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/57a9d8dcd482e9bbf179f445/57a9f8313e00be4bc05a45e8/59e8a31fdc2b4a633cf51511/1508480523194/Solar+System+Plane.jpg" target="_blank">everything is on a flat plane and the nucleus is the sun in the centre</a>, but that's not how it is; atoms exist in 3D space, with the electrons buzzing around in <a href="https://d2jmvrsizmvf4x.cloudfront.net/4rmrV3aTSGng4R7AAjMw_K5EcA.jpg" target="_blank">weird shapes</a>. It's because of these shapes -- and the negative charge of these electrons pushing atoms out of the way, that molecules have the shape they do. <a href="https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/csz/news/800/2018/missinglinkf.jpg" target="_blank">Ammonia</a>, for example, is a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Ammonia-dimensions-from-Greenwood%26Earnshaw-2D.png" target="_blank">pyramid shape</a>; water isn't a straight line, but has <a href="https://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large/1-water-molecule-friedrich-saurer.jpg" target="_blank">a little kink in it</a>. This is <em>also</em> very important, because it means that the charge isn't equally distributed all around the molecule. (In the case of water, even though there's a net neutral charge, the mass of the oxygen and the positive charge of its eight protons pulls the electrons ever-so-slightly away from the poor hydrogens, with their one proton each; this greedy oxygen, then, has a slightly negative charge at its end, while the two hydrogen atoms have a slightly positive charge.) We call molecules that display these properties <em>polar</em>, and it changes how they interact in a lot of ways. If you've ever wondered why ice crystals form such regular structures, or why water drips down the side of a glass when you try and pour it slowly, that's why: interactions between the slightly-charged parts of different water molecules. All of that depends on the electron structure, which depends on the number of electrons, which depends on -- you guessed it -- the number of protons.</p>
<p>Finally, there's one more way that protons can change an element's properties -- one that <em>doesn't</em> include electrons. Remember how earlier we were talking about the relative mass of an element -- that neutrons and protons have a mass of 1, and the mass of an electron is barely there? Well, that mass makes a difference. Adding protons makes things heavier, which is why -- along with the extra neutrons -- that hydrogen (with one proton in its nucleus) is lighter than gold (with 79 protons and 118 neutrons in its nucleus). Quite aside from the expense, this is why trying to get an zeppelin to fly by filling it with gold is a <em>very bad idea</em> -- although in fairness, it would be less reactive and therefore less flammable, so... call it a draw?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short version for anyone who doesn't want to read a big long scary wall of text involves these 3 things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A single proton changes the charge of an atom, the charge and subsequent arrangement of these atoms and their electrons is what controls what they are and how they work aka what element they are</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are &quot;billion-billions&quot; of atoms in most things, so if one proton is removed from an atom, something comprised of that many copies of the same atom are going to be drastically different. </p>
</li>
<li>This is because, since everything is made of atoms, everything is essentially several quintillion trillion little magnets and their shape controls everything about what the &quot;big picture&quot; item is and does.</li>
