<p>There's also the feeling of blocking everything else out and being surrounded by just the music.</p>
<p>And for some people it might be because they want others to hear how awesome their taste in music is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>We are good at detecting how intense something is when we sense it. We can see which light is brighter and hear which sound is louder. More intense things affect us more. Music is more likely to make an impact on you if it is louder because the signals that your ears are sending to your brain are more intense. So your body is going to react more. If that music is pleasing to you, it will be more pleasing to you if it's louder, as long as it isn't so loud that it might cause harm to your ear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s probably not any one specific reason and others have spelled out some pretty good ones in here but there’s another that hasn’t been touched on. </p>
<p>Our hearing becomes more sensitive to treble and bass as volume increases, so louder music will sound “better.” Obviously that’s subjective but most people like or are used to a little extra bass and treble generally speaking. </p>
<p>More info beyond an ELI5 level on human hearing response and volume is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-loudness_contour" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mixing engineer here (sort of). It's a bit of a psychological phenomenon that we perceive things that are louder to sound better. It's one of the reasons there has been a &quot;loudness war&quot; in music production for the last few decades - listeners tend to enjoy, and therefore remember - loud mixes better than quiet mixes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd say there are a couple different possible answers to this.</p>
<ol>
<li>When you like a specific song you are more likely to what to hear it more clearly in the past this desire has been fulfilled by turning the music up. Essentially you've been conditioned to turn up the music in return for a pleasurable experience, from a time where the sound wasn't good. </li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Music tends to be an escape from whatever situation a person is in, the louder the music the further distanced they are from whatever reality they are in. Even if you can already hear the music perfectly fine turning the volume up creates the illusion that you are going deeper down the rabbit hole so to speak. The louder it is the more immersed you feel you are in the experience. </li>
</ol>
<p>My background is in psychology, so I'm not sure if there are other reasons for this. There very well could be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
