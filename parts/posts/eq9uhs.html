		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Concrete 100% submerged is significantly less susceptible to deterioration than concrete that goes through wet/dry cycles which would be in shallower depths. For shallow depth repair work, you can install temporary cofferdams around the work area to dewater the immediate area to complete the required work. Also divers can do many repairs, albeit slower/costlier in general.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is lots of work that can be done under water. For more serious work you'd set up a barrier around the work area, then pump out the water, perform the work, then fill it back up and remove the barrier.</p>
<p>For something like a dam you can drain the water if needed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modern day dams have sensors and a team of people who ensure everything is working correctly.
Smaller dams are checked and maintained by third party companies like “Damwatch” who specialise in this very task.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are hydrophobic, crystalline additives that can be added to the concrete mix that fills the voids and strengths the concrete. There are also coatings and cementitious grouts that can be applied underwater for spot repairs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
