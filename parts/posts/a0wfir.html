<p>Germany benefits from a stable European Union and they're willing to dedicate resources to ensure that. A stable EU will see better growth and avoid war which is good for everyone in the long run, they've already seen enough</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Germany is in many ways the biggest beneficiary of the EU: It's a manufacturing-heavy export economy, so having free trade in the region is hugely helpful to the country's economic success. Also, ensuring the health of the countries around you makes sure they stay stable and full of prosperous customers/healthy suppliers.</p>
<p>The result is that the German economy generates more value/wealth, and the German government accumulates more tax revenue - significantly more than it pays into the EU.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because Germany is a country that manufactures things and sells it to other European countries.  So while they might pay more in dues, they gain access to many customers for German businesses.  Those businesses sell things and make money and pay employees who then pay taxes in Germany. </p>
<p>Basically, there's benefit to being in the EU more than just simple money transferred to or from your country.  Access to the common market, the common currency and common regulatory framework are all incredibly valuable for an exporting country like Germany. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Positive externalities. They're directly forking over more money, but the benefits for their economy overall dwarf the costs to the government. Completely free trade across an entire continent, the removal of customs checks, unified product standards, and a single framework for overarching law mean that Germany can take advantage of the strengths of every other economy in the EU, and her citizens can operate freely and bring their knowledge back from most of the world. An EU passport is one of the most powerful documents in the world, rivaling a US passport, which means German citizens get access to the strengths of practically every other country in the world as well.</p>
<p>All of these benefits are impossible to put a Euro value on, but they are so huge that paying more in is absolutely worth it. They support the other economies in the region, and this investment pays back many times over in invisible, but very real, ways.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
