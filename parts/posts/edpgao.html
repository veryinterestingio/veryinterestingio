		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's just a smothering effect that has a high burning temp so it won't catch fire as easily. We used to do this when I worked at a red robin, a burger place for those who don't know, and the char grill flared up, usually only happened on really busy nights when like 40-50 burgers were all on it at once and the grease got crazy in the drip pan and would sometimes catch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mostly it’s a smothering effect like baking soda. However salt also has pretty good heat absorption capabilities, so I suppose that aside from smothering, maybe it also helps draw the overall temperature of the oil down faster? In either case (salt or baking soda) it’s gotta be a pretty small fire, or you just have to have a lot of it lol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First: NEVER TRY TO PUT OUT A GREASE FIRE WITH WATER. Oil repels waters, so putting water on a grease fire will cause the grease to violently spread.
Grease fires are best extinguished by smothering. So shut off the stove and put a metal lid over the flames to cut off the supply of oxygen. Salt or sand can do the same but you need a lot of it to smother so using salt will only work on a very small grease fire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
