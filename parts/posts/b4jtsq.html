		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The theory is that the the part of the brain used for pain and the part of the brain we use for talking or yelling kind of “overlap,” so we can’t really use both at the same time.  The brain is quite interesting, but sometimes it really sucks at multitasking, so we’re able to use one part or the other, but not at the same time.  Screaming can even be used for pain management, although others around you may not appreciate it very much.  It’s an interesting area that’s still being studied.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Multiple doctors have told me that, if you have the urge to cry or scream, to do so. The reason why; bc it supposedly relaxes your body and eases the stiffness and tension, which then relieves some of the pain. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My psych professor explained the &quot;pain gate&quot; hypothesis to us: basically, the amount of information that is able to pass up and through to the part of the brain that processes pain is limited. By yelling, or rubbing your belly, or concentrating on something else or any number of stimuli or a combination of stimuli, you are giving your brain enough extra info to process that the raw &quot;pain&quot; data that gets through is limited.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The body has two basic modes of being: rest/digest and fight/flight. This allows us to respond to a changing environment and accidents. Pain is a signal that encourages us to rest/digest. However, if we face immediate danger then the body will create natural painkillers that temporarily relieve the pain, since our brain is telling our body that it needs to be in fight/flight mode: &quot;No time to rest/digest now!&quot;</p>
<p>When we scream, we can activate our fight/flight response mode. Many warrior cultures used screaming to prepare for battle. This would make sense as a way of activating the body's natural painkillers.</p>
<p>Depending on the context, screaming can also be intended as a signal to others. Humans are social creatures with brain chemistry that feels pain more strongly when we feel disconnected. Since physical pain is such a personal thing it is natural that the experience of it also triggers a feeling of disconnection, which is itself painful. Screaming as a signal to others could lead to social rewards that in themselves trigger natural painkillers.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Screaming helps trigger our brain's &quot;fight or flight&quot; response. In the response the brain releases loads of adrenaline which helps our heart speed up, gives us maximum strength, and numbs our response to pain. This is why people talk about not even feeling being shot. The adrenaline is so high your response to pain is little to none.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
