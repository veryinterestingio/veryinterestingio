		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually work on ants and although mostly I focus on more community-scale interactions, I can give some information on this topic.</p>
<p>Ants communicate via a variety of modalities but chemical communication via pheromones is a one of the most common means. As other's have mentioned, ants can communicate an immediate threat via the release of pheromones, specifically alarm pheromones (although there are other responses <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00040-016-0470-6.pdf" target="_blank">like stridulation</a> that also occur in some circumstances) . However, ants respond differently to alarm pheromones based on three general rules:  </p>
<p>1 - Natural History Strategies or Life Stage - Ant colonies can range in size from 10s to 10s of millions of individuals. Species with large colonies tend to respond in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8b1vVnQSY" target="_blank">dramatic fashions</a> to the release of alarm pheromones versus species with small colony sizes often (or at early life stages where colonies are small) often either hide or <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5459237_Young_fire_ant_workers_feign_death_and_survive_aggressive_neighbors" target="_blank">play dead</a> in response to disturbances.</p>
<p>2 - Distance from nest/territory - Many ants defend fairly exclusive intraspecific territories and an ant colony has famously been described as a factory within a fortress by EO Wilson. When an ant releases alarm pheromones, response by other ants will largely vary based on the <a href="http://www.public.asu.edu/~spratt1/Publications/Sasaki%20et%20al%202014.pdf" target="_blank">distance from the factory/fortress</a> or the nearness to a <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1890/09-0561.1?casa_token=CNATazme4dsAAAAA:CJ5a-AOxFpLUR7TquS3bRbnX1ScyFOk1KHIspM8GtYPgjrZi5beeZ2fwxQi4bofMHMUDr99-KdtFKg" target="_blank">territories edge</a> (and &quot;familiarity&quot; of their neighboring colonies.  </p>
<p>3 - <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2459556.pdf?casa_token=QJuUy-5AuKcAAAAA:E4-2gZYDf1gY6BxIR8V8c_ibErOMylQmMRFWKuKeT5cZPzeDoJabmytM-YdJ-Qv9r45Y6VaSYafh5DEByGN8h0aET0VRAFK-21eOgZ90VOkmpsWbXQ4" target="_blank">Concentration of alarm pheromone</a> - Although there is a fair amount of behavioral flexibility in response to alarm pheromones, a good general rule is that at low concentrations, ants will often become more aggressive and run towards a pheromone source (such as a distressed sister) but at high concentrations, alarm pheromones induce what could be described as basically a panic. There is a lot more modern work on this but I linked to a classic Wilson paper that describes this behavior pretty accurately.</p>
<p>In the circumstance you outlined where ants continue to come down a trail where someone is constantly stomping on them, what you'd likely see in terms of response is going to depend on all the above circumstances. Is this a large mature colony of ants that can afford to lose a few individuals in order to maximize foraging returns? If so, then the ants will probably keep coming. Is this trail way out on the edge of the colony's territory? If yes, then a lot of continued disturbance is likely to result the ants changing trails. And as the ants approach the &quot;stomping area&quot; you're likely to see first a increase in movement towards the area but then likely a general panic and scattering from the area as more dead ants pile up.  </p>
<p>Dr. Deborah Gordon at Stanford University does a lot of work on this particular set of questions using harvester ants in the southwest of the United States. She has a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Y546VQ/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451665709/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i1" target="_blank">books</a> on the general topic that are fairly approachable.</p>

<p>Ok, so Ants actually communicate in multiple ways, chemical, audio, visual, and tactile. Yes, they tell about imminent danger, hence why things like fire ants will swarm someone stepping on their nest. </p>
<p>I could go on for a few hours about ants, but that's thd basics for your question.</p>
<p>Edit: so, to dorectly address OPs question, the ants will continue to follow the chemical trail that is laid. If there is danger present, they will alert each other in various ways. One, is when they die. Ants release oleic acid when they die, along with a few other chemicals that are individual to each species. The oleic acid tells the living ants where the dead one is, and the other chemicals can cause them to go into an offensive/defensive frenzy, attacking things. So, while they still follow a trail, they know what is around, and a good portion will stop at the death sites to investigate or attack.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
