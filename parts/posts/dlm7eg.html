		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the sugar in honey is heavily concentrated, it has a low <a href="https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/inspection-technical-guides/water-activity-aw-foods" target="_blank">Water Activity Level.
</a></p>
<p>Despite the fact that it contains water, it is effectively too dry for organisms to grow in it and it causes their cells to become dehydrated until they stop functioning. However, being dehydrated isn't necessarily fatal for many organisms, it just stops their metabolism and stops them from growing. This is called <em>Cryptobiosis</em>.</p>
<p>If you mix honey with a certain amount of water, however, it will begin to ferment, creating <em>Mead</em>.</p>
<p>In fact, honey typically contains a variety of microorganisms such as yeasts, fungi, various bacteria. These are picked up by bees from their environment. Honey, being a natural product, isn't sterile. <strong>EDIT</strong>: for this reason honey is sometimes used to begin a sourdough bread culture. </p>
<p>Infants have sometimes been known to contract certain diseases such as Tetanus, Botulism, or <em>Clostridium difficile</em> Colitis from honey. <strong>EDIT:</strong> these are rare to be sure but life threatening when they do occur. </p>
<p>These are all caused by bacteria in the genus <em>Clostridium</em> that tend to be common in the soil but can only grow in low oxygen conditions. These bacteria produce spores that can withstand dryness for years or even decades. Once they reach the intestines of s young child, this gives those bacterial spores an ideal low oxygen environment in order to grow. Infants don't have the same diversity of gut bacteria that older children and adults do, and their immune systems aren't well developed.  This allows <em>Clostridium</em> bacteria to overgrow and begin to produce toxic proteins that can cause life threatening diseases. For this reason infants shouldn't be given honey until about 12 months.</p>
<p>In normal adults the intestines are already heavily crowded with normal gut bacteria, and <em>Clostridium</em> can't grow easily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honey is only about 15% water which makes it very hard for microbial growth. In addition, honey is pretty acidic largely due to bee stomach enzymes during the honey creation process. Lastly, as time goes on, honey tends to crystallize into a solid, making it even harder for bacteria to form</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honey is hygroscopic which means that it takes moisture around it and “eats” it up. That kills all bacteria or weird bugs. Cause they like water nomnomnom.</p>
<p>It’s very sweet making for a hypertonic environment. That means that all of those bacteria and things would shrivel up in the honey as equilibrium would be disrupted. Some parasites and things can make protective walls around themselves to withstand harsh conditions, but they have to survive long enough to do so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honey doesn't spoil because the germs that live in food and spoil food need to drink a lot more water than the amount of water that honey has in it.</p>
<p>Honey can still have some germs in it that can make you sick, though. Those germs are sleeping until they get more water.</p>
<p>This is why babies shouldn't eat honey.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
