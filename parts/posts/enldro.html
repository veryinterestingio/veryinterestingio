		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you're in a room with the floor walls and ceiling painted black. </p>
<p>Now turn the lights out and imagine you have to find a mirror somewhere in this room with nothing but a headlamp. You'd think it'd be easy, just shine the flashlight around the floor walls and ceiling until you see it, however you will soon discover that you can't see anything on the floor walls or ceiling because the mirror bounces the light from your flashlight away from you. All you see is the black reflection blended in with the black background. You will only be able to see the mirror when it's facing directly towards you and you can see your flashlight in the reflection.</p>
<p>Now take the same concept, except instead of a mirror, it's a pinball polished to a mirror finish. You should be able to find it almost immediately because there's always some part of the ball bearing that will reflect you and your flashlight back to you. As soon as you shine your headlamp on it, you'll see a twinkle from the reflection.</p>
<p>This is the basic concept behind stealth; certain shapes reflect electromagnetic waves back to their source better than others. Flat shapes are typically the best at avoiding this, while spherical shapes and edges will almost always cause a return.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, because of the footprint shape and the sleek design there are very few parts of the plane where a radar signal would be bounced back to its source. Radar works by sending out a signal and then waiting for it to bounce off something and come back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the USAF I maintained the avionics on both the F-117A and the F-22 Raptor. The stealth characteristics of these aircraft are determined by shape and RAM (Radar absorbent material, F-117 terminology) / LO (Low observable material, F22 terminology). There are measures taken to reduce thermal footprint like exhaust. Any other answers that go deeper then that are guesses because even with the security clearance I had there are things that just arenâ€™t discussed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are probably thinking of the F-117 which looks like a plan from a 1990's video game as opposed to the B-2 which looks like a very nicely rounded boomerang.  </p>
<p>The answer to the question though is that we understand how radar waves bounce off objects at a theoretical level and can thus engineer shapes with the objective of bouncing back as little of the signal as possible.  Radar absorbent materials, and other strategies, are employed as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
