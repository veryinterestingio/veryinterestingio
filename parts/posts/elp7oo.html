		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you're going to bed your body and brain have been working/thinking/going all day, so it takes time for everything to shut down into &quot;sleep mode.&quot; </p>
<p>The opposite occurs when you wake up, your body is in &quot;sleep mode&quot; already so it's much less work to just go right back to sleep, unless whatever woke you up really startled you to the point where your body isn't in &quot;sleep mode&quot; anymore.</p>
<p>I'm sure this varies from person to person as well, depending on how easily their body/brain can settle down and get to sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the going to sleep part, gotta associate bed with sleeping, no screens, books, masturbation even lol. If you teach your brain that bed is for sleeping and nothing else it helps a lot. If your brain is accustomed to playing on your phone a bit or reading a book when you first get in bed it will be much harder to go right to sleep even if you’re exhausted. As for waking up I think it’s the same deal, get right out of bed and drink some ice water or something. If you lay there a while, your brain will stay in sleep/want to sleep mode.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
