Also, what is the aspect ratio of human vision? Is circular, elliptical or something completely different?</p>
<p>I have recently studied few video coding standards and wondered why we have more resolution in horizontal than vertical in most standards.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simple answer: each eye covers an area taller than it is wide, but combining the two human binocular vision is 200⁰ wide and 135⁰ high.</p>
<p>Complex answer:</p>
<p>There's not that much difference in the up/down vs the left/right distribution of  photoreceptors, but most of your &quot;resolution&quot; doesn't really come from them in a practical sense.</p>
<p>Your visual perception isn't really light entering your eye. You perceive a model of the world that exists in your visual cortex, this creates an imagination of the outside world dreamt by flesh and guided by sensory input and visual memory; it holds an internal perceptual &quot;canvas&quot; that is &quot;painted&quot; by your eye glancing at parts of the scene.</p>
<p>The high resolution part of the eye is the macula at the centre of your vision, it sees an area about the size of a large coin at arms length, and as you look around it paints in most of the detail and colour into your imagined world. Given enough light and 20/20 vision, its practical resolution is roughly that of 8k cinema screen, but it's 360p and blurred within a few degrees.</p>
<p>Human eyes constantly dart about to keep the canvas fresh, and like a pigeon jerking its head about you're actually blind during these &quot;saccades&quot;. The movements are driven by the visual attention system, which gives the burning feeling that something must be looked at, and that is in part driven by the outer areas of the eye that detect movement. Force your eye to keep still for too long and the canvas will gradually descend into a dreamlike chaos; visual memory is transient and depends on constant change. Hallucinogenic drugs massively reduce this time window, if you're into that sort of thing.</p>
<p>So while eye resolution and field of view is part of the picture, eye movements and visual memory drive most of what you actually perceive. The canvas itself still seems wider than it is tall unless you shut one eye, but its characteristics are that of a window into a subjective, imagined 3D dream of the world, rather than being based solely on eye hardware.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your question is a little confusing because &quot;resolution&quot; can mean multiple things. For video formats, it generally means the number of pixels in one direction or another. But for optics, like telescopes, microscopes or eyes, the word is generally used to indicate some measure of how well those optics can resolve details. In that sense it's more akin to &quot;dpi&quot; on an LCD screen, which is generally the same/close in both directions.<br />
Why do we have more pixels horizontally compared to vertically in most video standards? Because TVs and movie screens are wider than they are tall. Why are they wider than they are tall? Because photographers and videographers realized that that's how most of the world is layed out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Round pupils mean that our horizontal and vertical are pretty much the same, though binocular vision means the horizontal is a bit better. In terms of scope, animals with vertical pupils like cats can see more of the vertical plane, while those with horizontal pupils like goats have a broader horizontal plane</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes sort of. The visual field is wider than it is tall. Also while acuity declines with eccentricity, it declines a little more slowly along the horizontal axis than the vertical. So in that sense horizontal acuity is a little better than vertical.</p>
<p>I don’t think that accounts for why pictures and displays tend to have a wide aspect ratio though. I think that has more to do with the fact that content in the visual world is more distributed horizontally than vertically so, you know, you can look from side to side and find more things then if you’d look from top to bottom, all other things being equal. Photographs and videos are going to naturally reflect that asymmetry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Related to your question: when working with Virtual Reality, the screen is split into two halves, one for each eye. It’s usually two cameras that are placed next to each other. The resolution for each eye is slightly taller than it is wide (for example the Oculus Rift had 1080x1200, and together that formed a 2160x1200 image).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
