		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Normally, the cells in the lining of the stomach secrete a mucus that protects the stomach from damage from gastric acid. When your body moves your stomach contents (which contains substantial amounts of stomach acid) into your small intestine, your body pretty much immediately neutralizes it with alkaline secretions from the pancreas (EDIT: also from the gall bladder, as bile is also alkaline), because the intestines don’t have the same protective capacity as the cells in the stomach.</p>
<p>Other organs in the body lack this kind of protection/countermeasure system. Aspirational pneumonia is a great example (when gastric acid enters the lungs). Another much more common example is GERD (which results from gastric acid refluxing into the esophagus. And as has been mentioned, ulcers in the stomach and intestine result when these protective measures are compromised.</p>
<p>While the acid content of gastric juices is problematic, it’s not the only problem. Gastric juice also contains pepsin, which is a major player in the digestion of protein. Essentially, once protective measures are compromised (or if they were never present in the first place) you have damage from the acidity, but also you are literally digesting the proteins in your own tissue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called a perforated ulcer. And it can do a lot of damage in your body, as gastric juices leak out. </p>
<p>It will start to act on those tissues just as if they were tissues you consumed. It will slowly dissolve them. Very painful, as you can imagine. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, stomach acid would burn through your stomach if it didn’t have a mucous lining to protect it.  But even with that, if you produce too much acid to neutralize (through stress or other issues) it will still burn through...that’s what ulcers are.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
