		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’d like to add that the creditors, though not having a legal claim to do so, may still try to collect the debt from family members. They have little to lose by attempting to do so, and gains much when, even once in a great while, a family member, unaware of their legal rights, actually pays the debt out of grief, embarrassment, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your debts become the responsibility of your estate after you die. Your estate is everything you owned at the time of your death. The process of paying your bills and distributing what’s left is called probate.</p>
<p>The executor of your estate, the person responsible for dealing with your will and estate after your death, will use your assets to pay off your debts. This could mean writing checks from a bank account or selling property to get the money. If there isn’t enough to cover your debts, creditors generally are out of luck.</p>
<p>This directly affects your ability to leave wealth to your heirs as you have to pay off debts before you can leave money to people. But it also protects them from inheriting some of your debts.</p>
<p>Some debts though survive your death and can be passed on to your heirs. Debts like a mortgage for instance. If anyone cosigned debt with you, then they could be on the hook for paying it back. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind, unsecured debt is not very common.  These days, your talking credit cards, and unless you have some net worth, you wont get approved for more than a few grand.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So its not often that someone with zero net worth would die with a signficiant amount of unsecured debt at stake.  Most common source is medical debt, since theres no approval process for that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
