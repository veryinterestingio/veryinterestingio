		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, I had braces for five years and everyone who has heard the horror story that if you don’t take care of your teeth while you have them you’ll have permanent spots when they are removed. </p>
<p>I was sufficiently frightened and brushed and flossed like crazy. Had by braces off, no issues, pretty teeth. (Smooooooth!) Thought it was just something orthodontists say until I had an appt to fit my permanent retainer on a bottom and another girl was getting her braces off. </p>
<p>Not a story. I’m sure some hardcore cleaning and whitening could have fixed it, but her teeth looked horrible with the white spots where the brackets were. She cried. I cried.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do damage the enamel though. I haven't had braces for 10 years now and I still have a little square on one of my front teeth from them. They don't do horrible damage and can be unglued easily, but they can impact the enamel unfortunately.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Orthodontic technician here! The glue is removed either with a specialized tool  called “an adhesive removing plier” that flakes the glue off, which takes while, or a dentist drill that has a special bur that pretty much sands it off to the enamel (without being the kind of bur that has the purpose of removing enamel like some other burs have). Then a polishing bur gets put on to smooth out any remaining roughness from the first bur.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
