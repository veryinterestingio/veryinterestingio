		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As you drink excessive water you'll dilute the sodium in your bloodstream.  The sodium in your cells will stay (relatively) normal.</p>
<p>Water always wants to move to the higher concentration of sodium (if it exists), this is called osmosis.  The excess water starts moving from your blood into your cells.  Where this causes problems is it moving into your brain cells and causing your brain to swell.  Since your brain is in a rigid container (your skull) when your brain swells it increases pressure on your brain.</p>
<p>This is where the neurological symptoms come from, your brain swelling and increasing pressure on your brain.  At first it is likely to present as some mild confusion.  As it gets worse, you'll be more confused and may have nausea / vomiting.  If it continues eventually the electrical system in your brain go haywire and you'll have seizures.  Somewhere around here is where you'll die without medical treatment.</p>
<p>One upside is as you become more confused the more likely you are to stop drinking water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>please correct me if I'm wrong, but this is what I've been taught/have read in the past about it:</p>
<p>When you drink too much water, it throws your electrolytes out of balance. Fluid outside of your cells tries to go into your cells to try to rebalance it, but then that makes your cells swell. Well when cells swell, that causes pressure to build up in your brain. Which is not good. Leads to things like headaches, irritability or mood swings, nausea and vomiting, and can also mess with your sensory input. And finally, the swelling cells can put pressure on your brainstem, which would lead to things like seizures, brain damage, and death.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From my understanding it’ll basically slowly water down your blood until you either stop drinking or die. And some symptoms include, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, death.
And it’s a lot less water than you think it would be to kill someone, it takes about a gallon and a half to kill someone, but you might throw up after only drinking 1/3 of that</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
