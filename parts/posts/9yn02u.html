		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most paleoclimate scientists agree that -- at least for the past half billion years -- oxygen levels have been set by a negative feedback regulation process.  Plants constantly generate O2, but if its concentration becomes too high, oxygen-consuming processes kick in to bring it back down.  The obvious example is forest fires, which are a problem today, but become unstoppable raging infernos at higher oxygen concentrations.  A less obvious example is animals and bacteria, which become much more effective at consuming plants when there's more oxygen.</p>
<p>It works both ways: as oxygen increases, fire and/or animals work more effectively to destroy oxygen; as oxygen decreases, they get less effective and oxygen levels build up.  </p>

<p>The net result is that oxygen levels have been fairly stable, but not perfectly so, varying between about 15% and 30% over the past half-billion years.</p>

<p>As for your second question, the winds circulate air around the atmosphere fairly quickly.  The air surrounding you in your forest was hundreds of miles away yesterday, and on the other side of the planet a week ago.  This means there's very little difference in oxygen on a local scale.  But there's less mixing between north and south hemispheres, so you do see some oxygen variations as the seasons change.  Plants grow in the summer, releasing oxygen, and decay in the winter, lowering it.  The changes are slight -- about .002% -- but they can be measured.  There's also a long-term trend of lowering oxygen levels, by about .025%, as we consume oxygen by burning fossil fuels.  However, the trend is way too small to lead to serious health problems for humans.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, that’s just the way it is. Earth’s “evolution” created this balance. Some belive there was more oxygen when dinosaurs were around (hence bigger creatures) some also now say there was less. What you have to remember is we evolved into this 21%. Your question is kinda like “why are there oceans.” Yes, there is absolutely a scientific explanation but in the end the answer is just that, ~21% O2, 78% N, then trace elements.
Also almost all of our Oxygen comes from phytoplankton, tiny plants that live on the surface of the ocean, not trees.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
