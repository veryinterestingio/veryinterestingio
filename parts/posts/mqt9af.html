When asked about seahorse however neither of us could come up with an answer. So what is up with the seahorse how did it come be? What other animals can we see that it's genetically close to?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The family is called the Sygnathids, which includes seahorses and seadragons and pipefish. If you look up pipefish, you'll see that they look like a stretched-out, less horsey version of a seahorse: similar eyes, jaws, and mouth, but long and slender like, well, a pipe. Seadragons are shaped like a cross between the two, with a more seahorse-shaped body but without the seahorse's characteristic upright body position while swimming. All the Sygnathids do the thing where the male incubates the eggs, either in a pouch or attached to his tail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Molecular dating finds that pipefish and seahorses diverged during the Late Oligocene.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Well, that is what evolution does, random mutation compared with natural selection.</p>
<p>In this case, the natural selection was about being able to swim upright, because this allowed you to blend in with the seagrass.</p>
