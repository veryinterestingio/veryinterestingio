<p>Now, maybe I am just over thinking this, but everything I Google gives me this big convoluted explanation of what standard deviation is without addressing the kiddy pool I'm standing in.</p>
<p>Edit: you guys have been fantastic! This has all helped tremendously, if I could hug you all I would.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ll give my shot at it:</p>
<p>Let’s say you are 5 years old and your father is 30. The average between you two is 35/2 =17.5.</p>
<p>Now let’s say your two cousins are 17 and 18. The average between them is also 17.5.</p>
<p>As you can see, the average alone doesn’t tell you much about the actual numbers. Enter standard deviation. Your cousins have a 0.5 standard deviation while you and your father have 12.5.</p>
<p>The standard deviation tells you how close are the values to the average. The lower the standard deviation, the less spread around are the values.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My explanation might be rudimentary but the eli5 answer is:</p>
<p>Mean of (0,1, 99,100) is 50</p>
<p>Mean of (50,50,50,50) is also 50</p>
<p>But you can probably see that for the first data, the mean of 50 would not be of as importance, unless we also add some information about how much do the actual data points 'deviate' from the mean.</p>
<p>Standard deviation is intuitively the measure of how 'scattered' the actual data is about the mean value.</p>
<p>So the first dataset would have a large SD (cuz all values are very far from 50) and the second dataset literally has 0 SD</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5: It's literally just tells you how &quot;spread out&quot; the data is.</p>
<p>Low SD = most children are close to the mean age</p>
<p>High SD = most children's age is away from the mean age</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>ELI10: it's useful to know how spread out your data is. </p>
<p>The simple way of doing this is to ask &quot;on average, how far away is each datapoint from the mean?&quot; This gives you MAD (<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/summarizing-quantitative-data/other-measures-of-spread/a/mean-absolute-deviation-mad-review" target="_blank">Mean Absolute Deviation</a>)</p>
<p>&quot;Standard deviation&quot; and &quot;Variance&quot; are more sophisticated versions of this with some advantages.</p>
<p>Edit: I would list those advantages but there are too many to fit in this textbox.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

At another restaurant it's a crapshoot whether your steak is served raw or burnt to a crisp. At both restaurants the average steak is cooked perfectly.
