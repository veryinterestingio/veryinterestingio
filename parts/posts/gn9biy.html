Without personally doing the math it seems that its *extremely* probable we're headed towards a Great Permian Dying extinction event in the oceans - what is the time frame for that?  How can we prevent it?  And (more likely) how do we maintain civilization with dead oceans?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
