		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are these newer designs of blades on an electric fan where the <a href="https://sc02.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1PGykMVXXXXcIXXXXq6xXFXXXm/electric-banana-blade-18-wall-fan-FB18.jpg" target="_blank">blades are narrower</a> than the usual <a href="https://www.kyowa.com.ph/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/KW-6709-Desk-Fan.jpg" target="_blank">wide blade design</a>. The marketing says that &quot; The reason for this is that the narrower surface area of the banana blade fan design permits faster airflow without causing a drag/obstruction because of it’s very small surface area. The wider fan blade design is more efficient at low speeds since the blades are only angled slightly. The banana blade design on the other hand is angle much sharper so it is not efficient at low speeds but when the airflow picks up and the fan reaches fast/optimal speed, the banana blade design runs more efficient in term of electricity relative to the traditional design at the bottom. &quot; Is this correct?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can get more airflow out of a narrower blade, for the same input power, by running it at a higher RPM.</p>
<p>The price you pay for this is noise. A broader blade can move the same air at a lower RPM and with lower noise, but a little more input power.</p>
<p>The difference is quite small. At the extremely low airspeeds of stationary fans, the amount of air moved is relative to the area acted on by the rotating blade per unit time, so a slim blade has less drag and can run faster, but also has to run faster.</p>
<p>It's a perception thing. People think that a roaringly noisy fan is doing more work than a quiet one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aerodynamically-wise the better 'propeller'/'wing' is a long and thin profiled blade. It. Produces a better lift/drag ratio so it's more efficient...you can think of it as more area of the blade is cutting through undisturbed airflow</p>
<p>But yeah, you have to spin it faster because...well else just take a whole A1 sheet paper and shake it slowly, that will move more air. There is less area pushing/pulling the air through the propeller disk. Adding more blade won't help because closer blades disturb the airflow for the 'behind' blade and rapidly decrease in efficiency.</p>
<p>Fans are getting the banana-style because engineering-wise we can reduce the noise emissions (mostly vibrations from the fixation). Plastic has gotten better and cheaper.
So we can afford tu run more efficient thinner blades faster for the same amount of noise and airflow. </p>
<p>Post suggesting a fan inherently emit noise are not wrong but, this is largely offset by the fact that the frequency of the &quot;inherent&quot; noise is equal to (n° of blades)(rotations per sec) and that's for a living room fan well outside of most people hearing range.
Plus it's not very loud. </p>
<p>You can try this with a computer fan (much faster rpm so it reach audible level):
Put a ruler/paper perpendicular to the edge to the blades at 5mm-1cm.
The inherent noise will be amplified as the paper/ruler will stop the vortex to smooth itself out. You probably never heard that pitch from your fans :-)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Which blade design is more effective depends on the application.</p>
<p>To move large volumes of air quickly the thin blade design is more efficient while the wide blade design provides better static pressure for pushing air through a radiator for instance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer the other part of your question: <em>why are the blades curved?</em> check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingtip_device" target="_blank">winglets</a> (those things on the ends of plane wings) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_wing" target="_blank">delta wings</a>.     Basically, as the propellor (or a wing) moves faster, more air slips off the tip without going over the airfoil, and as you go faster still, air needs more wing to get maximum lift. Fan blades are sometimes wider towards the tip where they move faster, but these curve instead to achieve the same cross section with less material.<br />
Also, propellers are usually twisted (and appear curved) to counteract twisting caused by drag at full speed, ensuring that it takes a full bite of air.<br />
So these fan blades are twisted like a propeller but also curved in order to capture air sliding off the faster moving tips.  The fan is so slow though, that the design is 50% style and 50% actually useful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
