I was just thinking about what holds me back from being the best version of myself and i realized that itâ€™s being lazy. Im too lazy to study, im too lazy to work out, and there is just so much wasted potential because of my being lazy. Im not depressed im actually very happy, but i just have no motivation to push myself to achieve better results because im not doing bad at all, but im not doing my best either. Why am i so lazy? How do i stop?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Laziness is a form of procrastination, and procrastination is usually a bad anxiety response.</p>
<p>We understand procrastination when the thing we need to do is actually bad. Like, suppose you need to go get a tetanus shot. It hurts for a couple of days. You don't want to feel pain, so you find reasons not to do it.</p>
<p>But other things cause us &quot;pain&quot; we don't want to go through as well. for example, maybe you want to learn to play the ukulele. But you understand to do so means you'll have to spend an hour or so every day for years to be relatively good. You worry that you'll do all that work, but turn out not to have any talent. That would be very disappointing. So your anxiety about being disappointed convinces you it's easier to binge Twin Peaks on Hulu or something else &quot;easy&quot;. </p>
<p>Odds are you're wrong: if you can't motivate yourself to do <em>anything</em> you're likely at least mildly depressed and not &quot;happy&quot;. If even things you know you enjoy give you this kind of anxiety, it's a sign your brain chemistry that's supposed to reward you for doing fun things is mucked up. It's OK. We're kind of all there, this year.</p>
<p>But if, instead, you can redirect yourself into trying the things, then you get the happy boost, then you turn the new things into habits, I'm wrong: you're healthy, you just got stuck in a bad spot. Anxiety is tough to overcome, but I find once you get past it it stays away!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have explained the psychology behind this. I'll help with the specific request:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why am I so lazy? How do I stop? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do something so small you can't argue with it. This tricks your brain into letting you start.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You want to work out? Find a clean spot on the carpet and do one push-up. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You want to write? Open a word processor or pick up a pen and write one sentence.</p>
</li>
<li>You want to learn something new? Open a Wikipedia page about it and read the intro paragraph.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice how you can do any of those things <em>right now</em>? You don't even have to close the web browser.</p>
<p>Go start something. And <em>whatever</em> amount you end up doing, good for you! That's more than you would have done otherwise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think you're lazy. I think you're protecting yourself. You're seeking comfort. And that's lovable. </p>
<p>There might be something dangerous or scary about the task. Maybe you're afraid of doing a bad job, maybe you're afraid of the responsibility that comes with success. Whatever it is, this behavior exists for a reason. Once you understand why, you can start to move forward.</p>
<p>It always starts with loving yourself, though. Loving yourself for doing a very human thing like seeking safety, comfort, and pleasure. You can't force yourself into a new behavior pattern, you must approach it willingly. And that willingness can only come from self love.</p>
<p>I think you could use a good counselor. They can help you overcome the behaviors that aren't serving you anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>That book is changing my life and it will change yours too. </p>
<p>Basically, dont focus on having motivation, just create some daily routines and follow it.</p>
<p>1) 7-8 hours sleep</p>
<p>2) 7-8 hous of Work</p>
<p>3) And in the remaining time be lazy/play around, nobody is stopping you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Procrastination is a form of self-protection and energy conservation. Another user explained the self-protection better, but energy conservation is a crucial role of preserving resources from an evolutionary perspective.</p>
<p>Additionally, you have a strong dopamine response to easy routes of satisfaction. Dopamine is our reward neurotransmitter that our brain pumps out when we eat fat dense foods, engage in sexual activity, and did other things that keep us alive. Sitting on the couch, cruising social media, playing video games, and the sort are low energy activities and themself feature dopamine triggering components by design.</p>
<p>My piece of advice is this: stop looking at laziness as lack of motivation. It's discipline. Motivation is bonus energy to do a thing, discipline is doing the thing even when it isn't appealing. Staying off reddit takes discipline, exercising takes discipline, eating well takes discipline.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
