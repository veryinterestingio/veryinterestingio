However, I couldn't find much when I was looking for the reason that vaccines provide longer immunity, I was only reading how in both cases there will be memory cells for secondary infection. Sources would be greatly appreciated.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vaccines as a rule do not provide longer immunity than a natural infection, though they can.</p>

<p>When vaccines are doing a particularly good job, it can come down to:</p>
<ul>
<li>dose and timing. Some viruses are very good at hiding from the immune system or only produce a pretty low infection titre. A vaccine can give a high dose of concentrated antigen in a place that your immune system can easily see and respond to. Having a high concentrated dose all at once is also seen as more urgent by the immune system and more inflammatory response cells may be activated (an &quot;oh, shit! Look at all that bad stuff!&quot; kind of reaction)</li>
<li>pathogen interaction with the immune system. This is less common for viruses which are relatively simple creatures, but many bacteria or pathogenic eukaryotes are able to modulate the immune system and make cells do anti-inflammatory things. These are absent from vaccines which often even contain adjuvants designed to make sure the immune response is activated. Similarly, the infection itself can cause real harm which stresses a body's ability to do anything productively and efficiently. Everything in life takes energy, and a natural infection may have to make trade offs a vaccine does not.</li>
</ul>
<p>When natural infections are doing better, it's usually due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>a wider range of epitopes are presented, allowing multiple ways to recognize a pathogen </li>
<li>viral dose is overall higher as infection takes hold </li>
<li>all immunity processes are fully engaged (per the way our immune systems evolved)</li>
<li>immunity reflects the actual viral/pathogen strain that was contracted, which may be a strain that evolved since the vaccine was designed. Wide range of epitopes is also a player here since immunity to multiple antigens (mutating and unmutated) is expected</li>
</ul></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unlike the non-specific response to the natural primary infection, vaccines can be create to prime the  innate immune system against specific antigens to elicit a greater response.
This may be due to factors such as a higher concentration of viral protein coat in the vaccine compared to natural infection. Additionally, in natural infection, viruses may be able to hide from the immune system to avoid detection on the other hand, a vaccine provides accessible antigens.
Vaccines also contain adjuvants which prime the immune response to enhance the vaccineâ€™s  ability to produce an immune response.</p>
<p>Edit:
In regards to length of immunity:
I found an article that said in Covid infections (particularly severe cases) it is common to have a reduction in CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and B cells.
Studies also showed reduction in interferon gamma. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking on a similar note, say you got naturally infected, got the antibodies, but were exposed to the virus over and over (like working at a hospital).  Your antibodies would fire up time and time again, right?  Would you lose your immunity despite being continuously exposed?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
