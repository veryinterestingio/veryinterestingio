Carbon black protects the tire from the damaging effects of UV light and ozone, two known elements that contribute to the deterioration of the tire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The vast majority of tire rubber compounds use a soot-like material called “carbon black” as filler to add strength, rigidity, and durability while reducing cost.</p>
<p>This material is, as you might imagine, jet black.</p>
<p>The rubber itself is brown or white, depending on the source.  Natural rubber is brown, synthetics are yellowish or bright white.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The rubber used to make tires is actually white.  Manufacturers add carbon black, otherwise known as soot, to tires to make the rubber stronger.  This just happens to turn to the rubber black.</p>
<p>Some other additives can be added to change the color, but this isn't done for a few reasons.  One is cost.  Additives add to the manufacturing cost.  Another is general aesthetic.  Tires have been this color for decades and just considered pleasing since we're used to it.  Finally, adding color compounds could alter the tires' performance and safety.  Since there isn't a whole lot of demand for colored tires, manufactures don't spend a whole lot of time and money developing them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
