		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OK, here's a really ELI5:</p>
<p>Sound travels in waves. Tie a jump rope to a fence and wave it up and down; the shape of the rope will resemble a sound wave. Now imagine you could freeze time, and you wanted to build a copy of the rope's shape, but you only had bricks. </p>
<p>So, you take your bricks, and start to stack them up under the rope. Some times you'll only need a couple of bricks; sometimes you may need to pile them up 10 or 12 high to touch the rope. After a while, if you step back a bit from your work, you can see how the piles of bricks look <em>very much</em>, but not exactly, the shape of the rope. </p>
<p>The rope is the &quot;analog&quot; wave form, while the bricks are the &quot;digital representation&quot;. The analog wave is <em>continuous</em> - the rope's height above the ground can have any value between, say 2 inches and 4 feet. The digital representation is <em>discrete</em> - it can only be 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. number of bricks. It can't be 3.867 bricks. </p>
<p>Analog systems capture the continuous wave. The groove in a record - do 5 year olds even know what those are anymore? - is a long continuous wiggle that copies the  original sound wave. This is actually fairly simple to do - the first records were made of wax, with the platter rotating while a needle, driven by a microphone, made the groove on the surface. This is an analog to analog process.</p>
<p>Digital systems try to recreate the original wave by using standard sized pieces to fill in the space beneath the wave, just as we did with the rope. But how wide, and how tall, should each of these pieces be?</p>
<p>This is beyond ELI5, but there was a smart guy named Nyquist who figured out that to completely capture all the information in the original wave, it needs to be sampled at twice its highest frequency. This tells us how &quot;wide&quot; the bricks need to be. For example, if the highest frequency in the wave was 4000 cycles per second, then we would need 8000 samples, so our 'bricks' have to be 1/8000 of a second wide.</p>
<p>The height of the bricks are is a function of how many digital bits in each brick. If you use 8 bits, you can get 2^8 = 256 levels. If you use 16, you get 2^16 = 65,336 levels. If you use more bits, it makes the bricks less high, so you can squeeze the brick piles closer to the actual wave, and so sound more like the original. </p>
<p>Note the digital process requires an analog-to-digital conversion at the input, and then a digital-to-<del>audio</del>analog conversion at the output. There are some - Neil Young comes to mind - who believe that this distorts and ruins the original recording; others don't notice it.  </p>
<p>finally, and this is way beyond ELI5, digital techniques like Adaptive-predictive Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM), use clever math and engineering tricks to get the sound even closer to the original, while using less bandwidth.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks for all the kind comments and awards. Thanks also to those who corrected the minor errors, and expanded on some of the stuff I left out.</p>
<p>EDIT EDIT: To all the longitudinal wave fans. yes, you're right. So am I. A sound wave can be represented as a two-dimensional signal on an oscilloscope, and it was that representation I was referring to. I elided the silly scope reference because it's ELI5.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Analogue audio is stored in an analogue (continuous) medium such as vinyl or magnetic tape (audio cassette). Digital is stored in a discontinuous medium such as a CD or MP3.</p>
<p>Sound is a wave, so audio information just describes the shape of the wave. On vinyl there is a wavy groove which has that shape, on cassette there is a varying magnetisation of the tape which also has the shape.</p>
<p><del>On a CD the &quot;height&quot; of the wave at each moment in time is assigned a value from 0 to 255</del> <em><del>65535</del></em><del>. Then at the next timestep it has another value. So the true wave shape is approximated by a sort of stepped shape. See a comparison</del> <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbeatlabacademy.com%2Funit%2Fmsd03-digital-analog-synthesizers%2Fasset-5-digitalanalog-waveform%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw3zWKdCV1GJ55rpplieYP3v&amp;ust=1615291906233000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCNj6-LjVoO8CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD" target="_blank"><del>here</del></a><del>.</del></p>
<p><em>A digital signal on a CD stores the wave form as a series of values at moments in time, with those moments very close together. Think of a series of dots where if you squint you see the original curve. There are 65536 possible values, stored every 1/44100 seconds, which is all you need to replicate the original sound when you play it back.</em></p>
<p>So long as there are enough values <del>and short enough timesteps</del> the digital shape is a close enough approximation to the true shape that no human can hear the difference. MP3 and other digital formats go further and compress the audio, so they sort of describe the shape rather than simply approximating it as outlined above. This can lead to distortions that humans can hear (or claim to).</p>
<p>You might think that analogue is therefore 'perfect' in a way that digital cannot be. This is sort of true, but any real analogue medium will have physical limitations which add their own distortions to the sound, potentially to a greater extent than good digital audio.</p>
<p><em>Edit to add: yes I am aware that a digital signal perfectly replicates the waveform up to the desired frequency, thanks for all the reminders.</em></p>
<p><em>Edit 2: alright alright I get it. People have strong feelings about this analogy.</em></p>
<p><em>Edit 3: actually scrap that I stand by my statement that a digital audio signal is an approximation of the original. Sound is not band limited, and does not have finite bit depth.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Analog is wiggles. Digital is numbers that say how big and how fast to make the wiggles.</p>
<p>Speakers wiggle the air which wiggles your eardrums. So either way, the end result is wiggles.</p>
<p>Digital is nice because if you see a messed up &quot;5&quot; it can be easy to see it was supposed to be a &quot;5&quot; because you know what 5s are supposed to look like. (Real digital signals use binary, but the concept is the same.)</p>
<p>But if a wiggle gets messed up, it just looks like another wiggle. So you can't fix errors as easily with analog. This means analog is more susceptible to noise.</p>
<p>Digital requires conversion back to analog to make the wiggles for the speakers. Having to convert back and forth is the downside with digital. The faster the wiggle changes, the more numbers per second the electronics have to convert. But modern tech has no problem doing this with wiggles that only change as fast as audio does.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is electronic music pioneer Wendy Carlos on the different between digital and analog audio:</p>
<p>&quot; Digital, of course, is essentially computer data which accurately describes an audio signal. It's easily manipulated and can be copied exactly -- all those ones and zeros, you know. Analog is how we usually describe sound waves, a continuous change of pressure or an electrical signal, what a microphone produces, what we used to record on tape. It's a much riskier way to handle audio, but historically was the method we first discovered.</p>
<p>Between the two, don't look for deeper meaning or arbitrary differences. There is a cult of near-religious dogma that proclaims analog sound on LPs (&quot;vinyl&quot;) to be perfection (what a hoot that is for those of us who used to cut LPs for a living!). They think you have to use special wires and elaborate techniques they don't even understand, and they claim that digital is in cahoots with Lucifer. It's kind of pathetic, based on ignorance and flamboyant cheek. The simple answer for synthesizers or reproduction is: To the listener, it shouldn't matter at all, as long as it sounds fine. If you're a performer, it shouldn't matter at all. If you have a very advanced analog synthesizer and then you have another that is all digital--and you get a lot out of both--fine, use them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, digital can, in principle, let you be more precise, with finer finesse and control. Analog runs out at five significant digits of accuracy (it doesn't have infinite resolution), something like that, and there's tape hiss to contend with. If you want to put the money and time into it, you can obsess with digital until you're dead. It's a potential that hasn't often been tapped, but usually you reach a practical limit, there's life for you. Microtonal tunings are a breeze with digital synthesizers, but very hard to do with analog.&quot;</p>
