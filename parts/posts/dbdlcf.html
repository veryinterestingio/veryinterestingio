		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see a lot of questions about how car brakes work but not how they mechanically affect the engine. When pressing your brake, you stop your wheels from spinning but the engine is still cycling and producing RPMs. If you let go of the brake you immediately start moving forward. Is the brake on an automatic car connected to a clutch of some sort that disengages your engine from the axles? If it does, then where do the RPMs go that your engine is creating? Otherwise it would be underloaded. Where does all this excess power go?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you have an automatic transmission, your engine and drivetrain are not mechanically interlocked; they're independent. You have this device called a torque converter - it's a drum filled with oil, and a turbine. The drum is bolted to the engine crankshaft, the turbine is attached to the transmission. As the engine spins, it rotates the drum, which gets the oil sloshing. This creates hydraulic pressure, which runs over the turbine. This pressure CAN rotate the turbine, and move the car, but the brakes can overcome this pressure. If this is the case, the oil just flows around the turbine.</p>
<p>In a manual car, you have a pair of friction plates held together by a spring. The clutch pedal pushes the plates apart. The engine and drivetrain are physically linked, but if you're going to stop, you have to step on the clutch pedal and disconnect the engine from the drivetrain, or you'll stall the engine and it'll be a bumpy stop, as you imagine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on if your car is an automatic or a standard (manual) shift car:</p>
<p>Automatic: Your engine isn't connected straight to the wheels. The engine turns a sort of fan in this thick goopy stuff that blows on another fan. That makes the second fan turn, and that one is connected to the wheels. So when you stop the wheels only that second fan stops.</p>
<p>Manual: There are no fans and no goop, but there is something called a clutch that does the same thing. Clutches are like a bunch of dinner plates stacked up. If you spin the top one, it will spin the bottom one too, but if you lift the top one a bit first it won't spin the bottom one. The bottom one is the one connected to the wheels just like that second fan in the automatic car.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Automatic cars have no mechanical connection between the engine and transmission. It uses a torque converter. The simplest way to explain it is it's like putting a fan face to face with a wind mill. The fan is the engine when it turns on the air blowing into the windmill turns it. But if you put a brake on the windmill the air will blow over it and not turn it. Then when you let the brake go it starts turning again. In practice it uses oil instead of air and is way more complex.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it comes down to the fact that the cars engine is not connected to the wheels in a &quot;solid&quot; way there is something that will slip or give in-between. in an automatic it is the torque converter and in a manual it is the clutch. the closest you could get to damaging the engine would be in a manual car with a really grippy clutch. even then you just force the engine to stall and while the engine doesn't like it, it doesn't hurt it. this last example happens 100's of thousands of ties a day when new people are learning to use a manual car or when someone stalls trying to go up a steep hill, same effect  as braking, in that the engine is forced to come to a sudden stop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
