		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wife and I had a long, weird argument last night about how siphons work. She didn't understand at all, and I only vaguely do (imagine what that argument was like). But at the end of the debate, I was left with a new question.</p>
<p>If I fill a cup with water in a tub, turn it upside down, and raise it out of the water, keeping the rim submerged, the water doesn't fall out of the cup. My understanding is, the water is being pulled down by gravity, but can't fall because there's nothing to take its place <em>[edit: wrong]</em>, and it takes a lot of energy to create a vacuum, so the water is simply being held up by the cup <em>[edit: wrong]</em>, and is exerting some kind of negative pressure on the inside of the cup (the cup itself is being pulled down by the water, but it's sturdy and doesn't move, so neither does the water). When I make a hole in the cup, air can be pulled in to take its place in the cup, so the water can fall <em>[edit: wrong]</em>.</p>
<p>If I did this experiment in a vacuum, I figure something very similar would happen <em>[edit: this paragraph is 100% wrong, the main thing I learned in the responses below]</em>. The water would be held in the cup until I made a hole, then it would fall into the tub. If anything, the water will fall a little faster, since it doesn't need to do any work to pull air into the cup through the hole. But then it seems that the vacuum is coming in to fill the space, which sounds wrong since the vacuum isn't a thing that moves.</p>
<p>I'm missing something in all of this, or thinking about it all the wrong way. Vacuum isn't like air, it doesn't rush in through the hole in the cup to take the place of the water, allowing the water to fall. But then why does making a hole in the cup allow the water to fall?</p>
<p><em>edit:</em></p>
<p><em>thanks all, I have really learned some things today.. but now my intuitions regarding how a siphon works have been destroyed.. need to do some studying...</em></p>
<p><em>edit 2:</em></p>
<p><em>really, though, how does a siphon work then? why doesn't the water on both sides of the bend fall down, creating a vacuum in-between?</em></p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So in the first example the air pressure outside the cup, pushing down on the water is greater than the pressure in side the cup. If you have raised the cup up 3&quot; the pressure in the cup is -3&quot; of water from atmospheric. </p>
<p>If you are working in a perfect vacuum there is no air pressure pushing down on the water outside the cup. So you wouldn't be able to 'lift' the water with the cup because there wouldn't be a pressure difference between inside and outside. </p>
<p>It's the action of the air pressure pushing down on the water outside the cup that allows you to create the vacuum inside the cup and lift the water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another way of thinking about this which is more intuitive for me: if you take your inverted cup in a vacuum and plunge it down into the water, the water level inside the cup will stay even with the water level outside the cup as it’s submerged.</p>
<p>Because the cup is truly empty, there’s nothing to prevent it from filling with water. The same principle applies in reverse when you pull a full cup up out of the water. Because the area outside the cup is truly empty, there’s nothing to prevent the water from exiting the cup and becoming empty again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You seem to misunderstand the nature of vacuum. It's not like vacuum is something special and it takes energy to create it. Vacuum is just absence of matter.</p>
<p>The statement that it takes energy to create vacuum is only true because if you're surrounded by matter you need to &quot;push&quot; matter away. In the environment we're used to living there is air pressure from the atmosphere that you would need to push against. </p>
<p>If you reframe the examples substituting &quot;<em>negative pressure from the vacuum</em>&quot; with &quot;<em>zero pressure from vacuum against a lot of pressure from the air</em>&quot; it will make more sense. </p>
<p>In your cup example, the water inside the cup is pushing down because of gravity, but it doesn't have the same pressure as the air surrounding the tub. So the atmospheric pressure is what actually pushes the water up inside the cup. If the cup is high enough (approximately 10 meters) the water would actually have enough pressure against the atmosphere and stop going up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the water and cup example is too complicated, because everyone is chiming in about vapor pressure and stuff. A much simpler example: trying to pull the plunger out of a syringe, which is blocked at one end.</p>
<p>If you try to do this with a well-sealed syringe in our atmosphere, you will agree that this is very hard to do. So the question is, would it be easy to do in space? The answer is yes.</p>
<p>The reason it is hard to do in our atmosphere is not from some abstract &quot;energy required to create a vacuum.&quot; At the end of the day, it has to come down to actual atoms bouncing around. And in this case, the molecules in the air around the syringe are pushing hard on the syringe from every angle. In particular, some of them are crashing against the plunger end.</p>
<p>So when you are trying to pull the plunger out, you are literally fighting against an opposing force created by the random motion of air molecules bombarding the plunger in the other direction. Since there are so many molecules, moving quite fast, this is actually a lot of force.</p>
<p>If you draw a force diagram, you're pulling on the end of plunger in one direction, and the random bombardment of air molecules is pushing on it hard in the other direction.</p>
<p>Now, if you open the other end of the syringe, air rushes into the syringe (by random motion of air molecules that would otherwise have just hit the tip of the syringe). Now you have equal numbers of molecules bouncing on either side of the plunger, cancelling each other out, leaving your arm strength free to tip the balance one way or the other by pulling or pushing.</p>
<p>So what happens in space? Simple. There are no air molecules bombarding the sides of the syringe and the plunger, meaning you have no force to work against. If you pull on the plunger, you are the only thing having an effect. The force diagram would show a single arrow.</p>
<p>So, while thinking in terms of &quot;the energy required to create a vacuum&quot; is fine for an initial approximation of your thinking, if you can't explain it in terms of simple atoms bouncing around, it's probably missing something.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, I don't have time for a detailed answer to this, but you're mistaken thinking is in negative pressure vs pressure gradients. Try approaching the problem from the perspective of a single water molecule at the surface experiencing the forces from the air above and other water molecules below and envisioning how that would change as the cup is raised and lowered.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
