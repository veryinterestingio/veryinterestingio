It hasn't erupted since 1977. Based on my basic knowledge of earth sciences and that the Philippines is a product of of oceanic convergence, am I right to expect that all nearby volcanoes in Philippines will erupt too? Isn't volcanic eruption an indication of an very active plate movement?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, the process of convergence is so slow and gradual that being linked to other volcanoes by the same process doesn't mean other eruptions are more likely on a human timescale. If multiple volcanoes are fed by the same magma chamber, there can be more of a direct link, but that is uncommon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn’t really work like that. With basically the entire pacific slowly getting smaller, due to subduction, the material melts at different rates based on a number of factors. We usually have about 30-40 active volcanoes spread throughout the world on any given day, but they don’t trigger neighbors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
