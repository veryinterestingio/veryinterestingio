		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi everybody</p>
<p>We are the scientists behind a recent UN report on the impacts of methane emissions on climate change around the world. This report is called the Global Methane Assessment and you can download the whole thing <a href="https://www.ccacoalition.org/en/resources/global-methane-assessment-full-report" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the headline findings:</p>
<p>The Global Methane Assessment shows that human-caused methane emissions can be reduced by up to 45 per cent this decade. Such reductions would avoid nearly 0.3°C of global warming by 2045 and would be consistent with keeping the Paris Climate Agreement's goal to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (1.5˚C) within reach.</p>
<p>Because methane is a key ingredient in the formation of ground-level ozone (smog), a powerful climate forcer and dangerous air pollutant, a 45 per cent reduction would prevent 260 000 premature deaths, 775 000 asthma-related hospital visits, 73 billion hours of lost labour from extreme heat, and 25 million tonnes of crop losses annually.</p>
<p>We are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drew Shindell - Professor of Earth science at Duke University</li>
<li>Jean-Francois Lemarque - Director of the Climate and Global Dynamics (CGD) Laboratory at the National Center for Atmospheric Research</li>
<li>Johan Kuylenstierna - Research Leader at the Stockholm Environment Institute</li>
<li>Bill Collins - Professor of Climate Processes at University of Reading</li>
<li>Nathan Borgford-Parnell - Science Affairs Coordinator at the Climate &amp; Clean Air Coalition</li>
</ul>
<p>Methane doesn't always get the attention that it deserves, so we were pleased to see the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/24/climate/methane-leaks-united-nations.html" target="_blank">NY Times</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/urgent-methane-cuts-needed-rein-climate-change-un-says-2021-04-27/" target="_blank">Reuters</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-56933443" target="_blank">BBC</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/06/cut-methane-emissions-rapidly-fight-climate-disasters-un-report-greenhouse-gas-global-heating" target="_blank">The Guardian</a> and many others highlighting our report - but now we're here to dive into the details. We'll be on at 17.00 CET (11am ET, 15 UT), ask us anything!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a former natural gas pipeline inspector, it was incredible to discover how much natural gas is leaked from our pipeline systems. The rules right now regarding the reparations of pipelines are based solely on the level of dangerousness for people and property. Even those leak classifications can be manipulated so that leaking pipes can remain that way for decades.</p>
<p>Is there any way to motivate politicians who speak so much about climate change to acknowledge this problem and hold utility companies accountable? I feel like even the public just have no idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
