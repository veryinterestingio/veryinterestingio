		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of electricity as the flow of charge between a high-energy area and a low-energy area. This is very similar to holding a ball up in the air and letting go: while you're holding the ball, the potential energy is high (it has the potential to fall some distance) relative to when it's on the ground (the potential for it to fall is zero) - the act of falling is the &quot;electricity&quot;.</p>
<p>So our bodies create electricity by using &quot;electrolytes&quot;, the major players of which are Sodium (Na) and Potassium (K). If we take a single nerve cell and look at how it sends an electric signal down its length, we'll see that the inside of the nerve has a lot of K and the outside of the nerve has a lot of Na. The amount of these is different, and there's a LOT more Na than there is K. Both of these are positively charged, but because there's a LOT more positive charge outside the cell... those ions really want to get in.</p>
<p>So that's our potential. Lots of Na outside, less K inside, the ions want to move in to make everything nice and even. Channels open for the Na to rush inside and K to rush out, and now, because they're moving, electricity is formed. Our bodies are able to use this electricity for a bunch of things, mainly cells sending signals to other cells. When the signal is done, those channels close up and pumps (Na-K ATPase) push Na back out of the cell and K into it to reset. This requires chemical energy, rather than electrical, which comes from breaking down sugar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is not &quot;electricity&quot; exactly - it is a cross-membrane potential.  That is a difference in charge which is kept separate by a cell membrane.  It is established by a high concentration of sodium on one side of the membrane, and potassium on the other.  Those concentrations are created and maintained by little sodium and potassium &quot;pumps&quot; in the membrane itself.  That's what I remember anyway....</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's important to note that the electricity in your body is not like the electricity in the wires powering your computer. In wires, electricity means electron flow. In your body, what we're actually talking about is the movement of charged atoms like sodium and potassium (which get in your body when you eat things like bananas!). These charged atoms, or 'ions', are pushed to different sides of a cell membrane, which means that charge is being concentrated in one area. When they are allowed to rush from the area of high concentration to the area of low concentration the 'flip' in charge can be picked up by machines like an EEG as a little blip of electrical potential.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>start with a cell, surrounded by a membrane. </p>
<p>the fluid inside the cell, and outside of the cell contains ions. these are just molecules with an electrical charge (it can be positive or negative charge). </p>
<p>if you pump negative ions into the cell, then the fluid in the cell will be negatively charged, compared to the fluid outside. you could also do this by pumping positive ions <strong>out</strong> of the cell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
