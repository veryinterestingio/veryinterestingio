		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes - the atmosphere has tides, but they are predominantly thermally driven. Consider if the Earth was stationary, and you suddenly turn on the sun. A portion of the atmosphere would heat up and expand, creating a pressure wave which would propagate around the Earth at a speed proportional to √h, where h is the column height of the atmosphere. If the Earth is spinning at about the same speed that the pressure waves are traveling, you can build up a large resonant effect which can result in a large mass excess around 45 degrees from the sun (see this <a href="https://d3i71xaburhd42.cloudfront.net/0497d7526ba9139393b27b9bad78760e42a2f7cd/2-Figure1-1.png" target="_blank">Figure</a>). This can create competing tidal torques which can completely cancel out the lunar tidal acceleration, and this effect may have been responsible for maintaining a <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016GL068912" target="_blank">constant day length of about 21 hours</a> for about a billion years during the Precambrian era.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good question, the answer is yes.  Atmospheric tides have been studied for centuries.  There are a lot of papers written about them,  google scholar is a great resource for these.   Atmospheric boundary layers fluctuations are influenced by the moon but solar forcing via heating, turbulence, and an assortment of waves cause much greater fluctuations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
