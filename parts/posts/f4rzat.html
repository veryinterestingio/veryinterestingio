		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you say the &quot;common cold&quot; you probably mean displaying symptoms such as sneezing, coughing, runny nose, maybe even vomiting. Most vertebrates have some form of upper respiratory infections that they can contract (I've even seen it in snakes). Cats are very prone to URIs </p>
<p>Many animals actually have their own influenza strain as well (these can hop around different species and even to humans)</p>
<p>Some animals are more prone to fevers, cats for example can spike a fever just from being stressed out too much. But any animal that can regulate their temperature can have one, a fever is the body's way of fighting infection (among other methods)</p>
<p>Animals can also have seasonal allergies, I've seen some poor dogs who are just allergic to pollen</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thing is that house pets rarely get exposed to other animals of the same species, and cross-species diseases are very uncommon, so they don't have a lot of chance to catch those sicknesses. Farmed animals on the other hand.... Avian flu, swine flu, etc</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They experience both of these things.  One example would be kennel cough.  Kennel cough is a catch-all term used to describe a usually self-limiting very contagious group of bacteria and viruses that cause coughing in dogs.  It usually takes 10-20d for them to clear it.  Sometimes, just like people, they can get secondary pneumonia from it.  If that happens, they can come down with a fever.  Fevers happen when their bodies have a systemic response to infection, but also as a response to other things (like cancer) sometimes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ferrets' respiratory systems are very similar to humans, and they can catch the same colds and flu that humans do. So ferrets are often used in lab settings to test colds and flu on them.  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4740393/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4740393/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4740393/</a></a> </p>
<p>That also means if you have a pet ferret you should be very careful not to bring home colds and flu from work (as I did when I was a kindergarten teacher with a pet ferret)!!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
