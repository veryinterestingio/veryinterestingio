		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My Master's thesis is in meat science so I can give a brief ELI5 as to why this is so. This question is also the main problem the lab grown meat industry is trying to tackle. </p>
<p>First and foremost, it's the fat. Not the amount or ratio of fats to other ingredients, but rather the type of fat. Fats are made up of fatty acids. The fatty acids in meat are much more diverse and flavourful than regular vegetable oils, particularly refined seed oils. Many of these fatty acids are detected by you in very minute concentrations. And so it's hard to emulate the exact flavour of meat because not only do you have to source the same kind of fatty acids from plants, but you also have to find the right balance of fatty acids and combine them. On top of that you have to do it economically.</p>
<p>Proteins is the next big one. Although most of the flavour is in the fat, the proteins in meat really are good at giving that distinct firmness and springiness when heated, whereas plants typically are either brittle or mushy. They are also involved in the formation of many different flavour compounds. Texture also affects the way flavours are perceived and released. </p>
<p>After cooking, you end up with hundreds, if not thousands of different flavour molecules and a unique texture to go with it. You can try to identify some of the major flavours and incorporate that into your recipe, but with hundreds of these flavours being detectable in such minute quantities, perhaps acting synergistically with other flavours, it's really difficult to even understand what is giving you these flavours. </p>
<p>You also need to consider the fact that beef and other red meats, and especially liver, is pretty much the only superfood and is loaded with an abundance of nutrients that plants do not contain. These nutrients are not necessarily flavours but you can still taste them and there is evidence that foods taste better when they contain nutrients you are deficient in it.</p>
<p>In short, meat is complex. The proteins and fats in meat are very diverse and unique. They undergo hundreds of reactions when cooking to produce hundreds of different unique flavours that are hard to adequately identify and quantify. Plants are much less diverse in their protein and especially fatty acid content and is why they are usually much more bland than meat and dairy products. Plant proteins are also usually very rigid and is why they are all typically sandy, mushy, or gritty, whereas animal proteins confer firmness and sponginess. </p>
<p>Edit: Never thought this would get this much attention! Glad to see all the positive (and negative) responses! Sorry if I can't reply to you but I saw two main questions and comments:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&quot;TIL meat science is a thing&quot; haha yes it is but my degree is actually in Food Science (also a thing) which more general, my thesis and focus though is on meat. Food Science explores the chemical, biological, and physical properties of food in order to create and optimize all the food products you enjoy in the 21st century.</p>
</li>
<li>&quot;I thought that texture was harder to replicate than flavour&quot; Texture is huge challenge as well, however I know that several cell-based meat startups that are struggling with flavour and in my opinion this will be something that people just get used to with the new product or will simply not like. You can look at texture under a microscope and look at what you are aiming for so you can work towards it somehow. With hundreds of different flavour compounds that all change and interact with one another with changes in temperature and environment, that are, detectable by humans to the ppm and even ppb, it's overwhelmingly complicated to understand which compounds, and proportion of compounds are crucial to the meat flavour. My gut tells me that some trace compounds act in synergy with one another making exact flavour replication a total nightmare.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s all about the ‘bliss point’, or the optimal levels of salt, sugar (or in the case of meat) fat in a particular food that makes it enjoyable. </p>
<p>It’s something that food companies are always trying to replicate in processed foods to make you want to eat more and more, even past the point of hunger satisfaction due to it’s deliciousness. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Meat, especially red meat, has a ton of fat and calories. Most fake meats are trying to be both vegan/vegetarian and also healthy at the same time. It's like how Diet Coke doesn't taste as good as regular Coke.</p>
<p>Also, people have gotten used to a certain taste when it comes to meat. When you eat a fake meat, you expect the taste to be like one food and get something else. People don't like this. It's like how people who are used to Diet Coke like it, but people who are used to Regular Coke find it jarring if they are suddenly given Diet instead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add a little bit from a taste perspective - the umami flavor is characteristic of most meats resulting from the fats, sugars, acids, salt etc. The umami flavor is rich and can be described as creating a full feeling in the mouth, and is what makes savory foods feel satisfying. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
