		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those annotations are not an official record of the game in the same way as the notation of the actual moves. If someone felt the need to add these annotations during the game, they could indeed mark as weak a move that turned out to be strong, but there would be nothing to stop them from going back and changing the annotation. Almost all the time, these annotations are added after the game by commentators. They're primarily used to draw attention to whatever part of the game the commentator thinks is interesting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is actually notation for a move that looks bad but may turn out good: ?!</p>
<p>For the others, sometimes there are moves that are just objectively bad or dubious with a very low likelihood of leading to something better. Chess is a very deeply analyzed game. Most opening moves and end game sequences are studied intensely and their relative strengths known.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
