		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some pretty bad answers in this thread ?. Guys I’m pretty sure OP knows what they are &amp; what causes them, he’s asking <em>why</em> they happen.</p>
<p>In short, we dont <em>really</em> know why they occur. We barely know why SSRIs work in the first place, and a lot of the withdrawal symptoms are an even bigger mystery. One theory is that discontinuation of these drugs leads to temporarily low GABA levels. Since low GABA has been liked to increased seizure risk, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-superhuman-mind/201710/what-causes-brain-zaps" target="_blank">it is postulated</a> that these brain zaps might be small, localised seizures.</p>
<p>We do know that despite ther discomfort, they’re usually harmless and in almost all cases disappear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve commented this elsewhere in the thread, but just for visibility- a single fluoxetine will stop the “brain zaps” occurring when you are coming off other SSRIs, and it is crazy that drs don’t routinely give patients this option (especially for antidepressants with horrible withdrawals like venlafaxine) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best eli5 theory I've heard it's that a lack of serotonin in certain parts of the brain can lower the firing threshold for certain synapses, which causes a chain of neurons to fire rapidly, resulting in the unpleasant zap-zap-zap sensation; for that theory to hold water, serotonin would therefore have to act almost like a down-regulator for certain types of synapse, perhaps?</p>
<p>I've had it a lot when withdrawing from certain medication, and also get it together with sleep paralysis some nights.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
