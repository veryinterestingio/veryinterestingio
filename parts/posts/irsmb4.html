		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Focusing on the DNA tests, they don't measure the amount of &quot;Korean-ness&quot;.  They measure the presence or absence of hundreds of different harmless mutations.  Some of these mutations are most commonly found in people from a particular region, so the more of them you have, the more of your ancestors probably came from that region.</p>
<p>But those mutations didn't necessarily <em>originate</em> in that country.  For example, the DNA test might associate &quot;Korean-ness&quot; with one gene that originally mutated in China and was brought to Korea through migration 2000 years ago, another that was brought by Mongol invaders 800 years ago, a third that originated in Korea but is also now found in Japan and Manchuria, and a fourth that originated in Japan and was brought over during their invasions in the 16th century.</p>
<p>None of these genetic tags are uniquely Korean, they're all found in other parts of northeast Asia.  All the genetic test can tell you is that that particular combination of genetic tags is most often found in the modern people who've chosen to call themselves &quot;Korean&quot;.  But those people have ancestors from all over the map.</p>
<p>Nobody's a pureblood, everyone's a mongrel, and it's been like this for thousands and thousands of years.  &quot;Race&quot; is nothing more than a set of sharp-lined boundaries we humans have chosen to draw across the blurry mixture that is human variation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>there are genes more common in certain areas of the planet, but all that shows is where some of your genes originated.</p>
<p>think about this, why is it italian?  Italy wasn't unified until the 1800s.  So, why is that report showing italian and not something like sicilian or roman?  Or even Etruscan (iron age) or   Remedellian (copper age).   If it wanted  to show where the genes originated, it would be something like 42N 12W (the approximate location of Italy), the alps, or the Tiber river (major geographic landmarks).</p>
<p>&quot;Italian&quot; is a label that the people currently living in the areas mentioned call themselves. It's just made up.  If you reset italy from back before the copper age, you'd end up with a completely different group of people with a different history that all called themselves something different.  Your genetic makeup would be the same (probably), but your report wouldn't say italian.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The idea that a person is &quot;White&quot; or &quot;Asian&quot; or &quot;Black&quot; is a social construct, because those categories are made up by people, and what counts as &quot;white&quot; varies from culture to culture, and from person to person. The idea of dividing humanity into sub-groups based on ethnic origin is a social construct, something that humans invented. The idea that certain humans whose ancestors came from specific regions are going to have minor genetic differences is science, but how we divide people up into groups is based on social norms and ideas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are real differences between people, but which ones are considered important and worth classifying, and how they are classified are up to humans entirely. One person may be considered different races depending on who's judging, for example. Who counts as which race has varied quite a lot over time. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Italy and Korea, and any nation, is a construct of humanity. Nothing is fundamentally different in the planet itself on one side of a country's border or the other. If the land were divided in a completely different way, you could still pick out alleles (gene variants) more common in one area than another and classify people that way. Also, some people have tried sending their DNA to multiple DNA testing companies and got results that were different! A lot is up to subjective, human interpretation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no scientific definition of race.  Human is a species.  There are no sub-species or &quot;breeds&quot; of human.  And the socially constructed definition of race has changed significantly over time.  For example, you'll never hear anyone say a person is of the Irish race anymore, but 100 years ago you would have.  Just as nationality is a social construct defined by made up borders, so race is a social construct with rather poorly defined borders.  For example, is someone from Egypt a member of the African race?  After all, they live on the African continent.  Or are they of the Arab race, because of their culture?  If it's because of their culture, then if an child whose parents were born in Sweden were raised in the Arab culture of Egypt, would they be of the Arab race even though their ancestry is nordic?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
