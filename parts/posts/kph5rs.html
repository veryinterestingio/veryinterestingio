		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several organs between your lungs. For example your digestive tract and heart. Having a single big lung would require som different placement of these which might not be optimal. In addition there are several types of injuries which mostly affect one lung. And you can survive on one lung while the other heals up. So having two lungs might have some advantages to survival. That being said evolution rarely finds the best solution as it will optimize the solution it found rather then find a completely new one. So the fact that we evolved two lungs is rather random and there may be more efficient ways to take up oxygen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other answers, bilateral symmetry. To simplify, organs placed on the center line of the body exist as a single organ: mouth, nose, trachea, esophagus, stomach, etc. Organs placed to the side exist as a pair: eyes, ears, limbs, lungs, kidneys.</p>
<p>Yes, there are some organs that exist as a single organ that aren't strictly on the center line of the body: heart, liver, etc. However, these organs develop in the embryo from tissue on the center line and later move off the center line.</p>
<p>So the lungs developed as a pair of organs because it works fine that way. The diaphragm can't really exist as a pair of diaphragms with our current body structure. Muscles need to attach to bones to have something rigid to pull against. There are no bones vertically separating the left &amp; right sides of the torso, so there is nothing for a &quot;half-diaphragm&quot; to pull against. So the diaphragm is a single structure rather than a pair.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is mostly redundancy. You could live on one lung and one kidney and probably half of your liver, without the stuff in your throat (dunno how they're called). You can live with one foot one hand one eye. Hell you can live with only the torso and head plus half your organs.</p>
<p>But as many people have pointed out: if something goes wrong you have a spare part that works on its own sufficiently enough to keep you alive while you heal the other part.</p>
<p>Being shot in the lung is painful but survivable. Being shot on your ONLY lung less so.</p>
<p>A single lung would probably work as we have many single organs eg the liver which is hefty and big. Evolution tends to erase unnecessary stuff. Many people don't have a specific sinew in their forearm which serves no purpose anymore. (Google it for source, am to lazy now)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't see how a single lung would work any different than what you have now. It would still need to divide the air passages smaller and smaller to get the surface area you need to get good gas exchanges. The one big lung will still have a left and right sides since it would need to go around the heart.</p>
<p>In a sense, you can consider yourself to have five lungs. Three lobes on the right side and two on the left. Each lobe is surrounded by it's own membrane and has separate air and blood supply. We just group the right ones and left ones together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
