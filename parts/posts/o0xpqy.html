		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The protons and neutrons in atoms are made up of particles called quarks.  Quarks have a very low mass and what is ultimately giving a proton/neutron most of its mass is that fact that the quarks inside of them are spinning at close to the speed of light.</p>
<p>There are three quarks in a proton.  Two of those quarks have a charge of +2/3.  One of them has a charge of -1/3.  The quarks themselves are arranged in a sort of triangular shape.  At large distances these charges cancel out so that a proton appears to have a net charge of about 1, and for nearly all applications we can consider that charge to be 1.  But its not <em>exactly</em> 1 - it varies depending on the position of the quarks relative to you.  </p>
<p>When the negatively charged quark is on the opposite side of the proton you experience a charge that is very, very slightly stronger than 1.  When it is on the side of the proton facing you, the charge is very, very slightly less than 1.  </p>
<p>Neutrons work the same way, except the one of the quarks in a neutron has a charge of 2/3 while the other two have charges of -1/3.  So depending on the position of the quarks in a neutron, you will experience a charge either slightly higher or lower than 0.</p>
<p>This extremely slight net charge is sufficient for a proton or neutron with &quot;0&quot; energy to, nonetheless, cause other nearby protons and neutrons to wobble a bit, resulting in them having some very minimal amount of energy.  This, in turn, causes atoms to have a constant, slight wobble (which will also result in the wobbling atoms very slightly &quot;bumping&quot; into nearby atoms).</p>
<p>We can't stop this wobble because on a very fundamental level we don't have any mechanism to influence the quarks inside of proton/neutron, so we can't slow them down.  Also, because the speed of the quarks is, itself, responsible for most of the mass of the proton/neutron, if you did somehow manage to slow those quarks down they would stop being a proton/neutron and start being something else, which doesn't necessarily solve the problem if what they turn into can't be measured, like dark matter - or if the energy in the quarks ends up getting liberated, such as through the transformation of a quark into high energy electrons or positrons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A solid is a structured configuration of molecules or atoms and forms in low temperatures because for most molecules this structured way has a lower energy then a less structured fluid or gas. This is because of the interactions between the molecules or atoms. As a simplified &quot;rule&quot; you could say: if the interactions between molecules is higher, it will form a solid at higher temperature. For helium these interactions are very weak.</p>
<p>A second effect is quantum uncertainty. For very light particles the uncertainty on the position is relatively large compared to the distances in possible solids of those particles. For hydrogen (I forgot if it was also the case for helium, it had been a long time since my studies) the uncertainty is even bigger then the distances between particles, so it can't form a structured lattice. </p>
<p>Helium, and some other atoms, will form an even more energetically favourable phase before they could become solid. They form a bose-einstein condensate, also called super-fluid helium. This is fundamentally different from a fluid. It is a quantum state were most of the helium atoms are in exactly the same state (have the same quantum numbers).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>0K is the theoretical minimum point of energy - not the point of <em>zero</em> energy. </p>
<p>Pressure plays a big role too. Substances move toward a solid state as temperatures decrease <strong>or as pressure increases</strong>. So if there is a change in pressure at absolute zero, there could be a state change.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
