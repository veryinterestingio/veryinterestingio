		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You bet! In fact, this is how ultraviolet and infrared radiation were discovered! </p>
<p>In 1800, William Herschel (who also discovered Uranus!) used a prism to break up sunlight and attempted to measure the temperatures of the different colors. He found that when he moved his thermometer past the red end of the spectrum he measured a much higher temperature than expected (this should have been a control). He called his discovery 'calorific rays' or 'heat rays.' Today, we call it infrared, being that it's below red in the EM spectrum.</p>
<p>In 1801, Johann Ritter was doing a similar experiment, using the violet end of the visible spectrum. He was exposing chemicals to light of different colors to see how it effected chemical reaction rates. By going past the violet end of the spectrum he found the greatest enhancement in the reaction rate! They were called 'chemical rays' for a time, until more advanced electromagnetic theory managed to unify sporadic discoveries like these into a unified EM spectrum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since you specifically asked about a rainbow and the top answers are detailing prisms, <a href="https://www.atoptics.co.uk/fz685.htm" target="_blank">here is an IR photo of a rainbow</a>. It does indeed stretch much further past the red part of the rainbow. I couldnt find a cutaway comparison for the UV side of the spectrum, but <a href="https://www.ultravioletphotography.com/content/index.php/topic/2420-rainbow-in-uv-and-ir/" target="_blank">this page</a> includes several different photos of the same rainbow with different UV and IR filters. Especially in the first two photos you can see a very strong UV component.</p>
<p>As far as further wavelengths like radio and x rays, that is unlikely. Rainbows are formed by light rays going into a raindrop, reflecting, and coming back out, refracting at the points where it enters a d leaves the raindrop. <del>This means that only wavelengths that are mostly transparent to water will be a part of the rainbow, and outside of the visible wavelengths and the IR and UV closest to visible, <a href="http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/images/water_spectrum_2.gif" target="_blank">water strongly absorbs almost all other wavelengths</a>.</del> This part is probably incorrect, see further discussion in the replies. </p>
<p>Edit: additionally, rainbows occur because the refractive index of water in the visible range increases for higher frequencies of light. This means that blue light gets bent more than red light, and UV light gets bent the most and IR the least. However, beyond near IR and UV wavelengths, <a href="http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/dielectric_constant.html#refract" target="_blank">this relationship breaks down</a>, and the refractive index of water bounces around chaotically for different wavelengths well beyond visible light. This means that, even for the few wavelengths that water does not strongly absorb, they will not fit neatly into the ordered spectrum of the rainbow, and could even be somewhere in the middle overlapping the visible rainbow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I did the compositing, but sadly don't know where the original channels are from. They were posted in this thread as an imgur link:  <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/69mjxt/do_rainbows_also_have_sections_in_the_infrared/dh7qufa/" target="_blank">Do rainbows also have sections in the infrared and/or ultraviolet spectrum?</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. This is how infrared was discovered. A scientist studying refraction discovered that a thermometer sitting on the table just out of the rainbow by the red side was still being influenced by something as though it was still in an invisible color of that rainbow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are indeed invisible infrared and UV frequencies at the ends of the rainbow, but it does not go up and down the spectrum forever.  Sufficiently long wavelengths are outside the geometric optics approximation and do not obey the normal refraction rules from which rainbows arise.  (They are too low resolution to &quot;see&quot;  water droplets.)  Likewise, x-rays have short enough wavelengths that they can start to &quot;see&quot; individual water molecules, break them apart, etc.</p>
<p>Maybe an expert can say something more specific.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
