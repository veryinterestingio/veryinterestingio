		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So others have already rightfully answered that these are obvious scams.</p>
<p>But why an extended car warranty?  Probably just because it works, so others have copied it.</p>
<p>It actually makes a lot of sense - most people (or at least a large % of people) own cars.  So they can call any random number and there’s a very good chance that person owns a car.  If they told you they were trying to contact you about your home warranty or a vacation you recently booked, you can quickly identify it as a scam if neither of those two situations apply to you.  But if you own a car and you’re not familiar with this scam, there’s a good chance you’d at least consider that it may be a legitimate call.</p>
<p>Also, car warranties DO expire.  So once again, the premise behind the call is actually very reasonable.  The only reason that these calls are instantly recognized as a scam is because we get them all the time.  Or think of it this way - if people can be fooled by something as absurd as the Nigerian Prince scam, an expired car warranty scam seems very reasonable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
