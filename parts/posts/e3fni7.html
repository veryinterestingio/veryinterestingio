To humans most chimpanzees look the same, although chimpanzees can distinguish each other by seeing each others faces most of the time. Some other common methods animals use to distinguish each other are by smell and sounds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

So if you grew up in Russia and had seen very few Koreans they are all going to look very similar to you and vice versa.

<p>Zebras are known to use stripe patterns, for example. Elephants use their ears. Dogs use their scent, as do most felids.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>“The ability to recognize same-species faces has been shown in many animals, including chimpanzees [17], rhesus macaques [15,17], cattle [18,19], dairy goats [20,21], pigeons [22], honey bees [23] and sheep [24]. Furthermore, a small number of studies show that some animal species, including rhesus macaques [25], horses [26], dogs [27], mockingbirds [28] and sheep [29] can distinguish faces of individuals from other species (i.e. cross-species paradigm).”</p>
