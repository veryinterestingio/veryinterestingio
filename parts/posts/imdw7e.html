Ask us anything, from our daily research to the organization of a large conference during COVID19! We have some special experts on</p>
<ul>
<li>Inflation: The mind-bogglingly fast expansion of the Universe in a fraction of the first second. It turned tiny quantum fluctuation into the seeds for the galaxies and clusters we see today</li>
<li>The Cosmic Microwave background: The radiation reaching us from a few hundred thousand years after the Big Bang. It shows us how our universe was like, 13.4 billion years ago</li>
<li>Large Scale Structure: Matter in the Universe forms a &quot;cosmic web&quot; with clusters, filaments and voids. The positions of galaxies in the sky shows imprints of the physics in the early universe</li>
<li>Dark Matter: Most matter in the universe seems to be &quot;Dark Matter&quot;, i.e. not noticeable through any means except for its effect on light and other matter via gravity</li>
<li>Gravitational Lensing: Matter in the universe bends the path of light. This allows us to &quot;see&quot; the (invisible) dark matter in the Universe and how it is distributed</li>
<li><em>And ask anything else you want to know!</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Answering your questions tonight are</p>
<ul>
<li>Alexandre Adler: u/bachpropagate I’m a PhD student in cosmology at Stockholm University. I mainly work on modeling sources of systematic errors for cosmic microwave background polarization experiments. You can find me on twitter @BachPropagate.</li>
<li>Alex Gough: u/acwgough PhD student: Analytic techniques for studying clustering into the nonlinear regime, and on how to develop clever statistics to extract cosmological information. Previous work on modelling galactic foregrounds for CMB physics. Twitter: @acwgough.</li>
<li>Arthur Tsang: u/onymous_ocelot Strong gravitational lensing and how we can use perturbations in lensed images to learn more about dark matter at smaller scales.</li>
<li>Benjamin Wallisch: Cosmological probes of particle physics, neutrinos, early universe, cosmological probes of inflation, cosmic microwave background, large-scale structure of the universe.</li>
<li>Giulia Giannini: u/astrowberries PhD student at IFAE in Spain. Studies weak lensing of distant galaxies as cosmological probes of dark energy.</li>
<li>Hayley Macpherson: u/cosmohay. Numerical (and general) relativity, and cosmological simulations of large-scale structure formation</li>
<li>Katie Mack: u/astro_katie. cosmology, dark matter, early universe, black holes, galaxy formation, end of universe</li>
<li>Robert Lilow: (theoretical models for the) gravitational clustering of cosmic matter. (reconstruction of the) matter distribution in the local Universe.</li>
<li>Robert Reischke: /u/rfreischke Large-scale structure, weak gravitational lensing, intensity mapping and statistics</li>
<li>Shaun Hotchkiss: u/just_shaun large scale structure, fuzzy dark matter, compact object in the early universe, inflation. Twitter: @just_shaun</li>
<li>Stefan Heimersheim: u/Stefan-Cosmo, 21cm cosmology, Cosmic Microwave Background, Dark Matter. Twitter: @AskScience_IoA</li>
<li>Tilman Tröster u/space_statistics: weak gravitational lensing, large-scale structure, statistics</li>
<li>Valentina Cesare u/vale_astro: PhD working on modified theories of gravity on galaxy scale</li>
</ul>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's awesome you're doing this AMA! Thank you very much for your work.</p>
<p>I have two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Does CMBR change with time? Will the scientists of the near future have to look past microwaves in order to detect it? What about a million years in the future?</p>
</li>
<li>Is singularity inside a black hole the only plausible explanation to what's inside of it? Could it be a different state of matter that only occurs when an object reaches its Schwartzshild radius?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Question for everyone, but definitely /u/acwgough in particular. Are there any computational barriers standing in the way of a better understanding (or verification) of some of these theories? How useful would 10x or 100x more compute power be for your work? I'd also be curious to hear about the hardware used for these simulations, and any open source software packages used. </p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A long time ago I had an astronomy teacher who was teaching our class about the expansion if the universe. He said it was expanding at the speed of light in all directions. I asked him: &quot;if the universe is expanding and has a size that implies that it has an edge. So what is it expanding into? What on the other side?&quot; He replied &quot;the future&quot;. This kinda blew my mind and I was wondering if you could elaborate on this topic. Can you explain what's on the other side? Can you explain how the future can be a physical space, or have an edge?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I never really understood electromagnetic waves. Gravitational waves are pretty easy to understand: space-time itself rippling is a pretty straightforward concept. </p>
<p>But the radio waves we use every day? That's a rough one. They're waves, but what is it that's vibrating?</p>
<p>Are we living in an endless sea of unmoving &quot;radio medium&quot; that vibrates at various frequencies when waves are emitted?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
