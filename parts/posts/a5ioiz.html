		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Elephants have been seen using sticks and other plant matter to throw onto and partially bury their dead friends and relatives. They also show behavior similar to humans visiting graves of loved ones, such as stopping by old skeletons when they pass by and caressing them with their trunks. They've even been seen &quot;burying&quot; other animals and enacting typical mourning behavior, at least one of which was a sleeping human who had a very rude awakening.</p>
<p>Elephants are crazy smart, man.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not burying but I saw a documentary on the BBC where they made a robot langur monkey with cameras in the eyes to learn more about langur in their natural habitat and but it in with a group of them, if I remember correctly the robot falls and the other lemurs try to help it and when they think it's dead they all gather around and pay respects or share empathy with one another</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honey bees have &quot;undertaker&quot; bees whose job it is to drag the dead out, fly them a bit, and drop them. I am a beekeeper. I can accidentally squish a bee, and within seconds another bee will be dragging out its carcass.</p>
<p>Bees also sometimes follow a behavior called altruistic dying. When they know its their time to die, and /or they are infected with a disease, they will fly away from their hive, just to die. This is most apparant in the dead of winter, when you see bees committing obvious suicide by flying out into the freezing cold. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Crows cant bury their dead for obvious reasons, but they do gather around the dead and hold what looks like a 'funeral'. Although experts have suggested that they are not actually mourning, they simply want to know the cause of death, in case its a danger to them as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
