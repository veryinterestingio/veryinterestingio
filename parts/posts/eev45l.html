		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So my understanding is that, according to the standard model, the fundamental particles are all point particles that occupy no space (or atleast, it is meaningless to talk about them having a size).</p>
<p>But if I wanted to identify a &quot;physical object&quot; (I know that gets a bit fuzzy at these scales) that occupies some physical space, it must be some form of hadron, no?  From looking online, it appears protons have a diameter of roughly 1e-15m, but is there anything smaller than that?  I thought at first mesons might be, as they are composed  of only two fundamental particles, but Wikipedia says that they are actually larger than protons.  That leads me to believe that maybe more quarks lead to smaller objects, but that now gets in a territory that I know absolutely nothing about.</p>
<p>So, is there a widely accepted &quot;smallest&quot; thing?  Something that still has an accepted or measured (or even predicted size) that <em>isn't</em> a concept like the Planck length.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Laymen classification/measurements are generally bad questions when you dig into it, because when you are asking for a size, you need to specify how you are measuring it. Especially with vague terms like &quot;physical object&quot;.</p>
<p>A few examples here: How big is, an atom, a rocky planet, gas giant, and the length of the coastline of Britain.</p>
<p>An atom is easy at first glance, it's the surface, right? But since there isn't a solid shell of anything, and the electrons orbit in probabilistic clouds, where is the edge really? And what about its size when viewed by a neutron, rather than another atom or electron? They don't interact with the electrons (or at least, a far smaller chance), so it's going to think the atom is just the nucleus at the center.^(1)</p>
<p>A rocky planet gets harder. Sure, it's got a solid surface, but what about its atmosphere? Isn't it part of the planet too? Shouldn't that be counted towards how big it is? And if so, how whispy of an atmosphere counts as atmosphere before it is interplanetary gas? If you want to argue the atmosphere is not rigidly bound, what about the oceans? Do they count? If not, what about an ocean planet with water thousands of km deep, to the point where the &quot;water size&quot; vs &quot;land size&quot; is significantly different.</p>
<p>Then this also leads to a gas giant. Since it's gas all the way down to the core, how &quot;big&quot; is Jupiter? We currently define its size as when the atmospheric pressure is 1 ATM, but that's really arbitrary. But the alternative of measuring the core size is so far divorced from how useful it is, it's not useful in normal contexts.</p>
<p>The coastline of Britain is another aspect of how fuzzy measurements get when you get down to it. The smaller your ruler, the more precise, and generally the larger the coastline can get, because you are now measuring a lot more of the fine details that would have been glossed over with a larger ruler. In fact, the non-disputed Portuguese and Spanish border is different depending on who you ask (987 km for the Portuguese, 1214 for the Spanish) because they measure it differently^(2).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So, with all that out of the way, to answer your question as best as we can, with a given that it has to be a composite particle, probably some sort of Pentaquark made up of <del>Top and Bottom</del> Bottom and Charm quarks^(3). </p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind, is that in particle physics, the more massive an object is, the &quot;smaller&quot; it is, because it is more localized because of the greater mass allowing it to have less uncertainty in its position, thus &quot;smaller&quot;.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT: Hmm, did not expect this to gain so much traction. I tried addressing specific points directly to the respective posters, and will be editing this post to fix inaccuracies after I independently confirm them. And with proper formatting and links.</p>

<li>There are standardized definitions for the size of atoms, but also several different ways to measure it, giving slightly different results. The point being made, is that you need to specify how you are measuring them, and make sure to compare to others using the same definitions. And concepts like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_section_(physics)" target="_blank">cross sections</a> are useful for describing particle sizes, to bring &quot;sizes&quot; to a more intuitive level, even if it requires you to ask how you are measuring the size.</li>
<li>There's some question over the validity of the Portugese/Spanish border survey results being so drastically different, even acconting for disputed territory, however I was not able to find a primary source for it, only secondary sources referencing different countries measuring their borders differently. Unfortunately, the secondary source is a print source (General Systems: Yearbook of the Society for the Advancement of General Systems Theory, Volume 6, page 169), and is difficult to follow up and track down the primary source. Regardless, the principals behind the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastline_paradox" target="_blank">Coastline Paradox</a> still apply, even if this specific example was found to be in error.</li>
<li>Top quarks are too unstable for gluons to interact with in time to condense them into Hadrons. Thanks /u/JiggyNye and /u/nuublarg for catching that.</li>
</ol>
<p>The key takeaway for this post is intended to emphasize the importancs on being precise on defining what you are measuring. You can make comparisons between objects, but so long as you are doing so consistently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Would you count a microscopic black hole?  It would evaporate almost instantaneously (at least if the Hawking radiation hypothesis is correct) and would have no accessible internal structure, but in principle a microscopic black hole could exist with a mass on the order of the Planck mass and a Schwarzschild radius on the order of the Planck length.  It's probably not quite what you're thinking of though, and we certainly can't actually measure something that small, let alone produce one.  I'd also expect a proper theory of quantum gravity to be relevant to its dynamics, and we don't have one of those yet either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The concept of &quot;taking up space&quot; is kind of fuzzy at the quantum level. I don't know if  I would say it is meaningless to talk about the size of fundamental particles, but you certainly can't say that there is a single meaning of size for them. One way you could define size is as the volume of an area for which the particle's wavefunction has a high amplitude, but you would need to set some threshold, for example &quot;the particle is 99.9% likely to be inside of this volume.&quot; But you can't just assign a number for all particles of a given type, since the size of the wafefunction depends on the quantum state of the individual particle.</p>
<p>Perhaps a more useful way to think about size is with the &quot;cross-section&quot;.  One way to think of a cross section is, if you throw another particle at it, how big is the target you need to hit for the two particles to interact is some way. Typically, this is easier to measure than the actual size of the wafefunction (although the two are correlated).  However, it is important to note that the cross section is dependent on the types of particles, and the energy involved in the interaction, so again there isn't a single number. But you can use a specific type of interaction as a proxy for the size of the particle. For example, you can compare the size of atoms by comparing the cross section for X-Rays at a specific frequency.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
