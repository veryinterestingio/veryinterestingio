		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey I'm a wildlife biologist currently working in predation management. /u/DoomGoober has an excellent answer from the camouflage development perspective. Pixelated and multi-terrain (e.g. multicam) patterns are kind of &quot;jack of all trades&quot; patterns designed to work decently in multiple environments. They are also attempts at hiding moving soldiers a bit better (though I doubt they are very effective at this). Obviously until/unless adaptive camo actually becomes a thing, it would be impossible to outfit soldiers with the perfect camo every time since soldiers can move through drastically different environments even on a single patrol. So militaries are more interested in getting decent camo patterns that give their soldiers a slight edge.</p>
<p>Hunters don't have that problem. They typically either post up in a stand or are moving very slowly through a single block of woods and can therefore carefully match their photorealistic hunter's camo exactly to the terrain. It's why there are so, so many hunter's camo patterns. They all might look the same at first glance, but if you look more closely you can see the subtle but important differences. If you pick the right pattern and stand still, you can become pretty much invisible. But if you move from the woods to a grassy meadow, for example, you'll badly stick out. A soldier in multicam would blend in decently in either situation.</p>
<p>Animals see differently than we do. Humans have light receptors capable of detecting red, green, and blue, called trichromatic vision. Every color you see is either that color or a mix. </p>
<p>Most mammals, however, are dichromats and only have two receptors. Physiologically, there's evidence that dichromats can actually see better in low light conditions and thus it would be selected for nocturnal or crepuscular animals, which describes most mammals. This means that most mammals are colorblind in some form or another and is why hunter's orange is perfectly fine for deer and hog hunting. That color won't appear that different from the woods to those animals but sticks out like crazy to humans. It's perfect for hunter's safety.</p>
<p>Birds, on the otherhand, are tetrochromats. They can actually see more colors across a wider spectrum than we can. For awhile, it was assumed that this gave them better resolution in differentiating colors, and so when hunting birds it was thought to be vital to have perfect camouflage. That's why turkey hunters are often exempt from the orange hunting rules and are camouflaged head to toe, including a camo mask and camo wrap around their rifle/shotgun. Any slight deviation and the birds would see and bail. Recently, however, research suggests that this is overblown. They can see a wider range of colors than we can, like ultraviolet, but can't necessarily differentiate between them any better than we can. However, it would still be a bad idea to wear hunter's orange or even military camo when bird hunting because their vision tends to be so excellent otherwise.</p>
<p>Lastly, animals live in the woods (shocker, I know) and are <em>very</em> attuned to any changes. Military camouflage often just doesn't quite blend in enough to prevent wild animals from noticing something is off and bolting. Hunter's camo, when matched correctly, works much better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The philosophy of digital camo is that it is made of small blotches of color (the individual &quot;pixels&quot;) but the individual pixels together form large blotches (where many similar colored pixels are close to each other.)</p>
<p>At a distance, large blotches camo you better while up close, small blotches camo you better.</p>
<p>Digital camo is supposed to have a bit of both. Anyone saying that digital camo supposedly scrambles the human visual system is talking marketing B.S. as none of the studies I have seen mention anything about scrambling visual systems. Digital camo is just better up close without sacrificing too much at a distance.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that digital camo is not some wonder camo. Studies have shown that digital camo increased the time from 1 second to find someone to 2.5 seconds in certain tests. The point of camo is to delay identification and slow the enemy, not really hide the soldiers, per se. The soldiers will be spotted if someone is looking for them.</p>
<p>Also, digital camo has been found to be worse in some situations... Camo is very situational and so you want something that generally works in most situations.</p>
<p>Edit: Whoops, to answer the question: if you are using camo to hunt, you should probably choose a camo pattern that works best at the range where the animal is likely to detect you visually (which will also be related to the range of your weapon.) Since digital camo is a bit of a compromise, it might not be best for hunting which will probably have more set distance ranges. Also, choose camo that matches the specific foliage/colors/surrounding of your hunting enviornment if you can (obviously.)</p>
<p>Edit2: The YouTube channel &quot;Task and Purpose&quot; recently made fun of the terrible digital UCP camo that was proposed to replace all camo with one camo pattern. It revealed the military approach to camo is a logistics problem more than a tactical problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Deer are red-green colorblind and extremely sensitive to movement. Dressing in bright orange and not moving is fine. Anything moving differently than the leaves will be suspicious, large or small pattern. Their vision isn't very sharp anyways, because of the pupil shape.That also keeps the ground in somewhat better focus than the rest of the field of vision. Moving above them could help. </p>
<p>If you want to wear military uniforms, take the UV patches off. Those they do see well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Excusing the discussion around pixalation's effect on the brain, I will just highlight that digital camouflage patterns generally are more successful due to the smaller, more complex nature of the pattern. Digital patterns ultimately work on the same layer of thinking that makes patterns like British DPM, or German Flecktarn successful; the shapes are smaller and the nuance of color mean easy confusion when used in the appropriate background. </p>
<p>I can't speak to how this plays out with animals, since color and shape are interpreted by various animals in different ways. Deer, as I understand, cannot perceive red colors. Dogs likewise are colorblind. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, most hunting camouflage patterns are highly complex designs, some even being based around fractal schemes that are much more smaller and complex versus typical military patterns like MARPAT. Even Realtree is quite complex</p>
<p>So, I'd say there's not necessarily a reason why digital patterns shouldn't work. Though TBH, I'd also say that existing hunting patterns do a better job versus most digital patterns exactly because of the complexity here. Likewise, most hunting patterns simply are better situated to the environment and seasonal shifts at play. MARPAT has to work year round, from either the Pacific Northwest to grassland plains. Many hunting patterns can be specific to one area, and one season.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
