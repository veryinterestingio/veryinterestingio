		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctors are not required to accept all patients, any more than lawyers are required to accept any criminal that calls them up.</p>
<p>One thing professionals factor into business decisions is &quot;how much will it cost, and what will I get paid?&quot;.  Medicare pays less and costs much more in terms of paperwork, presuming that actually providing the medical care costs the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Canada (as in many other nations) where we have a monopsony doctors can reject patients, too. They do it for various reasons: too many clients already, non-compliance on advice etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone else already said it pretty well.  Each insurance company has their own silly hurdles to jump through to recognize a visit as being legitimate and worthy of being paid.  And even if it is legit, some insurance companies will argue over every distinct charge in the visit/procedure, meaning you might only get a fraction of the pay you bill.</p>
<p>My dad's a physician, and he once told me that, in his experience, Medicare would usually give you about 1/5 of the money you asked for, after fighting for several months.  I think he said his group practice even has a blanket ban on seeing Medicare patients, for that same reason.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because if they didn’t, the doctors couldn’t stay in business. Most people don’t realize how LITTLE providers get paid by Medicare. It’s often below cost. Providers MUST see private insurance patients to break even, let alone make a profit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
