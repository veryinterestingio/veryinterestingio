<p>However, for plastic containers or cutlery, that is not the case. If I use residual lather to wash them, it will just spread oil over everything and make it worse. Even if I pump detergent on the sponge directly and lather it up and use that, the plastic will still not be clean. I can only get plastic clean if I apply detergent directly to the item I am washing. I have noticed this phenomenon only for plastic objects and never metal or ceramic, or even wood.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ceramics and metals tend to repel neither water, nor oil, so soaps have an easy time time washing oils off of those surfaces. The issue with using soaps on plastics is that the surface of the plastic is slightly hydrophobic, so instead of forming a soap membrane around the oil spots, it more or less creates a thin film over the entirety of the surface, diminishing the effectiveness of the soap.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>It seems to work a LOT better then in a sink full of other greasy objects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
