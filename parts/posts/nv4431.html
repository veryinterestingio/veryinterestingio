		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a number of factors that lead to this.</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a larger population of children (if nothing else changed there would be more of everything illness wise.)</li>
<li>People are more willing to talk about their issues.</li>
<li>There is a better understanding of what the issue is.</li>
<li>There are treatment options that never existed before and that makes diagnosis more worth pursuing.</li>
</ol>
<p>To think of this another way, dyslexia is not more prevalent than before, the portion of the population that has it has probably not changed. However, those kids were probably previously called lazy or stupid. There is an awareness of it, it gets detected better and it seems like it is more common than before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are three factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>More is known about Autism.  When parents and teachers aren't aware of autism, and even doctors don't know a great deal about it, the likelihood of a child making it far enough through the process to get a diagnosis are much lower - especially for mild cases.  Similarly, as more is known and the classification of the disorder changes, conditions that would once have been given other labels now fall within this heading.</li>
<li>Autism is more socially acceptable.  Not so very long ago, it was normal to refer to children on the autistic spectrum as &quot;mentally retarded&quot;.  Not only would parents be unlikely to seek out a diagnosis, but where it was diagnosed that information would be far less likely to be shared with others.</li>
<li>This greater awareness and greater acceptance also means that it is increasingly common for children who have not been diagnosed as autistic to be labelled as such by their parents.  These can be autistic children who haven't <em>yet</em> been diagnosed, or children who are not autistic and have other developmental, behavioural, or mental health problems that parents are misrepresenting (knowingly or not) as autistic.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The biggest factor is the reclassification of disorders in the DSM-V. Many individuals who were previously identified as having schizophrenia or an intellectual disability are now considered to have an ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder).</p>
