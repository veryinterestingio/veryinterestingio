		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The muscles that open your eyes and the muscles that close your eyes are both always turned on, pulling gently against each other. They are controlled by something like a set of scales. Whenever one set of muscles gets more active, the other set has to get less active. When you're wide awake, the &quot;open&quot; muscles are high on the scales. When you're asleep, the &quot;close&quot; muscles are high on the scale. When you're drowsy and your eyes are half open, the scales are balanced. Thing is, those scales move based on how awake or tired your <em>body</em> feels, not how your mind wants your body to feel. You can try to fight the scales, but if you stop paying attention, the scales slowly start to take back control.</p>
<p>That's why, when you're trying to go to sleep, sometimes your eyes start to open all on their own: because whether or not you want to be tired, the parts of your brain and your body that you can't control just aren't quite tired enough to want to push your eyes closed yet. It's like when you're trying to stay awake, but your eyes keep falling shut no matter how much you try to keep them open. That's just the opposite of what you asked about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I heard one day that the default position of our eyelids, using no muscles, is slightly open. On the opposite, having them wide open or completely shut require to activate sets of muscles.
Therefore if you want to rest your eyelids, leave them slightly open.</p>
<p>If I try it I can really feel the tension going away and coming back according to how much or little I open them.
Sorry no source.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>So unless I am more tired than a dog-tired dog, I need all sources of light to be off. Or, to save from being the annoying one, I sleep with a low-weight covering over my eyes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the same reason your fingers dont make a fist nor they are straight when you relax. one group of muscles straightens them when activated, and the opposute group curls them. even when muscles are relaxed, there is still some active tension, and equilibrium between these opposite tensions are the reason why fingers are slightly curled and eye lids are slightly opened. By the way muscle tension is why it is much easier to carry a living unconscious person rather than dead person, because dead person is completely relaxed and loose and is literarly like carying a sack of potatoes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
