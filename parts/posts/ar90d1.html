What changed? Is it down to early intervention in education or is it simply a difference in portrayal by the media?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of my friends has a younger sister with DS and is a special education teacher who works with preschool aged kids.</p>
<p>Part of the answer is that we now do what's called &quot;early intervention&quot; for kids with various disabilities. So this includes stuff like speech therapy, finding out if the kid has hearing problems, occupational therapy to work on fine and gross motor skills, all sorts of stuff. In years past this was not a thing, and not terribly long ago people with DS were just warehoused.</p>
<p>Early intervention is important because it helps kids get on a good track, and because stuff like DS isn't just a cognitive impairment, it's a whole syndrome. So occupational therapy helps with the tendency for low muscle tone, and speech therapy helps with communication that can be complicated by the tendency for hearing loss and enlarged tongue, and all that sort of stuff. When the kids and their families are given tools early on, they start off on more solid ground, and they aren't left behind the kid's peers. So when the kid gets to school they are more able to engage in and benefit from stuff like spending more time in regular lessons with non-impaired students.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My eldest daughter has DS and turns 19 next month so I feel i can give my opinion. A few decades ago mothers were told to give the baby up to an institution, forget about it, go home and have anther baby.
Nowadays society is a lot more accepting of those that are not &quot;normal&quot;. My then wife and I were advised to do the best we could for our daughter. No one will ever reach their full potential if they are kept in a corner for their whole lives.
My daughter finished high school last year, she has a job one day a week, she has a full social life, goes to the pool a couple of times a week, goes to the library, buys her own lunch,  loves books, movies and music.
She's as best a person as I've tried to help her be. If she was born a few decades ago she may already have died from lack of care. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are also a lot more resources and knowledge. We know now that people with DS vary tremendously in their abilities and health. It is largely a spectrum with how people with DS are affected by it. Because of this, we are able to tailor their education and/or training. My mom was a case manager for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Some of them are able to hold down jobs, live largely independently, etc. Some need more round the clock care. But treating them as individuals and having the financial and social resources to do so allows them to thrive in whatever makes the most sense for them. Not too long ago many people with intellectual disabilities were just institutionalized and not able to live to their full potential. And they were marginalized and hidden from society. This is still an ongoing problem, but now many in this population are in &quot;regular&quot; schools, have jobs in the public, etc, so society is becoming more accepting. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Education, acceptance, and intervention. Down syndrome is having 3 of the 21st chromosome, where as a person without DS only has 2. It causes learning difficulties, social difficulties, trouble with speech, ect. It also makes the person more prone to certain heart abnormalities, ear and throat issues, hearing problems, etc. </p>
<p>A few decades ago when an infant was diagnosed they would be put in a home. </p>
<p>Now, we understand DS and what to do for treatments. Speech therapy, medication, personal aides are all beneficial and are luckily now available to patients with DS. </p>
<p>Kids with DS just need a little extra help, in all aspects. There's are also different degrees of DS. </p>
<p>As another commenter mentioned, his daughter is 19 with a job, social life, and has graduated highschool. She is speaking, using the restroom on her own, and functional. </p>
<p>My brother, on the other hand, is 15 and still in Pampers, non-verbal, and has an array of the health issues I mentioned above. He has a mental age of around 3-4 years old. He will never live on his own, he will never be functional, but with my family's support, his wonderful school and aides, and modern medicine he is a happy and healthy young man who loves music, puzzles, and his little sister (His mental age is very close to her physical age) </p>
<p>I also want to say that this ok. Even though he is very low functioning doesn't mean his treatment plan isn't working, it just means that he needs more help than a higher functioning person with DS would need. </p>
<p>Edit to add: There are also tests during prenatal that can detect DS, but they are not required and up to the family. I personally decided not to test my fetus because the results would not have made a difference to me. </p>
<p>Women who's fetus does test positive have the option to abort, of course, but knowing ahead of time also helps plan because they can deliver at a hospital with a large NICU, they can find programs and assistance, and buy more disability friendly baby gear! </p>
<p>Choosing to abort a fetus with DS does not and never will make you a bad person. DS is hard, and no one should be expected to continue a pregnancy and raise a child with DS if it's not something they want to do and feel they can do. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
