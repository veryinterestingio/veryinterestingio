		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several ways this is done. I worked in a commercial system in the early 2000s but not a whole lot has changed since then. Your idea is one of the more popular ways of producing natural sounding speech. A large amount of audio is recorded by a single speaker, and then chopped up into tiny bits and then put back together in different combinations. Older systems like this would use full phonemes (the basic sounds of speech) like the “s” sound combined with the “e” sound to make the word “see”. This was unnatural because there’s always some mismatch at the start and end of the sounds. By cutting the recordings into smaller pieces the speech can be made more natural sounding when it is put back together. This process of cutting up the recordings takes a lot of time although it can be sped up by using machine learning and speech recognition techniques with some human intervention. We needed about 6 hours of quality recordings including all possible sound combinations multiple times to make a new voice. Less than that would work but 6-12 hours would give the best results. </p>
<p>There are other ways of producing speech that involve mathematical models of the human speech system. This is how some of the earliest computer speech was produced in the 70s and 80s, but it is less natural sounding (like the speech synthesizer that Stephen Hawking used)</p>
<p>Finally more recently there are AI/machine learning generated voices that use neural networks or other “deep learning” techniques to generate the speech sounds. </p>
<p>All of these techniques can be combined to make very good sounding voices these days. When I was doing work in this area some of the biggest challenges were around making the tone and cadence of the voices more human-like. We are still not all the way there but I am really impressed by the progress that has been made even in the past few years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I saw an article some years ago who interviewed the woman who provided the voice for Siri, and she said that at the time she didn't even know it was going to be for an AI, and that they basically just had her make a lot of sort of &quot;nonsense&quot; noises that were pretty much broken down words/syllables. </p>
<p>Because there was so much she did it for a while I'm pretty sure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
