		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very highly paid accountants and lawyers.</p>
<p>The world is a mish-mash of taxation and accounting schemes which all have to interact with each other as money transfers over local and national borders. Wherever you have a differing taxation system you have an opportunity to reduce the tax you pay through clever accounting and making it appear that your profits originate in a place where the tax is at its lowest.</p>
<p>Let's take a hypothetical country A called Lowtaxland that has a very low tax rate, but not many customers, and country B called Hightaxland which has a much higher tax rate, but lots of customers. </p>
<p>Then let's in introduce hypothetical company called CleverTraders Inc that wants to reduce its tax. Let's say CleverTraders Inc is in the business of manufacturing and selling beverages of some kind.</p>
<p>CleverTraders Inc sets up in Lowtaxland and then also sets up another &quot;independent&quot; company in Hightaxland called Shellsell Ltd (this new company would be a subsidiary of Clevertraders, Inc., but would have an independent balance sheet).  </p>
<p>Instead of doing it themselves and selling their beverages in Hightaxland, Clevertraders Inc gets Shellsell Ltd to do it for them. </p>
<p>Shellsell Ltd is required to buy all the beverages they resell on to customers from Clevertraders, Inc. which owns all the intellectual property to those beverages. When Clevertraders, Inc. sells its products to Shellsell Ltd, it does so at a crazy price, far higher than what could ever be normally justified (so creating justification is where the expensive accountants come in). </p>
<p>Shellsell Ltd that is actually selling the product to customers in Hightaxland is bringing in huge amounts of money, but is  making almost no actual <em>profit</em> (i.e. what is taxed) because almost everything they take in is going towards paying Clevertraders Inc for their products and licensing. </p>
<p>Clevertraders, Inc. by contrast, is making huge amounts of profit from selling their extremely marked-up beverages not to the consumer, but to Shellsell Ltd., but because Clevertraders, Inc. is located in Lowtaxland, they get to keep a much higher percentage of the profits vs if they themselves sold to customers and made profits in Hightaxland.</p>
<p>In other words, by shifting where the profits are made, you can reduce your overall tax burden that you pay on those profits. </p>
<p>For a real-world example, here's an interesting article on how Starbucks in the UK has never made a profit, because most of their revenue goes into services to the parent companies: <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-britain-starbucks-tax/special-report-how-starbucks-avoids-uk-taxes-idUKBRE89E0EX20121015" target="_blank">https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-britain-starbucks-tax/special-report-how-starbucks-avoids-uk-taxes-idUKBRE89E0EX20121015</a></p>
<p>This is just one way of doing it. Hire expensive accountants and lawyers, and they will find other ways.</p>
<p>Edit: This is a very, very simplified example of just one mechanism. As u/zjh31 and others point out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/cv6qnx/eli5_how_exactly_do_big_international_companies/ey2bf8c/" target="_blank">here</a> there are attempts to curtail this via mechanisms called transfer pricing, but they're way too complicated for a top-level ELI5. If someone more knowledgeable than I wants to take a stab at summarising them, i'll gladly link the post here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Companies pay corporate taxes on profit they make, so no matter how many iPhones sold there's no corporate taxes for Apple if they don't make a profit on the sales.</p>
<p>So Apple sells iPhones in high-tax countries, say Sweden and makes revenue. But all the patents and branding for the iPhone is owned by another Apple's company in some tax haven country. The Swedish Apple pays to the tax haven Apple fees on the patents and branding so much that they make no profit in Sweden. They still made a load of money and sent it to themselves in the tax haven, but without profit for Swedish Apple they don't have to pay corporate tax.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People are mentioning how Apple pays low taxes, I want to discuss how Amazon pays low taxes.  There are two things: investment and deferred tax assets.   </p>
<p>Let's say you're a plumber and your business made $50,000 in profit this year and you decide to buy a new van for $50k.  You'd think you still have a $50k profit, since you've swapped $50k in cash for $50k worth of van, but accounting rules say a van loses 20% of its value every year.  So your profit is now $50k - $10k of van depreciation = $40k.   </p>
<p>But congress has decided it wants people to buy vans.  It says you can expense the entire value of your van at once.  So according to regular accounting rules which you report to investors, your profit is $40k, but according to <strong>tax</strong> accounting rules, it's $50k - $50k of depreciation = $0.  No profit no taxes.  </p>
<p>Why does congress do this?  Two reasons: 1) Buying vans is an investment.  More investment = higher productivity = growing economy.  2) The senator from Michigan wants people buying vans.  </p>
<p>The second is through previous losses.  If you lose $1M in your first year and make $1M the next, you can say &quot;I still haven't made a profit on the whole&quot; and the government agrees. Companies like Amazon or Uber who spent years making huge losses can make headline grabbing profits one year but still have net losses over all years combined, and therefore pay $0 taxes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>International tax lawyer here. The main technique can be described as ‘tax base erosion and profit shifting’. You basically move taxable income away from high tax countries to low tax countries. You do this mainly by creating costs in high tax countries to the benefit of related companies in low tax countries or so-called ‘tax havens’.
For example: your company in a country with a high tax rate takes out a loan with a related company in a tax haven. The interest paid in the high tax country is deductible for tax purposes at lets say a tax rate of 40%. This means you pay less tax over there. However the company receiving the interest income in the tax haven is not taxed at all or at a very low rate. In the end you have created a deductible cost, which is not matched by a (sufficiently taxed) income.
Note: many measures are currently taken to curb such ‘aggressive tax planning’.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
