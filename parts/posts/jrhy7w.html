		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I’m a current psychology major so not too much credibility but I can attribute your phenomenon to incubation. </p>
<p>What you describe is an insight or moment of illumination. When you take a break from a problem, you partake in incubation, the process of which problem-solving continues unconsciously. This was tested by Smith and Blankenship through picture and word puzzles. Participants that took a break/incubation were able to solve the harder problems faster and easier than those that were engaged the whole time. Incubation is thought to be effective because you are able to remove a mental set about a problem and create a new one, essentially removing any mental blocks from the initial problem. </p>
<p>I’m sure there’s a psychology PHD that can further explain this better than me!

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Behavioral Psychology Masters student here. You’ll get different interpretations from different approaches of Psychology. A behavioral approach may interpret this as a result of covert autochaining behavior that generates supplemental stimuli that allows you to prompt yourself closer and closer to the answer. In laymen’s terms, when you solve a problem, you are generating other ideas, rules, principles (that you have learned before) in your thoughts to prompt yourself toward the answer. For example, if I would like to solve a quadratic equation, my first covert behavior is to generate the quadratic formula in my head to prompt myself to solve the problem. When you give up on a problem and come back to it, you are likely still autochaining and generating these “clues” in your head until finally you reach a clue that has such strong association with the solution and  then BOOM, it elicits the correct behavior aka you solving it. There are probably other principles of behavior to consider, but this is my guess at the largest contributing covert process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Educator currently studying a science of learning course aimed at looking at many disciplines in less depth. We are learning that at many different levels of organisation, many different responses can be given to similar questions. How do we use sugar? For example would be answered very differently by a microbiologist, a psychologist or a doctor. The question you raise here &quot;what happens when we realise something&quot; ought to understand the assumptions many neuroscientists and psychologists will have. Education is, if nothing else, the realisation that different types of problems will require different solutions. The assumptions that the same thing happens when we solve every different problem seems slightly unlikely. Imagine a social problem to a mathematical problem to a physical, in-body problem. With such an early ( comparative to medical understanding, for example) understanding of how the brain or mind works, it may be better to ask a) what level of science do you wish to learn about and b) what kind of problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
