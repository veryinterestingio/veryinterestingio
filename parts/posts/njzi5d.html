How is it that we’ve had much more time to study the effectiveness of antibodies attained from having covid than the time we’ve had to study the vaccine, but the studies on the effectiveness of the vaccine are presented to be much more conclusive?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I thought this paper from Jennifer Dan et al (published in Science) did an excellent job of demonstrating strong immune responses after natural infection, as measured by antibody titers, memory B-cells, memory CD4+ T-cells, and memory CD8+ T-cells.</p>
<p><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6529/eabf4063" target="_blank"><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6529/eabf4063" target="_blank">https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6529/eabf4063</a></a></p>
<p>As for why research on vaccines is more plentiful with massive sample sizes and strict protocols (compared to research on natural infection), part of the reason is because the biopharmaceutical industry can provide the massive financial costs, human resources, and infrastructure necessary to run clinical trials for vaccines. By contrast, studies on natural infection usually come from government grants, so funding and resources and infrastructure are understandably more limited. <strong>EDIT:</strong> Also, as other people have correctly pointed out, resources and funding aside, demonstrating an [X]% protection rate (the primary endpoints of vaccine clinical trials) is a LOT easier to do for vaccines than it is for natural infection. Just to be clear, it is still possible to estimate protection from natural infection; for example, we can make a big assumption on correlate of protection, or we can do a reinfection study.</p>
<p>As for CDC guidance on getting vaccinated even after being infected, this makes sense for a couple of reasons. First, a lot of people who think they had COVID might not have had it -- the reality is a lot of people didn't get properly tested, especially during the beginning of the pandemic. Second, for people who got COVID in the beginning of the pandemic, their antibody titers are probably waning so it would be helpful for them to get vaccinated to boost their body's ability to prevent infection (the same could be said if someone got vaccinated 12 months ago). That being said, in a perfect world, I do believe that people who have confirmed prior infection should not be prioritized for vaccinations, as their risk of severe disease is probably quite low.</p>
<p>It's important to remember that CDC guidance on masks, vaccinations, social distancing, etc is all about messaging -- they have the strike the delicate balance between &quot;clear and simple&quot; versus &quot;scientifically accurate&quot;. If there's one thing we've learned in this pandemic, it's that the average American (and even some scientists!) has great difficulty in parsing scientific nuance and applying it to their daily lives -- even when it is a life-and-death matter. They have to account for the fact that ambivalent messaging is more likely to result in fewer people doing the right thing. I really don't blame the CDC when their guidance is at times more conservative than what the scientific consensus might otherwise suggest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it’s easier to study a controlled intervention than an uncontrolled one.</p>
<p>Take vaccines. You do a study, randomized, double blind, give half the people the vaccine, half not. You then look at the number of Covid cases, hospitalisations and death in each group. Easy enough.</p>
<p>Take Covid. You take a bunch of people who got Covid, and then compare them. But to whom? For one, your post Covid group is biased as it only includes people that didn’t die from it. And who is your comparator group? People that didn’t get Covid? How are you sure that they didn’t get an asymptomatic infection? How are you sure that the behaviour of those that got Covid isn’t different from those that didn’t get it? How are you sure that the behaviour of those that did get Covid doesn’t change after getting Covid? And so on and so forth.</p>
<p>The bedrock of clinical medical research is a randomized, double blind study. That way you take two generally identical groups, make an intervention on them in a controlled setting, and their behaviour isn’t influenced by the intervention.</p>
<p>This is possible with vaccines. It isn’t possible with people getting Covid in the community as it isn’t randomized, it isn’t blinded, and the control group is iffy at best.</p>
<p>If we could do a study and intentionally infect people with Covid, then sure, we would have your answer. But ethic boards these days tend to frown on that...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is all about the difficulty in capturing significant numbers in a <strong><em>prospective</em></strong> controlled study - this is difficult for two reasons:</p>
<p>- if the people who had natural immunity had different exposure risk to the control group, then the estimates of effectiveness will be biased</p>
<p>- the sample size is limited as you have to wait for people to be infected naturally, compared to a vaccine, which is easy to administer to everyone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
