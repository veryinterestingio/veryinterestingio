		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two sphincters that control urine release. One is automatic and one is manual. The first one opens up when it detects the bladder is quite full (70%) At this point you will feel the need to ‘go’. You can then control the release moment with the second sphincter.
This is why sometimes some people can’t pee when they are trying to. (Gentleman at urinals)The automatic valve is not under your conscious control.
If the first valve closes the urge to release the manual one will subside too. As the bladder continues to fill the automatic system will try again until it has success.
Some medication sometimes prevents the automatic valve from opening at all and this can be very painful and life threatening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's Brain. Brain is the manager of the Your Body Corporation. Her job is to keep track of all the things Your Body is doing, and make sure that they go okay for us.</p>
<p>Here's Bladder. Bladder is one of the janitorial staff. Her job is to take out the garbage that gets handed to her by Kidneys.</p>
<p>When Bladder needs to go, she sends a message to Brain. This is so that Brain can get Your Legs to steer Your Body over to the toilet and take down Your Pants.</p>
<p>Sometimes, Brain doesn't do that. Sometimes there is something else going on, like fireworks or an important meeting, that has Brain's attention when Bladder sends the message.</p>
<p>So, Bladder sends the same message again.</p>
<p>And again.</p>
<p>And then waits a while, because if you just spam Brain with alert messages all day, Brain will call it &quot;chronic pain&quot; and go to the doctor and get the runaround because chronic pain conditions are generally misunderstood even today.</p>
<p>Eventually, one of three things happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brain steers Your Body over to the toilet and tells Bladder that it's okay to go.</li>
<li>Bladder gives up completely and just lets go, and you pee Your Pants. Bladder then sends an &quot;ahh, relief!&quot; message to Brain, who has to deal with the consequences.</li>
<li>Brain falls unconscious or asleep, and you pee Your Pants anyway. Brain deals with the consequences in the morning.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As with many aspects of the way in which the body runs, it’s helpful to think of this in terms of cavemen and how this system would have impacted/benefitted them. Imagine you are a caveman/cavewoman and you rely on hunting to get food, and shelter to stay safe from predators. When your body tells you that you need to pee, then you just go pee somewhere that you think it’s safe to be vulnerable for a few minutes. Now imagine you’re in a location that you don’t think is safe, obviously you’re not going to drop your trousers, you’re going to start looking for somewhere safer. The same works if you’re in the middle of hunting something and don’t have time to stop. After a while, it’s become clear that you either can’t or won’t stop your current task (hunting or searching for shelter), so it’s now in your body’s best interest to help you finish whatever task you’re working on so that you can go pee. To this end, hunting or searching for something can be difficult when you’re in mild pain because of a full bladder, it can distract your mind, making it hard to focus, and it can also make it hard to move because of the pressures you put on your bladder when you walk/run. So after a while of telling you that you need to pee, your body essentially recognises that you can’t pee because something more important is happening, and so it silences the need to pee so that you can focus on this more important task. This only lasts for so long, however, as eventually this need to pee will return when your body is letting you know that you seriously have got to pee right this minute or else you are going to start doing proper damage to your body. The same thing happens in terms of hunger. If you go a while without eating you’ll feel hungry, push through this for a few hours and you’ll stop feeling hungry, but several hours later you’ll feel even hungrier again.</p>
<p>Tldr: When your body needs to pee it lets you know with various signals. If you push through this then your body recognises that you have bigger fish to fry, and will dampen the signalling, trusting that you’ll remember your bladder is full when you next get a chance to pee. Eventually your body gets fed up with waiting and reminds you that you seriously need to pee soon, and will continue to do so because at this point you’re possibly going to damage your body if you hold it in much longer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
