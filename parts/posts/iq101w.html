If no one on earth can exactly predict when someone will die or if they'll be able to walk again, how and why do doctors come up with these predictions? </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There will always be outliers who defy expectation. However, statistically speaking, most aren't so lucky. The doctor wants to give people an understanding of their likely future so that the patient may start to make informed choices about what they want to do. </p>
<p>To make these predictions, doctors would look at the person's injuries and compare them to other similar cases. They know that most people who sustain certain types of injures tend not to be able to walk again. While occasionally someone might be truly lucky and get mobility back, the doctor's responsibility is to inform the patient of their likely future so that they can adjust and cope accordingly. </p>
<p>As for predicting death, it is similar. Doctors would compare the stage of the patient's terminal illness against other cases to get an early estimate. Due to all the studies that have been done on such illnesses, doctors know how long it typically takes a given terminal illness to kill someone after it reaches a certain stage. Following that, they would watch the patient to see how quickly the disease progresses for them, and possibly adjust that estimate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I also wonder how much of it is how the doctor explained / what the patient heard.</p>
<p>Example: you received a specific cancer diagnosis. Your doctor informs you that the 5 year survival rate is 10%, and probably explains more about what that means. But some people might hear 'I'm going to die in the next 5 years', which is not what is being said. So if they live to 10 years, they might say 'see, doctors know nothing', but the doctor gave accurate statistics. It's just that many people (doctors included actually) aren't great at interpreting statistics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a doctor. Have been for 10+ years. I have maybe a handful of times given someone a prognosis of when they will die, almost always only when they are already on their deathbed. And the estimate is extremely vague, like &quot;within a few days or weeks&quot;, because you cannot know. I never say &quot;you have 6 months to live&quot; or whatever specific like that, because that's just guessing, and you are much more likely to be wrong than right. I hate it when other docs do this, but fortunately most I work with do not do it either. </p>
<p>I have seen enough prognoses go wildly wrong to know better than to make glorified guesses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctor here. It all depends on what they’re dying from. A lot of the mortality predictions come from cancer research - from large studies you can say that median survival is 3 years, ie if we took a hundred people in your situation, half would die before 3 years, the other half would live longer. If it’s a dialysis patient, you expect about a week after they stop dialysis.  In my experience patients don’t often ask as much as you’d think. Often it’s family members towards the end of life. I also use the “crystal ball” phrase. It’s common to say things like “long weeks to short months”. In the last stages of dying, it can be quite variable from long hours to weeks. Once someone stops eating and starts sleeping most of the day, you’re talking within days. Once they develop a pattern of breathing called Cheyn Stokes, it’s a day or two</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
