<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I know the Moon used to be volcanic, and most theories describe it breaking off of Earth after a collision with a Mars-sized object, so I reckon it's made of more or less the same stuff as Earth. Could there be lunar Kimberlite pipes full of diamonds, or seams of metamorphic Tanzanite buried in the Maria?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology_of_the_Moon#Lunar_rocks" target="_blank">surficial geology of the moon</a> is relatively simple compared to Earth, the Lunar highlands are predominantly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorthosite" target="_blank">anorthosite</a> and the Lunar maria are predominantly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basalt" target="_blank">basalt</a>. On Earth, neither of these rock types are associated with common gem minerals (EDIT: unless you consider olivine a gem mineral, then sure, basalts have tons of olivine, but not usually gem quality, for that you usually need mantle xenoliths, which I suppose could exist in the Lunar maria basalts, but to my knowledge, I don't think we've found any in our limited sampling of the moon). Anorthosites are relatively rare on Earth and one of the few places we find them on Earth are in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layered_intrusion" target="_blank">layered mafic intrusions</a>, e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushveld_Igneous_Complex" target="_blank">Bushveld</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stillwater_igneous_complex" target="_blank">Stillwater</a>, which are commonly rich in a variety of metals (e.g. chromium, paladium, etc) but not so much in things we usually consider 'gems'. </p>
<p>A lot (not all) of gem minerals are associated with either metamorphic rocks or igneous environments which are related to various plate tectonic processes. E.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garnet" target="_blank">garnets</a> are almost exclusively metamorphic (there are rare igneous garnets, though I've only ever seen igneous garnets in very felsic igneous rocks, which you would not find on the moon), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corundum" target="_blank">corundum</a> (i.e. ruby, sapphire) is often metamorphic but also can be found in a variety of igneous rocks, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryl" target="_blank">beryl</a> (i.e. emerald, aquamarine) is mostly found in felsic igenous rocks (again, not expected to exist on the moon) or metamorphic rocks, and as you mentions, diamonds are often associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberlite" target="_blank">kimberlites</a>. We wouldn't really expect many of these rocks / environments to exist on the moon as it lacks/lacked plate tectonics, thus the various mechanisms required to generate the minerals we consider gemstones likely did not exist on the moon.</p>
<p>Caveat to above, lunar geology is most definitely not my specialty and I've done as much as I can in my career to avoid petrology / mineralogy, so I will happily defer to someone with more expertise in these fields if someone with relevant knowledge wants to chime in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/babgeo gave <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1f4n7c/comment/ca6v4qt?utm_source=amp&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_content=comment_expand" target="_blank">a pretty comprehensive answer</a> the last time this was asked</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Probably not any of the precious stones (diamond, ruby, sapphire, emerald): as an earlier commenter said, those are linked to plate tectonic processes on Earth, either relying on plate tectonics to generate very high pressures (diamond), or growing primarily in metamorphosed sedimentary rocks that have been deformed by episodes of mountain building (corundum -- ruby and sapphire). Emerald (beryl) is usually associated with pegmatites, or the very late-stage fluids from granite bodies which contain a lot of exotic minerals and are very uncommon outside of continental crust, which is more evolved and granitic than oceanic crust or the lunar crust.</p>
<p>The minerals that are associated with at least some semi-precious stones have either been found or suggested to exist on the Moon: peridot is gem-quality olivine, which makes up much of the mantles of both bodies and has been found in lunar rocks. Garnet occurs in Earth's mantle and has been projected to occur also in the Moon's mantle, but I don't know if any samples have been found in the rocks returned from the Moon.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are also <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2000JE001386" target="_blank">garnets</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But for the big ones like diamonds and emeralds I'm pretty sure you need the pressures from tectonic activity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work at probably the premier lunar research lab in the world (you can guess which one).  I am not the worlds expert, but I know where her office is.  </p>
<p>The primary geological process on the surface of the moon in the last 1-2 billion years is called impact gardening.  Meteors break up and redistribute regolith all over the surface of the moon to the point that we really don't see the &quot;surface&quot; of the moon, but a pulverized layer of broken up rocks and dust that is probably (we are not sure) over 100 meters deep.  </p>
<p>So there really is no &quot;bedrock&quot; that you would dig into to get the gems.  That and there being no water there (many gems require water to form), mean there are probably few if any such things there.  </p>
<p>That all being said, we don't really know!  And, we are sending people back to the moon shortly to find out!!  How cool is that!?!?!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a fascinating question.</p>
<p>Here's my summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>The moon is expected to be roughly similar to the composition of the Earth's mantle.  As a whole, the Earth has different mean composition due to its core, and a different surface composition due to continental material being focused there, but for the purposes of igneous-derived minerals we can think of the Moon as somewhat similar.</li>
<li>Gemstones require rare, extreme conditions on Earth.  Mostly this is extreme pressure and high heat from continental collisions, although there are some (like diamonds in kimberlite pipes) that have odd and unique genesis</li>
<li>The moon doesn't have plate tectonics, so it cannot generate the Pressure/Temperature conditions required for most gemstones you could name</li>
<li>Moon gemstones would either be from gems created in the Moon's formation that survived the subsequent cooling process, or gems created by meteor impacts (tektites include some gem-like forms like Moldavite).  I think the former are unlikely (I expect the extended cooling at low pressure would lead the moon to be mostly bland forms of basalt and granite with very few gemstones), but the latter is certainly possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I think the moon has few gemstones according to my instinct that gems require extreme conditions unique to plate tectonics, and the Moon lacks any similar mechanism to generate gemstones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
