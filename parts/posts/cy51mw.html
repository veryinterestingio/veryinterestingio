		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Melbourne (Australia) is building its first subway since the 1980's.  Building subways doesn't seem that common around the world in general.  When a project like this is undertaken, how do we find people who have expertise in building them?  Furthermore, when the project ends, how is the expertise gained in building that project kept/maintained for the next one?  Since these sort of projects are so rare, it seems hard for people to build up their experience to do each subsequent project better (as one would building multiple skyscrapers, or websites for example).</p>
<p>Are these projects mostly done by people doing it for the first time?  Are they informed by past successes and failures somehow?</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks everyone for the fantastic responses so far!  A lot of people are focusing on the 'subway' example, which was which first prompted my question, but apparently aren't as rare as I first thought.  So a side question would be, are there any projects where maintaining knowledge and experience in building it does become a problem, simply because the projects are so uncommon?  My other thought was dams, but they seem common too.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rarely will you find an expert in something like building a Subway. You'll find some engineers who specialize in designing tunnels, and some who design railroad systems, and people who design high-traffic spaces (like stations). They'll all work together, as well as with other people who have experience in the subparts of those tasks (electrical system design, HVAC, geologists, interior design, etc). </p>
<p>All of these people can apply their skill sets to a variety of projects - it's all about gathering the right group of people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a number of large scale infrastructure engineering design firms in the world. You can Google some of these companies to learn more about them - Jacobs, AECOM, Arcadis, China Com, Cardno, WSP, etc.</p>
<p>I work for one of these global giants, so I can give you a little insight. </p>
<p>A large scale infrastructure project such as an airport, major bridge, large interchange, tunnel, port, rail or subway system is planned for years, and sometimes even decades in advance. </p>
<p>The projects often begin as identified needs, but also sometimes as political plays, and sometimes even the design firms themselves can 'create' the project out of thin air by convincing the governments and stakeholders in question that it would be a benefit to the town, city, or state as a whole. </p>
<p>The projects float around for many years until finally they find some form of funding and begin to become a reality.</p>
<p>The engineering firms have large numbers of specialised engineers, usually divided into teams, dedicated to all the different specialities needed to make a project a reality.</p>
<p>For example, a subway system will need alternatives analysis - where engineers determine the most viable routes, vehicles etc., It will need Right of Way specialists to deal with all the impacted right of ways on the surface during the construction process. It will need environmental engineers to verify nothing will be illegally impacted. </p>
<p>Geotechnical scientists and drainage engineers must study the geology and soils through borings and similar technologies. LiDAR specialists will image the ground. </p>
<p>Utilities specialists will locate all the existing utilities (water lines, sewer, electric, gas) etc. They will identify what needs to be moved, removed, or replaced and they will also design the new utilities that will need to be in place. </p>
<p>Architects will design the stations, platforms and entries and exits. </p>
<p>Public involvement specialists will keep the public informed and as happy as possible during construction. </p>
<p>Traffic engineers will design alternate routes for traffic on the surface so that construction can have the least impacts possible on the population.</p>
<p>Tunnel boring specialists will design the methodologies that the tunnels will be excavated and figure out where the moved earth goes.</p>
<p>Rail specialists will design the systems and procure the vehicles.</p>
<p>The list goes on and on. I'm just skimming the surface here. For the most part, large infrastructure design firms have a lot of these specialists in house, but they will also often &quot;sub out&quot; certain tasks to smaller subconsultant firms. Sometimes they team with equally large firms to create a joint venture business entity just for the duration of the project.</p>
<p>The organization chart for a project of this scale will often have hundreds of individuals from several firms. </p>
<p>There will be one or two extremely experienced Project Managers at the top, assisted by more 'boots on the ground' Deputy Project Managers and Lead Engineers. There may be a dedicated 'Project Management Office' (PMO) set up.</p>
<p>Below this upper management level is a whole heirarchy of engineers and other specialists, usually split into carefully thought out teams. For example, there may be a &quot;Rail engineering&quot; team, headed by an experienced rail project manager. Beneath him or her there might be specialists for such things as track design, lighting, electrics, stations, vehicle procurement etc. and each of those engineers will have small teams under them going down to the fairly new engineers doing simpler tasks on the bottom.</p>
<p>When a project like this is finally funded and ready to begin being designed, the &quot;client&quot; (the city, government, or other agency requesting the project) puts out a 'request for proposals' (RFP). Then the engineering infrastructure firms will compete with each other for the job. They will each create detailed proposals about how they will approach turning the idea into a reality - how they'll keep costs down, how they meet the schedule, how they'll address technical problems, how they'll handle the public and the stakeholders, how they'll structure their team for optimum efficiency, etc.</p>
<p>The client will receive all these proposals by a given deadline, then they will shortlist a few of the best ones and bring them in for interview. The winner of the interview wins the job. Then there's a process of negotiations and contracting before the design actually begins. </p>
<p>Once the design is complete (or during the design process in the case of 'Design-Build' structured projects). Then the big contracting firms start bidding on the job. The contracter with the best experience and lowest/best value prices wins the right to build the project. The design project manager usually continues to oversee or work with the contracting form while the project is built to make sure everything goes according to plan.</p>
<p>Some of the bigger contracting firms in the world are Skanska, Turner, Kiewit, Walsh. Sometimes the Design firms are so big that they double as contractors too -AECOM and China are examples of these megagiants.</p>
<p>No project will ever go 100% according to plan. There will be scope changes, problems obtaining right of way, public and stakeholder backlash, technical issues, fluctuating material costs, inclement weather, political opposition etc., So all projects of this scale are 'living', 'organic', processes. They require deeply experienced people at the top who are capable of making quick decisions, solving unforeseen problems, and moving all the chess pieces just right. </p>
<p>I'm super proud to be a tiny part of some of these projects. It's truly miraculous to watch so many complex moving pieces all come together to create a real physical thing like an interchange or a subway.</p>
<p>Wow, that turned out really long, sorry. Hope it helps give you some insights into all the infrastructure around you and what it took to get it there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Huge construction projects have been done for many thousands of years. There are some who's engineering has been lost with time (pyramids, sphinx, etc.).  Today, there are few projects that haven't been copied in some way from previous designs engineering knowledge before. Tunnels and bridges especially. </p>
<p>Subways in particular are old designs; going through bedrock is common, and under some rivers they go through soft silt so the tunnel is actually designed to withstand the flexing that takes place. Either way, it's already been done. And as Turtle mentioned, it's all in the books for reference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Things are written down for a reason. And then lots of extra workers to check the work of the workers. It's done carefully and with lots of safety measures. A lot of it seems overpaid and stretched out over too long of a period, like the Eglinton line in Toronto (hurry up! Enough with the construction-born traffic!) But if it helps to ensure that it's safe, then I guess it's fine. Often, experts from overseas or wherever it's more common are called in for advisory purposes. These days, large machine and their operators are doing most of the heavy lifting. Here in Toronto, we dig then spray the walls with concrete and then build inside there. Then we move forward and do a next section. And repeat over n over for as long as it takes. In North America, subways and skyways are common in most big cities. In Europe, the Tube is famous. So there's a lot of precedent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Having worked in special projects like these (ironically in Melbourne too). It's really all risk mitigation especially when there are risks you can't forsee whether it be lack of experience or its an innovative product.</p>
<p>You look at Lend lease, scentre group, Downer, or some of the other builders in Australia, etc most builders shed a majority of the risk to their subcontractors. Put simply you don't need to be an expert or have the knowledge, you just need to get he right people that can bear the risk if something does go wrong. (and as a big builder, most companies will want to be on the payroll for future work, unless they get screwed over in the past)</p>
<p>For example structural designs and civil sign offs, as rare and as complex as it will be, there are companies out there who's core business are to provide sign offs and modelling of these things, which you can engage them to do, especially if they have a great track record. You'd get all their professional indemnity insurances, and get them to certify it, then ask your subcontractors to implement it exactly according to the design.</p>
<p>For Quality assurance, you could either verify that your subcontractors install things specifically yourself, if you are a larger company to reduce cost or otherwise write it into the contract of the certifier/designer and get them to QA, if you want too.</p>
<p>Anything goes wrong or if there are any delays, they pay for it, and again if they can't thats where the insurances come in assuming your contract has these. All big builders will have these in all of their contracts that they give to their subcontractors, under liquidated damages for delays/damage.This way it keeps everyone on time, especially for multimillion dollar projects where you can't afford delays.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
