		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Caffeine blocks the chemicals that make you feel tired from being detecting your brain, however, it doesn’t replace these chemicals (adenosine). </p>
<p>These chemicals continue to build up and when the caffeine begins to wear off, the chemicals flood the receptors leading to an increased level of tiredness, much more than you felt prior to consuming the caffeine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing I didn't immediately see mentioned is caffeine raises your blood sugar, which can make you tired. I'm very sensitive to drugs and couldn't figure out why if I had SOME caffeine I felt good, but if I had multiple cups I started crashing and felt tired.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple of factors going on here:</p>
<p>Dehydration: Caffeine is a diuretic, it makes you urinate more water than you take in. More often than not when you're tired after drinking coffee, your actually just dehydrated.</p>
<p>Tolerance: If you use caffeine often you'll end up needing more and more to maintain the same level of wakefulness. You could be taking a smaller dose than you need and could just enter right into the caffeine crash, without a high.</p>
<p>General Body Weirdness: The body is a super complex thing, there are probably a hundred other answers to your question. The body is weird sometimes, does fucky shit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
