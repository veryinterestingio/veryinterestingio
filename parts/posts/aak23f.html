You can use soap or olive oil to achieve the same effect, but shaving gel/foam was created expressly for the purpose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The shave gel/cream keeps the layer of water on your face as opposed to running off or drying up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had a conversation once with a guy who worked in R&amp;D for one of the razor companies.  I was told that most people use the gel or foam only for registration. That is, just to be able to easily see where they have already shaved and what still needs to be shaved.  But the actual main purpose of all the products was to soften the hairs, which reduces their strength by 80% or so, making them easier to cut, which in turn reduces irritation.  He said no matter what product you use, best result is to shave in the shower so your hair and skin are already wet and then to give the gel or foam 2 minutes to do its job before you start shaving. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
