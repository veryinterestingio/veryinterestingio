<p>It also depends on what you mean by “group.”  A group of close friends and a group of acquaintances are two totally different scenarios. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bo Burnham had a line referring to this in the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCp3n95qSZg" target="_blank">Are You Happy?</a>, from his most recent stand up, &quot;Make Happy&quot;. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>And if you watch this thing alone<br />
You probably didn’t laugh, but maybe a few times you exhaled out of your nose </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It basically refers to the fact that when you're alone you're less likely to laugh out loud expressly, even if you found something hilarious that would normally keel you over in a group stage. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Laughter exists in a sense as part of &quot;conformity&quot; - the need to fit in. It's part of your body's way of saying &quot;I enjoyed that&quot; without actually doing so, while being a more obvious and quick reaction, but is often used even if you don't actually believe that, again, as a way to &quot;fit in&quot; without ostracizing yourself. Of course all of this being said, people still laugh on their own, and a lot of them don't feel 'ostracized' by not understanding why others are laughing, so it's a bit of a grey area.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Tl;dr you're more likely to laugh in a group because everyone else is laughing, and you'd rather (subconsciously) be part of the &quot;group&quot;, even if you don't actually believe in the actions you're performing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
