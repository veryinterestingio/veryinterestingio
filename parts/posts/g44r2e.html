		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually remember seeing a study on this some years back! Basically they put flies into small capsules and had the capsules continuously rotate throughout the night so that they cannot land on a surface and rest. Next day they were exhausted, barely moving compared to the non capsule flies. Short answer is they do get tired but you don’t notice because they’re resting when you are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>, (the fancy-pants name for the species of fruit fly studied for over a century by geneticists) sure do! They can both get tired from flying around or climbing, and they also have a &quot;down time&quot; very similar to sleep in humans.</p>
<p>In fact, the genes that control the sleep cycle (circadian rhythm) were discovered in <em>Drosophila</em>, and the geneticists who identified them won a Nobel prize for their work. These genes are so evolutionarily important that they are very similar in humans!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For sure they do. When im hiking in the mountains it is much easier to swat them at the top if they have followed me from the bottom. If it is because they are tired or because of the lower amount of oxygen at the top, I dont know. But they're tired</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
