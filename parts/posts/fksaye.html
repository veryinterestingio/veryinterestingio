<p>Even if it doesn't lead to extinction, would one assume that colds, the flu, or other communicable diseases could dramatically decrease in measurable ways because of the social distancing, emphasis on hand washing, etc...?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It won't stop the rise of new viruses, but social distancing has to have a strong effect on non-target diseases on the short term, as (for instance) flu and the common cold are transmitted in similar ways to COVID-19.</p>
<p>I would expect that in addition to stopping the target virus in Vò, Italy, other socially transmitted diseases have been stopped as well. Looking forward to the follow up studies.</p>

The point is to slow down the spread temporarily so that healthcare isn’t overwhelmed. No healthcare expert is saying that covid 19 is going to go extinct.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It won't... but now is a perfect time for vaccination campaigns against fast-burning diseases. Whole strains can be exterminated, thus making the other strains spend time on adaptation and making it easier to track their spread on this blank slate. Complete extermination seems improbable, but now's a good time to try.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
