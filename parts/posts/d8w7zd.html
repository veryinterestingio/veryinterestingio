		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding it is hyperconjugation. There is electron donation from a C-H bond into the antibonding orbital of the C-F bond - this is only possible when the C-H and C-F bonds are anti to ech other (and so the C-O and C-F are gauche). In the gas phase there is also internal H-bonding between the OH and the F bringing them together</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In stereochemistry course last year we had the same question about 2-bromoethanol. The teacher told us that an hydrogen bond can form between the proton of the hydroxy group and the halogen when they are in gauche conformation, which lowers the overall energy of the compound. </p>
<p>The other answers give different reasons, I would very much like to know which one is right!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fluorine is super small and also the most electronegative atom. The most stable configuration is when elections are pushing against each other the least. The elections of oxygen are being pushed less by the electronegative flourine than the slightly less electronegative hydrogens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
