		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some vaccines appear to have non-specific (or heterologous) effects. Specifically, the two live-attenuated BCG and measles vaccines seem to grant protection against things beyond what they were designed for. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the DTP vaccine, which is not live-attenuated, may have a detrimental non-specific effect, although the evidence here looks weaker. (EDIT: The possible effect here is a mild and negative immunomodulation. Studies attempting to replicate it keep giving conflicting data. Whatever it is, the effect is weak if it’s there at all. No reason to start questioning vaccines, people.)</p>
<p>I know it’s early but I was wondering which category the Covid vaccines might fit in. </p>
<p>So, do the mRNA Covid vaccines have positive non-specific effects? Do the adenovirus-based ones?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I currently research in this space! (PHD in immunology). I know of a few lines of research on vaccinated groups that could help us know more when they are finished, and I imagine there are other studies underway that I am not aware of.</p>
<p>Basically, we don't know. The difference seems to be that live vaccines have beneficial nonspecific effects (NSE) and killed/non-live could have 'detrimental' NSE (I am working to understand why this could be). It's probably worth mentioning that these effects are often seen in specific populations that have a high burden of disease - the effects may not be present in most adults.</p>
<p>There are different covid vaccines - some are live, like Astrazeneca, some are dead (like SinoVac). mRNA vaccines (Moderna, pfeizer) are sensed in a similar way to a live virus in your body, so there could be similar NSE to other live vaccines, but we don't know yet.</p>
<p>I'm happy to answer any specific questions you have.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don’t really know what the cause of “long COVID” is yet, but there are reports that the vaccine has dramatically improved symptoms in some cases. It seems plausible to me that this or a similar vaccine could become a treatment and not just prevention, or even possibly help other ailments in the same family as long COVID.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read somewhere that the vaccines might also help against other coronaviruses (which cause symptoms of the common cold) (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/general-information.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/general-information.html" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/general-information.html</a></a>)</p>
<p>Unable to find the study description again.</p>
<p>So basically, you get the Covid vaccine and it bleeds over protecting against some cold causing corona virus . It's a ongoing study. This is a thesis.</p>
<p>I mean it would make sense, since old coronavirus - cold infections already are theorized to have some immunizing capability against Covid. Why shouldn't it work the other way around.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.livescience.com/common-cold-coronaviruses-t-cells-covid-19-immunity.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.livescience.com/common-cold-coronaviruses-t-cells-covid-19-immunity.html" target="_blank">https://www.livescience.com/common-cold-coronaviruses-t-cells-covid-19-immunity.html</a></a></p>
<p>Edit: Cold is cause by a variety of different viruses, like Rhino and Coronaviruses. So even if you get protection against some coronavirus. It's not full against &quot;cold&quot; which is more a symptom then a single disease. You would still get cold from a Rhino Virus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
