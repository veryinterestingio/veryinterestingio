		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is to the advantage of the politician to get there message to as many people as possible. Therefore, politicians often provide information about their speech to the press ahead of time. This can generate more interest in the speech (e.g., &quot;so-and-so is expected to say...&quot;) as well. The more people think and talk about a politician, the more they remember them -- that's usually a good thing come election day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because everyone wins that way. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the press need content for a 24 hour media cycle and often several news programmes a day. This way they can report what will be said in the morning, the saying of it in the afternoon and some thought on it (maybe vox pops in a local town) later on. They get three hits (at least). </p>
</li>
<li>the politician will press release key parts of the speech and let it get out. That way they can offer exclusives to some press (to keep them sweet) and get their message repeated in more news cycles. In some speeches (budget speeches or policy announcements) early leaking can allow some feedback too. I.e. you aren't sure the public's perception about your next step on Coronavirus. Why not leak it, get comment from the opposition and public and then change it if needed. </li>
</ul>
<p>Also by leaking some parts of a speech you can control what questions are asked. So you could say something bad that you can row back on and the news cycle will be about that rather than the really bad thing you announce silently behind it. For example 'we are going to increase tax on burgers by 100% because they make you fat!' Then said politician answers questions on this all day only he news causing a small furore with burger firms. Also in the speech (but not pre-release) is a comment on increasing mass surveillance of citizens . Your politician then say 'Look you're right. I've listened and the burger tax is not the right thing.' and gets off (relatively) free from scrutiny because burgers is a better and easier story than mass surveillance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
