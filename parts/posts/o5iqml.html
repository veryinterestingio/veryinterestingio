		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The basic idea is that a varying electric field will induce a current in a conductor. This is how radio antennae work. You produce radio waves in a transmitter. These radio waves are waves of <em>electromagnetic force</em>. As the radio wave passes over something, the EM force pushes and pulls electrons back and forth at the wave's frequency. If you have a conductor, these electrons are actually allowed to move, and you have a current. So, a radio wave will induce a small current in a conductor - such as a long piece of metal, i.e. an antenna. You can vary the radio wave to communicate a signal to the antenna, which is how radio communication works. But inducing a current is also supplying a small amount of electrical power to the antenna. In fact, it is possible to build a small radio that is powered entirely by the radio signal it receives. They are quiet, as the sound is not amplified, but they work, and there are even kits to build them yourself. The classic version is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_radio" target="_blank">Crystal radio</a>.</p>
<p>In that sense, wireless transmission of power is everywhere, and it's just been a standard part of everyday technology for about a century.</p>
<p>As for transmission of <em>large</em> amounts of power, there are some practical problems. An EM wave will set up a current in any conductor it passes through. So <em>any</em> piece of metal will get electrified. This is very dangerous. At the very least it will damage electronic equipment, and at worst you will electrocute people.</p>
<p>It also requires a <em>lot</em> of power to transmit over any large distance. This isn't such a big issue for radio communication, because you don't need the signal at full power - you can amplify the sound using a local power source. But if the electric power itself is what you need, then those losses really matter. As the wave spreads out, its power drops proportionally to 1/distance^(2) - each time you double the distance, you have 1/4 the power.</p>
<p>To maybe oversimplify a little, large-scale wireless transmission of power is dangerous and a huge waste of energy.</p>
<p>However, small-scale direct wireless transmission of power is more feasible. If your receiver is close to the energy source, then you aren't wasting as much power, and it's less dangerous because you aren't electrifying some large area. I believe there are also some new tricks to focus how EM waves are transmitted, to increase the range without losing too much power.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see others answering why Tesla's version wouldn't work (wide band, high noise, directionless energy transfer).</p>
<p>For our technology, a low noise, narrow band, directional transmitter would be a laser.  If you look at photovoltaics, there are models that use a photonic structure and a terahertz (THz) rectifier that can achieve a theoretical 86% photon energy to electrical energy conversion rate.  There have been proof of concepts built which were fractions of a % efficient.  No one knows how to build a rectifier with enough potential per distance to make this work.</p>
<p>Even taking this ideal, a laser can be about 50% efficient and this miracle solar cells 86% efficiency still leaves us with 57% loss which is extremely wasteful.  A current laser/photovoltaic would waste about 86% of energy.  </p>
<p>A copper wire is amazingly efficient in contrast.  The energy lost for most grids in the US sits somewhere in the realm of 5-15%.  That's losses across power lines, transformers and then to you.  We don't have the excess energy to waste on less efficient power transmission.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can do all those things, it's just that they are horribly inefficient, impractical and dangerous if your goal is transmiting usable power rather than information. And the greater the distance over which you want to transmit, the worse everything gets. Could you charge up your phone from 5 meters away? Probably, but the vast majority of all the energy output would be wasted on heating up all other metal objects in the room.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
