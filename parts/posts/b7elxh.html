		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty annoying to have to drink water all day, throughout the day in proper amounts. Not enough? Headaches, dry mouth, etc. Too much? &quot;Oh we don't need this right now. Pee it out!!!&quot; Same with vitamins. Extras just get excreted out so you have to gradually consume them to stay healthy.</p>
<p>But yet you eat too much fat, sugar, or cholesterol and your body is like &quot;hey let's hang onto this, we might need it in 27 YEARS!!!&quot;</p>
<p>Why is it so inefficient about what it does/doesnt store?</p>
<p>Edit: Wow thanks to everybody who answered! Apparently we do store vitamins and minerals. I thought we didn't because i heard taking supplemental vitamins was a waste because our bodies just pissed out the extras.</p>
<p>I'm still salty about needing to drink water constantly though. I work in a microbiology lab and have a lot of PPE to deal with every time i leave and reenter the lab to drink. I can't even chug a gallon of water and be good for the day; it has to be gradual.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Oh goodness too many replies to keep track of but you guys rock</p>
<p>Edit 3: Gold! Thanks strangers! And it turns out our bodies store water as well. Just not how i thought. But my eye does twitch when i drink a boatload of water one day, pee most of it out, then next day my body is like &quot;heyo i want more water even though I got rid of most of it yesterday&quot;.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physiologist here. Every reply so far seems to have missed the key fact that we DO store water when needed,  a whopping 1-2 liters of it. Because it is so heavy we don’t do this unless we discover we need to, i.e. we wait until an initial episode of dehydration. After an episode of dehydration, there is an change in water balance hormones (particularly aldosterone) to increase water retention. The next time you drink, the kidney retains water and promptly boosts blood volume by a phenomenal 20% on average, up to 40% in some individuals, even despite the blood dilution that this causes. Over the next two weeks the bone marrow increases red blood cell production so that hematocrit and O2 capacity per ml of plasma returns more or less to normal. The end result is that you carry around an extra 1-2 liters of blood for a while, largely to serve as a store of additional water.</p>
<p>Fun fact, this also occurs upon beginning a cardio exercise program, and is largely responsible for the “exercise plateau” of weight that dieters often experience. New dieters who have also just started an exercise program commonly gain water for the first two weeks, often so much water that it hides underlying fat loss on the scale. Often the dieter maintains weight for the first several weeks (despite eating at a deficit), and sometimes even gains weight. It’s not fat, though; it’s just extra blood, and it’s a good thing - it increases aerobic capacity.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because water is actually pretty hard to store. We need a <em>lot</em> of it, far more than we need fat or sugar. Water is also pretty easy to obtain, so we don't <em>need</em> to store it. Things that do only do so because they can't get it regularly: cacti, camels... </p>
<p>Water is also not only something we discard, it's how we discard <em>other</em> things, things that we have to discard due to their toxicity like urea. A high water intake and output is important for our overall health because it keeps us efficiently removing toxic waste products from our systems. </p>
<p>We actually do store certain vitamins - fat soluble vitamins. Some vitamins are water soluble though, so we have no way of storing them. To store any chemical our body has to sequester it from the water inside our cells. Fat-soluble molecules naturally remove themselves from water anyway, but water soluble ones have to be made water <em>insoluble</em> in order to store them, which means modifying them so that they're not vitamins anymore. </p>
<p>The problem with storage of fats and sugars is that we evolved to be able to survive droughts and other unpredictable conditions. We store excess energy (in the form of fats and sugars) so that we can't be caught off-guard if we ever enter a period of starvation. Fat storage is also a useful insulating tool remaining from when we hadn't invented central heating. So, we have all these mechanisms for storing fats and sugars, but we now live in an environment where starvation pretty much never happens unpredictably and we don't need to build large energy stores. The body always assumes the worst because it's evolved to do so, and if you're over-eating regularly its assuming that a starvation period is coming. So if you're constantly over-eating your body is constantly trying to stockpile energy in fear of an oncoming winter or something, but that never comes and you just keep on eating. </p>
<p>The body is actually <em>incredibly</em> efficient about what it does and doesn't store. It stores everything it needs to be able to store (and can store at all). That's how evolution works after all - it tends towards making the most efficient versions of things possible, as long as more efficiency means a higher survival rate. If it doesn't need to store more energy, then it sends us messages telling us we don't need to eat. If you're storing more fat and sugar than you need, it's because you're <em>eating</em> too much fat and sugar, ignoring those messages, or because of some genetic defect that is meaning that messaging system isn't working properly. Or because of gut bacteria. That's the new focus of dietary science.</p>
<p>Also, the reason we can't store water soluble things is because it's actually toxic to do so. A lot of our body works on the relative concentration of water soluble molecules, and if we have too much of a water soluble molecule, we actually can't absorb any more of it without converting the water soluble molecule to an insoluble form. We actually have to use a very advanced mechanism to absorb glucose at all, that relies on the fact there's more sodium in our intestine than inside our cells.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We do store vitamins. Vitamins A, D, E, and K are fat soluble so can be stored in fat tissue. People who eat a lot of carrots every day are sometimes known to start turning orange because of all the beta carotene (vitamin A precursor) they start storing in their fat tissue. The liver is also a rich reserve of vitamins and minerals. We store so much vitamins B12 in our livers that the typical person could go years without consuming any from food without developing a deficiency.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We do store water - our bodies are \~60% water so we're storing a lot of water. We just also use a lot of it so what we store will only last for a few days (a week at most). If we wanted to carry more water we would have had to evolve some additional means of storing that water - which would likely have involved carrying around a lot of extra weight. For most of human history we lived near a source of water so the ability to stay (somewhat) lean so we could hunt (and get away from stuff hunting us) was far more advantageous than the ability to store something we had ready access to anyway.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It wasn't until we developed other means of storing water (i.e. pack animals) that we were able to spend significant amounts of time in areas where water wasn't readily accessible.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Similarly with vitamins, etc - we only evolved to the point we were able to store enough to last us until we were able to replenish. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Fat is a little bit different. We got good at storing fat essentially because hunting for high fat/protein content food was hard and dangerous so it was better for us to not have to do it as often and to be able to get the most out of doing it as possible. It wasn't until we developed agriculture though until the concept of &quot;excess&quot; food actually became something we needed to worry about - before than we weren't particularly storing &quot;excess&quot; fat - we were simply storing enough to get us by until we could next successfully hunt. The concept of excess food exists because we were able to make advances in technology / social structure giving us access to food quicker than our bodies have been able to evolve a way to deal with having so much food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
