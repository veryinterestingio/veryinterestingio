		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the thermostat, but generally cool is connected to an AC unit while heat is connected to a furnace. When heat is on the temperature might go above the selected temperature and when cool is on it might go below the selected temperature. It would be extremely inefficient to make the temperature be exact since a house has a pretty large volume. Thus the heating/cooling system is more of a greater than/less than system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Instructing the system to repeatedly cycle between heating and cooling modes to maintain a narrow temperature range would consume A LOT of electricity/fuel as the system would potentially be running nearly constantly.</p>
<p>While on a hot summer day, you really don't want to run the heater just because the AC ran a little longer than necessary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two interesting parts to this answer. The first is covered by most of the other comments, in that it would be impractical to maintain the temperature at exactly one degree (e.g. 70). Instead it makes more sense to have a cool setting - &quot;keep it at least as cool as 70 degrees&quot;, and  hot setting - &quot;keep it at least as warm as 70 degrees&quot;, to allow a little wiggle room.</p>
<p>The other portion not covered in the other comments (at least so far) is that how cold or hot it feels is based on more than just the absolute temperature. Other interesting factors include things like direct sunlight, air flow, humidity, and air pressure. Besides the seasonal differences you may have for these that make you feel like 70 in the winter feels different than 70 in the summer, AC also serves as a dehumidifier, contributing to an AC induced 70 feeling different than a heat induced 70.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The same reason why analogue thermostats have them. &quot;Heat&quot; turns on the furnace and &quot;cool&quot; turns on the AC unit. Which is the same reason why one feels colder than the other. On heat the thermostat is trying to reach its sets temperature so the vents are blowing hot air. On cool the opposite it happens. In order to reguajte the temperature of the whole house the thermostat is place away from vents. So a room may be cooler or warmer than the set temperature when the thermostat turns off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>70 is the goal temp, but HVAC systems use much cooler or much hotter air to efficiently get the temp to that level. An AC might blow 40 degree air, while a furnace blows 100 degree air. Each does do until the hot/cold air mixes with the ambient air to hit the desired temp.</p>
<p>Also, an AC turns on and cold until temp drops to 70, while a furnace turns on to warm until it heats up to 70.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
