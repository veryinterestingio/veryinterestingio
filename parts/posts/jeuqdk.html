		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After hearing about this <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-54593295" target="_blank">hilariously amateur</a> looking newly discovered Nazca drawing, I again began considering the Nazca lines as a whole. </p>
<p>How are they so lasting? I read that all they are is displaced or depressed dirt, with a layer of differently colored soil filled into the space. </p>
<p>How has this not been washed away, or how has the surrounding soil not eroded to the point of them not being noticeable. No plants have grown in them. Other soil hasn't filled them in. </p>
<p>I get that that's part of why they're such a wonder, but I'm wondering if anyone can she'd some light on just how they've lasted thousands of years.</p></div></div>

<p>In roughly 200bc someone carved out the beach sand in the shape of a candelabra, and the complete lack of erosion means thats it's still there today.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like someone else said, it's something called desert pavement. It's when smaller grains are removed by wind and pebble to rock sized stuff gets left behind. The color difference happens because the top layer of particles receives all the sunlight, which causes color changes, called desert varnish. The Nazca lines are made by simply brushing away the varnished stones on the surface. Here's the other big point: they've been maintained over time. The same varnish process would change the color of the exposed material, so over the centuries people have gone out with brooms and exposed the lighter layer underneath. </p>
<p>Regarding the new find, slope processes (gravity driven) must have worked on the material that makes up the image, but I don't have an answer for how people have missed it for so long.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Somebody allready talked about desert varnish.  certain rock, undisturbed, gets a tan.  this varnish takes at least 5000 years.  so if you disturb the surface(rocks that don't blow away), it will appear much lighter in those places.  Even 2000 years later.  also in the desert, once that pavement is disturbed, erosion will accelerate in those areas, making new pavement and then varnish, take much longer than 5000 years more to reappear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
