		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What we normally refer to as alcohol is ethanol, which is a moderately toxic chemical compound our body can deal with reasonably well compared to ethanol's meaner cousins.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, alcohol interacts with the brain in a way that it competes with a substance produced by neurons to send signal across synapses (the gaps between neurons). This substance is called GABA (gamma amino butyric acid). A lot of the effects we experience when we drink too much root in this GABA vs ethanol competition. Also alcohol is a drug and can lead to addiction and tolerance, altough it is much weaker in that than e.g. cocaine or nicotine.</p>
<p>The second major organ that suffers from alcohol  is the liver, where ethanol is metabolized to acetaldehyde. This substance is heavily hepatotoxic (liver-damaging) and carcinogenic (which ethanol is as well strictly spoken, but way less). In heavy or long-time drinkers, liver damage such as steathosis, cirrhosis and hepatic cancer can occur.</p>
<p>Also, ethanol acts on your skin's blood vessels. It widens them and it results in you not feeling cold when you normally would. This can be dangerous and has killed quite some people too.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, ethanol rises the risk of some cancer directly too (oral cancer, cancers of the digestive system etc.).</p>
<p>However, moderate alcohol intake does reduce the risk of a stroke. No one knows why, but it does. I'll drink to that, cheers!</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/on-medicine/2016/11/24/alcohol-consumption-stroke/" target="_blank">https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/on-medicine/2016/11/24/alcohol-consumption-stroke/</a>
Quick search on the alcohol-stroke link, shows quite some ambivalence and research is ongoing. Also moderate consumption = 1-2 drinks per day :D</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I didn't read all the comments but I didn't see anyone mention that alcohol inhibits antidiuretic hormone. Antidiuretic hormone tells your kidneys not to release water. So inhibiting ADH means you pee more. So peeing excessively from a night of heavy drinking leaves you dehydrated. Dehydration is a lot of what a hangover is.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Most people don't experience the more severe impacts of alcohol abuse that other people are talking about. Most people get a hangover at some point in their life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let’s not forget that drinking too much for too long throws off your brain chemistry. It can get bad enough that abruptly stopping drinking can kill you. Delirium tremens is what happens when your body tries to counteract having a constant presence of a depressant thus it produces more chemicals to “bring you back to normal”. When you stop using alcohol the brain is still over-producing these chemicals so your brain is hyper-sensitive. This can lead to hallucinations, panic/anxiety attacks, uncontrollable shaking, seizures, and death. </p>
<p>Alcohol is one of the most dangerous substances to come down off of. If you or someone you know is trying to quit, they should do so under medical supervision. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some people (not necessarily OP) seem to mistakenly believe that when the body “breaks something down,“ it just disappears, or becomes inert. This isn’t the case. The body breaks things down, or metabolizes them, into simpler compounds that can then be used for energy, namely sugar.</p>
<p>I’m sure you already know that the “alcohol“ in alcoholic drinks is a specific kind of alcohol called ethanol. The metabolic process for ethanol is a bit complex, and goes through several stages:</p>
<p>Most alcohol is metabolized in your liver by an enzyme called ‘alcohol dehydrogenase’ (ADH).<br />
ADH breaks down alcohol into acetaldehyde, which is similar to formaldehyde and toxic to the body, and then another enzyme, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), rapidly breaks down acetaldehyde into acetic acid, which is basically vinegar, which the body digests.</p>
<p>Drinking alcohol is not guaranteed to cause liver damage; it’s only when you drink in excess.<br />
The reason it harms you is because your liver can only break down ethanol and acetaldehyde so quickly, and if you drink too much too quickly, your liver can’t metabolize everything fast enough.<br />
As a result, the acetaldehyde remains in your system longer than it should, and because it’s toxic, it causes damage to the liver.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
