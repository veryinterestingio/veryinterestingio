		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pants/trousers used to be two separate pieces that were lashed together with something similar to a shoelace. Shirts on the other hand were often a single piece of fabric. Over time pants were made into a single unit that was permanently stitched together and closed via button flies and eventually zippers as opposed to being laced together but the linguistic heritage of them being plural due to being two tubes remained. </p>
<p>Wearing clothing under your pants to help keep them clean and thus need washing less became common and this article of clothing was often called &quot;under-pants&quot; because they were worn under your pants. The plurality of the nature of pants stuck to the words used to reference what is under them, and so they are called a pair.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
