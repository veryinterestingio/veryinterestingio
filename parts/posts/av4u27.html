		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are actually increasingly on the rise and becoming an endemic problem in many cities precisely because they’re so fast to breed and hard to get rid of. There’s a great post on /r/bedbugs (on mobile so can’t link) about how we were actually almost rid of them in the 70s thanks to pesticides that in turn were also incredibly toxic to humans (edit: caveat that, as pointed out below, the toxicity was first and foremost to birds, and less critically so to humans) and thus were removed from the market, and now bed bugs are coming back with a vengeance. Overuse of only semi-effective pesticides is also causing them to build resistances through thicker shells, so one of the best treatments nowadays is heating the entire building up to over 120F and then leaving desiccants (dust that dries them out until they are nothing but little shreds) and residual pesticides to catch any that managed to dodge the heat. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I lived in the ghetto I learned quickly that what ever pest your neighbors had you also had. I had ants, spiders, and mice... until I got overwhelmed by bedbugs. It got so bad that I didn’t want to go to work because people would question the hives I had. So I looked up what eats bed bugs, and it was the previous pests. So I had to choose which devil I wanted. So I started to leave little droplets of syrup all over my house and the ants slowly returned neutralizing the bed bugs.</p>
<p>EDIT: My first gold! Thank you kind stranger!</p>
<p>This seems to be taking off so I’ll give more details. The infestation I had was so immense and genuinely scared me more than anything in my life at that point. I would wake up at night with a flashlight looking after I felt them crawling on me.
I’m not saying ants were the only method I used to fend them off, but they definitely were the straw that broke the bedbugs back.
I was broke and could not afford everything at once, so I started with the ants on week one. Week two sprayed all my fabrics with a lavender/ peppermint oil mixture to kill the larvae and act as a repellent. The next couple of weeks I washed everything with borax and after a month of staying tidy, constant laundry, and leaving treats for my exoskeletal friends I was pretty much rid of them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have brains and can outhink bedbugs. They are vulnerable to heat. Use mattress covers and bedbug traps on bedposts and furniture posts. Steam clean everything often. Keep stuff off the ground. Sanitize clothes in a dryer with a sanitizer feature (aka really hot). Pull furniture away from walls. Use diatomaceous earth, tea tree oil, and alcohol sprays on places you think they are or are traveling from/to. Seal up any cracks in your home including around electrical outlets. Shower often. While bedbugs are persistent, humans can be more persistent. That's really the key. Took me about 6 months of this behavior and I finally purged my house. No bites in over a year. I left the mattress covers on to prevent future infestation plus it protects the mattress from dust mites and stains. I left the bedbug traps on my furniture to prevent future infestations and they also catch spiders, rollie pollies, and other random creepy crawlys. I occasionally still steam clean because it sanitizes my furniture and keeps it clean. My hygiene in general is better from the experience so I turned the negative experience into a positive one. Also, I've never had bedbugs prior to this, was forced into a hasty move and the place I picked had them. I ended up tearing out the carpet in the one room that had carpet, that seemed to be their main infestation area which really helped. Prior to ripping the carpet I salted the earth with two bags of DE. The exterminator used the words &quot;overkill&quot; and &quot;mummified bedbug corpses&quot; to describe my assault. Be sure to use a HEPA grade respirator when dealing with DE. Use the pesticide grade DE not the food grade.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of things will eat them, spiders, centipedes, and I'm sure plenty of bugs. But that's not what keeps them in check.</p>
<p>They eat human blood, they can't really survive anywhere without humans, if they get to infestation level, humans are pretty good at killing them. We have strong insecticides, and physical barriers can be effective (like just putting your bed in dishes of water so they can't climb up the bed), wrapping the mattress in plastic, and washing all your clothes. They'll starve to death in about a year that way. Vacuums can suck them up as well. Basically, if you know there are lots of bedbugs in your home, you probably will do a pretty good job at eradicating them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
