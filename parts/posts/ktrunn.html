<p>e: Thanks for the awards and the many answers, I didn't think something this niche would get a lot of traction. the answers of u/Raikhyt, u/radioactivist, u/grolbol, and the link to the talk u/Deyvicous posted helped a lot. I found a dissertation chapter that explains some more background to this, for anyone interested: <a href="http://sundoc.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/diss-online/07/07H039/t8.pdf" target="_blank">Diss</a> (I hope edits are allowed)</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In most cases when time-reversal symmetry is spontaneously broken in solids, it is due to the presence of magnetic order (there are some, relatively esoteric, exceptions in theory) which involves the spins or orbital motion of the electrons. So the spin or orbital moments pick some preferred configuration/orientation (depending on their precise interactions) which is not invariant if you reverse time. </p>
<p>So, while it does depend on the arrangement of the atoms it's not &quot;from&quot; the arrangement of the atoms in any real sense. These being usually being distinct is manifested in the fact the temperature at which magnetic order sets in is typically different (below) the temperature at which the atoms solidify and form a periodic crystalline structure.</p>
<p>That said, if I recall correctly, there are a few examples (I could try and dig out the references if you're interested) where translational symmetry breaking and time-reversal symmetry breaking happen simultaneously -- i.e. you go directly from a paramagnetic liquid to a magnetic ordered solid. This is analogous to solidification of non-centrosymmetric crystals, where inversion symmetry is broken along translations. But even in this case it's still magnetic order in the above sense (coming from the electronic spin/orbital d.o.f.), but is a more intertwined with the structural degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>It's quite uncommon though -- in most materials that become magnetic the solidification temperature is somewhat high relative to typically magnetic ordering temperatures/energy scales. There are exceptions though; e.g. (metallic) ferromagnetism in iron, some copper-based anti-ferromagnets (many more). If I recall correctly, the compounds where the two transitions coincide were some funny metallic alloys.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am an applied physics PhD student designing photonic topolohical insulators. My time to shine! The most common way to break time reversal symmetry in solid state systems is to apply a magnetic field. The magnetic field can play the same role as a velocity v as in the example that you gave. In fact, in the electromagnetic Lorentz force they play a similar role since F= q(E + v x B) where F is the force, q is the charge v is the velocity and B is the magnetic field. The reason we apply a magnetic field instead of using some other quantity to break time reversal symmetry is because it is more feasible to do in a lab setting. Maintaining your entire sample moving at a constant high enough velocity is out of the question in a normal building. Applying a strong magnetic field has its own issues but it is doable. </p>
<p>As for why the breaking of time reversal symmetry brings out the  Hall effect, we have to delve into what is a topological insulator. A topological insulator is an insulator, so it has no conducting states in its bulk, but due to it being in a different topological class than vacuum, you cannot interpolate its wave function continuously to the vacuum wave function. In essence, imagine you have a a wave function that looks like a donut inside the insulator but the wave function far from it is a mug with no handle. The donut has one hole and the mug none. Topology tells us that in order to transform the mug to a donut we have to rip it at some point, breaking continuity of the wave function. But the problem is that physical quantities are usually continuous. To settle this discrepancy something has to give. That thing that gives is a local discontinuity in the vicinity of the edge of the insulator in the form of a conducting state that is localized around the termination, or edge of the insulator. Breaking of time reversal symmetry comes into play because it (in one of the simple cases) assures us there is only one such state that propagates in one direction. That is important because if we have an electron at that edge conducting state propagating along the edge and it meets a defect (a missing atom for example) along the edge it cannot scatter backwards because there does not exist a backward scattering conducting state to scatter to! This can get more complicated if there is time reversal symmetry cause then there will be such a state. Scattering to that state can still be suppressed under certain conditions. </p>
<p>The crystal Hall effect in antiferromagnetic systems is just a somewhat more complicated scenario where we have two copies of the time reversal broken Hall effect system, one provides a forward and the other a backward propagating state. Scattering is suppressed between those states due to the difference in either spin degree of freedom, valley, both or another degree of freedom depending on the specific system.</p>
<p>Edit: I happened to design a photonic time reversal system that emulates an electronic time reversal broken antiferromagnetic topological insulator, so hopefully I know what I am saying :)</p>
<p>Edit2: originally in my mind the mug had no handle. Clarified the mug has no handle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Time reversal is a really tricky one to grasp.  While a cup of coffee seems to always cool, the molecules moving around all obey equations that have time reversed solutions as well.  Philosophically, we have no idea why that symmetry seems to be broken in some systems.  For stuff like thermodynamics, we make assumptions about the way probability works, and say maybe that’s why the symmetry is broken.  We never see backwards time solutions for coffee cooling, so somehow the symmetry of the equations disappeared.</p>
<p>For antiferromagnetism, and a lot of magnetism in general, particle spin is the main factor.  Maybe the classic example of symmetry breaking in ferromagetism would help a bit: the spins of a ferromagnet prefer to align, but if you give each particle enough energy, the spins are just randomly oriented, hence producing a net zero magnetic field.  It is a symmetric configuration, where spin in any direction is the same.  But below that temperature, the magnetic domains randomly choose a direction to all align in, breaking the symmetry.  Spin wants to align, and if it’s not aligned, it affects the system, where as with the symmetry, spin can point in any direction without affecting anything.</p>
<p>So back to time reversal - the spins are in such a configuration where backwards solutions don’t exist, but before that happened, the backwards time solutions did exist.  I could be wrong but I believe this occurs because of the addition of magnetic fields.  As you mention for the car example, velocity is not the same under time reversal.  So what about magnetic fields?  Magnetic fields are flipped under time reversal.  If we want to time reverse a magnetic field we also have to take B —&gt; -B.  So the addition of magnetic fields breaks the time reversal symmetry of the crystal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
