		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the speed of light, the time it takes electricity to cross the surface of the chip is so drastically close to that 1/5 billionth of a second before the next signal is following behind it, that it becomes very difficult to design the chips to all have the same concept of &quot;now&quot;.</p>
<p>You could make asynchronous chips, where each part operates on a different time as the other parts, but nobody's yet done that for a mainstream chip that I know of.</p>
<p>You can get it a bit faster by cooling the whole setup down but pretty soon you need to cool it to ridiculous temperatures to keep it stable.</p>
<p>It's a physical limit to do with the size of the chip &quot;die&quot;, the speed at which an electrical signal can propagate across the chip (the speed of light, or thereabouts), and trying to keep everything on the same &quot;clock&quot; as the rest of the chip so you're all acting on the data in turn at the right times.</p>
<p>Pretty much, until you liquid cool you can't get past 5Ghz.  And the fastest ever processor is only about 10GHz or something - and it has to be kept stupendously cold, be stupendously tiny, and have rooms full of supporting equipment to get that far.</p>
<p>Pretty much, without some breakthrough in physics, you're never going to see a chip much faster than 5GHz in a normal setup.</p>
<p>You might see a chip that can do a thousand times as much in that 5GHz, which is why we have dual-core, quad-core, up to ridiculous numbers of cores in GPUs, but the base clock never really gets past 5GHz because it can't.</p>
<p>Until someone makes an asynchronous CPU, or quantum computers come along and make it all moot, 5GHz is about the limit for a normal, household computer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thermal budget mostly. You've got to cool every watt you make. Power consumption (which is synonymous with the heat you have to dissipate) increases greater-than-linear with respect to increased clock speed, but power consumption increases vaguely linear with respect to increased cores. So you can get more performance within a 100 Watt budget by increasing cores than by increasing frequency. Also there is still room for architectural improvements, such as increasing the pipeline length (although that might be a dated example). So progress is being made in the directions progress can be made.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several physical effects in conflict with each other:</p>
<ul>
<li>In one four-billionth of a second (period of a 4 GHz clock), electromagnetic effects will propagate only about 5 centimeters through copper, and you need the state of the CPU to resolve in significantly less time than that, so you want transistors as physically close as possible</li>
<li>As transistors get smaller and closer together, they become harder to manufacture without defects, have less surface area through which to dissipate heat, and have increased mutual capacitance, which adds latency to the propagation of logic unless voltage is increased</li>
<li>Increasing voltage dissipates more heat in the processor, which necessitates more expensive cooling solutions and may do more damage to the processor</li>
