		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Diffusion does occur across the interface, so there must be a source of salt to replenish the pool.  However, one factor that helps maintain a sharp interface between brine and fresher water is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_diffusive_convection" target="_blank">&quot;double diffusion&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>If you have warm brine beneath colder fresher water, both salt and heat will diffuse across the boundary, but heat diffuses faster than salt.  This means that the fresh water right above the boundary will be warmer than usual, so it will rise into the freshwater above.  Contrariwise, the uppermost part of the brine will be cooled, and sink into the brine.  This creates strong mixing within each layer, but sharpens the boundary between them.</p>
<p>This doesn't reduce the rate at which brine is lost from the &quot;lake&quot; -- in fact it increases it -- but it does keep the surface of the layer sharp rather than fuzzy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is my understanding that they are. However you would expect the process to proceed extremely slowly given the low thermal and kinetic energy of the environment - and the extreme difference in density between the lake and the surrounding sea water. An observed lake could be in the process of actively growing (due to replenishment) or shrinking (due to dissolution of and mixing), but because the process proceeds slowly it appears to be a feature of fixed size.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other answers here are pretty good afaik, but there's an aspect that hasn't been addressed explicitly that's worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Basically, diffusion is pretty fast on a small spatial scale, but fairly slow on a large spatial scale. Here's a stack overflow post with decent answers relating the length and time scale of diffusion <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/108159/characteristic-length-for-the-diffusion-equation-temperature" target="_blank">https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/108159/characteristic-length-for-the-diffusion-equation-temperature</a></p>
<p>To sum up the basic idea, if height is y, and the boundary of the salty region is at y^<em>, you'll get a lot of diffusion of salt content at heights very close to y^</em>, but the further away from the boundary the lower the salt transfer will be, going with approximately 1/root(y-y^*).</p>
<p>It's kind of like if you put a drop of food coloring into a glass of water, the color will immediately blossom out from that drop to a certain distance, but it'll go pretty slowly from there without water currents moving the food coloring particles around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a chemistry teacher, solubility is a LOT different to the overly simplified crap we typically teach you about polar / non-polar.</p>
<p>First off the explanation about polarity and intermolecular forces doesn't take into account entropy, which is a very very big reason things like to mix. For example, dissolving table salt in water is slightly endothermic, suggesting the bnding interactions of the mixture are actually WEAKER than the interactions when solid and liquid are kept separate. This is usually how we teach you to identify insoluble salts like magnesium hydroxide. However, once you consider that the ENTROPIC advantage of spreading all the ions out in water outweighs the energy cost for many salts, it explains why we can have at least some soluble salts with an endothermic enthalpy of solution.</p>
<p>Entropy is also why oils typically form monolayers instead of lots of small micelles in water - small micelles force the water molecules to form very ordered &quot;cages&quot; of surface around them, which is entropically unfavourable. You get a greater diversity of arrangements if it's just one big lipid layer and another big water layer. Notice that this in itself explains the &quot;hydrphobic effect&quot; without even accounting for what intermolecular forces are involved.</p>
<p>Similar sort of things happen with other liquids of very substantial difference in polarity or ionic strength, like say super duper briney water and not so briney water in the ocean, like you've observed here.</p>
<p>Density also plays a way bigger part in this than we account for too.  I mean dochloromethane doesn't mix with water, yet it has a bigger dipole moment than HCl, which does. The difference is largely dichloromethane's density.</p>
<p>If you've ever seen those &quot;density columns&quot; with like nine different coloured layers of liquid on top of eachother all of different densities, they're often set up by just dissolving different amounts of say, salts or sugar in each layer to change the density and ionic strength and so on.</p>
<p>Basically TL;DR, we lie to you about how solubility works for the most part. The story you're taught is rather incomplete.</p>
<p>&quot;Like dissolves like&quot; works much more broadly than people realise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Iirc from Enviro:
Brine pools aren’t on the surface or just floating around, they’re basically extremely salty puddles on the ocean floor in crater-like zones.  Because the water is so saturated with salt, it’s several times more dense and sinks into those pits, needing a strong current to move that much dense brine out of there.  Which doesn’t happen because the water current has no reason to hit it diagonally, so it will flow along the floor and skirt the top of the heavy pool.  Even if the current were to forcefully penetrate, the deposits that made the brining pool in the first place would continue to do so with the new water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
