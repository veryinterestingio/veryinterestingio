		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In RGB if you add pure green to pure red you get pure yellow. (255,255,0)</p>
<p>This is cuz the colors are additive / based on light.</p>
<p>For ink/paint if you add pure red to pure green, you get like a muddy brown. This is cuz the colors are more multiplying / mixing. So for ink/paint they need values that mix to get the color you want. This is also why in cmyk/printed color you can only get so ‘bright’ when mixing color, like you could never ‘mix’ a fluorescent yellow or green, you’d have to formulate that specially as a spot color.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked at a paint store for 4 years. Color matching random things that customers brought in was my specialty.  </p>
<p>The problem is that the computer software that paint stores use doesn't accept RGB/CMYK/HSL color codes. It translates color into formulas or recipes of tint/pigment/colorant (colored liquids that mix into white or clear base paints). At stores like Home Depot, the computer contains the database of tint formulas to produce their proprietary colors. The employees at big general stores like that don't generally do much color matching beyond asking you to just pick the closest color chip from their wall.  </p>
<p>At my store, which specialised in paint only, our computer had a spectrometer that could scan physical samples, but this would still only provide a list of possible tint formulas that could produce the color. It had no way of translating a color code without a physical sample to scan. Once the sample was scanned, we'd take the base formula, scale it back a little bit in case it went too dark (there's no taking the tint out, so it's ruined once it's gone too dark), and then tint and mix it. We'd then test it by painting a bit of it on some cardboard and flash drying it with a blow dryer and then visually comparing it to the sample. We'd then add more tint as necessary (too blue, add a little more yellow oxide, too light, add a little umber, too red, add a little more pthalo green, etc.) and check it again until we get as close to an exact match to the sample as possible. Of course we kept track of everything added so that we could label the can with the formula we came up with to reproduce the color if you need more paint.  </p>
<p>Your best bet is to fiddle with a program like Adobe Illustrator and see if you can get a print version of the color you want. Then take the printout to a specialty paint store that has a scanner and will do custom color matching.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay... there's a lot of half-information and misinformation in the responses so far.</p>
<p>Here's an ELI5:</p>
<p>RGB coordinates are like map coordinates. They specify a colour in the same way latitude and longitude specify a position on Earth. Assuming you agree on the prime longitude meridian, that is. Most people use the Greenwich meridian in London, however you can use others - France used a meridian passing through Paris for many years. If you have the wrong prime meridian, your coordinates will map to the <em>wrong place</em>.</p>
<p>Similarly, colour coordinates use what is known as a colour space - a set of axes that define how the coordinates map to colours. There are several different colour spaces, and unlike the Paris meridian (which has faded from use), they are all in use. If you don't know or can't specify what colour space you are using, then your RGB coordinates are meaningless. The hardware store paint mixing guy could (in theory) <em>assume</em> you're using some common colour space, but that might be wrong, and you'd be upset when you found the paint wasn't the colour you were expecting.</p>
<p>The hardware store assistant might not know all of this, but has been told that the paint mixing machine can't operate on RGB input, and is trying to explain to you as best they can. The real reason it won't take RGB input is because if it did it would have to guess what colour space you are using, and the risk of getting it wrong and having customers complain is too high.</p>
<p>Further information:</p>
<p>Responses here saying that paint uses CMYK instead of RGB are kind of half-true, but missing the important point. You can convert an RGB colour specification into a CMYK specification - <em>if you know both the source RGB and target CMYK colour spaces</em>. If you know only one (say, the RGB space), but not the other, or if you know neither, then it's a crapshoot.</p>
<p>If you know what you're doing, you can sample a colour with a high quality spectrometer, and produce an RGB specification in a known colour space. But you don't know what CMYK space the paint mixing machine uses, so doing the conversion won't help you. If you <em>did</em> know, perhaps by looking up the machine's specs, then you could do the conversion, and it should work... with another caveat:</p>
<p>Being a pigment based system, paint can't reproduce all the different colours that we can see. It's quite possible that the colour you want to reproduce <em>can't</em> be reproduced by paint. This is particularly true for very vivid and saturated colours.</p>
<p>One more wrinkle: Surface colours suffer from what is called <em>metamerism</em>. This means they can look like different colours to our eyes depending on the lighting. You can particularly notice this with some materials that look, for example, olive green under fluorescent lights but a tan brown colour under sunlight. It's very common for people to take a material in to be colour matched, compare it to a swatch in the hardware store, they mix the paint, you take it home and paint it on your surface, under different lighting conditions, and it doesn't match. To get a match you need to compare it under the exact lighting conditions where you're normally going to view the paint. You ned to take the swatches from the hardware store home and do the comparison there.</p>
<p>Another point: Taking a photo of a surface, or of anything, is not a good way to find a paint colour match. Photographs can't reproduce all the colours we see, and any device on which you display the photo, or print the photo, will almost certainly not be colour calibrated - meaning the display/print will in fact be a different colour to the one you took a photo of. If you take a photo of something and take that to the hardware store for paint matching, I can pretty much guarantee the paint you get won't match the thing you took a photo of. (unless you're extremely lucky)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
