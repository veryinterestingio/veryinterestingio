<p>The speed in which changes in gravitational field propagate is finite and also apparently equal to the speed of light. Recent successes with gravitational wave detection by projects like LIGO support this claim. So if an object outside of our observable universe were to &quot;propagate&quot; their gravitational influence to the star we can see, and then the image of that star affected by gravity propagate to us it would take at least the same amount of time it would have taken the signal from &quot;unobservable&quot; object to reach us directly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a fantastic episode of PBS spacetime on this, findings from this paper I believe (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.01214" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.01214</a>). It establishes that you can observe the relative accelerations of (redshifts) of different &quot;standard candle&quot; stars. For instance, we discovered the existence of Dark Energy by observing that the acceleration or redshifts of stars are actually increasing over time, despite there being so much matter and Dark matter in the observable universe. The study found that all matter in the universe is being somewhat pulled in a specific direction. However, when we investigate if there is anything in that direction that could cause this massive gravitational effect, we see nothing (no extra matter, dark matter, black holes, nothing). One hypothesis is there is something unimaginably massive (like puts messier87 to shame) in that direction, but outside the boundary of our observable universe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think there is a fundamental misunderstanding of what the &quot;edge of the observable universe&quot; is. There are sort of two ways to think about this. The actual edge of the &quot;observable&quot; universe is essentially the CMB, the surface of last scattering. We can only &quot;see&quot; things whose light we can collect. The CMB is a background where, more or less, all light scattered at once, we don't have any information about the light before this event, so we can't &quot;see&quot; past this point. Taking this as the edge of the universe we can't really make statements about things crossing this edge because the edge exists in time, not space.</p>
<p>The second way to think of the edge is as a causal boundary, that is, a place that is so far away from us that light cannot reach us from there. If we were to consider this the edge then we wouldn't be able to tell any effects of things on the far side of the edge on things on the near side of the edge because we would have moved too far forward in time for that information to propagate towards us. We currently live in an era where the horizon of the universe is time-based rather than space-based, so, for now, everything is causally connected and we would be able to, theoretically, see up to the big bang. As the universe ages though, and the acceleration of the expansion of the universe continues, we will &quot;lose touch&quot; with the rest of the universe. Eventually, all of the light from galaxies outside our own will be unable to reach us and the sky will begin to darken as the horizon shrinks around us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
