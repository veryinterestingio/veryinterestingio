<p>Note that this means very superficial injuries don't leave permanent scars.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you dug up an area of garden soil and replaced it with sand. Plants will grow everywhere except the sandy area. </p>
<p>When a scar is deep enough it damages the part of your skin that does not replace itself, and the gap is filled with collagen/scar tissue which isn't normal skin. As a result you have a change in color/texture and the area also won't grow hair. It's biological patchwork.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer that gets to the point is that when you have a relatively serious cut (think, more than a paper cut), part of the healing process involves filling in the wound with a different kind of tissue than just skin cells. Instead, serious wounds get filled in with something called fibrous connective tissue. That fibrous connective tissue is sort of bulky and not very flexible, but in a pinch is a good way to heal a wound. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The skin cells already there when you have a scar don’t know how to NOT be a scar, so they can’t tell the new skin cells to not be a scar either. The coding to make your skin look like it once did is more or less lost, so the new skin cells just keep doing what the old ones did and you are left with the same looking scar</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
