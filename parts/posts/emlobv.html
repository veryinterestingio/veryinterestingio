		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>10 feet. Your perception of depth is just how the light hits your eyes. You can draw a line from your foot to the mirror to your eyes, and then follow the line from your eye to the mirror and keep going to behind the mirror. The light didn’t actually come from behind the mirror, but it is as if it did, and you perceive it as if it did. I’m glossing over details of how you actually perceive depth, but that’s the basic idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>10ft. If you have an SLR camera you can measure the distance from the lens to the mirror, then focus on the reflection of the lens. When you read off the focal distance, it's twice the distance to the mirror.</p>
<p>Hand-wavey evidence is that the light reflected by the mirror behaves <em>as if</em> the light is coming from the reflected object. This article is pretty good, the diagrams are better than me explaining bunch of stuff like normals and angles of incidence: <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zw42ng8/revision/1" target="_blank">https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zw42ng8/revision/1</a></p>

Look at that, and your face goes out of focus. Look at your face, and the finger goes out of focus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eye doctors in many countries use a mirror to create a &quot;folded room&quot;. The optics of prescription glasses requires a 20-foot test distance, and a 12-foot room is less expensive than a 22-foot room ( 2 ft for the chair). Eye charts for these rooms are always printed backwards.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

My proof: if you look at your relexion on your phones display the text on the display is not in focus and the other way round.
