		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. In fact, this is called cohorting and is sometimes practiced as a way to prevent the spread of disease. For example, if you have two patients with the same antibiotic-resistant organism, sometimes they will be put in isolation in the same room. They both have the same thing, so they can't really infect each other, and this means that we won't need to put someone not infected in the room with one infected person and put them at risk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many of the answers are postulating that the quarantine  with other individuals will shorten the illness, however, the virus works on a load based equilibrium.</p>
<p>What this means is that the larger community will get better faster but the quarantined individuals will have less global resources (whole body) to commit to immune fortification while it is still in immune response.</p>
<p>So if you continue to touch infected materials, new cells are going to be infected and they have to be dealt with, even after immune fortification occurs.</p>
<p>If you havent learned about S curves, take a moment to do so. The communal effects are an emergent property of how our own bodies respond to an illness.</p>
<ul>
<li>Slow spread of illness</li>
<li>Positive logarithmic growth</li>
<li>Incubation</li>
<li>The first few cells die</li>
<li>RNA invoked lysis</li>
<li>Positive exponential growth</li>
<li>The immune system response</li>
<li>Inflection point</li>
<li>Immune fortification</li>
<li>RNA is encoded into immune cells</li>
<li>Negative exponential reduction</li>
<li>Stabilization</li>
<li>Negative logarithmic growth</li>
<li>Virus is contained</li>
<li>New homeostatic zero state</li>
<li>New viral black sites in DNA</li>
<li>New DNA sequence to pass on to offspring</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a thing called “viral load”.  This is why young doctors and nurses are dying at an higher rate than expected.  The immune system has to fight off your own virus, plus the newly inhaled.  Death also causes the virus to leave the sinking ship.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Somewhat related question since people are bringing up &quot;viral load&quot;. I know a single virus would be enough to cause infection, but could our bodies fight off a really small amount of the virus before it starts causing symptoms?  Versus continuously exposing yourself and getting an overall much larger dose?</p>
<p>In example: say I touch something that has the virus on it, therefore picking it up. I casually itch my nose once before washing my hands thoroughly. Would I be in a lot better chance of not actually getting sick, than say if I just didn't wash my hands?</p>
<p>I ask because somewhere on reddit recently had a post saying that people that wash their hands 4-5 times a day are much less at risk of getting sick. Didn't look into it besides the headline as I scrolled through.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
