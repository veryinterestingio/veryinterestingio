		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a patient of kerateconus, never ever rub your eyes.  I used to agree that rubbing your eyes was heaven, but now I'm slowly going blind.  When you rub your eyes you are slowly degrading the integrity of your cornea, and it will start to deform.  I wish I would have known at a younger age before the damage was done.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had it explained to me that it feels good because you're giving the soft tissue around the eye a massage. There are many very finely tuned muscles that operate the eye and eyelid as well as the soft tissue under the eye and around the brow. Just like any other area of our body, a massage brings in blood flow which gives us a good sensation, the way getting up and stretching does too.</p>
<p>As others have commented it can be dangerous to do. I have to restrain myself as my doctor told me it can cause and worsen astigmatism and astigmatism makes glasses/contacts more expensive. When I DO rub my eyes, I try to avoid the cornea and instead rub around the eyeball, also hitting some pressure points on the cheek bone and forehead for an overall relaxing sensation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
