<p>So, as you compress a liquid, what actually happens? Does it cool down as its molecules become constrained? Eventually, I guess it'll come down to what has the greatest structural integrity: the &quot;plunger&quot;, the driving &quot;piston&quot;, or the liquid itself. One of those will be the first to give, right? What happens if it is the liquid that gives? Fusion?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Correct, they are just much harder to compress than gas. At the bottom of the ocean the water is compressed by a few percent compared to the top. Typically compressing a liquid enough turns it into a solid, water is a little weird in that regular ice is less dense, so if you compress water enough it'll form a less-common phase of ice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you pressurize water to extreme #'s in a nuclear reactor you can see reactor power go up just a little bit as the molecules get just enough increase in density to cause more neutrons to reflect back into the core. (The increase in density of water causes more neutrons to bounce off moderator(water) and go back into the core to cause more reactions in the fuel.) We geeked out watching it happen while we were testing the piping in the reactor for our submarine, it was just a little increase but enough to make the nerds happy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>if you compress a liquid it will heat up, not cool down and become pressurised.</p>
<p>What will give in the case of most liquids is it will become solid, though you'd generally need a very strong container.</p>
<p>For water which expands as becomes solid, it's a bit weird but still doable.  You get a different form of ice than normal, ice IV.  You don't get it on Earth because of the immense pressure required.  Planets with 20km deep oceans might have it though.</p>
<p>They are mostly considered incompressible fluids for thermodynamics because the amount of pressure for any change in volume is vast.  It simplifies calculations without introducing significant errors most of the time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Liquids can definitely be compressed, just not in situations common to our every day life. I work with Ultra-High Pressure water systems (10-40K PSI) and the compression of water is something we have to take into account on the higher end of that range. At pressures close to 40,000 PSI the volume of water delivered is ~85% of the volume before compression.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're right. Liquids like water can be compressed. However, for almost all intents and purposes, it can be treated as if its incompressible; its compression is small enough to be considered insignificant. If a liquid were compressible in a significant fashion at standard conditions, it would be considered a gas. That's why some scientists will designate some fluids as an &quot;incompressible fluid&quot; rather than a liquid, or &quot;compressible fluid&quot; instead of a gas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
