		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a variety of factors involved.</p>
<p>In the case of kidney failure due to COVID-19, many people of African descent are more susceptible due to variants in the APOL1 gene. This isn't specific to COVID-19 though, the variants just make the kidneys weaker in general. Source: <a href="https://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/31/8/1688" target="_blank">https://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/31/8/1688</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4157456/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4157456/</a></p>
<p>Interestingly, people with darker skin are more likely to be vitamin-D deficient, which may be another risk factor. (Plus, people of West African descent are usually lactose-intolerant, and an important source of dietary vitamin D is milk.)</p>
<p>Also minority communities have a higher rate of pre-existing conditions due to societal and environmental factors. This increases the risks for complications.</p>
<p>Finally, people of low socioeconomic status may be unable to effectively practice social distancing (imagine living in very crowded conditions to save on rent).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;While there's no evidence that people of color have genetic or other biological factors that make them more likely to be affected by COVID-19, they are more likely to have underlying health conditions. Having certain conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, increases your risk of severe illness with COVID-19.&quot;</p>
<p>Other factors include a higher likelihood of working a public-facing or essential job - for example Black Americans represent ~11% of America's population but ~30% of its licensed practical and vocational nurses - and a higher prevalence of living in larger, multi-generational family homes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s very clear that there are different disease rates and outcomes among several minorities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the US, the disparity in COVID-19 mortality among minority populations is well known. It has become increasingly evident that the race or socioeconomic status of individuals affects their access to quality healthcare in the US, which may be the defining factor in acquiring COVID-19 disease, and may determine whether they survive. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s also obvious that the same minorities also have different socio-economic situations. If you look at non-minority groups <em>with the same socio-economic risks</em>, do they have similar disease risks?  In other words, is there something about the minority directly (some genetic risk factor - not at all impossible), or are they at more risk because they have worse access to health care, more dangerous jobs, etc?</p>
<p>In general, it looks as if the latter explains most of the increased risk:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Findings</strong>  In this cohort study of 11 210 individuals with COVID-19 presenting for care at 92 hospitals across 12 states, there was no difference in all-cause, in-hospital mortality between White and Black patients <em>after adjusting for age, sex, insurance status, comorbidity, neighborhood deprivation, and site of care</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Meaning</strong>  In this study, race was not independently associated with in-hospital mortality after adjusting for differences in sociodemographic and clinical factors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it’s important to understand that this is not a simple relationship - there are a huge number of dominos that have already fallen that have led to ongoing health disparities, and the solutions are not likely to be simple and easily put into place - many are linked to (very understandable) mistrust of authorities as well as deeply entrenched and unconscious biases in health care.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Longstanding health disparities such as diabetes, hypertension, CVD, and pulmonary disease among minority populations in the US may serve to predispose these communities to SARS-CoV-2 infection and increased risk for clinically severe COVID-19. The underlying social determinants of health and standards of care in minority communities must be improved to end these disparities. Improvements will require changes in governmental policy and a long-term commitment to minority communities that includes early interventions and prevention strategies to reduce or eliminate major healthy disparities on the way to achieving health equity.</p>
