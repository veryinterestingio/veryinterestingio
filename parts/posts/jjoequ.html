<p>Think of it this way does the military always throw every single weapon in to combat? Would say a small insurrection require unloading the USAs entire nuclear arsenal to deal with it?  Ideally the military only uses as much force as necessary the same thing is going on with the immune system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I noticed a majority of these comments are off of one comment so I’ll have a go at it through my perspective and understanding (2nd year immunology major at university of Toronto). </p>
<p>There are two main ways your body fights infections through the immune system. The first is the innate immune response and the second is the adaptive immune response. </p>
<p>The innate immune response cells are always the first cells to the site of infection. Specifically dendritic cells and macrophages. Later on more innate immune cells come like neutrophils and mast cells. They assault the area of infection and through mechanisms too extensive to detail right now, which leads to clinical symptoms like inflammation of the infected area. This response is very general and the innate immune cells are not discriminatory (same attack for every invader). However, if time passes on (the exact time is blurry but around a few days), the invader (covid) is still present, then dendritic cells will load themselves with the virus and move to secondary lymphatic tissue (most common one is the lymph nodes. That why you’ll notice that when you have a cold or infection, your lymph nodes under your jaw are more noticeable and appear swollen). </p>
<p>From here, dendritic cells will essentially present the virus to T cells and B cells. They basically say “hey, this is what’s in the body, it’s causing an issue, go kill it”. The T and B cells will be like “you got it” and differentiate into effector cells where they are prepared and ready to go kill the virus. They will travel through the blood stream to the site infection. From there they will release molecules and proteins called cytokines (T cells) and antibodies (B cells). The cytokines and antibodies will kill the virus and virus infected cells. The issue is that a clinical side effect of these cytokines/antibodies is even more severe inflammation, pain, coughing (from irritation), and tissue damage of the area. Although the B cells and T cells are specific and discriminatory towards the virus, there is collateral damage to the host tissue. Most of the time, this collateral damage is what kills the person, not the actual virus itself. </p>
<p>From what we’ve seen from covid, it takes approximately 14 days for the adaptive immune response to finally kill off all the virus and for the host to be virus-free. </p>
<p>Now that we covered that, people that are asymptomatic means that their immune system is fairly strong and does not need to unleash a full range of cytokines/antibodies and defence mechanisms to kill the virus. So realistically, if you are asymptomatic, you will be virus-free much sooner than 14 days as your immune system doesn’t need that whole time period to get the job done. The issue is that since your asymptomatic, you won’t know when the virus is fully gone. That’s why doctors and researchers say quarantine 14 days, it’s really just a safety precaution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It definitely means that the immune system isn't fighting at full capacity with all measures (as those include common symptoms such as inflammation / fever / coughing, etc).</p>
<p>It does <strong>not</strong> mean the immune system is not fighting 'at all'. Essentially, if someone with the flu sneezes in your direction, you get infected by that flu strain, full stop. But this doesn't mean you will suffer any symptoms, because your immune system might be entirely able to silently swipe the infection under the rug without you ever noticing.</p>
<p>Same applies to COVID, albeit that is probably one of the few comparisons between COVID and 'regular flus' you should draw.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Symptoms are a mix of the damage the virus does to your tissues and your body's response to it (a mix of innate and adaptive immunity). The innate immunity like production of mucus, swelling of the tissues in the throat and pharynx, the fever etc are all our own body's methods to fight the virus, but the adaptive immune system (which builds the immunity) takes about 1-2 weeks and has less obvious, if any, symptoms. So if in a given person, the virus doesn't cause many symptoms directly, and the innate immune system doesn't get fully engaged to fight it because possibly there's not as much danger detected, then you might be fairly asymptomatic. But your adaptive immune system might still be working to recognize and remember this particular virus and build antibodies for the next encounter. </p>
<p>However, I would defer to experts here by wondering if the strength of symptoms (or lack thereof) correlate with the ability or strength of the adaptive immune response. </p>
<p>TL;DR : No symptoms doesn't mean no immunity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Asymptomatic&quot; merely means there are no discernable symptoms. </p>
<p>Body temp elevated by half a degree, slight elevation in BP, elevated cortisol or a small amount of fatigue will go unnoticed by the patient, and would not generally register as symptoms in a clinical setting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
