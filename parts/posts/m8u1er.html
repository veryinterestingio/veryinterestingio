		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally, the main reason is that having more instruments playing the same part creates a richer sound, but there are multiple reasons that vary for different instruments.</p>
<p>For example you have three trumpets, and they often play different parts (different melodies that harmonize with each other) but they can also play the same part, then that melody will usually be heard over the rest of the orchestra.</p>
<p>Now, the instrument that there are the most of in an orchestra is the violin. There are usually around 30 violinists. They are usually only divided into two parts (but can be divided further) so you often have 14 instruments on the same part. One of the reasons is as I've mentioned richness, but another is that brass instruments like trumpets are so much freaking louder than strings so having more strings creates a more balanced sound.</p>
<p>Edit: typical number of violins.</p>
<p>Edit 2: clarity</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An alternative answer to the others, most of which assume the musicians are playing different parts - when playing the same part, it adds a more layered/textured effect, like a “chorus” pedal for a guitar.  When recording guitar, for example, you’d often record multiple tracks of the same part for a fuller sound.  Even copying/pasting the same recording but moving one ever so slightly out of sync has the same effect.  It makes a huge difference, and without these layers it’d sound quite thin and underwhelming.</p>
<p>You could even compare it to a crowd chanting the same song at a soccer game vs one lonesome chap.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You place the horsehair of your bow atop the violin string and pull. The rosin effects a friction that causes the string to vibrate. This vibration resonates through the cavity of the violin to produce a sound quite different than the simple sine wave of the string's vibration. It makes a sound that is beautiful and pleasant and musical, reflective of the unique characteristics of the violin's constituent wood and of the exact shape and size of the resonant cavity within.</p>
<p>Ten people place the horsehairs of their bows atop their strings and pull. They are all playing the same note. Their violins are the same size--or are they? They are almost the same size, but not quite; the margin of error in manufacturing is small, but greater than zero. The violins are made of different wood from different trees, each with its own voice. Each performer is pulling their bow at a slightly different speed. Their fingers are all placed expertly on the exact spot they need to be placed on their fingerboards, but as the violin is a fretless instrument, each finger is placed very slightly differently to all the rest, offering a barely discernible difference in pitch.</p>
<p>The pitch and timbre of each individual tone is unique among the rest. Combined, they are far louder than any one of them could be alone; this is vital in eras before (and venues without) electronic sound reinforcement. But this is not all; combined, they offer variegated and living ideas as to the interpretation of the sterile and static sheet music in front of them. Together, they are something different than they could ever be apart. They are the choir to the soloist; they have crowdsourced greatness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am the sound engineer for the San Diego symphony. We mic every instrument when we play outside. That is around 80 microphones. There is no way to recreate that symphonic sound through the PA with just a couple instruments of each section directly miced. We have about 25 violins, 14 violas, 10 cellos, 8 double basses, 10 horns, 10 woodwinds, piano, keyboards,percussion, and usually a guest soloist. We run a full Dante rig with a CL5. During the summer at the pops site we use Digico Sd12 consoles with a L’acoustics PA. When inside the symphony hall we don’t mic for amplification (just recording) because the stage walls are designed for acoustic amplification. For recording we do not directly mic instruments. We mic the sections with hanging microphones in an ORTF pattern. In terms of mixing you don’t mix like a normal band. With the symphony everything needs to be even and equal to the other. The conductor is the one truly mixing the symphony. I am there to make sure each instrument is heard by the audience with equal loudness across the section</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, one single trumpet is much much louder than one single violin. So, you generally balance the sound out by adding more violins.</p>
<p>Second reason: one single violin can sound pretty harsh. When you add multiple violins, you end up with a more stable sound. Think of it as adding frequencies together, where all of the frequencies might be off by a hertz or two. Adding enough instruments, the inaccuracy doesn't matter, because on AVERAGE, the sound will work itself out. This is important for inherently inaccurate instruments like fretless string instruments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
