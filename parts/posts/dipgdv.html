		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The term &quot;true cyan&quot; is a little misleading.  Cyan is a color, and there is a narrow range that's called cyan, and part of that range isn't displayable on monitors.  [This graph](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamut#/media/File:CIE1931xy_gamut_comparison.svg" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamut#/media/File:CIE1931xy_gamut_comparison.svg</a> ) shows the overall space of colors and the triangles producible with a monitor (most of which are a sRBG triangle).  There is some cyan outside this triangle, but also some purple and coral.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The majority of humans have 3 types of cone cells. A perceived colour is how much each type of cone cell is stimulated. Each one has it's <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Cone-fundamentals-with-srgb-spectrum.svg" target="_blank">response curve</a>. The cyan wavelength stimulates mostly S &amp; M cones. It's possible to &quot;fake&quot; that colour by using different wavelengths with the right intensities so the cone cells have the same response.</p>
<p>We have 3 cones, so we can reproduce a large portion of the possible tristimuli with 3 wavelengths. Hence the use of 3 primary colours (RGB in additive synthesis, CMY(K) in subtractive synthesis).</p>
<p>But it becomes much more complicated once you go beyond ELI5. <a href="https://xkcd.com/1882/" target="_blank">Relevant XKCD.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a limitation of additive color. When you start with black, adding light in the form of red, blue and green, colors on the intersections of the color wheel are hardest to produce (cyan, yellow, magenta).  Black, which is the absence of additive color is just the screen, hence even harder to produce. </p>
<p>With subtractive color: when you start with white, you take away light by adding pigments. The hardest colors to produce here are green and orange, which is why most commercial printers will use a “spot” color to better render these colors. And white is just the absence of pigment, so the best white is the the “whiteness” of the paper.  It’s also why black is part of the process as CMY will not produce a true black.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quick overview of some established knowledge (that other have already referenced): human colour vision is a product of three types of cone cells (commonly three, but more is possible). This produces a 3 dimensional colour space, that was formalized with the CIE-XYZ colour space and it's variants. In this space, the perceivable colour hues are represented by a horse-shoe shape, while colours of tri-cromatic display devices are represented by a triangle.</p>
<p>The horse shoe shape is a product of the human cone cells and their spectral sensitivity. Each cone type response to more or less the whole visible spectrum of light, but has a very pronounced peak either in the blue, green or red region. The response curves also have a very large overlap. It's these properties that define the shape of possible colours in XYZ.</p>
<p>Display devices attempt to take advantage of the three types of cells in the human eye, by using three types of coloured lights (red, green and blue) to stimulate the three types of cells. This way they can replicate a variety of colours.</p>
<p>My 5 cents: because the spectral response curves of the human cone cells overlap a lot, the lights of a display device cannot stimulate each cone individually. This makes it impossible to replicate all stimulation patterns of different spectra, with just 3 distinct colored lights. If however, the lights could stimulate each cell type independently, than complete replication of any perceivable colour should be possible.</p>
<p>EDIT: can someone turn this into a ELI5? :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
