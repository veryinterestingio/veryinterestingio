</blockquote>
<p>No it hasn't. I grew up in small-town Canada in the 1970s. I won't say I recall the exact sound of the background static/noise. I will say phone calls today(local/international) are much less noisy compared to then.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The phone company has determined the lowest possible call quality you're willing to accept and provides its customers with nothing but the lowest quality possible.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Phone call quality depends heavily on frequency bandwidth. Human hearing goes up to about 16-20kHz, but phone calls are typically allotted only 3kHz. This cuts off any frequency higher than about 3.5kHz and lower than 500 Hz and makes the audio quality terrible. Frequency bandwidth is increasingly very limited in cellular networks and there's no economical way to give calls 20k of bandwidth without seriously limiting the number of calls that can fit on the network.</p>
<p>If you've ever used google hangouts or something similar to place a call you'll notice the audio quality is usually much better because they can afford a wider bandwidth over wifi.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the sound quality of phone calls today is much worse than during the '90s.  It seemed to take a drastic drop in quality when we changed from analog lines to digital compression.  Anyone remember 20+ years ago Sprint advertising you could hear a pin drop?  No carrier would ever try to make that claim today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
