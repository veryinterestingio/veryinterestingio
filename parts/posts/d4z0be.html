		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>SA is a huge exporter of oil, so cutting their capacity decreases supply.  Unless demand falls when supply contracts, prices will rise.  Of course, speculators drive up the price on any hint of potential supply restrictions, so it may not take an actual shortage of supply to increase pricing, just the threat of it.
The impact on the dollar is more nuanced, and has to do in part to the medium term impacts to the US and world economies from oil supply disruptions and the prospect of more Middle East military intervention.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oil markets really don't like uncertainty as there is very little slack in the market in regard to oil supply. The other concern is that because this attack was apparently so easy and effective then others may try the same kind of attack.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the demand curve for gasoline is highly inelastic. Inelastic demand means that people aren't responsive to a change in price. By and large, they will keep paying for it no matter how high the price goes. Things other than gasoline that have inelastic demand curves are life-saving medicine and cigarettes. </p>
<p>Life-saving medicine has inelastic demand because if you don't buy it you die, and most people would rather be poorer than dead. Cigarettes are inelastic because quitting an addition is a horrible experience that most people would prefer not to go through. Gasoline is inelastic because almost everyone uses it in some form or another (car travel, air travel, electricity) and it's very hard to live life in a modern society without those things. </p>
<p>Okay, so getting to the specifics of the attack. The attack reduced world oil production by 5%. Now that there's 5% less gasoline to go around, some people are going to have to change their behavior. Fewer planes will fly, more people will have to ride public transportation, and fewer people will be able to run their air conditioning. </p>
<p>The way the market determines who that will be is by raising the price. As the price goes up, people look for alternatives (&quot;I'm going to walk to work, or take the bus&quot;) or do without (An airline CEO decides to stop flying a particular route because the costs of fuel have made it unprofitable to run that route anymore). </p>
<p>As I said above, gasoline has few alternatives and is hard to do without in a modern society, so the price tends to go up pretty sharply when there isn't enough supply.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Itâ€™s like the tremor before the earthquake so to speak.
