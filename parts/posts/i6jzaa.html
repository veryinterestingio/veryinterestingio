		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is the <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/se60324281/executive" target="_blank">earthquake</a> for those unaware and it definitely occurred on a fault. This earthquake occurred in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains#Geology" target="_blank">Appalachian mountains</a>, so there are without a doubt multitudes of faults that would have formed during one of several mountain building events which are recorded in the geology there, though none of them are active in the traditional sense. Earthquakes in the Appalachians don't occur that frequently, but they do happen, e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Virginia_earthquake" target="_blank">the 2011 Mineral VA quake</a>. These can best be thought of as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraplate_earthquake" target="_blank">intraplate earthquakes</a>, i.e. an earthquake that occurs in the interior of a tectonic plate (as opposed to most earthquakes which occur along the edges of tectonic plates). While a simple view of a tectonic plate is a completely rigid block of lithosphere which does not deform internally, this isn't quite true and strain that is being transmitted throughout the plate can cause pre-existing faults to rupture and generate an earthquake.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Live about 45 mins from Sparta and have relatives there. Yâ€™all have fault lines. Millions of years ago Europe and Africa were close to the east coast and collided with it creating the Appalachian Mountains, Scottish Highlands, some mountains in southern Greenland, and I think the Atlas Mountains. The fault lines from this time still exist but are extremely inactive, to the point it probably be another hundred years or more before something like that happens again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a difference between plate boundaries and faults. The North American plate does extend out to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge like you say, and most plate motion is focused at the boundaries.  But geology is messy, and plates are chock full of smaller faults.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are in fact several fault running through the Appalachian mountains. None of them are considered &quot;Active Fault Zones&quot; as the faults in the Western US are classified, but this does not mean these faults cannot slip of have earthquakes. </p>
