		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Through history occasionally are devices where a high end and a low end were similar, just had features disabled. That does not apply to the chips mentioned here.</p>
<p>If you were to crack open the chip and look at the inside in one of <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jl16e.jpg" target="_blank">these pictures</a>, you'd see that they are packed more full as the product tiers increase. The chips kinda look like shiny box regions in that style of picture. </p>
<p>If you cracked open some of the 10th generation dies, in the picture of shiny boxes perhaps you would see:</p>
<ul>
<li>The i3 might have 4 cores, and 8 small boxes for cache, plus large open areas</li>
<li>The i5 would have 6 cores and 12 small boxes for cache, plus fewer open areas</li>
<li>The i7 would have 8 cores and 16 small boxes for cache, with very few open areas</li>
<li>The i9 would have 10 cores, 20 small boxes for cache, and no empty areas</li>
</ul>
<p>The actual usable die area is published and unique for each chip. Even when they fit in the same slot, that's where the lower-end chips have big vacant areas, the higher-end chips are packed full.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most reply seem to focus on a process often called binning: disabling and rerouting defective or underperforming parts of a chip to &quot;act&quot; as a lower-spec config.</p>
<p>However, this only works for specific lines of processors - in GPUs you often see this happening between the top-tier and sub-top tier of a line.</p>
<p>For the rest of the range, chips are actually designed to be physically different:  most chips are modular, cores and caches can be resized and modified independently during the design process. Especially stuff like cache takes up a lot of space on the die, but is easily scalable to fit lower specs. Putting in and taking out caches, cores and other more &quot;peripheral circuits&quot; can lower the size (and fail rate) of chips without needing to design completely different chips.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>edit: use proper term, no idea where I got &quot;harvesting&quot;, binning is def. the proper term.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The process to make computer chips isn't perfect. Certain sections of the chip may not function properly.</p>
<p>They make dozens of chips on a single &quot;wafer&quot;, and then test them individually.</p>
<p>Chips that have defects or issues, like 1/8 cores not functioning, or a Cache that doesn't work, don't go to waste. They get re-configured into a lower tier chip.</p>
<p>In other words, a 6-core i5 is basically an 8-core i7 that has 2 defective cores.</p>
<p>(Just for reference, these defects and imperfections are why some chips overclock better than others. Every chip is slightly different.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine the job you want your processor to do is eating food. You know how I eat faster than you do? Part of that is having a bigger mouth (L1 cache), using bigger silverware (L2 cache), and having a larger plate (L3 cache). It's also about making sure that I'm taking the right size bites, constantly chewing because I make sure that the next bite is ready to go into my mouth by the time I'm done chewing (hyperthreading and pipelining).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
