I mean in a spot where no warmth of a star gets through. I thought about 0 Kelvin. But that would be the temperature where everything is cold dead and nothing can move (at least from Earth's perspective). So what would be the base temperature in space? </p>
<p>(I'm sorry if this question is too basic I'm an astro-noob) </p></div></div>

The CMBR is radiation emitted when the universe was much hotter and denser than it is now, but which has cooled over time as the universe has expanded.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First and foremost, the whole concept of the temperature of vacuum is tenuous. It's nothing like the concept you're used to when living inside a dense atmosphere. On Earth, the gas particles are so much crammed together that they constantly interact, bounce off each other and transfer energy to one another. That's why they reach a thermal equilibrium, more or less, and why you can feel the effects of different temperatures on your body.</p>
<p>In empty space there are so few particles that they just whizz by in straight paths, almost never interacting. Take any cube of space and you won't find any particle in it that stays for longer than a few microseconds. Coincidentally, most particles whizzing by could have approximately the same thermal energy, but they might also have vastly different energies, in which case there would be no one temperature to speak of.</p>
<p>So, even if you get some answers on what the temperature of empty space is, don't take that to mean that you can transfer your intuition about what that kind of temperature would feel like on Earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Passage from NASA website is below (funny that they use Â°F).  I know this isn't the question, but is the different as outlined below just being in sunlight vs. not being in sunlight?</p>
<ol>
<li>Spacesuits help astronauts in several ways. Astronauts face a wide variety of temperatures. In Earth orbit, conditions can be as cold as minus 250 degrees Fahrenheit. In the sunlight, they can be as hot as 250 degrees. A spacesuit protects astronauts from those extreme temperatures.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The temperature in space is actually quite high if it's the inner part of the solar system. We don't feel it as warm, because there is almost perfect vacuum, therefore not many atoms to store and conduct heat. We rather feel the radiation from the sun as warm if we go there. </p>
<p>But the few atoms that is there, will get heated up a lot from the sun. They won't be able to dissipate their heat through other matter, only through radiating it away as microwaves, which isn't much. </p>
<p>Out in outer space, the heat from stars is much less significant so the temperature there is about 3 kelvin</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
