<p>Object A is a heat source heating up Object B. Under constant heat can Object B ever end up hotter than object A?</p>
<p>Edit: thank you so much for all the answers. I had no idea there were so many solutions or that this question would be of interest to so many intelligent and educated individuals. I really didn’t think this would get so much attention.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, temperature is defined by which way heat energy flows. AKA- if object 1 is a higher temperature than object 2, than heat energy will flow from object 1 to object 2. So, by the very definition of temperature, an object can never be heated up to a higher temperature than the object heating it. </p>
<p>However, temperature is not necessarily what makes something &quot;feel&quot; hot. If an object is really hot, but has a really low thermal conductivity (which is a measure of how fast something transfers heat), then you can touch it, and it won't &quot;feel&quot; hot, because very little heat will flow into you. You have likely noticed this, comparing air and water. For instance, being in 70 F air is comfortable, but being in 70 F water is really cold. Why? Because water has a much higher thermal conductivity than air, so a lot more heat leaves your 98 degree body into 70 degree water than 70 degree air. Heat flowing out of you is what feels &quot;cold.&quot; Same the other way, being in 120 F air is uncomfortable warm, being in 120 F water is absolutely terrible and you can't survive it long. It feels &quot;hot&quot; because a lot of heat is flowing &quot;into&quot; you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Temperature is a measure of the kinetic energy of the molecules of whatever you are measuring. Heat is thermal energy in transit, and it ALWAYS flows from high to low temperature. Two solids or fluids (or a solid against a fluid) will eventually equalize temperatures and there will be no more heat (transfer). </p>
<p>Nothing can reach a higher temperature than the heat source temperature.</p>
<p>Edit: To clarify, things cannot get hotter than their heat source by means of convection or conduction. </p>
<p>Yes, things other than convection and conduction can increase temperature. A simple example I learned in school was to consider a fan inside of a perfectly insulated room. No energy (heat, mass, electricity, work, etc.) of any form exits our system boundary (the room). If the fan is running, electrical energy is crossing the boundary and entering our system, then it drives the fan which is doing mechanical work. The work done on our system (the air in the room) by the fan will increase the temperature of our system. This is because the internal energy of our system is increasing. We have energy in and no energy out, and the energy in is not heat, yet it still yields a temperature increase. </p>
<p>So with the help of extra energy into the system you can achieve a higher temperature than your temperature source, but this always involves other energy inputs (beyond heat due to convection or conduction). u/ast5515’s example is great. Compressing a gas will cause a temperature increase. This requires a work input. </p>
<p>I am not as familiar with radiation as I am with convection and conduction. Someone else would have to grab the torch.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Also, once you are at a higher temp than your “source,” YOU become the “source” and heat travels in the reverse direction (ALWAYS high to low).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not without some kind of work being involved. Induction heating involves voltage and magnetic fields. There's not much in the way of direct transfer of heat. There is inductive heating as the name suggests. (Even in this situation conservation of energy is preserved, the voltage source will probably need to generate as much heat, albeit over a larger volume, to produce that energy).</p>
<p>That's pretty much the only way that I can think of.</p>
<p>In general though, when things are in contact and not heating through some special form of heating heat only flows toward the colder (This is due to the second law of thermodynamics). So no, in that sense something can't heat something else hotter than it is.</p>
<p>Unless there's some extra energy added into the environment that you're not aware of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
