		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The concept that all your cells regenerate within 7-10 years is based on some misconceptions. Different types of cells regenerate at different rates. Some only last a few weeks while others last your entire life. Most of your brain cells are in the later category. The 7 years is based on an estimated average of all your cells.</p>
<p>And while we do not know much about how memories work there is some evidence suggesting that memories gets refreshed when you are asleep so that even if brain cells do not last your entire lifetime but gets damaged somehow the memories will get restored and refreshed from time to time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To be honest, having spent the last 15 years as a PhD neuroscientist, no one actually knows how memories are stored. Specifically because the cells and connections in the “memory” areas keep changing, and new ones WILL grow there. There are some theories that memories are stored in the connections between the cells AND in the dna superstructure (modifications to the backbone of dna, not the code). There’s no explain like I’m 5 for this one, because no one knows.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because not all cells get replaced in a few years.</p>
<p>...and even if it happens, memories are not stored inside cells, but by connection between cells, so as long as there is another cel to take up the slack, there is no problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not all cells of our body are replaced, for example, neurons, aren't replaced ever, they do not divide so that's why if you lose too many you may develop some mental illness, but even if they divided the information retained would be passed onto the new cells therefore your memories would go along, skin cells, for example are replaced if they die.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If you’ve ever seen a swirling eddy in a river, you’ll observe that the water composing the formation is passing in, around, and out very quickly - yet the pattern in the river is sustained. Depending on the surrounding conditions, it can be very stable and long lasting.</p>
<p>The water is your cells, the eddy is you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
