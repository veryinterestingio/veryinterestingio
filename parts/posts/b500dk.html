I see these posts often but I always wonder how they get the eyeglass prescription right for babies? </p>
<p>Normally eye doctors ask you the “is 1 or 2 better” question 15 times but babies can’t answer that answer that so how do optometrists get around that? </p>
<p>Is there a method they use that gets the correct prescription or is there a way to tell if the baby is near or far sighted and they just go from there?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Optometrist here.  If its possible due to the baby's cooperation, then autorefraction.  Its a machine that measures Rx and is often in the ballpark.  Most doctors wouldn't stop there though and would also do retinoscopy, which is a technique using a hand held scope that shines a reflective light into the eye.  We prescribe then based on the reflection.  And most would use eyedrops to cycloplege and get a cycloplegic refraction, waiting til the drops take effect and then doing retinoscopy.  Its also an art somewhat.  For example, you see a 1 year old with +6.00 -4.00 x 180.  You can't usually give the child that whole Rx from the getgo, you give then half or so and work up to it.  Obviously seeing the patient regularly and adjusting the Rx.  Plus they break the glasses constantly, so you're having to adjust and remake them often.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way to find a prescription without relying on patient responses is called retinoscopy. Different lenses are placed front of the eyes and the doctor uses a light that reflects back in a certain motion. How that reflected light acts tells the doctor if the lens in front of the eye is too high or too low. This can be used for both babies and adults. Autorefractors are not used on babies due to inability to fixate during the testing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Retinoscopy</p>
<p>Shine a steak of light with the focal point at infinity into their eye (dilated and cyclopleged with drops first). Then hold up different lenses until the reflection is neutralised. Take away your working difference and there's your refractive error. Depending on other clinical eye issues, take a little bit off the spherical refraction and that's your prescription.</p>
<p>Tim root does a great video on retinoscopy if you want to understand</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
