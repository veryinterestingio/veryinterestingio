		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not every animal's digestive acid is equally powerful. Large herbivores often don't break down their food themselves with acids and enzymes. Instead, they have a gut full of microbes that do this and the microbes produce the lipids, proteins and other nutrients that the herbivores eat.</p>
<p>Stomachs also aren't big water balloons full of acid. Organisms produce digestive acid as needed and then produce counter agents that neutralize the acid as soon as this part of digestion is done.</p>
<p>And while the acids are strong, it's not like a horror movie where a splash of stomach acid will instantly dissolve whatever it touches. When you throw up, you can feel the burn of the acid in your throat and mouth, it's irritating but you're not dissolving yourself into goo on the spot.</p>
<p>So what it adds up to is that herbivores often have less powerful stomach acids because they digest differently. There's not that much acid in a stomach at any given time. If you rip open a stomach, much of it will leak out of it anyway.</p>
<p>Half digested stomach contents are often quite nutritionally valuable for predators. Meat is just muscle, fat, protein etc. If predators only ate muscle meat, they'd run a major nutritional deficit. It's the prey animals bones and organs that provide predators with much of their vitamins and minerals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>And given that dogs will happily barf, then eat their barf, I doubt they're deterred by other stomach acid either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stomach acid isn't as strong as most people think, especially in herbivores</p>
<p>It doesn't melt things like you see in movies, it digests food over a long period of time </p>
<p>To carnivores to won't feel much more than a lemon squeeze over steak, it will only be in thier mouths for a short period and then will be in thier stomachs which have natural protection against acid</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
