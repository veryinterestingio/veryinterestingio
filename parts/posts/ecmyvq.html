		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, as an orb flies in the air here on earth it slows down due to it hitting the air particles right? So if the vacuum of space was changed to air of a similar makeup to ours here on earth, at it's current speed through space, how long would it take to lose it's momentum.</p>
<p>Basically i saw <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/eclda0/how_earths_orbit_around_the_sun_actually_looks/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x" target="_blank">this</a> and started thinking of my question above.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm torn between if this is physics or astronomy but i'm going with physics.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To get rhe answer you are looking for, you'd have to ignore gravity, the massive energy that would be released as heat as the earth slammed into air at 110k km/h (I think that's our linear speed), ignore the effects of the spin of the earth, etc. </p>
<p>There's an excellent comment already which kinda explains what would happen if you didn't ignore those things.</p>
<p>But if we assume the earth is just as massive smooth ball in standard sea level air, and classic fluid mechanics still works... It's complicated.</p>
<p>Here's a primer on drag on a sphere...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/dragsphere.html" target="_blank">https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/dragsphere.html</a></p>
<p>The upshot is thst the drag has to be determined experimentally.  And since we would need to know the drag as the speed dropped.... This becomes difficult if that drag Vs speed number is not easily fit to some polynomial we can integrate.</p>
<p>But to get an idea where we are in that chart,</p>
<ul>
<li>Air viscosity: 20 x10e-6 kg/ms</li>
<li>Air density: 1.225 kg/m3</li>
<li>Velocity: 110,000,000 m/h</li>
<li>Distance: using diameter: 12,700,000m</li>
</ul>
<p>The Re number is roughly 2E+16.</p>
<p>I searched for data on &quot;High&quot; Reynolds numbers to see what's out there, and NASA has data... Up to about 10E+7.</p>
<p>So the truth is that we probably can't even estimate what would happen in our overly simplified case.  I imagine someone has a theoretical model for this, but nothing that would go that high, because we're already beyond the bounds of std physics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>About <strong>8.80 days</strong> without considering that drag  reduces drastically as velocity reduces and other effects at crazy velocities:</p>
<p>Earth's Surface area =5.1007 10\^14  square meter, Cd=0.405 (drag coefficient of sphere), Air density=1.275 kg/m\^3, Earth Velocity = 29800 m/sec and Earth Mass=5.972 10\^24 Kg</p>
<p>So Kinetic Energy will be 1/2 m v\^2 = 2.65169*10\^33. </p>
<p>The Drag (taking entire Earth, not just frontal area) = Cd  *(density *Earth Velocity \^2)/2 *Earth surface area =1.16949*10\^23 so distance over which Earth will stop with this drag force :</p>
<p>1.16949*10\^23 = 2.65169*10\^33/d. Solving for d, we get 2.26738 10\^10 meter. The time required for that distance at speed of 29800 m/sec =  2.26738 10\^10 / 29800 = 760866 or <strong>8.80 days</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It wouldn’t loose momentum at all, gaining it instead. See, the sun is 99.x% of mass in the solar system. In this example it wouldn’t be anymore, by several magnitudes probably. But it would still dominate locally, air rushing towards it slightly dragging earth along. </p>
<p>The details would depend a bit on wether that air is moving relative to other bodies or not. For example the earth is moving relative to the sun. That’s the movement your thinking of. But the <strong>sun</strong> is also moving, around the Milkyway, quite a bit faster than the earth does around it at that.</p>
<p>So yeah, we can somehow say what’s happening in our immediate vicinity in the short term. Beyond that it would be a total mess, far too much mass. Expansion of the universe wouldn’t be able to fight all that mass as gravity is a stronger force locally, and with air(mass) <strong>everywhere</strong>... Kinda like a reverse Big Bang I guess.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>If it's bigger than 0.1% of a light year the whole thing would instantly turn into a black hole. No it won't even collapse into one, it will be one right away from the total gravity alone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
