		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The phenomenon you are describing is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_onset_muscle_soreness" target="_blank">delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS)</a>.  The exact cause of the pain from DOMS is not certain and I believe the 'delayed' aspect is even less understood, although Wiki lists a few common theories.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DOMS was first described in 1902 by Theodore Hough, who concluded that this kind of soreness is &quot;fundamentally the result of ruptures within the muscle&quot;. According to this &quot;muscle damage&quot; theory of DOMS, these ruptures are microscopic lesions at the Z-line of the muscle sarcomere. The soreness has been attributed to the increased tension force and muscle lengthening from eccentric exercise. This may cause the actin and myosin cross-bridges to separate prior to relaxation, ultimately causing greater tension on the remaining active motor units. This increases the risk of broadening, smearing, and damage to the sarcomere. When microtrauma occurs to these structures, nociceptors (pain receptors) within the muscle's connective tissues are stimulated and cause a sensation of pain.</p>
<p>Another explanation for the pain associated with DOMS is the &quot;enzyme efflux&quot; theory. Following microtrauma, calcium that is normally stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum accumulates in the damaged muscles. Cellular respiration is inhibited and ATP needed to actively transport calcium back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum is also slowed. This accumulation of calcium may activate proteases and phospholipases which in turn break down and degenerate muscle protein. This causes inflammation, and in turn pain due to the accumulation of histamines, prostaglandins, and potassium.</p>

Additionally, here is a meta-analysis of DOMS mitigation strategies as well as a paper discussing 'pain' in a broader concept.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since the ‘D’ in DOMS stands for delayed, what causes the initial burn/stiffness immediately after a workout? Since it’s no longer believed to be caused by lactic acid. Like when I do curls and my arms burn and I walk out of the gym like a t-Rex. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For one any adrenaline from your workout has flushed from your system at this point, which is a pain suppressant. You are essentially making small tears in muscles during workouts to have them build back stronger. So, the second phase is repair. Once the body has packed calories and decided to heal up these injuries it starts to feel sore. The body will for one send signals to not use those muscles as to not disrupt the repairs and cause further damage. The mechanics for repair also cause discomfort themselves, such as increased blood flow which can cause soreness/ stiffness. ?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
