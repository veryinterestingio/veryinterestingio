		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did my PhD on why Jupiter is red, so I feel qualified to answer this.</p>
<p>So Jupiter isn't actually fully red, what you're seeing is alternating red and white stripes. The white stripes are caused by clouds - this is where air rises from the hot interior, and as the air rises it cools and water then ammonia condenses out to form dense cloud layers - while the red areas are where air descends and so where the air is drier, which means that less can condense out of the air. Basically the same reason why the tropics on Earth are so dry compared with the Equator. As for what's specifically causing the red colour in those uncloudy areas, well, we don't know for sure, but it's probably to do with ammonia gas reacting with other gases in the upper atmosphere, forming layers of haze.</p>
<p>Now onto why Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus/Neptune look so different. Firstly just a small correction, Jupiter consists of around 88% hydrogen and 11% helium (I can't remember the exact ratios but it's something like that, as it is for the other planets) but it's the remaining 1% that's more important in our case as the 1% consists of gases that absorb far more visible/IR radiation than hydrogen or helium do. The most significant absorber in the visible is methane, which absorbs a lot of red light. So the main reason why the planets look so different is that Uranus and Neptune are colder, which means that cloud condenses much deeper in the atmosphere, and cloud generally absorbs and scatters light more evenly over different wavelengths than gases do as well as blocking a lot of light from below the clouds from reaching you. So what you're seeing on Jupiter is methane in the atmosphere above the clouds absorbing some red light, but the cloud layers prevent deeper methane from absorbing more red light. However, since clouds are located so much deeper in Uranus and Neptune, the methane in its atmosphere above the clouds is able to absorb so much more red light. In addition, you have the contribution of Rayleigh scattering, which is where tiny gas molecules have the tendency to scatter blue light more than red light (which is why the sky on Earth appears blue and the sun yellow, the sun is actually white but the gas molecules in the Earth's atmosphere scatter the blue light while the redder light tends to pass straight through). And that's also what you're seeing on Uranus and Neptune, because the clouds are located so deep in the atmosphere you're able to observe so much more of the atmosphere scattering the blue light.</p>
<p>Sorry, I know that's not that well worded - I've had a pint or two and I'm on mobile.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>While this is certainly true of Jupiter, Neptune contains quite a bit of other stuff, primarily water, ammonia, and methane. It's for this reason that we now prefer the term &quot;ice giant&quot; for Uranus and Neptune.</p>
<p>The real answer here, though, is temperature: cloud-top at Jupiter is somewhere around 120 K, while cloud-top at Neptune is closer to 60 K. The triple-point of methane lies somewhere between the two, around 90 K.</p>
<p>While there is some methane on Jupiter, it's too warm for it to condense. The bright white bands we see when looking at Jupiter are ammonia clouds, while the tan belts are caused by a translucent brown hydrocarbon haze overlying the bright white ammonia clouds. </p>
<p>On Neptune, though, it's cold enough for methane to condense...and methane absorbs red light very strongly. The result is that the methane on both Uranus &amp; Neptune only reflects blue and green, giving them their distinctive colors. We do think that these planets also have bright white ammonia clouds, but those are considerably farther down beneath the methane, where temperature are closer to ammonia's triple point (190 K).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hydrogen and helium are colorless, transparent gases, so something else must explain the color of both Jupiter and Neptune. In Jupiter's case it is ammonia and water ice clouds, but especially phosphorus, sulphur, and various hydrocarbons lifted from the lower layers of Jupiter's atmosphere by the constant churn of its powerful weather systems.</p>
<p>The blue hues of Neptune and Uranus, on the other hand, are caused by trace amounts of methane in the upper atmosphere absorbing mostly red light. It is actually not well understood why Neptune's blue is more vivid than Uranus's. The ice giants don't have Jupiter's striking weather patterns because in the outer solar system there's much less sunlight available to power storms.</p>
<p>(Note also that Neptune as a whole is not made of 80% H and 20% He. Only its upper atmosphere is.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li><strong>JUPITER....</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>I'd be cautious calling the Great Red Spot permanent. It is certainly long-lived, having been observed by astronomers for 348 years, now. Recent observations show it to be smaller than it has been. It is quite possible that it may go away, someday.</p>
<p>The short answer is that we don't have a definitive answer for the exact mechanisms. There is still a lot of research and debate about the exact mechanisms for the Great Red Spot and other anticyclones on Jupiter. A lot of the current thought is based around two different models - quasi-geostrophic (QG) and intermediate-geostrophic (IG). It's possible that the only way to resolve between those two models is to send probes into the atmosphere to get direct data.</p>
<p>But we do have pretty good consensus about some of the contributing variables.</p>
<p>The Great Red Spot is as tall as the Earth and almost three times as wide. At its narrowest point it is still six times the diameter of the largest hurricane measured on Earth. The first thing we should ask is why don't hurricanes on Earth last a very long time? Hurricanes feed off of the energy in the moist air above warm water. Typically hurricanes live until they pass over either cold water or land. On Jupiter, there is no cold water or land to pass over.</p>
<p>We should then ask, what else is different about Jupiter, that would affect the longevity of a cyclone? There are no boundary layers within the thin weather layer in Jupiter's atmosphere, which means there is very little dissipation. Jupiter rotates very quickly (resulting in a large Coriolis force). There is strong east-west shear. And the atmosphere is so thick that there is an almost limitless reservoir for energy.</p>
<p>There is pretty strong agreement that a vortex can become stable if it is fed by the shear in the bands above/below the vortex. Computer models reflect this and explain why anticyclones like the Great Red Spot last so much longer than cyclones, on Jupiter.</p>
<p><strong>2=Neptune.....</strong></p>
<p>Neptune is mainly composed of gases like hydrogen and helium. It's atmosphere comprises of one percent methane, nineteen percent helium and around eighty percent hydrogen.<br />
Neptune's blue colour is because of methane. When sunlight hits the planet's surface,the methane clouds absorb the red end of the spectrum of visible light. The blue end of the spectrum gets reflected back. So,when we see the bright bluish colour of Neptune,we actually see the reflected sunlight, minus the red light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your premise is incorrect. The bodies of the planets have similar composition, but not their atmospheres, which is the outside part that we actually see.</p>
<p>The outer atmosphere of Jupiter is <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/overview/" target="_blank">mostly hydrogen and helium</a>, with some water droplets, ice crystals, and ammonia crystals. </p>
<p>Neptune is blue because <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/neptune-in-primary-colors" target="_blank">its atmosphere is mostly methane</a>, not hydrogen or helium. Methane absorbs red light well, so it looks blue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
