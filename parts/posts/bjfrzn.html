		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The airbag shell isn't just hurled into the car cabin when the airbag goes off. They split open to release the bag but the pieces remain attached to the mounting brackets. So they don't hit people in a crash because they are behind an expanded air bag.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The whole point of airbags isn’t to provide a nice soft surface— it’s to provide a place that is vastly preferable to the steering wheel or other hard(er) surfaces within the car. </p>
<p>The whole purpose is mitigation of injury, not entire prevention of injury. Usually by the time the airbag goes off, injury is probable.  Making that injury something that isn’t severe is the point. </p>
<p>As said already, the airbag covers are scored so they split open and the airbag operates through the hole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
