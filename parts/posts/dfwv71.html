<p>Hello AskScience! We are members of the <a href="http://vertpaleo.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Society of Vertebrate Paleontology</strong></a>. We study fossil fish, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles â€” anything with a backbone! Our research includes how these organisms lived, how they were affected by environmental change like a changing climate, how they're related, and much more. You can learn more about SVP in <a href="http://vertpaleo.org/The-Society/We-Are-SVP.aspx" target="_blank">this video</a> or <strong>follow us on Twitter @SVP_vertpaleo</strong>.</p>
<p>Joining us today are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Stephanie Drumheller, Ph.D.</strong> (/u/UglyFossils) is a paleontologist at the University of Tennessee whose research focuses on the processes of fossilization, evolution, and biology, of crocodiles and their relatives, including identifying bite marks on fossils. Find her on Twitter @UglyFossils.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Larisa DeSantis, Ph.D.</strong> is an Associate Professor in Biological Sciences and Earth and Environmental Sciences at Vanderbilt University. Her research focuses on the paleoecology and paleobiology of mammals in North America and Australia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dana Ehret, Ph.D.</strong> is the Assistant Curator of Natural History at the New Jersey State Museum. He studies fossil fish and reptiles, and also has an interest in the pop culture and history of cryptids. Find him on Twitter @DrDanaEhret.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jess Miller-Camp, Ph.D.</strong> (/u/DeadGators) is the Paleontology and Zooarchaeology Collections Manager at the University of Indiana, Bloomington. Jess studies alligatorine systematics, biogeography, ecomorphology, and diversity dynamics as well as dicynodont morphology and extinction survival. Find her on Twitter @DeadGators.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Kenny Travouillon, Ph.D.</strong> (/u/KTravouillon) is the Curator of Mammals at the Western Australian Museum. His expertise is in mammalian ecology and paleontology in Australia, with a focus on bandicoots.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We are coming to you from Brisbane, Australia, so we will be back later this evening (Eastern Time) to answer your questions. Thanks for your patience, and see you soon!</strong></p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several years ago, Jack Horner gave a TED Talk entitled &quot;Where are the baby dinosaurs.&quot; The subject of his talk was the possibility that at least some of the variety of named species of dinosaurs are likely all members of the same species merely in different stages of development. For example, he suggests that Dracorex hogwartsia, Stygimoloch, and Pachycephalosaurus to all be the same dinosaur at different developmental stages.</p>
<p>My questions are, do you think this theory has merit, and if so, should it change the way we look at other fossils as well, especially from the perspective of evolution?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a normie, so this is from the perspective of someone not too versed in 'boney' news. </p>
<p>We always hear about big discoveries of dinosaur fossils, but what about animals from the time gap between them and us?</p>
<p>Are discoveries not related to dinosaurs not mentioned as much in media just because of dinosaurs being more 'flashy'/'cash graby'?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I'm a paleontology student in Brazil, I used to study fossil lizards from the Crato Formation, after the fire that destroyed the National Museum I find myself without a project. Do you know any collection where I could get in contact with to study fossil lepidsaours, or lepidorauromorphs?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fossils can take years to be described after they're unearthed, and more fossils are being discovered than ever before; is there generally buzz among paleontologists about bombshell papers before they're made public? </p>
