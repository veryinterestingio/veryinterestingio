<p>Hi /r/AskScience! We are members of the <a href="http://vertpaleo.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Society of Vertebrate Paleontology</strong></a>, here for our 7th annual AMA. We study fossil fish, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles — anything with a backbone! Our research includes how these organisms lived, how they were affected by environmental change like a changing climate, how they're related, and much more. You can <strong>follow us on Twitter @SVP_vertpaleo</strong>.</p>
<p>Also, it's National Fossil Day in the US. Please join us in celebrating! Our experts today are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Matt Borths, Ph.D.</strong> (/u/Chapalmalania) is the Curator of Fossils at the <a href="https://lemur.duke.edu/" target="_blank">Duke Lemur Center</a> at Duke University in Durham, NC. His research focuses on the evolution of carnivorous mammals and primates, especially in Africa and North America. He is also part of several teams working to network natural history collections. Dr. Borths co-produced the paleontology podcast series Past Time (www.pasttime.org).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stephanie Drumheller, Ph.D.</strong> (/u/UglyFossils) is a paleontologist at the University of Tennessee whose research focuses on the processes of fossilization, evolution, and biology, of crocodiles and their relatives, including identifying bite marks on fossils. Find her on Twitter @UglyFossils.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Eugenia Gold, Ph.D.</strong> (/u/DrEugeniaGold) is an Assistant Professorin the Biology Department at Suffolk University in Boston, MA. Her research focuses on the evolution of the brain in dinosaurs. Dr. Gold also created www.drneurosaurus.com and co-authored <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Found-Fossils-Maria-Eugenia-Leone/dp/1981516549" target="_blank">She Found Fossils</a> (and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/encontro-fosiles-Spanish-Maria-Eugenia/dp/1981806512/" target="_blank">Ella Encontró Fósiles</a>), a children's book about women in paleontology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Josh Miller, Ph.D.</strong> (/u/PaleoJosh) is a paleoecologist and Assistant Professor at the University of Cincinnati. His research focuses on Pleistocene paleoecology, taphonomy, and using fossil and subfossil records to help conserve and manage modern ecosystems (Conservation Paleobiology). Find out more at JoshuaHMiller.com.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ali Nabavizadeh, Ph.D.</strong> (/u/vertpaleoama) an Assistant Professor of Anatomy in the Department of Biomedical Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine. His research investigates the comparative anatomy and evolution of herbivorous dinosaurs, dicynodonts, and proboscideans. He is specifically interested in the muscles of their skulls and jaws, and the functional morphology of how they feed. Find him on Twitter: @Vert_Anatomist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jennifer Nestler, M.S.</strong> (/u/jnestler) is an ecologist who works on landscape-level modeling of the Florida Everglades. She studies the morphology and ecology of fossil and modern crocodylians, and using quantitative methods to inform conservation decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adam Pritchard, Ph.D.</strong> (/u/vertpaleoama) is the Assistant Curator of Paleontology at the Virginia Museum of Natural History in Martinsville, VA. His research focuses on the evolution of reptiles during the Permian and Triassic periods, a time of great change that saw the rise of the dinosaurs. Please check out the Virginia Museum of Natural History at vmnh.net. Dr. Pritchard has also co-produced the paleontology podcast series Past Time, available at www.pasttime.org.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gabriel-Philip Santos, M.S.</strong> (/u/PaleoParadoX) is a paleontologist and educator at the Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology in Los Angeles, California. His previous work focused on the paleontology of Southern California, particularly the evolution of marine mammals. Today, his research has shifted to education and DEI in STEM as a National Geographic certified educator and cofounder of the Cosplay for Science Initiative. You can find him online as @paleoparadox.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Karie Whitman, M.S.</strong> (/u/vertpaleoama) is a fossil preparator and research technician at the Duke Lemur Center's Division of Fossil Primates. She carefully uncovers fossils from the rock they are encased in, makes them sturdier, and puts broken pieces back together. She can also make realistic copies of fossils for museum display. Find her on Twitter @whitmankl.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is Paleontology still a viable career choice for students of this generation? I guess what I'm asking is, how much more out there in the world is waiting to be discovered? Do those discoveries still require the skill set of a Paleontologist graduate, or are other fields able to do the same job?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there's a burning question I've wondered since about May.</p>
<p>How do you determine if you have all the bones of a particular species, and more importantly, decide what that species might look like?</p>
<p>I'm quite curious on the process, and I imagine it's a group effort.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cool thanks to all for doing this.</p>
<p>My question is regarding the recently unearthed Nodosaur that is almost complete and has flesh and skin.  </p>
<p>What do you think is the likely reason or series of events that allowed it to survive so intact?  Or why are most finds much more deteriorated than this one is?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
