		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what others have said, it's also the same reason why you didn't feel your socks touching your feet until I just mentioned it. Our brains are designed to filter out the vast majority of the stimulus that we receive so that we can focus on the important things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can hear your own body, it's just never ever quiet enough no matter where you are. Watched a video only a few weeks ago and cannot for the life of me find it (Think it was a Tom Scott video but could he wrong).</p>
<p>The video was about precisely this and was only a few minutes long, but told the story of a man who was hiking through the desert and had been told before he left that he will reach an area so quiet he will be able to hear his body functioning, and he could. There is also a superficial room where you can experience this but this was a completely natural phenomenon. I hope somebody else can find the video or some information on it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not an answer, but kinda on topic; as a woman that's had a child, I learned about round ligaments because of the pain of them being stretched. See, a woman's uterus is held in place by these ligaments. And when she gets pregnant and her uterus gets bigger and heavier, it puts more strain on them. (Makes sense, right?) If you get up too fast or move quickly in the wrong way, you get these sharp pains (kinda feels like a leg cramp, but deeper) in your lower abdomen. And because they've already been stretched, they never really go back to the way they were before. (Like a rubber band, once stretched) so 8 years after pushing out my crotch fruit, I can still get up too quick and get the stabby uterus pains. Never knew they were a thing before I got pregnant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can once you learn what they feel like. It took me five years of fairly dedicated qigong and breathing practice before I could feel my kidneys.</p>
<p>The easiest organ to feel is the lungs. You can close your eyes and feel those when you breathe. After the lungs comes the heart, you can feel it beating in your chest. From there you get into the kidneys, liver, and other internal organs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
