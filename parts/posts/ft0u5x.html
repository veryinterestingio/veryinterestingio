		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From my experience as an EMT:
If you place the needle too deep or at the wrong angle you risk damaging the vein in a couple different ways. If you place it too far you can poke through the other side of the vein, or if you go at the wrong angle you can slice the vein length wise or just knick the side of it. Both of these will cause the vein to bleed and you can usually instantly see a hematoma or bruise form around it. If you see the bruising, it’s no longer useful and is considered “blown.”</p>
<p>Some people’s veins are very fragile or thin and small and this can happen easily.</p>
<p>If you do it right, you’ll make just one hole with the needle into the vein, slide the catheter (which is just a plastic tube) off the needle and into the vein, retract the needle, and now you have a useful IV access. :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in vet med and we tend to take IV blood samples differently from human med in the sense that we sometimes use a needle and syringe to draw blood. In this case, if the negative pressure exerted by the plunger of the syringe is too strong, the suction can cause the vein to “collapse”. Mostly seen in elderly or dehydrated pets.</p>
<p>Another mechanism of collapsing veins is due to external swelling that causes the vein to narrow until it shuts. This is usually caused by outside pressure, like if you were to inject something just outside of the vein, or if there was bleeding that makes the surrounding tissue swell up.</p>
<p>Lastly, injecting some products into a vein can cause them to collapse. Notably, salt solution is used in the treatment of varicose veins. The salt irritates the inside lining of the vein, making the vein collapse and the blood clot. Blood will be rerouted through healthy veins, and bye bye varicose vein.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The veins don’t collapse on their own. Sometimes in older folks with more fragile veins, the pressure of the needle going in through the skin can flatten them, allowing you to go through the vein. (Known as “back-walling”)</p>
<p>If someone tells you your vein “blew”, “rolled”, or “collapsed” it just a fancy way of saying “I missed, but Imma pretend it isn’t my fault”. ;-)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You need the pressure within the vein to drive the blood through the needle into the tube, hence you use the tourniquet.
You intentionally damage the vein somewhat to make the puncture hole. However if you excessively damage the vein as part of putting the needle in, you prevent the pressure buildup to drive the blood through the needle.
Factors influencing this excessive damage include techinical skill, old frail skin and veins, significant previous damage (IV drug use) or just bad luck.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
