		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a little leeway, but it's really constrained by biology. If the baby comes out too early, the lungs aren't developed enough to oxygenate their blood. They are often weak and can't latch onto their mom's breast and suck. They don't have much body fat, they have higher surface-area to mass ratio and have a hard time staying warm enough. </p>
<p>If the baby is born too late, the placenta starts to degrade, decreasing the baby's supply of nutrients and oxygen. The baby is also more likely to pass its first poo (meconium) into the amniotic fluid and aspirate it, causing huge pulmonary problems. There's also the problem of the baby simply getting too big to pass through the pelvis. And mom's getting gestational diabetes and high blood pressure.
C-sections haven't been around nearly long enough to remove those selective pressures. </p>
<p>Before modern obstetrics, death rates for human moms and babies was astonishingly
high compared to other primates, due in part to our pelvis being tipped for walking upright. </p>
<p>We also have huge brains vs other primates. Humans are the result of an evolutionary balance between hips that can walk upright and intelligence. We are born relatively immature so our skulls can pass through our mothers' pelvises and finish maturing outside the womb. Intelligence is such an asset that it's worth having helpless, weak babies that need ~3 years to walk, talk and kind of fend for themselves.</p>
<p>Natural selection narrowed down the length of the perfect pregnancy to 38-41 weeks.</p>
<p>The window is actually probably smaller than 3 weeks, because we don't usually know the exact date of ovulation. We estimate it on last menstrual cycle, which can vary a lot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first figure on <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/are-first-babies-more-likely-to-be-late-1b099b5796b6" target="_blank">this page</a> shows the distribution of pregnancy durations in weeks. It does exclude C-sections, but it's not clear if it also excludes induced labor. The effect shouldn't be too huge even if they are included, though. It's a pretty tight distribution around 8.5-9.5 months.</p>
<p>It's too bad the figure doesn't include the full long and short tails of the distribution, but it's safe to assume that on the short end, the distribution decreases more or less smoothly until about 25 weeks. Babies born earlier than that are very unlikely to survive. At the long end, the distribution has already dropped almost to 0 in the figure at 44 weeks (note that the 0 line is slightly above the X axis). Durations longer than 44-45 weeks are definitely extremely uncommon even without induced labor.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that these data are from America, which like other wealthy countries probably has significantly fewer early births than the global average. Pretty much all types of stress have been shown to increase the probability of early birth if you have a large enough sample, including physiological stresses like nutrition as well as psychological stress. Other than reduced stress and some hormonal issues related to development, I'm not aware of any factors that increase the duration of pregnancy, though. That means the actual global distribution of durations should be somewhat more skewed towards early births than these data from America. It still won't go below around 23-25 weeks and in fact babies born very early are a lot less likely to survive in less wealthy countries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
