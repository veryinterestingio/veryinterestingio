I saw some article about how Perseverance is powered and it's really interesting. I understand that a car might require a bigger reactor but still, would it be possible to have it charge the vehicle's batteries as you go?
If it would be possible, would it actually be a better option that having to charge every few hundred miles?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The battery in the Perseverance rover (and in several other vehicles that have left our planet) is a so-called radio-isotope thermoelectric generator (RTG). And this is essentially just a bunch of radioactive material that gradually decays. When this material decays, it generates a little bit of heat. The RTG converts this heat into electricity that can be used to power the vehicle.</p>
<p>Such a device is not really useful in Earth-based cars for several reasons: First, it contains radioactive plutonium.</p>
<p>But radiation poisoning aside, it's also not very powerful. The RTG on Perseverance generates about 110 W of power. The power usage of our cars varies greatly from model to model, but most car engines have a maximum power usage of at least 50 kW, or 450 times as much. Sure, when driving gently and with a modest velocity your power usage isn't as high, but it's still many times more than what the RTG in Perseverance uses. To make the RTG more powerful, you need to simply need to make it bigger. More stuff to decay, more heat, more power. But bigger is heavier. An RTG that's big enough to power a modern car would weigh somewhere in the same ballpark as the car itself.</p>
<p>Next problem: It has no offswitch or a way to control the output. The plutonium decays whether you like it or not at a rate you can't change. Both when the car is going full throttle and when it's parked in the garage. You'd need to build in some way to get rid of the excess heat (wasted energy!) or buffer it in a conventional battery. Perseverance has a battery pack that is charged by the RTG and it is this battery pack that ends up powering all the systems on the rover. When it's empty, the rover has to recharge. But even a battery buffer isn't that great, because it adds even more weight to the car and it's hard to tell how much battery you need. Some people will use the car daily for long commutes, while others leave it in the garage for weeks. So the car would still need to deal with excess heat once the battery is full.</p>
<p>Another issue: It's hard to find enough plutonium to power a meaningful number of cars. Enough for a spacecraft or interplanetary rover every now and then? Sure. For mass market cars? Nope.</p>
<p>Finally, did I mention the thing runs on radioactive plutonium?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pedant alert:</p>
<p>The RTG that powers the rover is not a reactor.  A nuclear reactor generates heat by controlled nuclear fission (atom splitting).  The RTG is just a block of plutonium that naturally decays (alpha, beta particles and gamma radiation) and gets hot while doing it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reactor uses the heat from radioactive decay to power a solid state Peltier module to  produce electricity. The Peltier module is only approx 5% efficient but has no moving parts and is thus extremely reliable.  2000 watts thermal=100 watts electrical</p>
<p>A car could use a Stirling engine instead of a Peltier module and get 6 times more efficiency, eg 30%. 2000 watts thermal = 600 watts electrical.  </p>
<p>This means that if the output was stored in a battery for 24 hours  you could run a very modest car for an hour per day.  600 watts x 24 hrs = 14400 watts x 1 Hr (20 Horsepower)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Rovers have chemical batteries just as an electric car has.</p>
<p>The RTG can be used to charge, and to heats the batteries and rover.</p>
<p>As /u/Rannasha says, the main issue is Plutonium, but I disagree about all his other points, as the RTG would not need to power the motors by itself.  Cars are not driving &gt;90% of the time.</p>
<p>Lets say you have a Tesla model 3, and you drive the average 13,500 miles per year.</p>
<p><a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2019/08/12/tesla-model-3-owner-drives-15000-miles-for-630/#:~:text=5%2C194.67%20kWh%20were%20pumped%20into,at%203.84%20miles%20per%20kWh." target="_blank">For each kwH you get 3.8 miles.  So we have a yearly energy budget of ~3.6 Mega-WattHours.</a>  </p>
<p>This means your RTG for your car would need to produce only 405 Watts, VERY close to the 110 W of power that the RTG on NASA's Perseverance.</p>
<p>Indeed we don't even need any more plutonium. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/glenn/2020/stirling-convertor-sets-14-year-continuous-operation-milestone" target="_blank"> All we need to do is to use a Sterling engine, rather than a Thermo-electric device to pull in the heat, and we are good to go!</a></p>
<p>As for not being able to turn the power off, who cares?  It doesn't matter to us.  When we are full up on power, we just radiate the heat, as we would anyways.  The RTG is so inefficent on the Rover that the difference between using the power, and not using it is basically 3% heat difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
