		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two primary ways:</p>
<p>1) They have transactions arranged to sell at pre-determined times well in advance, for example they want to sell $250k worth of shares on the last day of every quarter.</p>
<p>2) There are &quot;blackout&quot; periods where insiders are advised that they are not able to trade. These are typically at the end of a fiscal quarter when executives become aware of financial performance, or ad hoc when there is a material event being discussed like an acquisition. The company's legal department will advise those &quot;in the know&quot; when they can/can't sell because the executive meets the criteria of having &quot;material, non-public&quot; information about the company.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;insider trading&quot; does not apply to any trade, it applies to trades based on &quot;inside information&quot; that the public does not have access to</p>
<p>so if Tim Cook wants to buy a yacht and needs to free up $100 million in cash by selling some Apple stock, he can do that.  Generally key executives need to file with the SEC before making large trades to that they are public knowledge in advance</p>
<p>if Tim Cook knows that Apple is going to sink 10% because of a bad quarter, he CANNOT trade on that information before it is made public.   And he can't tell his brother to trade on that information either</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are blackout dates when company employees cannot sell, like weeks leading up to earnings release, when a merger or acquisition is in the works, when material info like a lawsuit settlement or regulatory ruling are known but not yet publicly announced.</p>
<p>Also, many senior execs set up automated trading orders, say selling 1000 shares on the Friday after earning release every quarter, which make it easier to show them at the trade wasn’t tied to any sort of inside knowledge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Certain industries, particularly in finance, have internal policies that control what and when you’re allowed to trade in general, not just of that companies stock.</p>
<p>For example, working for an investment bank every trade  requires pre-clearance by compliance, often through an automated system, and there are restrictions on trading any stocks that the bank is working closely with, for example pre-IPO. Some types of trade or asset class might be banned entirely.</p>
<p>Additionally you may be required to hold your investments with certain brokers who’s systems are linked to your employers compliance team who will verify you’re not trading anything that’s not allowed.</p>
<p>Technically the information you might have is called “Material Non-Public Information” (MNPI), and banking and finance compliance rules are in place to control who gets access to it. Accidental disclosure also requires reporting to Compliance, even if you don’t trade on that information.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
