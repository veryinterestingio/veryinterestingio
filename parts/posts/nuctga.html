		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plenty of reasons possible.</p>
<p>We live with plenty of screens nowadays, and it's become more and more common for it to break our sleep schedule. With the constant stimulation and lack of physical exercise, our brain lose track of time. The usual darkness that is supposed to be a signal for our body to recharge isn't working in our current environment anymore.</p>
<p>Another possible reason is a different natural sleep schedules. Some people simply have a different time when their body feel tired.</p>
<p>A third one is hormonal issues. This one is more of a &quot;friends experience&quot;, but I know someone's who's body had trouble with that. Their body wouldn't produce the chemical that says &quot;tired&quot; on time. It would produce it much later (such as 8AM) than it was supposed to. As such, no matter how much she tried she couldn't sleep any earlier.</p>
<p>If I were you, and this issue is still troubling you, I'd recommend talking about it with your doctor. We can speculate all we want, medical issue are never a &quot;reddit&quot; kind of question. It's a medical expert with years of training kind of question.</p>
<p>Regardless, i wish you the best of day and a good night sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not an answer, but I have the same problem.  I also got a fitbit to track my sleep and I noticed if I sleep from 5 PM to 8 PM because I am just exhausted I have very few moments where I am shown as awake and it is mostly deep sleep.  But when I sleep from midnight to 8 AM I have a lot of moments where I am awake between my light and deep sleep cycles.  It's really frustrating to want to sleep so badly at 5 PM but you know you can't because it will mess your cycle up and then later in the night you can't get to sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What comes to mind:</p>
<p>A) There is something wrong with the room, where you sleep: Too noisy, too hot/cold or too much light.</p>
<p>B) Anxiety - you always feel there is something you should have accomplished and didn't, so you have trouble going to sleep.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason is, if you don't sleep at night, you are tired and your body will eventually make you sleep regardless of circumstances even during the day in perhaps even less suitable conditions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It can be a learned behavior if you don't fall asleep once at bedtime. If you do activities other than sleeping in your bed then your brain may not associate bed with sleep. The only other thing you should do in bed is sex. Even something as simple as not being able to sleep can make your brain associate bed with not sleeping even if you are only laying in bed.</p>
<p>If you have trouble falling asleep then you can be worried about falling asleep which can make it difficult go sleep. </p>
<p>You can check out normal sleep cycles on sleep foundation but for most adults melatonin starts being products around 9pm and by 10-11pm you should be getting sleepy and can sleep. If you are a young adult (early 20s) or teen then this process normally starts later so you would be ready around 1am. As you age then it starts to happen earlier about 30 minute per decade for AARP age. Only about 20% of people are larks or night owls but if that's you then add or subtract and an hour as well.</p>
<p>If you need to wake up at a certain time and so you back tracked what time you need to get up and it doesn't fit neatly in the ideal 10-11pm. It isn't a huge concern you can set circadian clock to be later or earlier though at the extreme (working at night sleeping during the day) can have longer term effects. A few hours earlier or later however should be ok. </p>
<p>On the weekend try to wake up the same time in the morning even if you don't fall asleep at the same time. It's best to follow sleep schedule on weekend but if you have to pick then waking up time is more important. You can just wake up from an hour or two and then take a nap. But make sure to wake up don't just hit snooze.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
