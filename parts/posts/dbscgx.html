		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Diseases are transmitted to humans via vectors (Arthropods, specifically fleas, tick, and mosquitos) which can transmit in one of two ways - mechanical or biological transmission. Mechanical transmission is when the pathogen on its feet. Biological transmission is when the pathogen reproduces or undergoes some form of reproductive change, then is transmitted to people via bites or feces. </p>
<p>Ants do transmit disease but the prevalence is not nearly as high as in mosquitos or ticks. Usually ants are vectors of transmission through mechanical transmission. The main cause of ant related disease is through bacterial and fungal infections in countries that are less hygienic. Usually these diseases present themselves through a secondary infection - an infection which normally would not infect someone but now does given a weaken immune system for example. </p>

One of the more fascinating parasite life cycles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
