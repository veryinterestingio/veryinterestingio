		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because before the industrial revolution and modern medicine, it was a lot easier for people to die from things like injury, disease, and natural disasters, and a lot of nursery rhymes came out of getting children ready to face their own mortality.</p>
<p>I don't remember where I read this, but 'we told our children stories full of blood, then took out all the blood and wonder what happened to the stories.'
The idea that children need to be sheltered from the horrors of reality is relatively new in the grand scheme of things. I'm not saying parents should traumatize their children, depictions of violence and gore usually aren't traumatic for children anyway. What I'm saying is most censorship is unnecessary at best.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about nursery rhymes but the Grimm Brothers Tales were written a long time ago and inspired many of Disney's earlier films. Not sure why they're as dark as they are or why Disney made lighthearted movies out of them, but they're definitely worth a read</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, they don't, for example Miss Muffet is pretty benign:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Little miss Muffet she sat on her tuffet, eating her curds and whey<br />
Along came a spider who sat down beside her<br />
And frightened miss Muffet away</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some people theorize that &quot;Ring around the rosy&quot; is a reference to the Plague, but there's no historical evidence of this (and the plague explanation only cropped up in the mid-20th century)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of nursery rhymes were supposedly born from historical events. They weren't originally written for children, but to make fun of unpopular people. Sort of like some Randy Rainbow songs do today. :-)</p>
