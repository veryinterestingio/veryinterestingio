		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are three main drivers of plate motion, listed in approximate order of importance/strength they are (1) slab pull, (2) ridge push, and (3) basal traction. Slab pull is the force imparted from the negative buoyancy of the edges of oceanic lithosphere/plates which have started to sink into the mantle at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction" target="_blank">subduction zones</a> as they have reached a state (through cooling and thickening) where they are denser than the asthenosphere below (imagine a rug floating on a pool of water and then you clip some weights to one edge of the rug, that edge of the rug will sink and drag the rest of the rug down with it). Ridge push is largely from positive buoyancy, i.e. new oceanic lithosphere is created at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-ocean_ridge" target="_blank">mid-ocean ridges</a> and this lithosphere is very warm and less dense than the lithosphere adjacent to it (away from the ridge) and so is sitting higher than the adjacent lithosphere, this translates to some force pushing away from the ridge. Basal traction is essentially a drag force imparted to the base of the plates from motion of the mantle driven by convection currents and other movements and it can be a driving or resisting force depending on the orientation of the basal traction with respect to other forces. We can further resolve other forces that both drive and resist plate motion, e.g. <a href="https://imgur.com/uWWb5Ud" target="_blank">diagrams like these</a>, but these are the three major drivers. From the early days of plate tectonics, we've known that under most normal circumstances slab pull dominates plate motion (e.g. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/43/1/163/586101" target="_blank">Forsyth &amp; Uyeda, 1975</a>), but there continue to be discussions about just how important (or not important) the other forces are and a lot of the details of slab pull and what influences it, e.g. <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2004GL019528" target="_blank">Schellart, 2004</a> as one example. But at the basic level, saying that plate motion is fundamentally tied to the life cycle (i.e. creation at a mid-ocean ridge and destruction at a subduction zone) of oceanic portions of plates (e.g. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040195118301215" target="_blank">Crameri et al, 2019</a>) and mostly driven by the sinking of subducted slabs would be correct.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> For all the people replying or commenting elsewhere, the relationship between mantle convection and plate motion is complicated, but <strong>it is incorrect to say that plate motion is driven by convection, and more correct to say that plate motion is part of convection</strong>. The common, simplistic view of plates passively moving along on top of convection currents in the mantle (a model referred to as the &quot;passive plate model&quot;) is demonstrably false. A better way to think about this is the plates forming a part of the convective system, but not one driven by heating from below but rather more by cooling from above, where the driving forces end up being the edge forces on plates (primarily slab pull) and plate motion and the geometry of mantle convection are both dominated by the behavior of these subducted slabs (e.g. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040195118301215" target="_blank">Crameri et al, 2019</a>). The nuanced relationship between plate motion and convection is expounded upon in a variety of papers (e.g. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X02010099" target="_blank">Bercovivi, 2003</a> or <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2009GC002378" target="_blank">Foley &amp; Becker, 2009</a>), but critically, the dynamics are much more complicated than just saying &quot;plate motion is driven by convection&quot; as, for example, the dynamics of the subducted slab and interactions with the overriding plate are critical in explaining many important aspects of plate motion, e.g. <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-87974-9_1" target="_blank">Becker &amp; Faccena, 2009</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
