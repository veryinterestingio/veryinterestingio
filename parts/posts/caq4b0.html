		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hot is farther from room temperature than cold is. Typical cold beverage might be 35 which is 35 degrees below a room temp of 70. By contrast, a typical hot coffee might be 180, which is 110 degrees above room temp. </p>
<p>The bigger the difference in temp between inside and outside the thermos, the faster the temp will drop or rise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The rate of temperature exchange is proportionate to the gradient. A &quot;Cold&quot; drink on a hot summer day is going to be around 5° when ambient temperatures are 25-30°. A &quot;Hot&quot; drink could be as hot as 100° if it's freshly brewed tea. So there's a bigger temperature gradient and thus faster temperature exchange.</p>

<p>It takes about 4 Joules to heat 1 gram of water one degree Celsius, but about 334 Joules to melt 1 gram of ice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many people have explained the temperature difference, and it's true this is the dominant effect.  But there is another effect as it relates to cold things vs. hot things.  That is radiative heat transfer.  Basically, put your hand near (but not on) a hot coffee cup.  You'll feel the heat.  Put your hand near (but not on) a cold coffee cup.  You won't be able to tell it's cold.  Radiative heat transfer from ambient to cold things is less effective than from hot things to ambient.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>To not ELY5:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The heat transfer goes as a constant * T\^4 in absolute temperature.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The ambient surface is transferring C * 293\^4=C * 7.4E9 units of energy from the outer surface to the inner surface (whether that object is hot or cold!)</p>
<p>The cold thing is losing C * 273\^4 = C * 5.6E9 units of energy from the inner surface to the outer surface.</p>
<p>The hot thing (to illustrate the effect, we will use a 40 degree C thing) is losing C * 314\^4 = C * 9.7E9 units of energy to the outside.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The cold thing thus receives 1.8E9 units of energy, while the hot thing loses 2.5E9 units of energy (for the same change in temperature between the fluid and ambient).  So you can see that effect make the hot thing cool off faster than the cold thing heats up.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Another very important effect:</p>
<p>If there is ICE in your cold thing, you also get the latent heat of fusion from the ice turning into water.  This is quite a bit of energy!  One gram of ice can cool one gram of water 80 degrees Celsius as it melts.  So to pull all that ice up from freezing is like requiring 80 times more heat to be lost per mass than to just have to heat it up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
