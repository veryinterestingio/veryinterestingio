		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There actually have been vaccines for HIV that made it all the way to human trials (this is actually Dr. Fauci's main area of reasearch). One is in a phase 3 trial right now actually. A vaccine candidate that was trialed in Thailand actually made a small group of people MORE likely to get infected - unclear why this happened but it may be a feature of how people get infected (sexual vs shared needles). Edit, see this paper from  /u/capedcrusador <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23661056/" target="_blank"><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23661056/" target="_blank">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23661056/</a></a> </p>
<p>As people have said, there are vaccines for HPV, there's also vaccines for Hep B (shout out for vaccination - there are several nasty Hep A outbreaks going on in the US right now, if you're not vaccinated for Hep A and B, go do it! If you don't have insurance, the health department will usually do it for free! Hep A can be easily spread through food.)</p>
<p>There are vaccines for Equine Herpes Viruses, which can be sexually transmitted, but mostly transmitted by respiratory droplets and fomite contamination. Unfortunately, it's just a crappy vaccine. Horses that travel frequently need to get it at least twice a year, and it hasn't even conclusively been shown to prevent infection. It does reduce viral shedding and may reduce severity of disease. EHV is pretty nasty, often causing severe respiratory and neurological symptoms, it's highly contagious, and it can be fatal.</p>
<p>Herpes in people really isn't that severe most of the time, most people are infected with HSV-1 from a young age, and HSV-1 can be protective against later HSV-2 infection. HSV is latent and/or asymptomatic in most infected people. So you'd have to spend a ton of money to develop a vaccine for a fairly innocuous disease and then have no real way to test if it was effective or not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hepatitis and HPV both have vaccines. Most other STDs are easily curable, with the exception of HIV and Herpes. Herpes almost never kills you, and HIV is a really difficult disease to prevent/treat because of the way the virus attacks body cells. However there are drugs that help prevent HIV, called PREP, and another one you can take if you think you've been exposed, called PEP.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are vaccines for STD’s, HPV has multiple vaccines.  Others are either viruses like HIV that infect immune system cells and pose some particular difficulties.<br />
The difficulties in making an HIV vaccine are:
Lack of natural immunity to HIV
Variability of HIV types
Lack of correlates of protective immunity
Lack of an animal model that reliably predicts vaccine efficacy in humans
Basically, we have no example of what HIV immunity looks like in an average person because unlike flu or even smallpox we don’t have people who “survive” HIV infection because they’re immune system fought it off leaving them immune to future infection.  We biologists and biochemists do most of our magic figuring out the natural cause of things like resistance, immunity, headache relief after chewing on willow bark... and isolating or replicating it.  We can’t do that if we have no one whose naturally immune to HIV post infection.  </p>
<p>Second reason is HIV is a virus that mutates a lot causing different serotypes (basically it changes the amino acid order in its protein shell and the order of its genome so that an antibody that recognized one serotype wouldn’t necessarily recognize another, meaning a vaccine isn’t guaranteed to work on all HIV viruses even if it worked on one serotype.  </p>
<p>Third is that it seems like just about everyone can contract HIV... so we don’t have a model of someone who is resistant... just like with the first problem, we have no idea how to replicate something we haven’t seen.</p>
<p>Fourth, and not least, is the human part of human immunodeficiency virus.  It doesn’t infect our most commonly used scientific model organisms (mice/rats or even cats/certain primates) so we can’t test vaccine efficacy on anything... we can make sure it doesn’t kill other mammals, but we have no idea if it’s protecting them against the disease.  (This was a major problem with studying leprosy before we found out that armadillos can contract leprosy infections... then we made a ton of research headway really fast... if you are allowed to purposely infect and give potentially dangerous drugs to something infected with a certain pathogen or exposed to a certain toxin you can do research that would be pretty much guesswork amassed over decades if you were restricted to human research only.  That’s why we have the Nuremberg ethical question about the research Nazi’s did in concentration camps.  Evil deeds beyond compare were done to humans as model organisms... but the scientific data generated is potentially lifesaving... but using it essentially excuses similar action in the future by “at any costs” scientists or a regime that dehumanizes people... so we can’t use it, ever, if we really, really want to discourage it being done ever again).  </p>
<p>Herpes is tricky for many of the reasons HIV is (it lasts forever so we don’t have post infection immunity to replicate) and it’s also really good at going dormant in nerve cells and not provoking any immune response and then flaring up intermittently and shedding virus only some of the time, so there isn’t always active virus stimulating the immune system...  the first flare of herpes simplex one and two is usually the worst because we do amount a faster immune response to future outbreaks, but because we never irradiate all cells hosting the virus the infection is never eliminated.  Other herpes viruses we do have vaccines for (zoster... aka chicken pox and shingles) for example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
