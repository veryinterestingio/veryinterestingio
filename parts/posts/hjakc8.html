		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thing about most albino animals in the wild is that they are killed early on in their lives by predators due to the lack of their natural camouflage. Something bright white stands out against grass or trees and means they are easy targets. This may skew the chance of a true result to this question.
If you extended the question to include hypermelanistic (completely black including eyes) you might get a wider answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Shunned is a somewhat loaded word as it refers to how other animals feel about the albino. This is very hard to know in other species.</p>
<p>However there is plenty of evidence for behavioural differences in albino individuals. Here is one example for albino catfish:</p>
<p>&quot; We found that the total number of aggressive interactions was lower in albinos than in pigmented catfish...albinos showed a tendency towards greater separation from their same-coloured conspecifics...&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4841223/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4841223/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4841223/</a></a> </p>
<p>The intro section of that paper also mentioned several behavioural differences in albino rats such as reduced activity, more timidness, lesser burrowing behaviour and sleeping away from the nest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a general comment here, there's a lot of really good conversation going on here about selection and survival. It's really important to point out that <em>Albinism is not just about being &quot;white&quot; in color.</em> Albinism is a condition in which an organism has seriously reduced or &quot;no&quot; pigment. The most obvious thing that we can see is the &quot;white&quot; coloration of an albino animal, but this reduced pigment can have other drastic effects, most notably that albino organisms often have poor or terrible eyesight which also can/does have an impact on survival of individual organisms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A short answer is that yes, this can happen. Primarily, animals that have albinism or are hypomelanistic (or suffer from leucism) can, at the very least, have issues being selected for breeding, especially if coloration is important in sexual selection (birds being a prime example). Something to keep in mind is that Albinism is a trait that can be inherited (can be passed down), but is also a recessive trait.</p>
<p>Albinism causes a lot of other issues in animals; Other than the lack of coloration, which also means serious issues with camouflage, another problem is bad eyesight. Your retina is highly pigmented specifically to absorb light, and if it cannot do its job properly, the result will be incredibly poor eyesight.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Whether or not all albino animals are &quot;shunned&quot; or not, albinism leaves them at a definite disadvantage in the wild as a couple of other posters suggested. Not being able to hide because of coloration issues, and not being able to hunt prey (or see a predator to avoid becoming prey) can put some severe limitations on lifespan and survival. Not to mention the potential issues with sun exposure and having to deal with having a thinner than normal coat (or feathers) and what role that can have on insulation (pigmented hair and feathers are thicker, and do a better job at what they are supposed to do).</p>
