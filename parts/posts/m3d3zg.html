		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you build a modern structure and want to replace an old one that's in the same location, first thing you do is demolish the old. We tend to build very exacting foundations for our buildings these days, so we excavate and destroy the foundations of the old to give a clean slate for the new. That's not always the case, but it's how we often do it, and we have many powerful tools to allow us to do so with relative ease, like jackhammers and bulldozers and trucks and digging machines. Even so, we leave behind various traces that are not worth our effort to pull up, like old piping and the like. Very large structures like skyscrapers and bridges sometimes leave huge anchors dug into the bedrock itself, and when we eventually replace them, chances are we're unlikely to go to the effort to remove these if we have no pressing need to. So you can imagine how, many years from now, you'd find all kinds of buried evidence of our buildings around.</p>
<p>Ancient cities had this phenomenon, but far moreso, because digging up foundations was significantly more difficult and time consuming without big powerful modern tools, and many ancient structures didn't need the sort of precise design that many modern ones do, so without a compelling reason to go to the effort of removing these foundations, you'd just re-use what was already there, or you'd bury them and just build on top.</p>
<p>Often when things are abandoned, nature tends to take over. Plants spread over the top of things and eventually die, decompose and become soil. Over a very long span of time, the level rises, and the ruins are buried beneath.</p>
<p>Other times, floods come and deposit silt over the top of things, or in dry places winds can bring dirt and sand over a long period of time, very slowly burying things. </p>
<p>What hasn't been buried tended to succumb to erosion, and of course we don't know about things we don't have evidence for anymore. Put simply, we find things buried, because 99% of the time things being buried is the only reason they survived long enough for us to find them in the first place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not so much that everything that's old eventually gets buried, it's that stuff that happens to get buried is there for us to find, whereas stuff that doesn't gets reused or recycled eventually and then can't be found by us. But cities in particular do tend to have stuff get buried. For one thing, in pre-modern cities, when buildings got old and collapsed the rubble was often just flattened over and new construction built on top. This has the cumulative effect that the street level of a lot of cities has gradually risen so that you can often find the foundations of ancient buildings in the basement level of the more recent construction. Also, a lot of human settlement is in river valleys, which do often have a new layer of dirt deposited on them periodically when they flood. Also it bears mentioning that a lot of the very best archaeological finds are things that were intentionally buried, like tombs and other burials.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Colosseum wasn't buried. Neither were the Carnac Stones, or Machu Picchu. </p>
<p>Some old things were buried gradually by dirt and sand being blown over them, like the Sphinx. Actually the head stayed visible, which must have been confusing during excavation. You've digging up a big statue of a dude and then there's paws. </p>
<p>Some things were buried on purpose, like Newgrange. It was always a partially underground structure. </p>
<p>Other things were buried very suddenly, like Pompeii. We know exactly where the stone came from because Vesuvius is right there. </p>
<p>Remains that weren't buried were usually either maintained, so we can't find them because they're not lost, or they were worn away and carried off so we can't find them because they're not there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some parts of the earth are being eroded away and deposited in other parts. The bits of ancient civilisations we've dug up are in areas where earth is being deposited. Other bits of ancient civilisations have been eroded away but we mostly don't know about those ... just because they're not there any more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It comes from other areas. Rivers flood and carry mud with them. When the flood recedes, the mud is left behind and builds up. But that material is missing from another place now. Wind can do the same and blow sand and dust over your place. If the conditions are right in a spot, the sand and dust builds up there. </p>
<p>On the long scale of geology, new mountains get built up by tectonics and start to erode, providing more dust, sand, gravel  and so on, which then gets transported and covers other places. On the very long scale, all that stuff sooner or later gets pulled back into the mantle in subduction zones, melts up and basically gets recycled.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
