		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heart strength is a measure of muscle contractility and can be measured by either cardiac output (heart rate times the amount of blood that is pushed out with each contraction), or ejection fraction (the percent of blood in the left ventricle that is pushed out with each contraction). This is most significant when someone has heart failure because it can tell you both what type of heart failure, and to what degree. Typically fast and weak beats are not good because it means that blood won’t flow well, this is common is certain arrhythmias. Slower (60-100 beats per minute) and stronger beats are usually better. Others may be able to add more, but hopefully this is a good starting point to your question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

So to answer your question the Ekg can generally tell you heart rate pretty accurately. What I always like to point out to people is heart rate on a cardiac monitor does not always equal pulse rate. If your heart is going so fast or a premature complex comes in before the lower chambers are filled with blood, you may see a decrease in stroke volume (the volume of blood ejected by the heart in a single beat). As my Ekg text book drummed home in every chapter “The EKG measures electrical and not mechanical activity”. As such these beats happening multiple time a minute will decrease what’s known as your cardiac output (stroke volume x heart rate). </p>
<p>The way we tell the actual heart strength (at least diagnostically) is through the use of an echocardiogram. They do an ultrasound of your heart. They analyze the structure (how thick is the myocardium the actual muscle). they look and measure the movement of fluid between the heart valves and through the chambers. The big number we are looking for is the left ventricular ejection fraction (the lower right chamber that ejects blood to the body). In a normal person this is 50-70% and indicates the percentage of blood in the ventricle that gets ejected every beat. Anything lower and you are looking at heart failure generally. </p>
<p>Interestingly enough one of the classic things that leads to heart failure is uncontrolled high blood pressure. You see as the heart has to push against higher pressures it starts to compensate by increasing the rate (as stroke volume decreases). Eventually it gets to a point where the myocardium (again muscle) thickens partially in an effort to increase the force of contraction. Good short term solution but in the long term the problem is that thicker wall means less ability to eject blood fully. picture trying to empty air out of a balloon by squeezing and trying to empty air out of a tennis ball with a hole. Ones going to be easier to empty than the other. Other interesting thing is one of our treatments for heart failure is digoxin which is used to increase the contractility (strength) of the hearts beats to try to increase that ejection fraction.</p>
<p>Faster weaker beat are what you get with heart failure. Slower and more efficient beats are what you get out of your marathon runners. Technically speaking those beats may be a bit stronger than the normal person but I think part of the reason I see runners who can sustain in the high 30s while sleeping is because their body uses oxygen efficiently. Unlike an obese man there is less body mass on a runner that needs oxygenating. So long as blood is circulating and their blood pressure is high enough to perfuse their organs and tissues it’s not a major issue if it’s normal for them.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of good answers already about monitoring heart contraction strength, so I won't go into it in depth.  </p>
<p>As for the question about dis/advantages of fast/shallow vs slow/strong heart beats, its kind of a matter of circumstances, but extremes on either side are bad.  </p>
<p>By my understanding, fast and weak is less ideal.  My justification for this is that 1) increased heart rate increases the work done by the heart, and 2) despite the increased work (which would increase the oxygen requirements of heart muscle tissues) the time for perfusion of the myocardial tissue itself is decreased.  This is because the blood flow to cardiac tissue itself through coronaries occurs during diastole (or when the ventricle is resting).  Increasing heart rate reduces the total amount as well as the proportion of diastolic time for coronaries to fill, thus less blood, thus less oxygen.  Overall this has the effect of taking heart muscle and creating an ischaemic setting in vulnerable people.</p>
<p>As the heart fills more, the stroke volume improves through a number of means (can look up Frank Starling law of the heart for more information).  This is advantageous, though in cases where heart muscle is weakened or limited in its movements, relying on large, strong pulses is a recipe for worsening heart failure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just as a point of clarification, heart monitors measure more than heart rate and often times can detect parts of what would be seen as strength. The heart muscles works on currents which is what is measured when someone is attached to a heart monitor so the monitor can see when the muscle isn't firing in sync, or when damage has happened to an area of the heart and lots of arrhythmias that affect the overall workload of the heart in relation to getting blood to the body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
