		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally, the left hemisphere (side) of the brain is involved with processing speech and language. Parts of the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes are activated when you formulate / choose what you want to say, and the motor cortex (part of the frontal lobe) -- particularly Broca's area -- lights up (meaning that it displays the most activity during brain scans) as you speak. So it's likely that any damage caused by drug use affecting speech occurred mostly on the left side of the brain.</p>
<p>The specific types and amount of damage would be difficult to determine without actually testing an individual in that situation, but it would be fairly safe to assume that synaptic response has been damaged, so messages to and from the neurons in those areas may only be slowed down or might be blocked in any number of places. If they've gone years without help, some degree of the damage is probably permanent, but with proper assessment and therapy they might be able to repair some of it, but there are a <em>lot</em> of factors involved in that, not the least of which being age.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An ELI5 answer is impossible because an “ELI am a neurologist” is also impossible. Diagnosis of brain disorder is difficult and can take months of testing and observation. It may not be the drugs, it could be alcohol, it could be an underlying degenerative condition or injury. Yes, lack of O2 due to an overdose and respiratory failure will cause injury pretty quickly. But predicting where the injury occurs is another matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Brains are really complicated. Drugs make them work in ways they don't usually, and this can hurt them.</p>
<p>It's kind of like your brain is a car, and taking a drug might be like heating every part of it up to 120 degrees and driving at 80mph over sand. The car might be ok, or it might not. Little parts of it might be damaged all over. Maybe you notice the steering is 'off' after. It's hard to say why this is, as lots of the car's systems were out of their normal bounds and may have suffered lasting impacts.</p>
<p>Of course if your brain is a car, it's a magical self-repairing, self-shaping one that adapts to fit your use over time. It's just a question of how much your brain can handle before you do some lasting damage (probably through cell death).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
