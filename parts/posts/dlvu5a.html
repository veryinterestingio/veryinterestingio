		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other explanations your stomach is also effected because the human stress response will pull blood from your viscera to get you muscles ready for action. As you can probably guess, the human stress response in many circumstances isn't really helpful very often.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During a stressful situation whether something environmental, such as a looming a deadline or  persistent worry about a serious matter it trigger a cascade of stress hormones  Such as  your heart pounding and breathing quicken. Muscles tensing, sweating and that butterfly in stomach feeling </p>
<p>The combination of these reactions are called the fight  or flight response because it evolved from prehistoric times as a survival mechanism, enabling people to react quickly to life-threatening situations. </p>
<p>The exact &quot;feeling of your gut&quot; is from your adrenal glands and stomach muscles during the fight-or-flight response, and that’s partially what causes the butterflies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The body needed more oxygen, thus blood, to deal with threat. Removing blood from the digestive system stops some processes and it feels bad, but you survived the threat.  </p>
<p>Now, we have replaced physical threats for intellectual ones, which need no blood, adrenaline etc, but the survival systems are still there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you are stressed, anxious, or scared about something, your body enters a “fight or flight” state, and optimizes it’s bodily functions to prepare for the perceived incoming threat. It does so by increasing heart rate (preparing you to run away if you need to), and other similar things. It also shuts down some of your bodily functions in order to preserve energy for the upcoming perceived threat. The digestive system is one of these functions. The “butterfly in the stomach” feeling/mild nausea is a result of the digestive system being shut down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
