		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electricity comes in two flavors: spicy (AC) and bland (DC). There's also two other things that are important: how fast do you want it coming in (voltage) and how much do you need (amps).</p>
<p>When you plug into a wall outlet you're getting Spicy AC power at 120 volts in America or 230 volts in Europe and a standard house circuit can supply 20 amps (at least in America, not sure about other places). In either case that's the electrical equivalent of having your garden hose on full blast, it's coming out pretty good but it's still relatively safe and usable for the average person. For big dumb things like a hairdryer or a blender that just want to go fast or get hot this is great. Just take that full blast spicy power and go brrrrrr. Similarly you could hook that full blast hose up to your lawn sprinkler and it'll work fine.</p>
<p>If you want to run something a little more sophisticated though like a laptop or a Playstation you need that bland DC power. AC power is all wiggly, DC plods along in a nice straight line and if you want to do math with electricity it needs to move straight. You also probably don't want it coming in so full blast. Your sprinkler may be able to handle the hose on full, but if you stuck it in your mouth you'd probably have a problem pretty quickly. So you gotta turn the spicy AC into bland DC, that's what the power brick does. You also need to turn the hose down, it also does that and brings the voltage down from 120 or 230 to usually something like 5-12 depending on what you're running. Instead of your hose on full it's your faucet on at a trickle.</p>
<p>I also mentioned amps earlier, basically how much power do you need. Keeping with the hose analogy how big a hose do you need? Your house circuit can supply up to 20 but you've got to filter that through the transformer in the power brick.. If you're just charging your cell phone you don't need much at all so the dinky little block that fits in your hand is fine. If you want to run an Xbox though you'll need more. All that math requires a lot of power, so you gotta have that much larger brick to get the same bland 5 volts, but you need 2 or 3 amps worth and you need more space to accommodate the hardware for the additional capacity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A laptop needs to convert the AC power from the plug to DC to use it. That power brick is what does that. A hairdryer uses AC so it doesn’t need to convert, the only reason it has a block on the plug at all is for its gfci protection to avoid shocking the user if it touches water. </p>
<p>Things like kettles and hairdryers don’t care about the power source very much, at their core is just some coiled wire that electricity is passed through, the resistance creates heat. Laptops need to charge the DC battery and use a lower voltage also.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kettles and hairdryers etc all run directly off AC voltage.</p>
<p>Laptops and phones (all electronics) need DC voltages. That brick is a converter that generates DC voltage from AC mains. Bigger electronic appliances like desktop computers, TVs etc have a built in AC/DC converter so they don't have a separate brick.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kettles, hairdryers, etc. use power mainly for heating or to run a motor. These things can take the full mains voltage and does not need any form of power convertion. However things that use transistors and other semiconductor devices to run logics circuits need a very low voltage. Similarly with batteries as each battery only have a small voltage across it. This means that these devices needs to transform the main voltages of about 120V to 240V into eventually something like 3.3V or lower, however usually with an intermediary voltage of maybe 12V or 20V. This is what the big power brick does, it transforms the higher mains voltage into this intermediary voltage that can then more easily be converted to the correct voltages. The size of the power brick is roughly proportional to how much power it can transform. So something which draws just a tiny bit of power like a control chip in a device or for example an LED light might have a tiny power transformer built into it but a larger device like a laptop or a TV need a larger external device.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Things like hair dryers don't care too much about what electricity is given to them. So long as it's close enough, they'll work just fine. But things like laptops are more sensitive. They need the electricity to be <em>just right</em> in order to function properly. The power brick takes the electricity from the wall and makes sure the laptop can use it safely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
