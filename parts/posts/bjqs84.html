<p>While you’re infected with the virus and your immune system is busy fighting it off, you are slightly more vulnerable to other bugs. When it resolves, your body will have made antibodies against the virus so that if you ever encounter it again, the symptoms you experience will be much milder, if you notice it at all. </p>
<p>Despite this, there are a great many variations of the virus that usually causes the common cold, and your body won’t be able to recognize those that differ greatly from the one you were infected with (which is also the reason there’s no vaccine for the common cold). </p>
<p>The best thing you can do is practice good hand hygiene (washing your hands often) and stay away from your sick coworkers!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So 'strengthening your immune system' can mean two different things.</p>
<p>There's specific immunity - which is how resistant you are to a specific disease. Getting exposed to the common cold a lot will make you more immune to a specific virus. But there's over 200 different viruses that cause very similar symptoms, all of which we call the common cold. There's some overlap in immunity based on how similar one virus is to others, but if the viruses are too different, then exposure to one wont make much difference.</p>
<p>Then there's general immunity - which is how good your body is at dealing with new threats. Exposure to illnesses doesn't do much at all to this. But exercise, sleep, eating well, and being mentally healthy make a huge, huge difference. If you find you get sick much more often than others, this is where you should focus.</p>
<p>And to be clear, when it comes to the immune system, good diet isn't about calories, it's about nutrients - especially zinc. Contrary to popular belief, vitamin C does little to nothing for the immune system unless you're deficient or a serious athlete (very heavy exercise is associated with immune suppression, vitamin C counteracts this).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in a hospital. I've been here close to a year. I've been sick for most of it.</p>
<p>Because of hospital attendance policies I can't recover long enough, immune system has been in constant battle.</p>
<p>Hospital attendance policies cause more sickness than anything. Makes more sense for employees and patients both for employees to be given enough time to recover.</p>
<p>But no.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of companies use a point system and u can get points docked for a number of reasons. Lots of people won't take the day off when they are sick because they were pointed cor being five min late or having to take a half day cor something.
