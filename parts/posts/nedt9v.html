		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a vacuum chamber that I use for freeze drying.  It works really well.  Aside from the foods, I have done some  tricks for the kids where I put water in a clear glass and put it in the chamber.  I turn the machine on and it does what one would expect, after a few minutes as the pressure drops the water begins boiling.</p>
<p>But  then what happens after a little bit the water stops boiling.  Pressure continues to drop. The water just sits there, motionless.</p>
<p>If I release the vacuum stir it (maybe it super cooled?) And then try again, I get little to no boiling.  I tried it in plastic (less of a smooth surface so perhaps there was more condensation points) but still the same thing, no boiling.</p>
<p>When I replace the water with fresh tap water, it will boil again but then do the above.</p>
<p>What is going on?  I expected the water to boil until gone.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like you're not boiling the water, but degassing it. Once all the dissolved gas has been removed from the water it stops bubbling.</p>
<p>What kind of vacuum chamber do you have? What pressures are you reaching?</p>
<p>At room temperature you need to be reaching pressures lower than something like 20 mbar to boil the water in 'vacuum'. This required pressure would likely also be driven even lower by the cooling effect from evaporation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually very simple. The water is cooling as it evaporates, and it eventually reaches a temperature where the pressure is no longer sufficient for boiling.  </p>
<p>Since the vacuum provides excellent insulation, the water can’t pick up energy to continue the boiling.</p>
<p>If you can fill the pressure chamber upside down with the water freely flowing inside, it can get heat from the glass itself and continue boiling. It will also chill the glass and show the students that it’s clearly boiling even at a cold temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like the pressure is low enough to boil water. Your expectation of what water boiling in a vacuum look like may be off. The surface of the water is likely rapidly vaporizing (boiling away). You are not seeing the big bubbles in the bulk of the liquid because the weight of the water itself is locally increasing the pressure in the water as a function of depth, so it can no longer boil in the bulk of the water like you see on the stove.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m not 100% confident on this, and I’d love someone to fact check me. </p>
<p>But water definitely boils at a lower temperature, when in a low pressure atmosphere. </p>
<p>The water boils in the vacuum. <strong>Then</strong> it releases water vapor. This would then increase the pressure again. Then it would stop boiling because it’s not in a low pressure environment. </p>
<p>Also, if I’m not mistaken, the water temperature should decrease. It should follow the formula PV=nRT. Pressure, volume, moles, (some constant) temperature. The only ones changing are pressure and temperature, and pressure is going down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
