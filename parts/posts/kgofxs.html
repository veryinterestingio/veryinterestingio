		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mayo is fat + egg.</p>
<p>Butter is fat + water.</p>
<p>The fat does all the work, so you should have a somewhat similar thing here, you're just cooking mostly fat onto bread.</p>
<p>And yes, if you're wondering, you can make homemade mayo, and yes its just oil and egg (although you're welcome to throw some extra stuff in for flavor)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a good chemist either but mayonnaise has a ton of fat in it so that should be what is browning the bread and making it crunchy. Personally having tried both I’m still a butter person myself but to each their own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mayonnaise is primarily made from oil. It is perfectly usable as a substitute for frying if the egg protein and spices won't throw off the taste of whatever you're doing too much. I've used it for grilled cheese and bologna sandwiches.  You could fry taters in it etc.. It will just break down into oil when you heat it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mayo has two primary ingredients; fat (oil)and protein (egg).  The fat transfers heat to the bread, while the protein browns up nicely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
