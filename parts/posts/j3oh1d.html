		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difference comes down to pigments. Many blue birds, for example, don’t get their colour from a pigment, but from microscopic patterns in their feathers that reflect certain colours of light. Fish use pigments called chromatophores for their wide range of colours. Humans and other mammals use the pigment melanin for hair colour, which through combinations of its two forms, gives us the shades of red, tan, black, white, gray, silver and brown that you see in mammals. Melanin can’t produce cool colours like blue and green, so you don’t see them</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR because most mammals can’t even see green, stemming from a lack of advanced color vision due to our subterranean, twilight-dwelling lifestyle — whereas birds and reptiles have had the limelight for a long time.</p>
<p>I would go to correct the title as saying there are no green mammals at all. Sloths can technically look green, but this is due to the algae growing on their fur.</p>
<p>The fur of mammals gets its color from two melanin pigments: eumelanin and pheomelanin. Eumelanin is responsible for the dark browns and blacks, and pheomelanin is responsible for the reds and light yellows.</p>
<p>In the skin and fur of mammals, the process is simple: the interior is simply stained with pigment, produced from melanocytes:</p>
<p>Pigment does play a major part in the coloration of many birds and reptiles, but the primary mechanism is structure.</p>
<p>The feathers of many birds trap and use melanin, an otherwise black-ish pigment, in such a way as to absorb and scatter certain wavelengths of light.</p>
<p>Note that when the melanin is missing, such as in leucistic specimens, this scattering can’t happen and the bird is completely white:</p>
<p>But you were wanting to know about reptiles. This, in my opinion, is even cooler. Reptiles and a few other animals have taken the idea of structural coloration to an extreme by using chromatophores:</p>
<p>These are also pigment-containing structures, with the added twist of being neatly organized cells whose reflected color(s) can be easily determined by their shape and orientation.</p>
<p>Due to this user-friendly interface, the coloration of reptiles can be highly adaptable. Many reptiles alter the position and shape of their chromatophores over the course of their growth, but in some lizards this goes even further with their chromatophores intimately connected to their nervous system, giving them the ability to change color based on things like health, reproductive status, circadian rhythm, and even mood — which can be used to maximize sunlight reception, quickly camouflage or even communicate:</p>
<p>“Okay, I guess that explains how they have different colors,” you might state. “But why didn’t this level of coloration evolve in mammals?” For that, we look at their lifestyles and natural history.</p>
<p>Birds, most of the other dinosaurs, and even the aquatic ancestors before all of us, have spent most of their evolution in bright daylight. As such it would have helped to see things like</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>and most importantly, each other:</p>
<p>When the difference between safe and toxic food can be as small as a different color, and mates need to stand out in an already colorful world, rainbow vision is certainly advantageous. And because of the ever-increasing ability to see color, more colorful ways to grab attention can evolve. Birds often attract by sight, and many lizards attract by sight alone. The need to locate sources of sunlight indicated by ultraviolet colors would further necessitate advanced color vision.</p>
<p>As such, the range of colors visible to birds and reptiles usually look something like this:</p>
<p>Since you can see so many colors already, traits that exhibit brighter forms of coloration would be advantageous and selected for.</p>
<p>Now let’s go to mammals.</p>
<p>Our bright, glorious history doesn’t stretch very far. For the most part, it’s been rather inglorious, always in the shade of the larger, more flamboyant, more dangerous reptiles and dinosaurs. This was once the typical mammal habitat for the longest time:</p>
<p>Yuck. And because of the prevalence of those cantankerous Jurassic-Cretaceous megafauna, it of course wasn’t safe to go out in broad daylight. We spent most of our days underground and among leaf litter, and typically waited until dusk, dawn or nighttime to get really active.</p>
<p>In twilight conditions, normally bright colors aren’t really that bright anyway and the view is quite subdued. The difference between yellow and green isn’t as pronounced, and the strongest colors are usually shades of orange and blue. As long as you could see those colors, you might be good.</p>
<p>As a result, the color vision of the average mammal, even today, is some variation of</p>
<p>(This is also why orange or yellow makes a perfectly sufficient hunting camouflage in ‘green’ forests, for both big cats and humans!)</p>
<p>So even if a mammal had a means of being more colorful, it wouldn’t be selected for because it wouldn’t even be noticed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this limited range of colors isn’t going to be good for identifying food, so instead we evolved an advanced sense of smell, which we also used to identify mates. And then, because mammals primarily use scent for mating, visuals became an afterthought.</p>
<p>Even snakes, a commonly subterranean reptile, evolved from daylight-dwelling lizards and as such retained the chromatophore structure that gives many modern snakes bright colors.</p>
<p>But wait! The lifestyles of many mammals have changed since then. Aren’t there any mammals that currently live a niche very similar to birds and reptiles, in tropical forests or other bright areas? They have advanced color vision, right? What do they look like?</p>
<p>Well, it’s not quite green, but it’s definitely a use of bright colors outside the ‘yellow-tan-red’ spectrum. Perhaps one day mammals with advanced color vision might evolve skin with a greenish hue, but any wacky colors in hair itself would require either some drastic changes to the way hair is structured (actually not that far off, some moles have structural properties in their fur that give rise to iridescent fur), or the use of an entirely different pigment to dye the skin or fur (biliverdin, perhaps)?</p>
<p>In short our dull-colored nature is a relic of our dirty, dingy past.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
