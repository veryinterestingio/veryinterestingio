		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a doctor  and have done lots of reading in this area so can shed some light. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There is a neuroplasticity hypothesis of depression whereby as a response to stress our brains change at the cellular level in a dysfunctional way.  This has been demonstrated by studies in mice, brain imaging and postmortems of depressed patients. Namely these changes are:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>Reduced synapse (connection) formation between neurons</li>
<li>Loss of connections between existing neurons</li>
<li>Reduced formation of new neurons</li>
<li>Atrophy of existing neurons</li>
</ol>
<p>In the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. The prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain responsible for higher brain functions such as decision making, planning, concentration and personality development. The hippocampus is key in learning and memory, and has connections to the ventral tegmental area which is important in motivation and reward processes.</p>
<p>In the amygdala, which is responsible for the 'fight or flight' response, research has shown that there is actually an increase in synapse formation between neurons which may explain why anxiety is co-morbid with depression.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There has been research to show that anti-depressants can reverse the changes seen in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. The time it takes for anti-depressants to work is in parallel to the time course for the maladaptive neuroplastic changes to be reversed.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>TLDR; Yes there are bad changes associated with a depressed persons brain, yes antidepressants have been linked with a reversal to some of them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, here's an <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0269881119874461?journalCode=jopa#:~:text=Based%20on%20the%20results%2C%20depression,level%20of%20oxidative%20DNA%20damage." target="_blank">article</a> that shows how people that are depressed have increased DNA damage markers, inflammatory markers, and oxidative markers in the brain when compared to healthy individuals. Essentially making people that are depressed age faster than those that typically aren't. The study also shows that anti-depressents do decrease all of those markers which is great news.
Commenting on what others have already said though, the most helpful thing you can do is find a therapist and/or psychiatrist that you can trust and have them help you decide what the best thing is for you. Also, everyone's different and will react to anti-depressents in different ways, but for a large number of people it does help. It helps balance the chemistry out in your brain. Exercise, healthier diets, a bit of trusted and comfortable social interactions will all help tip the scales towards a healthier brain chemistry as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Memory loss also has a strong link stemming from stress. Stress is one of the singular most disastrous things for the human body. Stress can induce memory loss, appetite loss, hair loss, and much much more. There are some healthy forms of stress but mental stress is no joke. Please take care of yourself/selves everybody. On a personal note it helps me to remember that every and all emotions are just chemical reactions taking place. Therefore they’re controllable variables (to a large extent). No matter what you’re going through, things will get better</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
