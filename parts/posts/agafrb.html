		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The method isn't clear, as others have said, but there's a key difference - humans are weird, in that our muscle needs can change very quickly. There's a benefit to being able to build up muscle mass in one are as needed, then lose it when it's not needed. So if an early human had to spend a month travelling, by the end of it, they'd have strong legs. Then they need to build a shelter, and if the leg muscles remained, they'd take a lot of calories to maintain. So upper body muscles would build, lower body would fade. </p>
<p>It lets humans be efficient. </p>
<p>Bears, on the other hand, gonna bear. Their muscle needs are relatively consistent, so there's no good reason to have the muscles atrophy during hibernation - those bears that remain strong through hibernation would have a better chance at surviving than those who do not. </p>
<p>EDIT: a day later, 8000 upvotes, gold, and more people responding to &quot;bears gonna bear&quot; than I've ever had to anything else in my life. Thanks for helping me peak, Reddit!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We arent actually sure how this works. A common theory is that perhaps bears have increased neural activation of muscles during hibernation. Essentially, their muscles twitch a lot during hibernation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human beings have evolved over time to fluctuate their muscle mass based on how much physical activity they engage in. This is beneficial because it lets us adapt to our environment while also avoiding wasting resources maintaining muscles that serves no purpose. In our case, muscle atrophy is actually an advantageous trait.</p>
<p>Bears have evolved to retain their muscle mass regardless of hibernation, because it's more biologically expensive to create muscle than to maintain it. After every hibernation cycle, the bear will need its full strength relatively quickly and can't afford the time and cost to rebuild muscle. In the bear's case, muscle atrophy would be a disadvantageous trait.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is matter of much research and no full answer is known, but..it is true that despite both weight loss and non-use, bears maintain muscle mass to a much higher  degree then a would-be-hibernating human.</p>
<p>In humans lower  neural activation is a precursor  to  muscle mass retention.  One study suggests bears lack the mechanism that  alters muscle  mass in the absence of neural stimulation.</p>
<p>Other studies suggest that bears  can generate amino acids from uric acid (stuff if  the  pee they are  not  peeing out).   Yet others suggest that  shivering can serve.  Whats  also true is  that they utilize  fat stores so from an energy perspective it's  not that hard to explain how  they  <em>could</em> retain muscle mass by focusing energy  utilization on fat rather then what would happen if you or I  fasted without the other slowdowns associated with hibernation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
