		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would assume you took your smartphone with you when you went to the optometrist.  Your phone's location reported to Google's servers as having an extended stop at an optometrist, so their algorithms assumed you had an optometrist appointment.  Many people don't go to the optometrist unless they feel like they need to get their vision checked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Maps knows exactly where you've been, and when, and for how long. In fact, you don't even need to do that, just look at a Google Maps entry: it will usually tell you what time of day a place is busiest, and how long people spend there on average.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Google (and other companies) will employ a range of technologies (and combine them) to create an accurate and continually updated assessment of your purchase intent. It's possible to connect data from multiple services and types of hardware even if you're not logged in. Some examples of what is data mined:</p>
<ul>
<li>Geo location from your phone. They can tell if you visited a car dealership, for example, and deduce that you're about to make a big purchase. Why is this important? Because they'll spend way more money trying to influence you about a car purchase now that they know it's imminent. The way it works out is that they end up spending $1 on you before targeting but $10 on you after. Except it's less overall. Instead of spending $1m spamming ads at random times, or in random places hoping to catch whatever walks by, they can spend $250k on a smaller chunk of people who are way more likely to buy. Lower overall spend, more trying much harder per person, because they get great returns.</li>
<li>Search history from your browser. Obviously this will yield a metric fuckton of data about you, where you work, what your interests are, and your problems, medical info, and of course, your fappin' habits.</li>
<li>Microphone speech translated from your phone AND computer AND alexa, etc. This one is easy to test. Google it. </li>
<li>Transaction info from iwallet/android pay or whatever it's called. They can infer from this your income level and home address to within half a block. </li>
<li>Different lists from technologies like the above, but purchased from other collectors. You can compare two overlapping lists of consumers, validating duplicates and filling in the blanks when not a duplicate. Even if your data is anonymized it's possible to connect &quot;person x who lives on Broadway ave and makes 100k/y and likes to go to starbuck's every morning before work&quot;</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question. I was on a date, we were talking about the kind of music she likes (soul, jazz, classic) and told me she played traverse flute.
On my side, I sometimes listen to classic or jazz on YouTube but that's all. Never been to a concert or search for it on Google.
The very next day, I got two ads on Facebook. One for a jazz, soul and classic concert happening in a city nearby, the other offering courses to traverse flute players.
I've heard that phone are not supposed to tape conversations, but these kind of things are super strange! Any idea? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
