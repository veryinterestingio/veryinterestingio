		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pain is actually a very complex process. See, what you experience as pain happens in your brain, not your nerves.</p>
<p>Nociception (literally “harm perception”) is the process of a pain-sensitive nerve detecting a noxious stimulus and sending a message back to the brain. All peripheral nerves terminate at the spine, and pass the message on to the spine and up to the brain. But this doesn’t always result in “pain”.</p>
<p>Firstly, there’s what’s called the pain gate. This is a spinal mechanism whereby the spine shuts out one pain stimulus in favour of another - it’s why rubbing a wound lessens the pain. The spine is literally blocking a portion of the pain stimulus in favour of the less painful rubbing.</p>
<p>Secondly, there’s the brain itself. Whole PhDs have been written on this but the summary is the brain decides how much pain to feel based on context. Emotional state, prior experience, concentration and even language itself all have an impact on pain perception. It’s why an athlete might break their ankle but finish a race, while a person with a bad back experiences more pain when he’s having a bad day, or why injuries always seem worse at night when you have nothing else to focus on.</p>
<p>Pain tolerance is a mix of all these factors. Some people have alternative nociception pathways (there’s even a congenital syndrome wherein a person has none at all), some have excellent mental strategies for coping and some people literally just have better things to do. Some poor people have experienced something worse and can contextualise it differently. Pain is actually impossible to objectively measure - no two people will experience the same harmful event the same way.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Pain starts at nerve endings and sends an electrical signal to the brain. Someone with high tolerance could simply have less sensitive nerve endings, some sort of signal blockage, or different mental processing of the signal. Pain can also be missed / ignored like any other sensation because your body takes in <em>far</em> more information than it can actively feed your conscious mind.</p>
<p>ELI5: Let's imagine you touch a hot stove. There is a news station in your palm that starts a broadcast to HQ (your brain), asking for help. But maybe your news station has older, slower tech. Maybe the wires are frayed and the message gets distorted. Maybe HQ isn't tuned into that channel when the broadcast starts or they think the danger is exaggerated. In any of these cases you would have a weaker pain response. How much of that is software rather than hardware I don't know.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I don't know what changes take place in the body / mind while improving tolerance. Shot in the dark, but there is scientific backing for depression / anti-depressants affecting dopamine receptors which has an impact on how much you actually feel the effect of that chemical's release. Caffeine has a similar effect on blocking receptors meant to tell you when you're tired. I'll leave the proper ELI5 on that subject to someone with more secure understanding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You may be interested in <a href="https://youtu.be/1ylbrkstYtU" target="_blank">Lorimer Mosley’s</a> and others’ work on pain science in Australia.  It seems our brains play a huge role in our perception of pain.  Tissue damage is only part of our pain response.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some nice answers here. I’ll try to contribute on some additional pain mechanisms that haven’t been discussed. </p>
<p>There are 3 areas of pain: detection, transmission, and reception. Each of these can vary from person to person yet we lump it all into “pain tolerance”. </p>
<p>Peripherally, you can have heightened sensitization in your skin and many times that’s caused by inflammatory chemicals like prostaglandin. This is “detection” and I find nutrition, menthol topicals like IcyHot, and some NSAIDS do a good job here. </p>
<p>Transmission is from the spinal cord to the middle of the brain called the thalamus. It’s where your endorphins usually try to diminish pain. Some people make more of these than others. Your spinal cord also has some areas along the way that diminish pain sensation, called substantia gelatinosa. Opioids can affect these areas really well...sadly sometimes too well. Physical therapy can be helpful too. </p>
<p>Finally, from the thalamus to your outer brain, you have an inhibitory neurochemical called GABA. It is found in high concentrations surrounding your thalamus. I like to call it your “thalamic shield”, and it does what it sounds. The medications that can affect this? You might have heard of GABApentin or Lyrica (preGABAlin).</p>
<p>There are many more mechanisms but as far as simplifying the pain pathway, I like to use the 3 areas of pain and then understand why some things work well and some things don’t. </p>
<p>Then throw a total wrench in the whole equation when you bring in genetic predisposition as well as psychology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
