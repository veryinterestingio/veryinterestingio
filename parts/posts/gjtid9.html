		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like the actual moment they are emotionally hurt? When you get really bad news like being dumped or finding out something aweful a few things can happen. One, is a sudden burst of adrenaline and your fight or flight response being triggered which is why your hands become shaky and you have a physical sensation in your chest and stomach. Another is your blood pressure can drastically drop due to the emotional shock, and you feel dizzy like you may pass out. Kind of like people who pass out from needles, the needle doesnt physically cause any real damage or trauma but your psychological state being freaked out by them triggers a vaso vagal response and sudden drop in BP that can make you faint.</p>
<p>Severe emotional pain can trigger both of these to happen at nearly the same time immediately after finding out something shocking. Your BP dramatically drops, and your glands squirt out tons of adrenaline that isnt going anywhere because of the low BP. Its kind of sitting in place rather than spreading through the entire body like it should because your blood isnt flowing as much as normal. What can happen next is your BP corrects itself and catches back up and circulates that pool of adrenaline, giving your body basically a &quot;double shot&quot; of it all at once. This starts a feedback loop and the adrenaline raises your BP even more, causing your heart to race and beat like a motherfucker which will make you feel all kinds of physical sensations and do things like make your skin flush as extra blood is being pumped into the blood vessels near the surface of the skin, which has its own sensation.</p>
<p>Basically, bad news triggers a cascade of hormones and adrenaline that all do what theyre designed to do, but its happening suddenly and all at the same time at an abnormally high level.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An interesting tidbit to add here (though I can't recall details) is that the Peripheral Nervous System is deeply involved in emotional experience. I believe much of this has to do with the extensive innervation of your major organs (heart, lungs, digestive tract, etc) by the Vagus nerve. </p>
<p>That is to say, you literally process emotions with your entire body. Studies have shown that people with cervical spine injury/paralysis report less intense emotional responses.</p>
<p>I wish I could cite the specific studies here, but i bet someone else will beat me to it.</p>
<p>EDIT: I'm getting some push back on my claim, so here's an example study: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2633768/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2633768/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
