		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The density of pure ethanol is about 800 kg / m^3 , compared to 1000 for water. Humans are close to water in density.</p>
<p>So from a buoyancy perspective, swimming in ethanol would be like swimming with a lead weight 1/5th of your own weight. You'd find it difficult at best to not sink unless you wore a buoyancy aid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On top of the other answers, you would also be somewhat warmer than when swimming in water. </p>
<p>You can get cold quickly when swimming due to the high the thermal conductivity of water. The thermal conductivity of air is 0.026 and Water is 0.61, so water cools you down ~ 20X faster than air. Ethanol has a thermal conductivity of 0.17, so if you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it, your body temperature would actually drop ~ 3.5X slower than it would in a swimming pool of water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming you're moving everything at the same speed in either case, the ratio of the Reynold numbers in the alcohol to the Reynolds number in the water is </p>
<p>(ρ/μ)<em><em>alcohol</em></em>/(ρ/μ)<em><em>water</em></em>,</p>
<p>where ρ is the density and μ is the viscosity.</p>
<p>This works out to be about 0.66 for ethanol, if both the water and ethanol are at 70 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_crisis#/media/File:Drag_coefficient_on_a_sphere_vs._Reynolds_number_-_main_trends.svg" target="_blank">drag coefficient</a> for a generic blunt object like a body is pretty flat around the range of Reynolds numbers we're interested in (~10^(5)). So multiplying the Reynolds number by a factor of 0.66 probably doesn't change the drag coefficient much.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is buoyancy. The density of ethanol is lower than that of water, so your body is less buoyant in ethanol than in water, which means that you have to work harder to stay afloat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
