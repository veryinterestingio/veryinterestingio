Less muscle requiring less glucose. However, the paper also finds that men and women have near identical A1C levels which are the 3 month average blood glucose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This study isn't totally recent (2007), but might be a good place to start:</p>
<p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/92/9/3646/2598120" target="_blank">https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/92/9/3646/2598120</a></p>
<p>Notably:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has been known for a long time that women have lower plasma glucose and higher plasma FFA concentrations than men after short-term fasting (<a href="javascript:;" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank">4</a>–<a href="javascript:;" target="_blank">6</a>). However, despite extensive research on gender-related distinctions in glucose and lipid metabolism, these differences in plasma glucose and FFA concentrations have not been explained in full detail so far (<a href="javascript:;" target="_blank">7</a>–<a href="javascript:;" target="_blank">16</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We hypothesized that the relative protection from FFA-induced insulin resistance during fasting in women results from lower muscle ceramide or glucosylceramide levels due to lower muscle FFA uptake, subsequently resulting in higher muscle glucose uptake with lower plasma glucose concentrations.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lot of talk about differences in energy accessibility in here, and I would just like to remind everyone that the total amount of glucose in the bloodstream is tiny, generally between 3.5-8 grams total. A blood glucose measurement doesn’t say anything about the total storage (ie available energy). Glucose is not static in the blood. Like minerals in the bone it is constantly moving into the bloodstream from the liver and digestive tract, and moving out, primarily into skeletal muscle, the brain, and a minority of tissues which cannot oxide fats. The serum level is the just the steady state between those ins and outs.</p>
<p>In fact, if anything you would probably evolutionarily expect the sex with higher energy requirements to have lower serum glucose levels because of a higher ability to <em>remove</em> glucose out of the bloodstream and transport it into the brain and muscles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doesn’t answer OPS question but: does this mean if men have the glucose in their blood more, they store it less than women? Because the glucose is flowing in the blood and being used instead of just turning into fat?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
