		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you've ever seen those &quot;grandmaster plays 100 opponents simultaneously&quot; stories, it's because the past moves and mind games with the opponent aren't much of a factor. They make a move, forget what happened, and go to the next board.</p>
<p>A given board state often has a small handful of &quot;correct&quot; moves, so playing both sides yourself is an exercise in solving board states rather than exploiting an opponent's tendencies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For me, when I'm playing against someone else, I'm still planning moves against myself.  I'm always looking at it from my opponent's view and thinking what can I do here in response?  </p>
<p>Chess is not just about setting traps and hoping the opponent doesnt see them. It's about coming up with good moves that are hard to exploit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chess is a game of perfect information. Both you and your opponent can see the exact same state of the board. Like another post said, there’s usually a number of “correct moves” to make. So theoretically since you have the same information and there’s usually a few “correct moves” you should be able to figure out what your opponent might play even if there is another person playing.</p>
<p>So when you play by yourself, you kind of just attempt to figure out and work through the possible correct moves you can make for either side, similar to how a computer might analyze a chess position.</p>
<p>Contrast this with a game with hidden information like Poker or Stratego, knowing your opponents information completely ruins the dynamic of the game.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best chess players can anticipate their opponents move anyway, so not much difference, so in theory playing against yourself as a skilled player is the hardest game you will ever play. </p>
<p>Eitherway though it's more about practising strategies and giving you a look at what your opponent would do if they were you xD</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
