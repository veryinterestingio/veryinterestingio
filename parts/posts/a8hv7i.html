		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Muscle knots are tensed up bundles of muscles that feel like tough (like a knot) spots that may hurt only when applied pressure to or hurt all the time. They become “knots” because they are unable to return to their regular which causes the nervous system to treat them differently. </p>
<p>These are mostly caused by repetitive motion that stresses out a single muscle. Poor posture, stress induced tension etc are also common reasons for muscles to get knots. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Massage Therapist here. A &quot;knot&quot; usually refers to one of three basic muscular issues, either a) adhesions where tissues like muscle or fascia that are supposed to slide freely get stuck to each other instead, b) scar tissue formed after healing from a muscle tear, or c) trigger points caused by a handful of muscle fibers continuing to fire when the rest of the muscle is relaxed. From your description I'd expect you're experiencing both a) and c). I'd recommend seeing a professional therapist who specializes in medical or pain management massage for treatment if the pain is bad enough. Home care remedies include stretching and targeted, gentle exercise of problem muscles. I'd caution against using a theracane or massage ball because it's easy to overdo it and cause more damage in the long run</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The truth is that no one knows. The scientific community knows that there is something happening in the muscle that we call a &quot;knot&quot;, but that's as much as they know. Here's a link to a great article: <a href="https://www.painscience.com/articles/trigger-points-identity-crisis.php" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.painscience.com/articles/trigger-points-identity-crisis.php" target="_blank">https://www.painscience.com/articles/trigger-points-identity-crisis.php</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Surrounding our muscles is a dense connective tissue called Fascia. Fascia acts as a support mechanism to which helps to keep our muscles in place. This fascia can bunch up and restrict the  motion of the muscle underneath. This bunches up fascia is a “knot.”</p>
<p>In order to fix the tight fascia it must be manually massaged, a term known as Myofascial release. A common misconception is that stretching will help release the fascia; this is not accurate. The fascia must be broken apart manually with pressure in a circular or “J” motion before stretching the muscle. This is why when we get a massage we feel much looser, The fascial tissue loosens and detaches from the muscle and allows for the muscle to contract unhindered. </p>
<p>Ways to break down fascial tissue can be to pay for massages. Massages are very effective but can be expensive. More importantly, myofascial release must be done everyday in order to realize the full benefits. “Foam rollers” exist for the purpose of self massage. You can put it on the floor and use your own weight to break the fascia as you roll on top of it, this is called “Foam rolling.” Other devices that resemble rolling pins exist and are useful for getting the calf and legs if you don’t want to get on the ground. Lacrosse balls/ tennis balls are good for the upper back region- place against a wall and lean on it. Put a golf ball on the floor and roll the bottom of the foot to prevent plantar fasciitis. You can roll any muscle. </p>
<p>Foam rolling may be painful at first. This is normal. Most people don’t have well
Conditioned muscles and the fascia hurts when it’s broken apart. Press on thru the pain and it will subside the more you do it. Foam roll before you workout, stretch at the end. </p>
<p>As always, YouTube and google has ample info. Search “Myofascial release” and “ foam rolling techniques.”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nobody knows what they are or what causes them. But if you work a labour job repetitive or static effort could be playing a role. To prevent them I would suggest avoiding really strenuous postures, changing postures and take a break to stretch every now and then.</p>
<p>To treat them... Well for temporary relief many options work great, heat massage, etc.</p>
<p>But they will keep coming back unless you deal with the root cause.</p>
<p>For long term relief you need to do 2 things:</p>
<p>1) control abusive so your body in the ways mentioned above </p>
<p>2) get stronger, particularly if you have any muscle weakness or imbalances that are part of the issue</p>
<p>If it continues it wouldn't hurt to go see a physiotherapist. They will be able to detect any muscle imbalances and give you exercise to strengthen any weaknesses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
