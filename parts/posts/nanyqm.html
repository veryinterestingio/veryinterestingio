		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you had the flu? Im not sure I would call that response measured. The immune system isnt conscious and responds in an almost mechanical way to challenge, with tissue damage and organ dysfunction often being the collateral damage to clearing what is perceived as an infection. The extent of of the damage to host tissue usually depends on the extent of the threat. For instance bacteria in the blood stream, even if the bacteria is not particularly harmful, will result in sepsis -  widespread immune activation that progresses to loss of blood pressure, global edema, organ failure and death within hours. Viral sepsis can also occur.</p>
<p>But the question about immune reaction to environmental antigens is a good one, and not one that biomedical science has a good answer for. The rate of allergies is on the rise, and correlates very well with industrialized living. A 70s french study found significantly higher rates of asthma in city raised children compared to rural children and since then this has been replicated in any number of ways. Clean living is definitely part of the problem, and it seems to have something to do with our microbiota and early childhood (children delivered by C-section, which are not immediately colonized by the mother's microbiome, have higher rates of allergies and asthma and the same goes for children who arent breastfed and therefore do not pick up bacteria from the mother's skin).</p>
<p>Why specific allergies develop is also unclear. Every time we eat we introduce foreign substances into our bodies which the immune system tolerates. This is in part due to the requirement for multiple signals for immune activation, ie it is not enough for the immune system to encounter 'non-self', the encounter must also be accompanied by a signal that this is an infection - bacterial cell wall components, double stranded RNA (virus), evidence of tissue damage or cell death, and so on. The gut mucosa in particular is a 'tolerigenic' environment, rich in regulatory T cells, a type of immune cell that suppresses inappropriate immune responses and induces tolerance of antigens that don't appear to be dangerous. A few recent papers have hypothesized that food allergies (or other environmental allergies) are developed when a particularly immuno-stimulatory but otherwise benign antigen is encountered at the same time as something else that is causing tolerance to be broken.</p>
<p>For instnce, if you eat pad thai, which contains eggs and peanuts, it is usually no problem. But if one day the eggs happen to be laced with invasive salmonella, then as you are processing your noodles the immune system will detect infection and the regulatory T cells will allow an immune response to mount in order to stop the bacteria. In this context, it is possible to develop a response against peanut antigen as well. Similarly, if you encounter some sort of pollen while dealing with a respiratory infection, you may develop allergy to the pollen.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>TL;DR: there are mechanisms in place to prevent reaction to non-pathogenic antigens but these systems are weakened by industrialized living and can be broken if non-pathogenic antigen is encountered in the context of infection or injury.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’d echo everything u/dirtymirror said - I think the T cell balance, especially with regards to regulatory T cells, is a very important part of this question. Its also important to consider not just environmental determinants but also genetic determinants. So that explains why allergies occur, why they may be increasing, and why they occur at higher rates in certain parts of the world or amongst certain demographic groups.</p>
<p>However, the immune response to the flu is characteristically different than the immune response that causes anaphylaxis. Sure, your immune system can get out of hand during active infection just like with allergy, but the two utilize different arms of the adaptive immune system to different extents. Allergy primarily occurs through hyper-activation or inappropriate activation of IgE antibodies, leading to release of histamine from mast cells. Histamine then causes allergy symptoms. This response tends to be more mediated during influenza infection, but there are many other branches of adaptive immunity that kick in during this active infection, such as IgG/IgA/IgM antibodies activating complement, cytotoxic T cells, all the cytokines leading up to that, etc. I’m not saying viruses don’t lead to IgE production - they certainly do - but my understanding is that it may not be the first thing people think of when it comes to viral infection, but it is when it comes to allergy. Regulatory T cells are important, as B cells must be not only activated but also class-switched from IgM production to IgE production by activated T cells, and regulatory T cells should normally be providing tolerance when it comes to activation of T cells reactive to harmless environmental antigens. But it seems clear that something is going wrong with this tolerance leading to allergy, and it’s occurring at higher incidence every year, particularly in cleaner, wealthier areas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The immune system fights off different invaders  in, slightly different ways. Allergy is reaction to a protein vs cold/ flu is virus/bacteria.</p>
<p>Allergens largely trigger histamine release which causes the severe symptoms we can see eg swelling, itching, anaphylaxis.</p>
<p>But having the flu instead triggers cytokines to the site of the invader (usually nose) which fights and flushes it out with white blood cells at front lines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would add that the antibody response mediated by IgE seems to have been originally designed to fight multi-cellular pathogens, like helminths. If you'll excuse the analogy, it's more like fighting an elephant than weeding your garden. A response to a virus includes killing and cleaning up after the individual cells that are infected (roughly). A worm is much bigger than the white blood cells sent after it, so the response is more like throwing bombs at it, which we may see as an overreaction when the same response is used in response to pollen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
