		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn’t a comprehensive answer, but maybe a piece of the answer. When you wear clothing outside on a sunny day, it dramatically reduces but does not completely eliminate exposure to UV on those parts of the body. Some light and UV does penetrate and hit your skin, dependent on the material, thickness, and color of the clothing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why do black and brown people have brown skin in regions not exposed to sunlight? </p>
<p>Same thing. Freckling is just a particular skin types ‘strategy’ for distributing melanin. Freckling is more prominent in areas exposed to sun because exposure to UVB stimulates melanin production, but everyone has some baseline level of melanin production.</p>
<p>Alternatively, what <em>you</em> may be seeing and calling freckles are in fact nevi or moles. Some families carry a trait that causes the expression of dozens of moles all over the skin with such a broad distribution they can look a bit like freckles, but upon closer inspection you’ll see that they’re raised instead of flat like freckles. Moles are melanocyte dysplasia or irregular growth. Melanocytes make melanin and dysplasia is called dysplasia because it happens whether exposed to stimulus (sunlight) or not. The melanin makes them dark, but they show up with or without sun because that’s just how those cells are programmed. They are not all cancerous or even mostly but people with this condition need to be screened yearly by a dermatologist because any of these moles can transform .</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The ones on my arms over the years were all fine but it was the one on my stomach that was pre-melanoma.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
