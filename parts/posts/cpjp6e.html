		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The British wanted to get a port in China, for strategic reasons.  The Chinese didn't want to give them one, for the same reasons.  The British sold opium (from their colony in India (another long story)) to China.  Without another source, the Chinese agreed to lease a port to Britain for 150 years.  The port was called Hong Kong.</p>
<p>After 155 years, the lease was up and Britain returned Hong Kong to China.  HK was inhabited by rich, educated people that don't want to give up their freedoms because of some contract signed in the 1800s.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lived in HK and studied this relationship first hand. Like, was only there to understand it. I won't speak to the opium wars since other people have done a really thorough job of that but I'll give you the 411 on recent events.</p>
<p>HK is a port city with its own culture due to the opium wars and being a British colony. When they were handed over, China was told not to touch the country as it was for 50 years. Slowly China started flexing its muscle, starting with making it easier to go to HK with a visa and overstay, to removing Cantonese in favor of mandarin, to stating that the political leaders need to be picked by Beijing. The last one was what got the Hong Kong citizens riled up. They started with the 2014 umbrella protests and motions to secede have increased in recent years.</p>
<p>The latest round of protests have begun after what is called the extradition bill was passed along &quot;criminals&quot; in Hong Kong to be tried in Chinese courts. The people of Hong Kong know that if you go to a Chinese court for civil disobedience, that's probably the end of your days as a free person. Now you have the protest with China flexing its full might.</p>
<p>The problem on the Hong Kong side is that they don't really have a leg to stand on in this fight, they either fight or they get crushed in time because their special status is one of the main reasons that their economy has been so good. It's a liberalized port city where you don't need to deal with Chinese officials. If that protection goes, hk is no longer different from any other port city in China. The more they protest, they will lose businesses due to political unrest. It's an uneasy time and it's a shame, but it was always bound to happen with the state of things since the return to China, and everyone always knew it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Back in the day, around the 1820s and for centuries before that, China was the largest economy in the world.  They sent out far more than they took in and they had major economic power.</p>
<p>About 1840, Britain wanted to import opium into China.  China, naturally, said no.</p>
<p>So the UK went to war with the Chinese and forced them to open up and allow the English to sell their opium to the vast number of Chinese.  This, of course, led to the downfall of the Chinese economy, with their numbers dropping by half by the 1860s.  </p>
<p>This led to the Chinese having to open up unfavorable trading pacts with many parts of the West, just to get by.  Their government was greatly weakened and eventually civil war broken out.  </p>
<p>The Chinese were forced to give up Hong Kong to British rule as a result as well.  </p>
<p>By the time the civil war came to a close, the British and French had forced the new Chinese government to legalize the opium trade, give the two Western powers 10 more port cities and greatly expand the export of their own people in the form of cheap labor.  Coolies.  </p>
<p>The Opium Wars were probably the worst thing to happen to China in the last 500 years or so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I remember in the history that I learned in college, British actually banned the usage of Opium on their own citizens. However, like big companies today, they needed to find a way to maintain their profit. So, China became their target. The British govt, maybe the queen, decided to keep their eyes close. Below is a quick Google search from Wiki.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1839, the Daoguang Emperor appointed scholar-official Lin Zexu to the post of Special Imperial Commissioner with the task of eradicating the opium trade.[70] Lin wrote an open letter to Queen Victoria questioning the moral reasoning of the British government. Citing what he understood to be a strict prohibition of the trade within Great Britain, Lin questioned how Britain could declare itself moral while its merchants profited from the legal sale in China of a drug that was banned in Britain. He wrote: &quot;Your Majesty has not before been thus officially notified, and you may plead ignorance of the severity of our laws, but I now give my assurance that we mean to cut this harmful drug forever.&quot;[71] The letter never reached the Queen, with one source suggesting that it was lost in transit.[72] Lin pledged that nothing would divert him from his mission, &quot;If the traffic in opium were not stopped a few decades from now we shall not only be without soldiers to resist the enemy, but also in want of silver to provide an army.&quot;[73] Lin banned the sale of opium and demanded that all supplies of the drug be surrendered to the Chinese authorities. He also closed the Pearl River Channel, trapping British traders in Canton.[29] As well as seizing opium stockpiles in warehouses and the thirteen factories, Chinese troops boarded British ships in the Pearl River and South China Sea before destroying the opium on board.[74][75]&quot;</p>
<p>As you know the result. Hong Kong Island was actually given to British, while Kowloon &amp; NT were &quot;leased&quot; for 99 years. But in the early 90's when the two govts started talking about the future of the city, British decided to release the ownership of HK Island and return it back to China along with Kowloon and NT.</p>
<p>Correct me if I was wrong.</p>
<p>I was born in mid-70's and grow up in Hong Kong, and now live in SF. I was one of the regular HK people who witnessed the exchange of the power in the mid-night of June-30 in 1997. I have a lot in my mind about the &quot;events&quot; in the past few years, but I decided to keep mostly silent on social medias. While I am sure the HK govt has been doing a shity job, and the living of HK people are getting more and more difficult (my parents and brother are still living there), I do not agree on these kind of non-peaceful protests. Hope you all could open your eyes and read the stories from both side.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The British love tea. The only supply of tea at that time was China. The Chinese didn't want to sell their tea to the British for silver, as they didn't really need it. So the British merchants came up with a triangle trade: export textiles from British textile mills (they were the world's best at that time) to India and sell it for opium, then take the opium to China and sell it for tea then take the tea back home and sell it for big profit. The Chinese opposed this plan of course, because drug lords, but in the end agreed to lease HK to the British after the British navy sailed up the Pearl River and shot up some Qing troops in the name of free trade. (Bonus fact: some of the biggest conglomerates in HK today - called Hongs - are descendants of the original drug cartels.)</p>
<p>Britain then governed HK for the next 150 years or so then gave it back at the end of the lease. Since 1997, China and Hong Kong have existed in an uneasy but mutually beneficial relationship. Recent Chief Executives however have stalled on promised democratic reforms, possibly spooked by mass protests in 2014 as &quot;Occupy [something]&quot; was a global fad, which has lead to resentment and dissatisfaction (possibly as Mainland Chinese grew increasingly wealthy relative to Hong Kong citizens).</p>
<p>The current HK government tried to introduce a new law without following due process, that may have meant sending people across the border to the Mainland, which lead to the fear and initial mass peaceful demonstrations. Violence between the police and protesters has escalated and the government has been not really responding, allowing the situation to escalate to now and people getting hurt and the Mainland getting frustrated with the situation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
