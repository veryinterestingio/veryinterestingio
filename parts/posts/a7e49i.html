		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The liver does a lot of things. There are lots of biochemical reactions you need to survive which takes place in the liver. The liver does not actually filter out toxins but it changes it to other less toxic chemicals that can either be metabolized or filtered out by the kidneys. But this is just a small part of the biochemical reactions taking place. The liver produce proteins, a lot of the hormones, bile, insulin, etc. A lot of these biochemical processes is what actually requires the vitamins and minerals you need so the liver is where you find the biggest concentrations of these.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if animals eat that first - I know animals will eat fatty tissues first, as they're the most calorie dense. But if anything, the liver is high in iron content, which iron is a precious resource in the body. Your liver processes dead blood cells so it can strip out and recycle the iron to make new blood cells, and the heme (the proteins that surround the iron) is discarded down the bile duct (and is hence forth regarded as bile pigment), since it's going to the intestines anyway. This is what makes your poop brown. If you have diarrhea, you can have white poop when the first solid matter travels down the intestinal tract so fast it doesn't pick up any pigments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The liver stores glycogen in a stable form, which increases the energy value by raising insulin and helping the carnivore store more of their meal as fat and survive longer in a famine. Glycogen in muscles quickly gets burned up by rigormortis, so carnivores learned that when they found a carcass to get the liver before another animal does since the muscles may or may not still be good. Kidneys also store some glycogen but the liver has much more so its the highest value. Also its pretty prominent and right up top when they open the abdominal cavity so its an easy grab, everything else is takes more pulling and tearing or is behind ribs or full with digested food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
