		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Virtual particles should not be considered to be &quot;real&quot; particles, but it's complicated. The most obvious reason is that they don't need to obey the energy-momentum relation,</p>
<ul>
<li>m^(2)c^(2) = E^(2)/c^(2)-p^(2)</li>
</ul>
<p>which all &quot;real&quot; particles have to by definition. But we can say more: When say two particles interact, their interaction is a terribly complex thing to deal with which usually cannot be solved for exactly. But we have a technique, called perturbation theory, which pull out the most important behavior and gives us an infinite sum of understandable terms each one capturing some aspect of the full interaction.</p>
<p>An analogy would be summing frequency modes that make up a complicated wave, or using a Taylor series to describe some function. So let's say we scatter two electrons off each other, </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B8ller_scattering" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B8ller_scattering</a></li>
</ul>
<p>you'll often see Feynman diagrams like these. The two electrons exchange a virtual photon and bounce off.</p>
<p>In certain situations, this single Feynman diagram captures almost all of the interaction. But it's not the entire interaction. What about exchanging two virtual photons? That diagram is included too. What about a virtual photon which has a little e+e- pair which briefly shows up before collapsing back into a photon? In real life, this diagram should be added as well. So if we scatter electrons, and you insist that virtual particles exist, then you must acknowledge that <em>which</em> virtual particles exist is indeterminant.</p>
<p>The point is that the full interaction sums across all possible diagrams and the hope of perturbation theory is that as the internal combinations of virtual particles becomes more complicated, they become less important. So even if we need to sum an infinite number of such interactions, only the first few are needed to get the gist of the effect. This isn't always true, and thus nonpertubative approaches might be needed and in those techniques, virtual particles never actually show up.</p>
<p>Now with all that said, there is a mechanism to &quot;promote&quot; a virtual particle to a real particle. The main ingredient to accomplishing this is allowing the virtual particle to actually travel a long distance in space. The farther the particle has to travel to complete the interaction, the more &quot;real&quot; it has to be... and the closer to,</p>
<ul>
<li>m^(2)c^(2) ~ E^(2)/c^(2)-p^(2)</li>
</ul>
<p>being true it has to be. This is really easy to interpret using Feynman diagrams, all you have to do is cut the diagram in half such that virtual particle lines now must become external lines. External lines are the observable particles. Another way of thinking about this is drawing the virtual particle line to be really really long. This is effectively the same thing where now the almost real internal particle leaves the 1st interaction to become the incoming line of a 2nd interaction. A physical example of this is star light being absorbed by your eyes. That photon has had to propagate such an incredible distance that it is indistinguishable from a real particle (you can say it's energy uncertainty from Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is basically zero). But nobody talks this way, we just call such photons real.</p>
<p>A more technical example would be the production of charm or strange mesons from hadron collisions. Such mesons (quark-antiquark pairs) which have charm or strange quarks inside them can be produced by photon-nucleon scattering. But there's an issue: nucleons only have up and down quarks. How do we produce the J/psi meson which has a charm and anti-charm if the ingredients (a photon and a proton or neutron) don't have these quarks? In a sense, when we make particles like the J/psi, we are &quot;making real&quot; virtual quarks. A similar argument can be made for when a photon scatters off an atom and produces an electron-positron pair. The virtual pair has been &quot;made real.&quot; This kind of language can be used precisely because we're taking what otherwise would have been a Feynman diagram with internal virtual particles and chopping it up so the internal lines must now be outgoing particles which are real. So to answer your question explicitly: If you isolate a &quot;virtual particle&quot; it is no longer virtual, but a real particle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is yes, at least in some sense. You might want to take a look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwinger_effect" target="_blank">Schwinger effect</a>. One interpretation is that in a <em>really</em> strong electric field, you should be able to isolate vacuum electron-positron pairs. But it turns out to be extremely difficult, so it is not possible to verify the effect with current technology (thanks to ultra high energy laser experiments like the ELI it might be possible in the future though).</p>
<p>Bonus fact: Theoretically, you should also be able to do this with virtual black holes. This leads to some interesting gedanken experiments. But the technology to actually do that is outside the realm of what we can even dream of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
