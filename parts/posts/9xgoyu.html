		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not expected to be a universal extinction event, the impact will depend on your location and your dependence on certain resources.</p>
<p>If you, say, live near the coast, your home and the industry used to support you will likely be flooded by rising sea levels, and life is going to suck for you. If you depend on some sort of animal that doesn't like vast temperature levels, your life, again, will suck. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf</a></p>
<p>This gives a summary, which I strongly recommend you read. </p>
<p>In terms of a broad overview, they give four likely scenarios.
RCP2.6 : 1C
RCP4.5 : 1.8 C
RCP6.0 : 2.2 C
RCP8.5 :3.7 C</p>
<p>RCP 2.6 is the most optimistic average temperature rise where we abandon all carbon production or store as much as we make, RCP 8.5 is the worst case scenario.</p>
<p>To give perspective, during the Pleistocene glaciation 20,000 years ago the global temperature was 4 C lower. 4 C is pretty bad for us.</p>
<p>We expect several things to happen.</p>
<p>Mass extinctions of a lot of animals and plants that can't adapt to climate change.
Heat waves (because it's hotter).
Mass migrations (because people's homes get hotter and flooded)
Most areas will have lower crop and fish yields.
Intense competition over water and food.
Economic issues.</p>
<p>So, humanity won't be under extinction level threat, just a huge number of people will have worse lives or die. If we do sharply reduce our carbon dioxide production, much less of this will happen.</p>
<p>These are global issues. Local areas mighty be luckier. A region might, say, have lower average temperatures for some reason. Of course, that does play into the competition over food and water issue. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how much of the food web is disrupted by the changes. There isn't evidence that the thermal changes themselves would make the whole planet inhospitable to human biology, ecology however may greatly simplify in the process, as many organisms ranges change.</p>
<p>How much the food web will potentially collapse is a difficult question to answer. At least one paper suggests <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2006/11/seafood-biodiversity/" target="_blank">ocean fishery</a> collapse by midcentury, but that is in part due to human consumption, not just climate change. There are also a lot of organismal interactions that didn't exist before for example, <a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/06/150601-ghost-moose-animals-science-new-england-environment/" target="_blank">Moose did not evolve with ticks</a>.</p>
<p>The optimistic view is that even in a near full food web collapse, some tribes of humans will survive. The more optimistic one is we don't burn all the rest of the fossil fuel at current rates.</p>
<p>As for time scales, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/15/stephen-hawking-predictions-human-extinction-to-global-warming.html" target="_blank">Hawking predicted</a> we need to get off the planet within 1000 years or risk extinction, but most people don't have a good estimate, there are quite a few variables and a good number of scenarios suggest someone gets through.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not so much as an extinction as a massive increase in instability- food supplies, some regions becoming unlivable, animal extinction events- these will all compound on woefully unprepared nation-states.</p>
<p>The fear isn't that we are all going to die (which is a moderately 1st world anxiety) it's that one half of the planet is going to kill the other half so that it can survive. And the clearest example of that starting to bubble up is the recent caravan event on the US-Mexico border- soldiers of one state moving to 'control' refugees from another state- will events like this become massacres or will they resolve peacefully? As they become more common the probability for either goes up. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
