		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1) Neurotransmitters in the brain do not cross the blood brain barrier.  A blood test cannot be done.  </p>
<p>2) Neurotransmitters do different things depending on where in the brain they are present.  Blood serum levels would be mostly irrelevant.  </p>
<p>3) We do not know what neurotransmitters actually correlate with depression, or what levels &quot;should be.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Blood has nothing to do with this as we’re dealing with neurotransmitters</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The chemicals for which you are referring are neurotransmitters which are released and absorbed in synapses of nerves.  A blood test would test for chemicals floating around in the blood stream.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the moment, we have no biomarkers for depression— biomarkers being things like proteins or chemicals in the blood that we could measure and detect through routine lab tests. Depression is, by and large, a clinical diagnosis— in other words, it’s diagnosed based on a physician’s high degree of suspicion based on the patient’s symptoms and reported experiences.</p>
<p>Hell, at the moment, we’re still lacking imaging tests that would help diagnose depression as well.</p>
<p>As for your final question— there are tons (TONS) of different medications used to treat depression at the moment. Different people respond differently to different drugs. A medication that may work as a miracle in one depressed patient may do nothing in another patient, or even make their symptoms worse.</p>
<p>tl;dr depression is an extremely complex biomedical issue. Our current technology limits our capacity to diagnose and treat it</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
