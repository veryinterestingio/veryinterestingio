		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tumbler locks tend to have 5 or 6 pins.  Let's say 6.  The question then is how many distinct pin positions they can have.  Let's say 8.   That would give a total number of unique keys as 8^6 or about a quarter of a million.  This ignores different lock designs and such, but still, you can see it's actually a remarkably low number and many lock manufacturers have probably made well in excess of a million locks.</p>
<p>So yeah, just based on the odds there are probably lots of other locks out there your keys will open.  Good luck finding them.</p>
<p>EDIT: I understand that keys have physical restrictions that mean you don't really have the full range of possible positions on every pin.  I was trying to set a reasonable upper bound, not come up with an actual accurate estimate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many locks and their keys are standards. For example, in the US, an estimated 75% of recreational vehicles use a CH751 key. If you own an RV, it is likely that the key for lock you use to gain access to your vehicle will work in another. </p>
<p>Filing cabinets, desks, and many other small locks use a limited number of keys. I used to run a charity, and we had locking steel filing cabinets donated to us without keys. It was simple and inexpensive to look up the lock number, and order new ones on-line. </p>
<p>Lock standards like this are cheaper for manufacturers. The chances that any one lock and its key has a duplicate is much greater than chance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Locks provide a certain degree of comfort to a resident but are unlikely to actually deter anyone who really wants to enter your home.

<p>In reality, it's not just the limited number of tumbler combinations. A poorly made or worn-out lock will allow <em>close</em> positions to open it. So yes, it's definitely been known to happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
