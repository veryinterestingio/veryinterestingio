		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are specific muscles around the bladder that is generally used. However a muscle needs leverage. So you can make them work better by increasing the pressure in your abdomen by using all the other muscles around your stomach. Even pushing down on your belly makes you pee faster. However some of these muscles help with breathing in a similar mechanism. So you may have to hold your breath to force the pee out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few muscles, but particularly the detrusor (bladder muscle), the diaphragm (breathing muscles), and the abdominal wall muscles. </p>
<p>Think of it this way - the more a balloon fills up with air, the faster and harder air leaves it. That's the bladder and the detrusor muscle. But what happens once it starts to deflate? The rate of air leaving the balloon slows down a bit. Increasing pelvic pressures by taking and holding a deep breath, as well as bearing down with the abdominal wall muscles (core) can increase the pressure in the bladder (squeezing the balloon).</p>
<p>Strangely, we also have to relax the pelvic muscles to poop and pee. There is a form of urinary dysfunction in which someone finds it difficult to urinate but nothing is truly blocking urine, it's just that their pelvic muscles are so tight that they hamper the stream!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially, the detrusor (sp?) muscle that is connected to the bladder. When the bladder is being filled/full, the muscle is relaxed, and it can be engaged to put pressure on the bladder, and thus force the liquid out quicker.</p>
<p>There may be more to it, but thats all I remember from Anatomy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
