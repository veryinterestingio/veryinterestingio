		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Remember that cards are printed in large sheets and then cut.  If you want to make just 52 cards, your closest option to making them square is 4x13.  With 54 cards, you can print a 6x9 sheet which has much more manageable dimensions.  Many decks these days are printed on 7x8 sheets giving you 56 cards in the pack.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Im more amazed there are people who've never used jokers in a card game.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While most of the card games we play today dont require the jokers, most of the older games included them.</p>
<p>Games nobody really plays anymore because we made better ones, which just so happen to require equal numbers of cards in a type.</p>
