<p>They are studied heavily, and though it's hard to say what the ultimate cause is, the ELI5 seems to be that it occurs most often with words that we think of as a unit, rather than separate. Things like &quot;ketchup and mustard&quot;, &quot;barn door&quot;, etc - they are usually spoken together. Our brains and mouths seem to get out of sync and we end up replacing the first syllable of each.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human brains are lazy. Because of this laziness, most people only process English language as much as they need to: enough for day to day speech. Generally, the brain gives more importance to the letters and syllables towards the beginning and towards the end of the word. Which is why it’s relatively easy to read shit like  <a href="https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/07070543/Sceince-Explain-Our-Reading-Brain1.jpg" target="_blank">https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/07070543/Sceince-Explain-Our-Reading-Brain1.jpg</a> When one thinks of a word they would like to say, the brain usually fires off the first letter correctly then sorta expects the rest of the word to flow out naturally as saying the first syllable is often enough to remind most people of the remaining syllables in the word. However when one tries to craft a more complex sentence, the brain has to think further than the first syllable of the word and this is where people can become tripped up. In my eyes, this looks like an individual who has thought of the sentence they want to say before they do: blah blah mustard and ketchup blah blah and then once satisfied that they have a correct sentence to say they have begun the process of using their mouth to say the words they have just thought of. One small problem, they have already forgotten what order the mustard and ketchup are in and because one of the key first letters needs to be said before a word can commence, a Hail Mary attempt to correct for forgetting the order comes out at the 11th hour as the individual is speaking. This likely impacts the confidence of the individual speaking so as they speak they are freaking out that they forgot the order of the words. The anxiety of messing up their sentence combined with the Hail Mary attempt to correct it is what causes the individual to utter one of the key first letters and hope that correct following syllables will come out of their mouth. However, because saying the first letter does not guarantee the brain will correctly fill in the rest of the word on the fly, we can observe the effects of it failing to do so in this case.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to realize but your brain has lag when it comes to controlling and rceiving answers from your body.</p>
<p>That lag is short but it can be long enough to cause you to stumble for example when you expect a stair step and it's not there.</p>
<p>Well when you think those words your brain uses a fast track for them because you're used to sending them together.</p>
<p>If your mouth is already in movement or Another thought that was NOT on the fast track comes along they collide (ELI5 people, I know it's a LOT more complicated than that).</p>
<p>The order is still queued but now there's interference so what comes out of your motor cortex is sometimes back to front or like your example swapped 1st a 4th syllables get swapped.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
