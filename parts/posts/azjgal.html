		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>CEO: usually the person who is the public face of the company and has executive authority. The highest rank of the C-level directors, thus the COO, CFO, CTO all report to the CEO. They are responsible for the health and long term strategy of the company. In this biggest firms they report to a board of directors.</p>
<p>COO: Chief operating officer. They handle the day-to-day affairs and problems and work on strategy on the very short term - typically just in operations. For example in a manufacturing firm they focus on getting the actual product made and out the door, not on the sales or marketing side.</p>
<p>Other roles exist like chief financial officer, who handles and manages the money side, or chief technology officer who manages the IT/Tech people need to do their job. (edit: or the CIO, see good comments below for details)</p>
<p>Usually VPs are directors of certain divisions - VP of sales,  VP of new product development, VP of marketing. They focus on that specific area and report to the CEO or COO, depending on the company.  Sometimes in a smaller company or flatter organization, the COO may actually be the VP of operations, etc.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Companies are owned and controlled by the people who put up money to get them started.  In a private (ex: family) company, this is also usually the one who runs it.  The traditional term for this is President.</p>
<p>However, many companies have lots of owners.  A private tech startup might have 3-4 big investors who all put up a slice of the company’s starting money.  A large public corporation might have thousands or millions of little shareholders.  Well, who gets to run it in that case?  How do the other investors know that person won’t do something stupid and screw them?</p>
<p>The answer is a kinda-democracy, called a Board of Directors.  Usually investors get a number of votes roughly equal to how much money they put in.  Sorta like a tiny Congress.  There might typically be 3-10 people on the Board, with larger investors having multiple seats, like a political party.</p>
<p>The <em>board</em> then votes to elect a CEO.  This is the most important distinction that most in the thread are missing.  The CEO could be the largest investor, or could be the original founder, or could be just some person from outside that the Board hires. But the point is that they work for the Board, and the Board can always vote to fire them.</p>
<p>It’s confusing because these days, people like the sound of the term “CEO, “ and you get a lot of self-employed, or small business owners, or private companies with no Board calling themselves “CEO.”  Some will even say “President and CEO,” which well... it’s not like there are any laws against it, but is still a bit silly in a small company, because with no investor governing structure those are literally the same thing.</p>
<p>In companies with an actual Board, they also usually elect a leader (like the Speaker of a Congress or Parliament) that sets the votes and the agenda of the Board meetings.  It’s generally considered good practice if this is a different person than the CEO, so that if the CEO screws up, the Board can vote to fire them.  If they are also Chairman, they can just... never hold that vote, so that makes them extremely powerful.</p>
<p>But given powerful Founders usually are also the largest investors, and therefore have the most votes, they can also often get themselves voted both Chairman and CEO, and it becomes much, much harder to fire them.  Extreme examples of companies like this are Facebook, where Zuckerberg has permanent majority votes on the Board and therefore literally cannot be fired.  Ever.  He would have to quit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
