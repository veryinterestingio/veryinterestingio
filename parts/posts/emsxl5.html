So if you go to the gym and work out why does it seem to dissolve over time if you don't continue working out?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body doesn't only reduce muscle mass when something is wrong or if you're starving. </p>
<p>It also does this for muscles that aren't used as often to save energy. Why spend the nutrients/energy to sustain a big muscle if you never use it?</p>
<p>This is called atrophy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If you consume excess calories, it keeps them around as fat.  If you are less active, it decides it is a waste to spend extra calories to keep muscles you aren't using around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Almost everything in your body works in a dynamic balance. At any given point in time, your body is both building things and destroying things. The end result is just about where the balance is tilted. If you are using a muscle you are actively telling your body I like my muscle as it is please maintain balance, if you're working out you're telling it this is weak I need more force (because of resistance training - the struggle to lift heavy weight) so tilt the balance to building and here have some signals to do so, and if you're sedentary doing nothing and not even using your muscles much, you're saying I don't need this, I'll stop sending signals to build, which allows the balance to tip to atrophy since it's the better way to conserve energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
