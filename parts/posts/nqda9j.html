		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light from a star is combination of light of many wavelengths. A hotter star produces more low-wavelength high-energy photons, which are more on the blue/violet/ultraviolet end of the spectrum. However, it also produces lots of infrared/red/orange/yellow/green photons. The colour you see is a mix of all these wavelengths.</p>
<p>The Sun actually has its peak emission in green light (although there's some semantic issues in defining peak emission, but that's not critical here). But it produces enough red, orange, and yellow that these all combine to look sort of yellow-white.</p>
<p>A really hot star might have a peak in the violet, but it produces so much over the rest of the ROYGBIV spectrum that it ends up looking white or bluish instead, depending on how hot it is.</p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Solar_spectrum_en.svg" target="_blank">Here</a> is a nice pic from wikipedia showing the Sun's emission. You can see the Sun emits light all across the whole visible range.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If a star was emitting a lot of purple light it would <em>also</em> be emitting a lot of blue light, just because of how blackbody radiation works. Human eyes are way more sensitive to blue than purple so we'd see it as blue.  From a scientific standpoint it's pretty much the same reason.  Any star that has a temperature that would peak in the purple portion of the spectrum would simply be classified as a blue star.</p>
<p>If a star was emitting a lot of green light it would also be emitting a lot of the entire rest of the visual spectrum, again because of the blackbody radiation curve.  Such a star would probably be described as white.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Partial (only) answer:</p>
<p>&quot;Purple&quot; isn't really a wavelength that exists on the electromagnetic spectrum. </p>
<p>We all know that, of all the visible spectrum, red light has the longest wavelength (~0.7Å), followed by sequentially diminishing wavelengths that we perceive as &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, and so on, until we eventually lose sensitivity. But what we perceive as &quot;purple&quot; is actually an optical illusion; it's simply a function of both our longwave, red-sensitive cones and our shortwave, blue-sensitive cones being stimulated at the same time - without our midrange, green-senitive cones being activated.</p>
<p>In other words, unlike the other six classic, Newtonian colours that can be refracted out of the visible-light spectrum, there actually <em>isn't</em> a discrete wavelength shorter than &quot;indigo&quot; that we can point to and identify as &quot;purple light&quot;, because it becomes the invisible and confusingly-named &quot;ultraviolet&quot;. Any glowing object that appears to radiate &quot;purple&quot; is in fact simultaneously transmitting two very different wavelengths, situated at opposite ends of our visual range. Likewise, solid &quot;purple&quot; objects achieve the same illusion by reflecting back exclusively red and blue wavelengths, and absorbing everything but.</p>
<p>So for a star to appear &quot;purple&quot;, it would have to radiate in a way that stimulated both our red cones and our blue cones, <em>without</em> stimulating our green cones - because if it activated those as well, we'd simply perceive it as radiating broad-spectrum (aka &quot;white&quot;) light. As there's substantial crossover between the wavelengths our three different cones can pick up, this makes for a pretty stiff transmission requirement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, they do do emit other colors of light, the question is in how much of each. As objects get hotter and hotter more and more frequencies will be emitted, the thing is that the other frequencies don't suddenly stop (the slowly decay), so you get a mix of colors. There's a nice video on minute physics about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5P6O0pDyMU" target="_blank">why isn't the sky purple</a> that very nicely explains what black body radiation is and why you can only get a certain sequence of colors out of it, highly recommend it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
