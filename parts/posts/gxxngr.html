		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two answers to this question.</p>
<p>First, a one-size-fits-all dosing strategy is reasonable for many drugs. While this sounds like a flimsy excuse, we know this because of a drug's <strong>therapeutic index.</strong> The therapeutic index is the ratio of a drug’s efficacy to its toxicity. This is basically the amount of a drug that causes the desired effects compared to the amount that causes toxic effects. Pharmacologists determine this margin very early in the process of drug testing, and each drug's unique therapeutic index is well defined.</p>
<p>There are many drugs that have such a high therapeutic index that a single dose is generally reasonable regardless of body weight. Some antibiotics for example often fall under this category because the goal of treatment is to ger rid of an infection rather than determining the lowest effective dose. Other examples include allergy and pain medications. For individuals whose weight falls far above or below the average range, the dose will probably need to be adjusted though.</p>
<p>Second, A patient’s weight and other attributes — such as kidney function, liver function and variations in metabolism — come into play for drugs with a lower therapeutic index. These drugs, like asthma, thyroid, and diabetes medications are instead administered by <strong>titration</strong>. This is done by starting with the lowest effect dose and slowly increasing until the desired effect is achieved.</p>
<p>Children are the exemption, and weight-based dosing is always required. This is because a baby's weight to a teenagers' varies much much more than adults. Since there is little margin for error, you have to account for weight.</p>
<p>Additionally, when doctors prescribe medication they do adjust for weight, even if they don't make this adjustment explicit to their patients. The F.D.A.’s guidance ensures that physicians stay within ranges that are generally considered safe.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Wanted to add that there is still a big problem with drug companies mainly using men for the therapeutic index testing. Women's bodies work differently, and drugs can have a surprisingly different effect of them than on mens'. The industry is far from perfect, and issues like this definitely warrant further research.</p>
<p>Edit 2:</p>
<p>I'd like to clarify that I am not a medical professional. I am just a random person who saw the question, found a new york times article about it, and posted a response. If you have any medical concerns or serious questions please direct them to your doctor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For many medications, it doesn’t matter all that much. They pick a dose good for a wide range of sizes of people and that becomes the standard dose. This mostly works ok except that every year there are a couple cases of adults who are very petite overdosing on Tylenol and destroying their liver. Why they haven’t fixed that, I don’t know. I lived in Japan where average weight is much less than average weight in the USA.  Medication doses are correspondingly smaller.</p>
<p>But this doesn’t work well for certain medications, like chemotherapy and surgical anesthesia. In such cases, dose is based on weight, age, and sex.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a vet, we treat animals with REALLY disparate weights.  We dose on weight but I can see why this is not so with people.  Drugs with a wide margin of safety are fine to dose by &quot;adult&quot;.  For people who wheigh dramatically different amounts, like 400 pounds--not really a factor since fat is not metabolically active so dosing should be by lean body weight anyway.</p>
<p>For drugs with narrow windows of safety, we dose by surface area, a calculation done to better approximate metabolic capacity.  I think people are dosed this way too for drugs that are very dangerous like chemo.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had it explained to me like this, let's say a liver had 3000 slots in it, it doesn't matter if you are 125 or 300 lbs as long as both people have normal functioning livers. The dosing is based upon those slots and the rate the liver filters the medicine from your system. Not all meds work this way in dosing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The majority of chemo is dosed based on BSA, or Body Surface Area. Notable exceptions are things like immunotherapy which have standard doses and Platinum drugs which are dosed based on kidney function. For many medications, the dose is capped for larger patients so they don't have more than their body can handle at once.   </p>
<p>This is because there is a tiny window with chemo drugs where they are strong enough to kill the cancer, but not strong enough to kill the patient (usually). It's super easy to kill cancer, it's just really hard to do it and keep the patient alive at the same time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
