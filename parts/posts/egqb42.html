		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe the presence of diamond on Jupiter is just theoretical at the moment; there’s no direct evidence. The theory runs like this:</p>
<p>We know from spectroscopy (see earlier postings) that carbon-rich compounds exist in Jupiter’s upper atmosphere. We also know that Jupiter gets hotter the further you go into the atmosphere and that there are lightning storms. Both of these can reduce carbon compounds to graphite particles.</p>
<p>Graphite is only stable at relatively low pressure so any graphite carried deep into Jupiter’s atmosphere would be recrystallised by heat and pressure into diamond.</p>
<p>The weakness of this theory is that Jupiter (and Saturn) only contain a small proportion of carbon - fat more of their mass is hydrogen and helium, so carbon compounds might be too dilute to allow for crystals to form. </p>
<p>A better bet might be the two smaller ice giants Uranus and Neptune. These lost most of their hydrogen and helium early in their lives: instead, they have high concentrations of methane  (CH4). And they are still massive to have immense temperatures and pressures deep in their interiors.that might be enough to create diamonds.</p>
<p>Probably we’ll never know for sure as the temperatures and pressures needed to make diamonds are far beyond any sort of space probe we can conceivably build.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When Dagobert Duck visited Jupiter for the first time, he was seeking for treasures, of course. When he found out about the diamond rain, he started to collect and sell them. When you are looking for evidence, you don’t have to believe in the historian Walt Disney, you can probably see a Jupiter diamond in some museum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
