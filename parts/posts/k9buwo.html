		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Liquids are easily absorbed into your bloodstream through your lungs(as long as it's small amounts) and either eliminated through your kidneys or used by the body.</p>
<p>Solids are harder and you will, generally, cough them &quot;up&quot; to at least the point where your esophagus and wind pipe separate so that your body can move it into your stomach.</p>
<p>If they are small enough particles they can also be absorbed into your blood stream over time.</p>
<p>If they are somewhere in between small enough to be absorbed and large enough to be coughed up then it will be surrounded by a layer of mucus and your body will(very, very slowly) break up the food and carry it away like any other waste.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cells in your lungs have tiny hair like strands that beat and move substances up and out of the lungs. </p>
<p>You constantly produce mucus in the lungs that will trap small debris/pathogens and it gets passed up and usually then swallowed where stomach acid kills the pathogens. </p>
<p>These hairs donâ€™t work in people with cystic fibrosis and they need help to clear the lungs with massage.</p>
<p>Edit: spelling of mucus</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
