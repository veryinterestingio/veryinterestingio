		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heat sources emit electromagnetic radiation with a frequency respecting to their temperature. The visible spectrum of EM radiation ranges from red to violet. The sun's surface is about 5000 Kelvin hot and our eyes happen to see this light. Infrared means that the frequency of the EM radiation coming from an object is below the visible specrum due to lower temperature than the sun, anyway it can still be detected and it's frequency measured pretty accurately.</p>
<p>But How do we get a picture we CAN see?</p>
<p>Like digital cameras have light sensitive chips that render visible light directly to true red- green- and blue information in their memory, we can build a chip that detects light of lower frequency and renders it to any other colour and intensity value in real time.</p>
<p>It's just a microchip doing real time calculus, mapping the gathered frequency and intensity information to another color map we can display and see.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To summarise in a genuinely simple ELI5-way: all objects with any heat at all emit infrared waves. Thermal imaging simply uses sensors/cameras that &quot;see&quot; infrared instead of visible light, and converts it to light we can see.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, humans even emit visible light. It's just such a ridiculously tiny amount that you can't tell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The analog value from the pixels detectors are converted to digital values, usually already in the chip. These digital values are going thought some calculation to correct for difference sensitivities in the pixels to get  consistent values. So that a specific digital value always corresponds to the same temperature regardless of differences in pixels detectors. After this each value is mapped into palette that converts it to RGB that is displayed. The palette are usually selectable by the user. In addition to this there might also be some math converting the values to temperature if it is what you want.    The detectors can be of different types. Very common today is bolometric detector elements. Each element are heated by the received radiation. And the change in resistance caused by this heating are measured. All this is made in real time.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electromagnetic radiation is a wave-like physical phenomenon that takes different names depending of its frequency, i.e. how fast the wave oscillates. </p>
<p>The radiation our eyes can detect we call it visible light. But radio waves, microwaves, x-rays, gamma rays, infrared and ultraviolet are all 'flavours' electromagnetic radiation of different ranges of frequency.</p>
<p>Every object emits spontaneously radiation, most intensely on a certain frequency that grows as the temperature grows.</p>
<p>That's why heated metal starts to glow read: at a certain point our eyes can pick up its 'thermal' radiation. </p>
<p>Every room temperature object emits in a range of radiation called infrared that our eyes can't see. It's just 'before' the red color, that's the first we can see. </p>
<p>If you build a detector, exactly like those of a regular camera, but tuned on the infrared instead of visible light, you can obtain a thermal picture. </p>
<p>Then you convert it on a scale of visible colors on screen to make our human mind understand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A microbolometer is used for most thermal cameras.  This is a fancy name for an array of a large number of temperature sensors.</p>
<p>Infrared radiation is emitted by hot objects. This causes the individual pixels in the microbolometer to warm up. The change in temperature is measured by an electronic circuit, in much the same fashion as a digital image sensor measures the change.  This is displayed using a defined thermal &quot;palette&quot; - hotter colours usually appearing brighter or more yellow/red.</p>
<p>Because the wavelength of the infrared light is much longer (8 to 13 micrometers compared to 450 to 700 nanometers - about twenty times larger) it is necessary to have much larger sensor pixels than an ordinary camera.  The sensors also need to be kept apart from each other, so that they can produce an accurate image without the adjacent sensors causing too much interference.    This means that thermal cameras generally have a low resolution.  Most are under 160 x 120 pixels - which is about 400x less pixels than a smartphone camera (19.2Kpixels vs 8Mpixels).   </p>
<p>Some microbolometer sensors have cooling to reduce their sensitivity to changes in the environment.  Other sensors use a shutter, which is made of metal, so its temperature can be measured easily by a separate sensor.  This provides a calibration factor.  The shutter needs to be put in front of the sensor periodically to measure the reference temperature and compensate for errors in the sensor.  If you have heard a thermal imaging camera &quot;click&quot; and have the image update pause, this is because it is calibrating.  More advanced thermal cameras have a continuously rotating shutter that means the image doesn't get updated. </p>
<p>Other technologies are used for thermal imaging (old cameras often used vidicon tubes optimised for thermal applications) but microbolometers are how the majority of thermal imaging cameras function.</p>
<p>Fun bonus fact: Because thermal imaging cameras are valuable in military operations, they are restricted to 9 Hz refresh rate (9 frames per second) for consumer applications.  This is ostensibly intended to stop people using them for combat operations.  </p>
<p>Additional bonus fun fact:  FLIR makes the most thermal imaging sensors and holds a patent on a thermal imager with more than 14 thermal imaging sensors in a row.  To work around this patent, a competitor,  Raytheon,  deliberately disables every 13th thermal imaging pixel on their thermal imaging array.  The missing pixels are replaced with estimates from the adjacent area.  Patents like these shouldn't be granted, but it goes to show why when writing a patent application, you should consider how it will be worked around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
