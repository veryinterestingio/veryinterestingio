		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They mention explicitly at one point that the black hole is close to maximally rotating, which changes the stability of orbits. For a non-rotating black hole, you're right, the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) is 3 times the event horizon. The higher the spin of the black hole, though, the more space-time is dragged around with the spin, and you can get a bit of a boost by orbiting in the same direction as the spin. This frame-dragging effect lets you get a bit closer to the event horizon in a stable orbit. For a black hole with the maximum possible spin, ISCO goes right down to the event horizon. By studying the material falling into the black hole and carefully modelling the light it emits, it's even possible to back out an estimate of the black hole's spin, and this has been done for a number of black holes both in our galaxy and out. For those curious about the spin, ISCO, or black hole accretion geometry more generally, <a href="http://www.astro.umd.edu/~chris/Significant_publications_for_Christopher_Reynolds_files/Reynolds2013.pdf" target="_blank">Chris Reynolds has a review of spin measures of black holes</a> that's reasonably accessible (in that you can skip the math portions and still learn some things, particularly in the introduction). </p>
<p>They also mention at one point that the black hole is super-massive, which makes it physically quite large since the radius is proportional to mass. This has the effect of <em>weakening</em> the tidal forces at the point just outside the event horizon. While smaller black holes shred infalling things through their tides (called &quot;spaghettification&quot; since things are pulled into long strands - no really), larger black holes are actually safer for smaller objects to approach. Though things as big as stars still get disrupted and pulled apart, and we have actually seen that happen in other galaxies! </p>
<p>So for a black hole that's massive enough and has a high enough spin, it would be possible to have an in-tact planet in a stable orbit near the event horizon. Such a planet would not, however, be particularly hospitable to the continued existence of any would-be explorers, from radiation even if nothing else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former black hole physicist, but haven't had my coffee yet, so my numbers may be off...  </p>
<p>If you took the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way and dropped it where our sun is, the Earth would still orbit in the same place, but our &quot;year&quot; would only be about two hours. </p>
<p>That's <em>very</em> fast, and requires the earth to move 81,296 miles per second, or ~0.44 c.   No practical fusion rocket is going to achieve this, and certainly not one as small as the Endurance (the rotating ship in the movie).  Even an antimatter rocket using proton/antiprotons probably wouldn't be able to achieve this speed due to energy loss from neutral pions.</p>
<p>So while the planet itself may have been in a stable orbit, there's simply no way their ship could have caught up with it to land on it.</p>
<p>Edit:  I wanted to add some math here so I could double-check things (I'm writing a short story that coincidentally involves Sag A*, so it's killing two birds with one stone).</p>
<p>Start with Kepler's 3rd Law:</p>
<pre><code>T^2 / R^3 = (4*pi^2)*(G/M)</code></pre>
<p>Where T = the period of the orbit, R = radius of the orbit, M = mass of the central object, and G is the gravitational constant.</p>
<p>Let's assume you swap the sun for Sagittarius A* (the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way), while keeping the planets the same distance away.</p>
<p>You get (after cancelling out stuff):</p>
<pre><code>T_sun^2     M_sa
-------  =  ----
T_sa^2      M_sun</code></pre>
<p>Plugging in the mass of Sag A* (~4.1 million solar masses) and simplifying:</p>
<pre><code>T_sa = T_sun / 2024.84</code></pre>
<p>The period of Earth's orbit around the sun is 1 year (or 8,760 hours).   So if you swapped the Earth with the sun, the &quot;year&quot; would be:</p>
<pre><code>T_sa = 8,760 hours / 2024.84 ~= 4.3 hours</code></pre>
<p>So not &quot;2 hours&quot; as I stated above (I must have remembered wrong), but the story doesn't change too much.</p>
<p>The circumference of Earth's orbit is 942,000,000 kilometers.   To complete one orbit in 4.3 hours, the Earth has to be moving at 60,852 km/sec, or 0.2 c.</p>
<p>Which <em>may</em> be within the realm of possibility for a fusion engine, <em>if</em> it was &quot;straight line speed&quot;.  But the planet isn't orbiting in a straight line at 0.2 c, it's orbiting in a circle at 0.2 c, which is a much harder problem.</p>
<p>The ship basically has to back off a couple of light years (far enough to allow the fusion engine to reach a terminal speed of 0.2 c), accelerate in a straight line with the propellant it doesn't appear to have, and hope it arrives at the planet at <em>just</em> the right instant and at the right distance.   Otherwise, the ship is either going to miss the planet completely, or smash into it.</p>
<p>So it's still &quot;approximately impossible&quot; that the Endurance could ever land on the planet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
