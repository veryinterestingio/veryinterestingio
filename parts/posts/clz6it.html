		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have a comprehensive answer, unfortunately. I know that <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a469325.pdf" target="_blank">this 2003 report</a> to the US DoD points out that &quot;There are some indications today that global warming has reached the threshold where the thermohaline circulation could start to be significantly impacted. These indications include observations documenting that the North Atlantic is increasingly being freshened by melting glaciers, increased precipitation, and fresh water runoff making it substantially less salty over the past 40 years.&quot;</p>
<p>But what is the effect of this? Here's a summary of what the report says:</p>
<p>The thermohaline conveyor is an ocean current which transports warm water northward, allowing for temperate climes in Europe and North America. However, gradual global warming could cause a rapid collapse of this system and abrupt climate change with a significant decrease in food production (Schwartz &amp; Randall, 2003, p. 1). The amount of fresh water would decrease, and there would be more frequent flooding in some regions and more frequent droughts in others (ibid., p. 1). Temperatures would decrease 5-6 degrees Celsius in the Northern Hemisphere, while increasing by 4 degrees in the Southern Hemisphere (ibid., 10). There would be a 30% decrease in rainfall in Europe (ibid., p. 10) while Northern Europe suffers through conditions similar to Siberia (ibid., p. 12). Crop yields worldwide would fall up to 25% (ibid., p. 13). All of this would plausibly result in mass emigration to regions like the United States (ibid., p. 5), while Europe struggles with external and internal immigration, and Asia experiences a food and water crisis (ibid., p. 22). All of this would occur within a decade. While these are extreme projections, they are not without basis in reality. Two recent studies found the strength of the conveyor has reached a 1000-year low (Raphelson, 2018).</p>
<p>This would undoubtedly have an effect on terrestrial wildlife. I don't know what the effect would be on marine life.</p>
<p>The authors of the DoD report emphasize that this is an extreme scenario and while it was not viewed as likely by scientists they surveyed at the time of publication, it was viewed as plausible by those scientists. Certainly expert opinion may have changed since.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It causes a significant risk to ocean currents. Lower salt content lowers the density of water, and might hinder downwelling to occur, the process of water sinking down. This could disrupt global ocean currents.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Any desalination that would occur from the melting of the ice caps would only have a very small effect on the oceans.  The saltiness gets replenished from the minerals washed into it.  The rising water levels would flood the coastlines, washing much more minerals into the ocean.  This would replenish the salt.  Also, if you realize the sheer quantity of water in the oceans it’s an incredibly small amount of fresh water as compared to the salt water.  It’s like placing one drop of deionized water into a glass of salt water.  While I don’t have the exact concentrations to give, these proportions are relatively correct.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. The amounts involved are orders of magnitude below anything that could ever be detected. You must remember the oceans are very large, a few billion (or even trillion) tons of meltwater isn't even a drop in the bucket</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
