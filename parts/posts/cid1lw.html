		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's supposed to be done by committee. You can look up NASA decadal surveys where leaders of their respective subfields from space agencies, academia, and industry get together to create a list of the most exciting and important research projects which should be undertaken in the next decade. These then influence funding decisions in terms of what types of missions or science objectives NASA asks for, and people then need to propose to. </p>
<p>Of course, now and then president's or congresspeople throw a wrench in the process because they have their own pet projects. Legislative branch controls the purse strings and executive controls the workforce.</p>
<p>Feel free to ask about more specifics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh my goodness...so many incomplete or frankly wrong answers in this thread :(</p>
<p>NASA is an agency of the United States federal government. It has administrators at its top level, as well as scientists throughout its organization. These scientists often collaborate with colleagues outside the organization, such as at universities or non-NASA agencies.</p>
<p>Usually, NASA's administrators and scientists, as an organization, decide which projects the agency wants to pursue, which can include (but do not have to include) manned or unmanned space missions. Each year, NASA submits a budget request for its operations to the White House, which then submits an overall proposed budget for all federal operations to the US Congress (Congress controls the US budget and decides how much money is spent where). NASA's budget requests will include money for whatever missions NASA has decided it wants to pursue. You can view NASA's budget requests (and related strategic planning documents) here: <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news/budget/index.html" target="_blank">https://www.nasa.gov/news/budget/index.html</a></p>
<p>Congress, as part of its deliberations on the entire federal budget, then eventually decides how much money NASA gets. Those individual projects can become subject to political negotiations at that point--sometimes a member of Congress will decide he wants a particular mission to be funded, perhaps because his home state will get a number of jobs based on construction of a piece of that mission. Ultimately, the fate of a particular mission will depend on whether Congress agrees to provide money for it.</p>
<p>In some cases, there is political pressure on NASA to pursue certain missions. This was the case in the 1960s with the Apollo missions. There was a huge amount of political will to have the United States get to the moon first. It's not like NASA came up with the idea and Congress just learned of it when the budget request was submitted. But again, that was a bit of an unusual situation; it's not like the White House or US Congress was pressuring NASA to do the New Horizons mission to Pluto, for example.</p>
<p>That said, upcoming missions to the Moon and Mars do have a political component, for a few reasons. There is some political apprehension about other countries getting there first and exploiting whatever resources are available, particularly on the Moon. The missions to get to the Moon and Mars will also be incredibly expensive, which means there is a lot of political jockeying I spoke of earlier in terms of which states get a piece of the pie in providing pieces for the mission. The missions are so expensive, in fact, that the mere question of whether to fund them at all when the country has a very large overall debt is an important political consideration. Then of course these are high-profile missions that are of international significance, so there is a national prestige aspect to them as well.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR version: in most cases, NASA's administrators and scientists (often in collaboration with scientist counterparts outside the organization) decide which missions NASA wants to pursue; NASA submits a budget request for these missions; US Congress decides how much funding the missions get, if any.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe Kennedy said &quot;We choose togo to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because theyare hard.&quot; That's how it was decided</p>
<p>Space exploration is somewhat controlled by president administration. When Bush W. was president he wanted to return back to the moon, but when Obama became president he decided to focus on Mars. Trump has decided to go to the moon. NASA is very good at adapting current projects to new project so not everything is lost between adminstrations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The decision to go the moon was a giant PR stunt.  After Russia launched their early space probes, the (incorrect) assumption was that Russia was more technologically advanced than the US.  With the cold war and the two sides fighting for influence over smaller countries, this would not do.  By going to the moon, the US secured a perception of technological dominance over the USSR, giving them a huge PR  and influence advantage.  </p>
<p>So that decision was a product of the times. Space exploration has slowed down since because there isn't such a compelling reason to do it any more, although possible commerical space applications are starting to cause private sector space exploration to become a thing.  </p>
<p>And the final say was the leaders of those two countries.  Nowadays, space agencies do so in a more democratic and beaureacratic way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
