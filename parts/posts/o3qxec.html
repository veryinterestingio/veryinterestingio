		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both species (<em>Alligator mississippiensis</em> and <em>Alligator sinensis</em>) have 32 chromosomes. They are from the same genus. Theoretically it should be possible. There is a massive size difference between the species though. American alligators can grow to 1000 pounds while chinese alligators rarely exceed 100 pounds. So to answer your question probably yes, but probably not naturally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another factor is that genes donâ€™t merely turn on features in all cells. We have many cell types and most genes are turned off in most cell. There is a complex framework for embryonic cell differentiation to turn on the right genes in the right cells. If two species have the same number of chromosomes but not the same number and sort of cell types that differentiate in exactly the same order, one can imagine some weird stuff is going to happen. Maybe the embryo will break down. Maybe some tissue that is not in the liver will try to exhibit liver function or a hoof that pounds rock will be loaded with nerve endings. Animals have tons of hormones but i am guessing the levels of those hormones that is normal varies, so maybe a cross excretes one level and has an organ designed to respond to another so its sex function, blood sugar, growth, etc is broken and doesnt seek balance. All the cells in a species are closely calibrated with each other for many things like embryonic differentiation and endocrine function so its not wonder any cross has health issues and less close crosses cant be born.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
