		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Photographic memory, in its true sense, is the ability of one to be able to recall pages of text, number, or images in high detail. This is different than eidetic memory, which is the ability to recall memories as images like photographs in high precision <strong>for a brief time</strong>. Eiedetic memory has been demonstrated to exist in some children but has not been observed in adults and is generally accepted to not exist in adults.</p>
<p>Photographic memory, however, is believed to not exist at all. It has never been positively demonstrated and is purely theoretic.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My area of expertise is more general in how we interact with and use our memories, but there is an interesting point I can bring up on the topic.  </p>
<p>There are a few individuals who have been registered with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthymesia" target="_blank">hyperthymesia</a>. Like you can read in the wiki article, some of them might even be bad at memory tasks, but they can retell their lives with ridiculous accuracy. Some also call it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlNB7dAXQEc" target="_blank">super autobiographical memory</a>. This is how it looks in individuals who have the least false memories of humankind - an end of the spectrum which is quite interesting. I think that in some of the interviews they talk about the negative connotation of remembering things like trauma very exactly, which might be of interest to you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well there are several important things to note to answer your question. There is a difference between a photographic memory and an eidetic memory. An eidetic memory is more like that associated with a trauma in which someone could, through dissociative techniques, look back upon a past moment in intense detail as if looking upon a photograph. This is more like a sensory experience rather than an autobiographical commentary.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Then there is the photographic memory, where one has deliberately tried to capture a detailed mental image for later reference. Some people use mnemonics and spatial awareness as well as other tools. These memories are formed deliberately while eidetic memories are formed automatically.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Back to your original question, false memories are believed by some to be the result of revisiting an incomplete memory and essentially filling in the gaps with educated guesses. Therefore, a person with an eidetic memory would not be more likely to have false memories, as their experience of the memory would feel apparently incomplete. There is no gap-filling by this mechanism because it is a seamless image. Whereas someone with a photographic memory may develop false memories because they are using commentary to recall the information almost like lyrics, which can deviate these memories as you point out.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Your last question is a little unclear because of the word 'dissociating' which has multiple meanings when discussing traumas. If you are asking if they are less likely to forget a traumatic event, I would say yes they are less likely to forget because often traumatic events are the etiology of an eidetic memory. If you read into it most people with these conditions have comorbid depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder among other bizarre neurological features unique to themselves. Possibly as a result of post-traumatic remapping of the brain. Neuroplasticity is something we're just beginning to understand.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
