		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Racism within the system/a system designed to be beneficial/detrimental to differing races</p>
<p>If your neighbor Bob is racist that is not systemic racism. Thats just racist</p>
<p>If the laws are racist that is systemic racism.</p>
<p>If people treat you differently because of your race that is not systemic racism. Its just racist</p>
<p>If the government treats you differently because of your race that is systemic racism.</p>
<p>If the bank teller treats you differently because of your race that is not systemic racism, thats just a racist employee.</p>
<p>If bank policy treats you different because of your race, that is systemic racism.</p>
<p>This is a very dumbed down version obviously but its basically if the rules are against you because of your race, or better for people who are a different race, then it is systemic racism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One example is to have most of the minorities living in poor neighborhoods with low property taxes and then fund education through property taxes. </p>
<p>Giving great mortgage terms to people in white neighborhoods so they can buy homes and start building wealth, and offering much worse loans to black neighborhoods so that they can't ever begin to own things and accrue wealth. It's called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining" target="_blank">Redlining</a>.</p>
<p>Another example is that black people tend to not be included in drug trials or medical research so they tend to have worse outcomes from the same healthcare system.</p>
<p>The legal repercussions of being caught with cocaine (a drug traditionally associated with white people) versus the much more strict and severe repercussions of being caught with crack (a drug traditionally associated with black people). Then the war on drugs leads to a LOT of black men in prison for very long sentences, and their children grow up in single parent homes, which when mixed with low income, poor education systems, and very little social/societal support, leads to increased rates of crime.</p>
<p>There are dozens of examples that add up to make it much harder to be a minority in America. It's not about having a guy yelling the N word at you in the gas station, it's about having a much harder time getting ahead, and a much easier time sliding down to failure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities.&quot;</p>

</ul>
<p>And so, in the early 70's all the progress of the 1960s civil rights movement was brushed aside in favor of institutional racism against those elements they wished to silence and enslave.  Nothing has really changed at the federal level since, and the Klan, <del>outlawed</del> disgraced overtly, sent its members out to infiltrate and indoctrinate police forces nationwide.  Songs have been written about it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well Billy, I'm glad you asked.</p>
<p>So, when you learn about racism in school, you probably learned that some people are man and nasty to other people because of the color of their skin, or the shape of their eyes, or a bunch of other things. That is naughty, and you shouldn't do it.</p>
<p>Systemic Racism is when the rules in a society are set up in a way that is unfair to people who belong to a certain race. This can be intentional, or it can happen by accident.</p>
<p>For example, because of how badly treated African Americans were back in the past, a lot of black people today live in really really poor areas. This is because a lot of black people didn't have the opportunity to move out of poor, predominantly bad neighborhoods, so their kids live there today. Schools are funded by local taxes, so while white people in rich neighborhoods get to send their kids to well funded schools with a lot of teachers, tools, books and fancy classes, black kids from poor neighborhoods wind up in poorer schools with worse books, fewer teachers, and worse equipment. People aren't intentionally trying to give black people a worse education, but it happens because of the ways we fund schools.  </p>
<p>EDIT: Holy Guacamole! I did not expect this to blow up like this! Thanks for all of the awards guys!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
