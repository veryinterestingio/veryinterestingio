It's so incredibly toxic.</p>
<p>But.. why do these people care? I'm sure they also hate country music, but they don't rant and rave about it as much as one would Fortnite if they hate that also, It's only the popular things that get the most vocal hatred.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the beginning, you don’t care about the thing. But after countless mentions from TV, friends, social media, family, school, etc., you start getting tired/annoyed at the thing. And thus, you start hating the thing. </p>
<p>Also, this is like being Pavlovian trained to hate the thing, just like making your favorite song your alarm clock. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>This is going to be both controversial and anecdotal unfortunately</strong>. But a lot of it has to do with <em>how young people consume media</em>.</p>
<p>When you're younger, opinions on entertainment and trends are more polarised. As you're typically forced to be around a mix of people not of your selection (ie school), and you are in the process of building up much of your identity based on the crowd you associate with, the trends you emulate, the clothes you wear, the games/films you consume, etc. And by extension the groups you <em>distance</em> yourself from.</p>
<p>No young person wants to be in the middle-ground. You want to find a tribe. We're social creatures and that's how we do. So you'll find yourself fanatically devoted to [Boy Band], whilst hissing distain as another group who like [Boy Band 2].</p>
<p>As you get older however the equation changes. Your experiences broaden, so your tastes evolve. You gain control of your environment and finances. You intentionally fall out of touch with the people who do not share many common interests and have fewer friends as a result. And you identify the sorts of hobbies/music/films you like with the rest simply not being on your radar. And then become a <em>connoisseur</em> of said hobby, because you only want the best examples of it. Because your time is precious now, what with work and/or family consuming everything else.</p>
<p>Ask someone over 30 what they think about something polarising to young people and you'll more likely just get disinterest. Or reasoned explanations about <em>why</em> something isn't very good, backed up by more experience in said hobby.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don’t really like it, so hearing about it/seeing already frustrates you. But since its popular you see and hear about it EVERYWHERE. On top of that, you know a lot of people who like it, and they always make a point to single you out as the only person who doesn’t like that thing, which makes you wrong because you don’t follow the crowd. I’ve ended friends by simply saying, “I don’t like Fortnite, it’s just not very fun to me.”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not so much that they hate things that are popular, it's that they hate that things they hate are popular. </p>
<p>For example I didn't like Fornite when it came out (for fair reasons like the repetitive gameplay etc.), but now I <em>hate</em> it because a) it's everywhere but more importantly because b) other games are changing because of it (for the worse, IMO). I dislike PUBG for the same reasons but I don't hate it because it doesn't really affect me.</p>
<p>Very little of this hate is &quot;irrational&quot;. Most often you'll find a fair reason for the hate, even if it's just because the popular thing is taking attention from something they consider more deserving.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
