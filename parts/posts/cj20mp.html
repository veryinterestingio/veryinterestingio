<p>The chip is like a little man who makes secret codes that can each be used to buy one thing. I can copy the secret code but not the little man. Because the secret code only works once and for a limited time, and in one situation, stealing the secret code isn’t useful. You can’t steal the little man without doing a lot of work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Magnetic strips can be much more easily duplicated than the chips.</p>
<p>The strip can be duplicated just by reading the swipe, since the data it gives <em>is</em> the data it has.</p>
<p>The chip, instead, gives an encrypted code based on what you ask it by combining the value you gave it with a secret one it has, and even if you ask it hundreds of times, you won't be able to figure out the secret number it stores inside it. When the reader says to it &quot;what value do you get when I give you Value Y?&quot; the chip responds with what it gets, and then that is checked by the institution that issued the card (who know the secret number too so can do the same calculation and see if the results match).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have already explained how it works, so I will go to the practical side a bit more.  </p>
<p>You know how in the news, big companies sometimes have hackers steal credit card information?  If they steal information from a magnetic strip, then they have your credit card number and can now buy things on YOUR credit.    </p>
<p>If they steal the information from a chip it's useless to them.  They can't use it to commit fraud because the numbers the chips makes can only ever be used once.  </p>
<p>So using the chip makes you hacker proof in any places you use the chip.  </p>
<p>Note that it does really protect you much if you've ever used both at the same place or if you use the actual card number online.  So it helps a lot, but it's not foolproof.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The chip is actually a tiny computer that is powered by the reader. </p>
<p>It has a secret number inside of it that cannot be read. Only the bank knows the number. There's no way to ask it the secret number. Instead, you can only give it another number, and it will do some math on that number and its secret number and tell you another number. That's what happens when you read the card. The bank picks a number and asks the card to respond. The bank does the same math, and if your card has the same secret number it must be legit.</p>
<p>Now, you're probably thinking someone could figure out the secret number by just getting it to do the math enough times. But the numbers involved are so big, this will take too long to be practical, more than 10 years to get enough numbers to have a shred of making a guess. Even with very modern computers. That's longer than your card's expiration date so it's fine.</p>
<p>And if computers get fast enough the math fails, the banks can simply change the chips to use new algorithms and new, bigger numbers that take even longer to crack.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A magnetic strip is literally just your card number written in plain on a piece of magnetic tape ; like a cassette. No security at all, whatsoever.</p>
<p>A chip is a little computer you have to talk to in order to authorize payment. It will require all kinds of verifications to talk to you. </p>
<p>Also, the data is stored encrypted in it. <em>If</em> you were able to get to it you still couldn't read what's inside.</p>
<p>I say &quot;IF&quot; because the reason these chips look like they're made of flat metal thingies is because the chip itself is below the contacts. What you see are the contacts. So to get to the chip you would need to drill through these, destroying a lot of stuff in the process, making it likely to be unusable anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
