Applying pressure as you describe activates the sensors in your eyes and sends signals to your brain, and what you see is your brains interpretation of the signals caused by the applied pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I get this thing called visual snow where there's a constant overlay of static like dots over your vision.</p>
<p>I only really notice it when I think about it but it's much more distracting at night and when I close my eyes I never really see blackness. </p>
<p>It's apparently possibly some sort of visual tinnitus.</p>

<p>I can also get a similar effect by closing my eyes harder. If that makes sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think the question of when there is no pressure has been answered.</p>
<p>They think it's because the cells in our eyes including the retina ( like all cells) emit a very small number of photons. In the light we don't notice them as the receptors in the retina are being bombarded with so many photons. But in the dark the retina can actually detect these and interprets them as colours and patterns.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
