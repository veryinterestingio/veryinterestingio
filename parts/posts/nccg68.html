		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s a photochemical reaction. </p>
<p>There’s a chemical in your skin called 7-DHC that’s photochemically reactive to light between the wavelengths of 290 and 320 nm. These wavelengths are part of the sun’s spectrum and what is often referred to as UVB radiation. When 7-DHC reacts with UVB light, the product is dholecalciferol, also known as Vitamin D3, which is then carried to the liver.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When exposed to UV radiation, epidermal cells in the stratum spinosum and stratum basale convert a cholesterol related steroid into Vitamin D3.</p>
<p>The liver converts D3 into an intermediary product used by the kidneys to synthesize a hormone called calcitriol.</p>
<p>Calcitriol is essential for the absorption of Calcium and Phosphorus in the small intestine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ul>
<li>In the human skin, we have this steroid molecule (we have innate pathways for steroid biosynthesis) called 7-dehydrocholesterol. </li>
<li>This 7-dehydrocholesterol, upon exposure to UV light gets converted to a precursor vitamin D3 molecule, which upon isomerization, forms cholecalciferol (an inactive form of vitamin D3). </li>
<li>Cholecalciferol, in turn, has to be acted upon by 2 enzymes to form the active vitamin D3. 
<ul>
<li>25-hydroxylase in the liver, forming 25-OH-vitamin D3 </li>
<li>1-alpha-hydroxylase in the kidneys, forming 1,25-dihidroxycholecalciferol. </li>
<li>Both products are active forms of Vitamin D. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Long story short, sunlight acts as a catalyst in a reaction that converts an intrinsic steroid molecule into usable vitamin D.</strong> </li>
<li>And no, we don't have a special organelle for this. Hope this helped.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>FYI the color of skin is an adaptation to sun exposure in the region of the world your recent ancestors lived. White skin became white in order to absorb more sunlight as we moved north and eventually got trapped during the ice age and the closer your recent ancestors were to the equator the darker the pigmentation in order to protect the skin from the sun. Our hair textures and eye colors adapted the same way.  Pretty cool when you think about it and just another why judging some based on skin color is so ridiculous.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
