		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There could be a variety of reasons, but a common one has to deal with blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>When your stomach empties and blood sugar levels start to drop, your body sends out signals that the food supply has stopped and you need to get more.  This is especially true if the last meal  was composed of a lot of starches and sugars since your body had to pump a fair amount of insulin to handle that quick infusion of sugar.  There may have been an overproduction of insulin, resulting in you not only being hungry but also shaky.  All in all, an uncomfortable experience!</p>
<p>As time goes by and blood sugar levels stop dropping and insulin production levels off, your body starts making decisions about where to find the energy to keep going.  Around the 6-8 hour mark, the decision is made to switch to fat reserves.  </p>
<p>You'll still be getting a &quot;need food&quot; signal from your body, but the urgency is lower.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hunger is (to us, in the western world) usually not the real feeling of &quot;my stomach is empty&quot; but a hormone called &quot;Ghrelin&quot; that tells you youre hungry because this is when you usually eat. That hormone is broken down again after a while, which is why you feel less hungry even if you havent eaten.</p>
<p>Additionally, sometimes your body really doesnt have an energy source, bdcause theres too much insuline in your bloodstream for your lipase (the enzyme that breaks down fat to convert into energy) to work correctly. After a while of not eating, your bloodsugar goes down and your isnulin too, so your body is able to use fat as energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a more basic psychological perspective, your brain is easily adapted to constant stimuli. </p>
<p>Say you were hungry before bed, but actually stayed awake browsing reddit or something.  If you were able to distract yourself from the hunger and not eat, during the same amount of time you would have slept, you'd likely have 'forgotten' much of the initial hunger.  This works in people who fast for days at a time.</p>
<p>Also really loving the variety of perspectives in these answers!  The truth is likely a combination of many of these posts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
