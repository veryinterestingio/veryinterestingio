		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sports med doc here. The studies haven’t really given a clear answer regarding longterm outcomes after injury with icing. For every study that claims worse outcomes, there’s one that shows improved outcomes. The reality is that a month or two after injury, it “probably” didn’t matter either way. But on the short term, icing and compression can help relieve pain and reduce swelling, and if this allows you to optimally and progressively load the joint, and perform the functional rehab protocols (which absolutely have been shown to have improved outcomes), then it’s “probably” a good thing. </p>
<p>For overuse injuries, it can be helpful to break the cycle of inflammation and injury. An inflammed tendon sheath filled with fluid is going to be dysfunctional and the injury will progress. Too much tendon inflammation will lead to permanent maladaptive changes within the tendon. A lot of people are talking about the “natural” healing process, but many athletes are doing supraphysiologic activities and finding ways to continue training safely is often a challenge. </p>
<p>Final thing to keep in mind, is that injury treatment can vary wildly depending on the joint, the mechanism, the type of injury, the athletic demands, the age, etc, and trying to come up with an answer of “is X good for injuries” is like asking “is tylenol good when you’re sick.” It’s too broad a question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been a first-aider in various contexts and the RICE protocol for soft tissue injuries has remained popular, but some recent studies suggest that the ice element doesn't improve recovery - or might actually delay it by interfering with the inflammation response (see <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3396304/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3396304/</a> and <a href="https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/is-it-time-to-rethink-rice-for-soft-tissue-injurie" target="_blank">https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/is-it-time-to-rethink-rice-for-soft-tissue-injurie</a>). One interesting point made in the second article is that ice could still be beneficial by reducing pain and allowing the patient to move around more freely (when a person 'protects' a painful injury and stops moving naturally this can lead to other problems like reduced range of motion, chronic pain etc).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Swelling is part of the immune response to injuries. When you sustain an injury/infection Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPS) or Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPS) trigger the immune system. Patrolling immune cells release chemical signals that direct the broader immune response and can induce things like vasodialation (swelling), fever, ect. The purpose of the swelling is to allow for more immune cells to infiltrate the site if the injury and clean up the mess, promote tissue healing, and fight pathogens. </p>
<p>Our immune system is tightly regulated but many predispositions or just severe injury can take a healthy response and drive it to a dangerous over response. In many cases icing or other anti-inflammatory treatments is a matter of comfort but sometimes it's a matter of preserving tissues and ensuring that the inflammation itself doesn't do more damage than the injury.</p>
<p>An example of a dangerous immunological over-response is anaphylaxis where common foreign particles induce a drastic immune response that can threaten the airway of patients and tank their BP. The vasodialation caused by these allergens constrict the airways to the point where oxygen passage is severely diminished. This is why the treatment for anaphylaxis acts to counteract the the effects of the immune response. Anti-histamines work to block the chemical signals being released by the mast-cells associated with allergies and anaphylaxis. Epinephrine serves as a vasoconstrictor to counteract the swelling and IV fluid is given to counteract the drop in BP associated with the vasodialation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a theory in the physical therapy realm that cryotherapy actually slows down healing because you’re delaying the body’s natural progress through the stages of healing. I’m not as well versed in this theory as we were taught differently in school. This doesn’t mean anything as there is always new evidence that comes out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
