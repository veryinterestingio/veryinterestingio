		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It really depends upon the organism being bacteria or virus.  Nobody knows how long Covid-19 vaccines will offer immunity, yet.  Also different vaccines will vary.  Chicken Pox vaccine (varicella) lasts \~40-50 years, then immunity lessens, that's why there is a Shingles vaccine for elders.  Measles last your lifetime.  Tetanus should be re-vaccinated every 6-10 years.</p>
<p>The yearly flu (influenza) lasts only about a year, but not because the immune system weakens, it's because the virus changes and the body no longer recognizes it.</p>
<p>Vaccines or the natural infection itself (such as chicken pox) give the same immunity.  With chicken pox whose immunity lasts about 40 years, it is the immune system getting weaker.  With influenza, it's &quot;I don't recognize this enemy.&quot;  With Tetanus it's &quot;I forgot how to fight this.&quot;</p>
<p>Not all mutations are bad.  Back around 2009 the &quot;swine flu&quot; hit the world, another pandemic, but the virus mutated so much that it pretty much was no longer a big issue.  Unfortunately Covid-19 is not being so polite, but it also could mutate into a friendlier form, or as you've heard a &quot;worse&quot; one.  In this case it's not more harmful, it simply spreads easier.</p>
<p>Covid-19 vaccines are most likely going to become an annual thing, maybe even mixed with the flu shot.  Remember though that vaccines can give &quot;partial immunity.&quot;  This means that while you might become ill, you might not become seriously ill.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer:  No</p>
<p>Long answer:  Unless you live in a hermetically sealed environment, your body has been fighting bacteria, virus, fungi and every other type of microbe 24/7, every day, without fail, quarantine or not.  Our immune system is *always* on just waiting for something to challenge it....it does not stop....ever.  Kind of like the terminators.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The immune system does not exactly work like a muscle that needs exercise in order to work. So your immune system is generally in the same condition now then it was a year ago. The exception to this is the parts of the immune system used for detecting foreign species, the antibodies and B-cells. But the reason these need regular exposure is to know what kind of foreign species they should be looking for. They are still able to detect any new pathogens without issues. However your ability to withstand previously encountered viruses and bacteria does slowly go down over the decades unless you encounter them again. On the other hand viruses mutate so fast that you are unlikely to face the same pathogens with a few years interval anyway. But I am certain that immunologists and virologists are working overtime trying to collect as much data as possible from this unique scenario we are in and are very exited to observe what will happen once we resume normal social protocols. It might be that the flu vaccine is more important now then it have ever been.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The immune system doesn't get rusty from lack of use but clearly it is not as efficient as we age. A year or so out will probably be unnoticed.</p>
<p>There is a germ theory that our clean environments can make our immune system over active which can cause allergies or autoimmune diseases. We are still not sure if this is why we are seeing more allergies and autoimmune diseases than we saw 50 years ago. So I wouldn't say that being away from pathologans for a year will cause more people to have allergies or autoimmune diseases, but it might be possible.</p>
<p>Also realize even if you are not around other people you are still likely being exposed still from food. Even when you do your best to keep everything clean and free of pathogens it doesn't take long for bread or other food to get some foreign species on them even if it's not enough to see them!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While it does not get weaker short term, your symptoms can be worse when you get sick again after a longer period healthy. Regular infections from pathogens keep things more primed than not. This can take a little longer if the pathogen has been absent awhile.This is part of the reason the most effective COVID vaccines are two dose with the second dose more likely to cause a nastier reaction. Your immune system cleaned up the first small amount and NCIS put the photo in the 'BOLO', when before they didn't even know who it was. Then it sees it again, really recognizes this is a perp on a mission and instead of going in alone, Seal Team 6 is now coming for those terrorists. You may feel worse after that second one, because the Seals have called in air strikes, cruise missiles and JDAMS... Plus some Hogs to soften those bastards up (BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTT!). You feel like you're in a warzone. The end result is the same and in vaccines it's a false alarm. The infection is eliminated, just the journey you 'felt' is different.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
