		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bees, wasps, and hornets all evolved from a common ancestor, so their venom is similar. Basically, their venoms contain irritants that irritate the victim/the individual who was stung. Phospholipase A2 and mellitin are the allergens that cause a bee sting. Antigen 5 is the main venom of a wasp/hornet. Both a bees and a wasps venom contain hyaluronidases, but the combination of compounds really dictate how the stings work/feel. A bee will inject a venom that basically causes inflammation - similar to an allergic reaction. A Wasps’ venom breaks down cell membranes and they can sting multiple times which is why they hurt so much more: they do actual damage. Finally, bee stingers stay in the skin, and you should always remove them. Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> While it’s not <em>completely</em> wrong to say they’re “similar” it’s not quite correct. The allergens found in them are well defined as completely different. Therefore just because you aren’t allergic to bees doesn’t mean not being allergic to wasps. It does not mean not being allergic to hornets. In fact they’re so variable you are unlikely to be allergic to more than one but could be allergic to any of the three.</p>
<p>To answer OP’s question though, they’re different cocktails. The proteins, enzymes, and pheromones are varied. Compare a bee to a cobra and yes, the bee venom will be much more similar to that of a wasp. That’s like comparing an orange to an apple though, of course the orange is more similar to a lime, but they’re all still vastly different.</p>
<p>Fun fact; Hornets venom actually contains dopamine and serotonin. They will not make you feel good though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honebee venom: The main component is melittin, amounting to 52% of venom peptides. Adolapin contributes 2–5% of the peptides.</p>
<p>Common wasp venom: Complex venom containing amines (histamine, tyramine, serotonin, catecholamines), peptides, and proteins, including many hydrolases. The alkaline venom is quite different from bee venom, which is acidic. This varies for other wasp species ofcourse.</p>
<p>Hornet venom: haven't found any specific list for hornet venom but I have found that it's more similar to wasp venom. A large amount (5%) of acetylcholine makes it more painful than a wasp sting. The toxicity wildly varies from species to species. From very venomous to not very venomous (just painful).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I can’t begin to answer this but conveniently there’s an entire book on it: Sting of the Wild by Justin Schmidt (of Schmidt’s sting pain index). He addresses this exact question and lots more.

<p>I became allergic to bee venom and had a near fatal anaphylactic reaction. I now undergo shots to maintain some immunity to bee venom but I also get a hornet venom and wasp venom shot as well so there must be some difference in the three.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
