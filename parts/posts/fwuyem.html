		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The SARS-CoV-2 virus infects the upper and lower respiratory tract in humans. As far as I understand, it does not infect other parts of the body, e.g. muscle tissue. So I would expect that if the virus is injected into muscle tissue, it should help the recipient develop immunity, which could then protect them from a conventional Covid-19 infection. This is not being done, so either:</p>
<ul>
<li>the virus does infect muscle tissue</li>
<li>the virus is not infectious enough in muscle tissue to trigger an immune response</li>
<li>the virus would reach the respiratory tract too quickly from the injection site</li>
</ul>
<p>Is any of the above the right answer? Or is it something else entirely?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because once it gets into the bloodstream, or into the lymphatic system, it can go anywhere in the body, so you would still have a very high risk of getting a full blown infection. You also would have a potential risk of infecting others.</p>
<p>But... there are vaccines that use attenuated (as in less virulent) live viruses (such as the MMR and chickenpox vaccines) and this could be a way to make an effective COVID vaccine.</p>
<p>To attenuate a virus, you infect a host that isn’t the viruses’ normal host, and if you can get the virus to do this successfully, it means it’s mutated sufficiently to get better at infecting this new host - which also usually means it’s no longer so good at infecting its original host.</p>
<p>Once you’ve done testing to verify that this attenuated virus will no longer successfully infect the original host, you can use it as a vaccine in the original host - it will still elicit an immune response, but it won’t replicate much/at all and therefore won’t cause an infection.</p>
<p>These types of vaccines can’t be used in people with compromised immune systems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why do you think intramuscular injection would magically be isolated in the muscle, or that only respiratory tissue can be infected?</p>
<p>ACE2 receptors are expressed in most epithelial cells of the body - which means most organs of the body will be infected - from the blood vessels, to the liver &amp; kidneys, to the intestines etc.</p>

<p>That isn't quite true. There is a growing body of evidence that some people have GI symptoms too (e.g. diarrhea), conjunctivitis, severe headaches and, most recently, cardiological symptoms (heart attacks and heart issues) due to the virus. </p>
<p>The respiratory symptoms are only the most common ones and tend to be most severe but that doesn't mean the virus doesn't have impact elsewhere too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The key here is &quot;as far as I understand&quot;. Much is still unknown. There are lots of suggestions and theories that the virus also attacks the brain, kidneys, intestine, fatty tissue, et cetera. As long as these mechanisms are not understood, doing as you propose may be very dangerous.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
