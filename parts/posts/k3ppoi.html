		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have stated the paradox that many homeless and poor folks run into. I've seen it solved one way, and this was specific to the United States. You need at least one friend who has it all together (ID, mailing address, easy to locate). </p>
<p>Find someone who is a Notary Public. Have your friend write an official letter on paper with a real signature saying basically &quot;I know this person is who they say they are.&quot; Have it Notarized. </p>
<p>Then you get your friend to send you a letter in the US mail to your actual mailing address. Take those two items and go register to vote or get a library card. Then you take all 3 of these things and apply for your birth certificate (If you were born outside the US, this is where it breaks down for you.) With birth certificate in hand, you can get your ID. </p>
<p>Then you can start applying for jobs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to intern at a non profit that helped people struggling to meet basic needs.  Think food, shelter, clothing, etc. If they were homeless and didn't have ID, we would accept a piece of mail or even a prescription bottle, anything with the client's name on it and an address showing that they were residing within the county we served.  If there was room in our shelter and they moved in, social workers would help them gather the official documentation they needed to start getting back on their feet before they left.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even if you're sleeping in a tent somewhere, it would be beneficial to stop by a homeless shelter because a lot of them can help you connect to resources like social workers. Social workers are basically sorcerers when it comes to red tape. They can usually help.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
