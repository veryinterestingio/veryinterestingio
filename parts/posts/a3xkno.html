		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but the difference isn't very big. The radius of the Earth is about 6400 km (depending on where on Earth you measure). So if you're 10 km high in the atmosphere (the cruising altitude for long haul commercial aircraft), you're only 0.15% further away from the center of mass.</p>
<p>Since gravity is proportional to the square of the distance, that means there's a difference of about 0.31%. On a fairly average adult male of 80 kg, that's about a quater of a kg difference. This difference is certainly measurable, but it's also well within daily fluctuations of ones weight (a drink, a meal or a bathroom break could cause differences of similar magnitude).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is correct. Even better, because the earth is not an actual perfect sphere, but thicker at the equator, even at sea level you weigh less on the equator then in let's say London. Also, the centrifugal force is larger at the equator then in London. It makes pole vaulters jump 2cm higher with the same effort! How do I know this? There's a nice comic about this by XKCD: <a href="https://xkcd.com/852/" target="_blank"><a href="https://xkcd.com/852/" target="_blank">https://xkcd.com/852/</a></a> </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is essentially correct, but there is one minor detail in your question that bears analyzing: for an extended spherical body like a planet, the maximal gravitational force you can feel would be at the surface. The gravitational field strength actually becomes lower if you go closer to the earth's center of mass than the surface (i.e. tunnelling down). You can think of it like this: there's some mass &quot;above&quot; you that pulls you &quot;up&quot; a little and thus reduces your weight. This effect can also be explained by a principle known as Gauss's Law.</p>
<p>In fact, if you somehow found yourself at the very centre of the earth and somehow prevented yourself from being crushed/ionized due to the enormous pressure and temperature, you'd be weightless (but in perhaps the least cool way imaginable).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>yes, on the Earth's surface the gravity also varies depending on where you are on the bulging spheroid shape the earth actually is, roughly it's stronger at the poles and weaker over the equator. Mineral deposits under the surface effect it too, locally the gravity is slightly higher over dense minerals this is used in prospecting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, weight will change ever so slightly. In fact, a rough approximation from the first derivative of Newtons law of gravity with respect to r gives a value of about -.308 milligals per meter elevation increase. A gal is a cm per second squared. We use a device in geology/geophysics to detect small changes in gravity called a gravimeter. Some are designed almost exactly like spring scales except there are a few differences including a quartz spring and vacuum chamber. Elevation changes and terrain changes are typically removed from the gravitational anomalies so that changes in density of the subsurface rocks can be detected. This helps geologists find ore deposits, caverns, changes in crust thickness, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
