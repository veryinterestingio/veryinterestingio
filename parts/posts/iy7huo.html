		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most likely it is a phantom feeling. However sometimes it could still be a bug. Humans are not as fast as we think we are especially when compared to insects. And if a bug was on you (especially a flying one) they can sense your muscles flexing as you adjust to look at a part of your body and fly away before youâ€™d be able to see them on your body. Also a bug could innocently fly/fall into you and then they continue on their way before you can react to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Also, that's just air crossing the hairs on your leg.</p>
<p>You can't see air. Therefore you don't see anything when you look.</p>
<p>Hair is a defence against things that may injure you, so it warns you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
