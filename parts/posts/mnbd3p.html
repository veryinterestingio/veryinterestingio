		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple satiety signals. Some detect the amount of stretch, some detect certain nutrients such as proteins and fats.</p>
<p>You can get very full on a small volume of food if it has a high fat content. But for most people, eating fat alone doesn't seem to be enough to trigger satiety.</p>
<p>Other hormones that play a role in satiety:
Insulin
Leptin
Ghrelin
Peptide YY</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding to what the others said it is also about the time you spend chewing something, also feeling full usually only starts about 20 to 30 minutes after eating regardless whether one ate a medium amount or a lot. So when wanting to reduce the caloric intake it might be useful to eat one plate of something and before getting seconds because you are still &quot;hungry&quot; to wait a couple minutes. Most of the time then you are full. Or eating slowly so you get to the half hour check point with your first portion</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically you have 3 sensors: weight, volume, and calories density or nutritional value. So, you can feel full on a bag of fries, and you can feel full eating a massive salad. And while the salad is healthier and more packed with nutrients and fills more volume, it has less weight and you'll digest it faster. So you'll feel hungry sooner. The fries will fill you up oil-calories wise, but will take longer to digest and therefore make you feel full for longer. There's a great pictogram out there of illustrated stomachs &amp; how full they get based on different foods.  I'm not sure how to link things. Google &quot;calorie density&quot; and find the photo of stomachs <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/wX7Q7sfGh58Hpb4D8" target="_blank">stomach pic</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

I’m reading this at the moment and on a chapter explaining leptin, ghrelin and satiety very well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
