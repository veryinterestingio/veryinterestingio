		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the same way that water doesn't go in your bum when you swim. They have sphincters, or sets of muscles, that close the hole.</p>
<p>EDIT: Since my quick comment seems to be getting attention, a bum isn't really the best analogy. It's more like squeezing and kinking a hose to make it flat. The round(ish) tube becomes a closed slit. And it happens in multiple places, not just at the visible part of the blowhole, but deeper inside as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The tracheal tube that connects the blowhole to the lungs has a sort of a nozzle attachment, like a vacuum cleaner hose, that slots into the internal passage to blowhole.  This allows them to swallow while underwater without aspirating water into their lungs.</p>
<p>It does mean they can't breathe through their mouths though, so something like a golf ball plugging their blowhole would be very serious.</p>
<p>If they swallow something too large, it also has the possibility of dislodging their breathing tube, and making choking on their food or accidentally breathing water a possibility.  It's rare, but it does happen.</p>
<p>Some whales have also learned how to voluntarily pop the tube out, allowing them to do tricks like blow bubble curtains.  It's a learned skill for them, like the ability to burp on command.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
