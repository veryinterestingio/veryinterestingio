The cheap pencil topper erasers tend to be the worst. Once they’ve hardened a bit, they’re not going to do as good a job, whether that means smearing or just crumbling to bits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think I have the correct answer. I believe it has to do with low quality erasers trying to mimic the original colors by using pigment. Good erasers are black, white, or pink not on purpose but because of the result of mixing a specific rubber and sulfate. Companies that sell cheap erasers are probably using cheap material. It's probably a different kind of rubber than what leading brands use, then it's mixed with pigment. When using those, the rubber easily breaks apart while rubbing off the pigment into the paper.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This usually happens when you have micro pencil lead crumbs stuck on your eraser, so when you try to erase it's just like you smear a pencil lead onto your paper, hence why the skid marks happens. It's also why the eraser doesn't crumble up and fall off because of that pesky pencil lead crumbs acting like a protecting layer for the eraser.</p>
<p>You can easily get rid of this by rubbing the eraser to a table or something, and by keeping your eraser in a different compartment with your pencils in your pencil case.</p>
