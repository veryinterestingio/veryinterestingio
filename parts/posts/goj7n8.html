The company that made the black box surely knows how to decrypt their encryption, so why would it take so long?
Also, assuming the encyrption is super-complicated, what sensitive data would warrant such encryption? Is it just voice recordings, or something more?</p>
<p>Edit: I really appreciate the responses. Not only does it answer my queries but also expands on a lot of questions I hadn't even thought to ask.</p></div></div>

<p><strong>TL;DR... The time is in the full investigation, not just the box data.</strong></p>
<p>If a Flight Data Recorder is intact, getting the data is relatively quick and easy once found. There may be some damage to components or incomplete information that requires interpretation. Forensic techniques can get some of that data back. Relative to the whole endeavor, it's a small portion of the effort.</p>
<p>That data is correlated to other evidence to figure out what happened. That evidence is gathered physically and through interviews and records.</p>
<p>Here's a non-comprehensive list of things an investigation will be looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Aircrew Background: Mannerisms before flight. Diet. Illness. Fatigue. Alcohol. Medication. Stress. Major life events. Reputation. Training history and performance. Identified human factors in all of this history. Personality (Excess/Lack of Confidence, attitude toward bending/breaking rules, communication skill etc). Group Dynamics. Social barriers (see Korean flight that crashed in SF). Conflict. 24hr(or more) history to include what they did day of, night before, day before, even week before. Family Dynamics. Things they've said not just in the cockpit, but out of the cockpit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aircraft Operation: within SOP/Regulation/Training/Aircraft Limits. Deviations from normal operations and reason. Acceptance of failed equipment (there's always failed equipment on a plane, there is guidance on what is safe to take flying), unusual control inputs (too aggressive, not aggressive enough, autopilot usage), systems setup (navigation used, parameters such as Baro Bug set correctly)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Environment: weather, history of aircrew flying in said weather, equipment and qualification suitable for weather, aircraft/aircrew/airport/maintenance/operational/navigational complications due to weather, airport/control operations in general (pace, safety, same considerations for controllers as there are for aircrew), company culture, dispatch helpfulness, clarity in communication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical/Engineering: Part exceeded limits. Part failure due to random/user error/malice/engineering/maintenance/unforeseen incompatibility. Personnel access to those parts same considerations for maintainers/engineers as for aircrew and controllers and their companies and training. </p>
</li>
<li>Training: Adequate. Culture...</li>
</ul>
<p>Just fill in the gaps already because I've only got like half of them. All of this has to be strung together to figure out and rule out causal factors to an incident, and come up with recommendations to prevent further related incidents, and do so with a high degree of certainty that all of this is correct.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine someone’s car crashed and you want to understand what happened. You have a recording of the crash, but it’s not a video - it’s a recording of the exact speed each wheel was doing, what the brake pressure was, what the position of the accelerator was, the engine temperature, the air con setting, and so on.</p>
<p>You’d eventually be able to understand a lot about the crash, but you’d need an expert to look at all that data and tell you what it meant.</p>
<p>Now imagine that for an aeroplane except there are several hundred times more pieces of data to look at, and the ultimate cause of the crash may be buried deep in one obscure sensor reading. That’s what you’re ‘decoding’ with a black box.</p>
<p>Edit: thank you for the gold and awards! My first ever!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Normally they are slightly damaged due to the conditions of the crash, then it isn't the decoding that is a problem it is interpreting the data, the data tells you what happened and when but not all the other things that happened. So an engine failed at 11.03 20 seconds later the plane goes into a steep dive. Is it crashing or are the pilots trying to dive to restart the engine or even put out a fire?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Im no black box expert, but from what I know, it's basically a log of all of the aircraft's sensors and all of the things the pilots did. Imagine a massive excel file with hundreds of columns(vertical) . Each column is a sensor, be it altitude, aircraft nose angle, air speed, engine power, amount of fuel, door closed sensors, etc, anything you can imagine that an aircraft might have. Then every second, the value of all the sensors fills out a row(horizontal)  in that excel file. Well, that's a shitload of data, and looking through an hour or more of that pure data is going to take a lot of time. You'd be looking for abnormalities in sensor readings or weird combinations of sensor values, sensors that stop working, pilot actions that didn't result in the expected sensor response, etc. It's probably just a ton of crap to go through, and unless you find a real &quot;smoking gun&quot; figuring out what exactly happened would take a lot of time a knowledge of the entire aircraft. That make sense?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Finally a question I can answer. I’ve been an avionics tech for about 10 years. </p>
<p>A Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) and Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) are what is commonly revered to as the “black box.” Fun fact, they are in fact not black, but international orange and typically consist of two different systems. One used to record pilot voice and the other used to record aircraft flight surface data. </p>
<p>I am not sure at all where this idea come from that it takes 6 months to “Decode” that data as a recent crash only took us 10 days to decode. Sometimes it can take longer to decode for a few reasons however. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It’s destroyed - the CVR and DFDR are in a very tough case we simply call the “Crash Survivable storage unit.” (Real original I know.) Even so, this case may not survive an impact into a mountain. In this unfortunate case we simply may not be able to retrieve the data. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It got “lost” - this is pretty typical in underwater scenarios but we have underwater locator beacons that operate at a depth that I cannot disclose. Just know that it’s pretty deep. Sometimes though, it may exceed this depth and it makes it difficult to late. </p>
</li>
<li>Some maintainer didn’t calibrate the damn thing correctly. - this suck because it’s our own people’s fault that we can’t quickly calculate what happened. People usually go to jail for this stuff though so there is that.</li>
