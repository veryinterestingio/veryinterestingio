<p>1) Boxing is hard work and it's easy to over-exert yourself and become exhausted. Throwing a light punch can be a way to get your opponent to tire themselves out by wasting energy blocking or dodging. </p>
<p>2) A light punch can also be a feint: throw a light punch to the face, and when they block that, it can open up their defenses for a more powerful follow up, maybe to their ribs if they bring their guard up too high (as an example).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Boxing is exhausting.  Don't underestimate how tired they can be, especially in later rounds.  </p>
<p>But also, little light jabs can keep your opponent away from you or disrupt an attack.  It's easier to maintain your defense when you don't put everything into a punch.   When you do, if your attack doesn't go right, you can really open yourself up for a counter-punch. </p>
<p>So it is also a way to get your opponent to react and change their stance while still having a careful defense and preserving the opportunity to throw a harder punch at the right time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
