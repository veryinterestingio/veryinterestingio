		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In college I learned that in order for nuclear fusion to start happening you need the energy of your electrons to be high enough to overcome the Coulomb potential, so that they can interact with the nucleus of atoms. The equation (3/2)nkT = e^2 /r gives a temperature of ~10^10 K, but taking into account quantum tunneling and using the de Broglie wavelength as the radius of the nucleus, you can get a much lower temperature of ~10^7 K. </p>
<p>That's pretty close to the temperatures observed in the corona. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_corona#Coronal_heating_problem" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> even mentions that the corona is 10^6 K and parts of it can reach even of 10^7 K, though doesn't have a source attached to it. </p>
<p>So does that mean that there are parts of the corona the can fuse hydrogen? I'm assuming the answer is no, and that you need a relatively high pressure as well for fusion to happen, but pressure doesn't seem to appear in the equations. Are the calculations above just approximations to get the order of magnitude for the temperature?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The density of the corona is something like 18(!!!) orders of magnitude lower than the core.  The chances of the tunneling event in the core is extremely low (~1 in 10^28 ) and only happens when two atoms collide (but it still happens because there's a <em>lot</em> of atoms there).  The chances of it happening in the corona is trillions of times less likely because there's just not as many collisions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
