		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>mRNA encodes a protein. You get the mRNA into some cells, and they use this mRNA to make the protein. All cells send samples of every protein they're making onto their cell surface, for the immune system to keep an eye on what's going on inside of each cell. If you make the mRNA encode a protein belonging to something like a virus, the cell makes and shows off virus proteins on its surface. Immune cells see virus proteins and prepare an immune response to it, before any cells actually have the virus. Then when you encounter the real virus, the immune system has already prepared how to deal with it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure about the exact details, but I'll try to tell the general idea.</p>
<p>The mRNA gets into your cells and there it is translated into a protein. Your immune system recognises that foreign protein and you develop immunity against it with help of memory cells. That protein is usually chosen so that it is unique membrane protein of a specific pathogen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In case this helps anyone curious but wants a less technical analogy:
You have immune system cells in to it body that are like guards or patrols. They just chill in your bloodstream and when an intruder (virus in this case) is detected they sound the alarm and bring the rest of the immune system in for an attack. An autoimmune disease is when the immune system gets fired up at your own cells instead of an intruder. </p>
<p>Vaccines basically work by sending in something to train the patrol cells on what to look for. Either a killed off virus, a virus that has been incapacitated from actually being able to start an infection (this is called a live attenuated virus) or a piece of the virus. Like showing the immune system a yellow hat and saying ok the enemy will be wearing hats like this, keep an eye out. </p>
<p>An RNA vaccine is a newer technique where we basically give the body the blueprints (RNA) and your own cells build the target piece to train on. Like giving a pattern for yellow hats you make yourself instead of having to build and send out billions of hats. Could be much faster/more efficient.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To use an analogy.</p>
<p>If you want to think of DNA as a computer code; mRNA acts as the output to facilitate a 3rd event. Eg; DNA controls power. mRNA controls the light pattern. Output is the light being turned on, colour or speed of change. In this case we are talking about a theoretical computer virus that is hijacking this process. </p>
<p>mRNA vaccines are like a hot fix fix for DNA code but it has to work quickly so they just send in the code for the thing needed not a DNA change that would solve the root cause. In this case the mRNA fixes a exploit like a port, authorisation and more by quickly changing the way that that exploit works. It doe snot address the underlying way it works.</p>
<p>mRNA vaccines differ from a regular vaccine which moblises the immune system and this causes the right DNA to be selected for. mRNA vaccines cause the cells to immediately produce the right antibodies which promotes the right immune cells to be selected for and mobilised. This kick starts immunity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
