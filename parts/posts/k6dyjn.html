		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not really in the spirit of the sub to just send a video, so I'll add some supplementary explanation. <a href="https://youtu.be/n7LXYyohmgg" target="_blank">Here's the animation.</a> Atoms in a crystalline material are not arranged in a perfect pattern, but rather in small chunks of patterned atoms which haphazardly stick together at the boundaries. Under high strain, these boundaries begin to slip, allowing the material to slowly thin if under tension or bend if under compression.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nothing is actually touching anything else. Everything is held together through bonds of energy and some bonds are stronger than others. </p>
<p>The bond between the atoms of a noodle are quite weak, so they can be broken easily. Imagine magnets of different strengths and you get the idea. </p>
<p>Steel has much stronger bonds but if enough force pulls the atoms in opposite directions, those bonds will still break. </p>
<p>So, at the atomic level, the same thing is happening as the noodle, the bonds are broken and the groups of atoms are separated from each other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
