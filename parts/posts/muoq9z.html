		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The growing Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) crisis, brought about by decades of misuse and overuse of antibiotics and responsible for 35,000 deaths annually in the United States alone (according to the Centers for Disease Control), has forced scientists to adopt new tactics and develop new strategies to stay ahead of the evolutionary race with microbes.</p>
<p>Join us today at 2 PM ET (18 UT) for a discussion with experts on the science of AMR, organized by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM). We'll discuss how the problem of AMR has evolved, strategies for combating AMR now and in the future, and approaches for identifying and producing new antibiotics that can attack drug-resistant microbes. Ask us anything!</p>
<p>With us today are:</p>

<li>
<p>Of course no problem in the world has only one cause, but could you speak to what the primary source of antimicrobial resistance is? I understand we overuse antibiotics. Is this more often cases like &quot;Hey doctor, give me antibiotics for my flu!&quot;, or cases where people don't finish their antibiotics, or is it the antibiotics we feed to livestock? Could you give a general overview of how bad each of these practices are and which one, if you had to pick, you'd eliminate?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you think about the potential to use bacteriophages in the contexts where we have historically used antibiotics?</p>
</li>
<li>Imagine, <em>hypothetically</em>, I did some experiments with Atomic Gardening and some fungal samples, and I had produced something that appeared to act as an antibiotic against E. Coli samples. What would be the proper course of action to have an expert verify whether this is a new antibiotic?</li>
