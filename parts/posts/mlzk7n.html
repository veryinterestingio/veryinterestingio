		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Reddit!</p>
<p>I'm Dr. Diwakar Davar, a physician-scientist at the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center and the University of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Despite the success of cancer immunotherapy only about 30-40% of patients have a positive response. We want to know why! And, we think the gut microbiome may hold some of the answers.</p>
<p>There are billions of bacteria in the gut. In fact, the gut microbiome has been implicated in seemingly unconnected states, ranging from the response to cancer treatments to obesity and a host of neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, depression, schizophrenia and autism.</p>
<p>Together with my Hillman and Pitt colleague Dr. Hassane Zarour, we looked at the success and failure of cancer immunotherapy and discovered that cancer patients who did well with anti-PD1 immunotherapy had different gut bacteria microorganisms. So, what if we could change the gut bacteria? What if we transplanted the good bacteria from those who responded to treatment into the patients who did not respond? In a small first-in-human trial, we found that this just might work! A tremendously exciting finding.</p>
<p>What does this mean for the future of cancer treatment? We think altering the gut microbiome has great potential to change the impact of immunotherapy across all cancers. We still have a way to go, including getting more specific with what microbes we transfer. We also want to ultimately replace FMT with pills containing a cocktail of the most beneficial microbes for boosting immunotherapy.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just a comment my MIL had stage 4 melanoma with tumours in her breast and lymph nodes. Completed a round of immunotherapy and is labelled as a complete recovery. The tumours in her breast you could feel are gone and the lymph nodes clear. Her immune system just eradicated them. It’s truly amazing she would have been dead and now two years later she’s fine. She was told her micro biome had something to do with it. She grew up on a farm and I think because of her diet which consisted of hardly any processed foods this set her guts up with great bacteria. She still has to go every 3 months for a scan but everything appears fine. Science and our bodies are truly amazing. Thank you doctor for everything you do!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
