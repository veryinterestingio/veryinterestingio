		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chickens are omnivores, but free-range chickens eat a great many insects, and insect exoskeletons are similarly rich in calcium.  They'll also eat just about anything else, including small mice, voles, moles, lizards, etc., bones and all.</p>
<p>In a commercial setting, they are supplemented with oyster shells, or whatever source is cheap.  Home chicken keepers sometimes feed old eggshells back to their chickens.</p>
<p>Chickens fed more calcium will lay eggs with thicker shells, and they can accept a fairly wide range, but a deficit will yield fragile eggs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that their wild counterpart, Red Junglefowl, typically produces one or two broods per year, with around 18 eggs being their max yearly output. For calcium sources to be spent on eggs, a wild hen only needs 5-10% of the amount a domesticated hen needs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Production layers produce about one egg every 26 hours. Their feed has a calcium supplement. Calcium supplements are also given free choice, such as oyster shell or pulverized eggshell.</p>
<p>If there is not enough calcium, the hens will lay thin-shelled or even shell-less eggs. Thin eggs are especially troublesome becauese the hen is likely to break them and then seeing all that nutritious goo on her foot, will eat it. Once a hen learns to eat eggs she will test every egg to see if it can be broken and eaten. Worse, other hens will learn this behavior.</p>
<p>Fun fact: birds store egg calcium on their femur bones. Paleontologists found such a formation on a T-Rex.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chickens that have been specifically bred for egg laying lay 1 egg a day. It is extremely rare to get two eggs in one day. Commercial egg layers are given a ton of supplemental calcium in their diet. Also without artificial light in the winter chickens will stop laying. They also stop laying when they molt. Many chicken breeds only lay an egg every other day or less. Young chickens called Pullets or chickens that do not get enough calcium will often lay eggs with soft or sometimes even no shells. </p>
<p>Tldr; even the best chickens only lay one egg a day routinely and it's only possible with man made feeds, artificial lighting and calcium supplements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It gott o the point that their eggshells were hard enough that they often wouldn't even break if you dropped them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
