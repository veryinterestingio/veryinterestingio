		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difficulty in measuring G (usually called big G, or the gravitational constant), is that gravity is very weak in comparison to all the other forces. To make a measurement of G, you basically have to measure the force of two masses on each other. The masses and their separations have to be well known for precision, but that limits you to laboratory measurements, where you can't fit big enough masses. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>To make matters worse, the measurements that have been made seem to give values that differ by more than their individual error bars would suggest, so there seems to be some misunderstandings of the measurements and their errors. Anecdotally, this leads to loud arguments at conferences, as different groups accuse each other of not understanding their own measurements. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that gravity is really weak. State of the art experiments are done by dropping a ball in a vacuum and measuring the fall time with a laser. If you put a very heavy object above the ball, the fall will be a tiny bit slower due to gravity. The accuracy is then limited by the mechanical, electrical and optical parts - how precise is the time measurement. If the heavy weight changes the time by a factor of 1e-6, and you can measure the time to 10 significant digits accuracy, you have 4 digits left to compute G.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, it’s relative weakness compared to other forces in nature and how we need to measure it. </p>
<p>For example, it’s nearly impossible with current techniques to measure the gravitational attraction between two protons, indeed the electro-magnetic repulsion due to their positive charges will be orders of magnitude higher. So in order to measure G with any degree of success we need to go up to larger objects where the gravitational force is much more impactful on their structure/behaviour. </p>
<p>Indeed in ancient times most measurements of G came about from studying the planets motion around the sun. As you can imagine, it’s very hard to measure the mass of planets with a high degree of precision (decimal places), and so this imprecise measurement of the masses of large objects have impacted our determination of the value of G. </p>
<p>Even on Earth, the gravitational field varies considerably around the globe. Dependent on a variety of factors however mostly it’s related to the density in the soil beneath your feet. Indeed measuring the variance in the gravitaional field beneath your feet is a common technique to find oil/mineral deposits underground. (Source/further reading: <a href="https://www.epmag.com/gravity-and-magnetic-geophysical-methods-oil-exploration-1364421" target="_blank">https://www.epmag.com/gravity-and-magnetic-geophysical-methods-oil-exploration-1364421</a>). This means that even in a lab, if you knew the mass of your test mass to absolute precision there would be some uncertainty in the strength of the force of the gravity that the Earth pulls on the mass, due to your inability to accurately know the exact mass distribution of the Earth. Leading to a relatively low number of significant digits in our measurements of G. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We're gonna start with the simplest ways to measure the gravitational constant. F=Gm1m2/(d^2 ), so the easiest way to solve for G is to know the masses of two objects, the distance between them, and the force they exert between each other. Since we can measure gravitational acceleration to such a high degree of accuracy, we can simplify the equation with a known force for an object of m1 mass at d distance from Earth (F=mg).</p>
<p>Big problem, we now need to know the mass of the Earth to a high degree of accuracy.</p>
<p>Other methods of measuring G keep running into the pesky issue that Earth is a huge gravitational well. Any gravitational attraction between two objects of known mass is paltry compared to the Earth, so we're back to needing to know the mass of the Earth to a fine degree. We could measure this in space, but 1) it's not like those experiments are replicable by others to confirm the findings since it requires, well, being in space, and 2) the gravitational constant is only really necessary for calculations in astrophysics where the masses of objects and distances between them are huge, so the degree of accuracy needed for G is a lot smaller. If I know a planet's mass to two significant figures and its distance from another planet to two significant figures, having four significant figures is almost overkill.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is gravity is a very weak force, and penetrates everything</p>
<p>With elaboration, it's also tied to mass and distance. There's just no way to scale that down in our universe. It's like trying to measure an atom with a ruler. If we're going to directly measure that, we just have to make our instruments really, really small. That's all well and good if we at least know rulers measure physical objects, atoms are physical objects, so we already have the technology, more or less. But at that scale, atoms aren't very much like physical objects and we have to  start finding alternate methods of measurement, which we can do because we know things like the structure of an atom and the charge of its parts.</p>
<p>We don't really know what gravity is. Is it conveyed by gravitons? Are gravitons particles? Or is it really just curvature of spacetime and doesn't have a conveyor the same way a piece of paper doesn't shoot some kind of particle around when you fold it. How do you even measure curving space when that curves your instruments too?</p>
<p>So we do have to measure gravity directly, and we can't scale the universe itself so we have to work with what we've got. And that means using instruments so large that most things by comparison are small and it kind of simulates scaling everything else down. And needless to say, building unreasonably large structures is no easy task. And if we were to measure attraction between them, its near impossible to know their exact masses. Exact enough to get better than 4sf precision anyway. gravitational constant times mass is actually known to 9 or 10 (I forget) sf</p>
<p>Even if we did measure that attraction directly, we're also measuring the attraction of everything else in the universe. Literally. Gravity has an infinite range, and stops for nothing. You can't shield it to create an isolated environment, you can't reflect it, or use any material that isn't affected by gravity because firstly that defeats the purpose of the test, and secondly because no such material exists. Not even antimatter or dark matter. Not even massless light.</p>
<p>We can measure changes in spacetime though, but like I said, gravity is weak. Like so insanely weak, And space is very very large. Any credible source of gravity is certainly too large to work with, or too far away for its gravity to be measurable, and by the time it gets here, it'll be all mixed up with the other gravity generating masses in the galactic neighbourhood (and technically the entire universe). Pretty much our only hope is a massive observatory to measure gravitational waves coming off of colliding black holes. Yeah. The most powerful gravitational source in the universe, and we need two of them, spinning around each other at breakneck speed, for us to even feel the change. So, to detect this change in spacetime, we need a laser, shining over a distance of multiple (3-4) kilometres for instruments to detect a gravitational wave. And we don't even measure the time difference for the lasers to travel that distance. No, that's much too crude for such a tiny measurement. We have to see if the lasers go out of phase with each other. That's a nanometre scale variation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
