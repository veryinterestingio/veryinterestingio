I also understand (on a basic level) that electricity and magnetism are the same thing. However, I don't understand where the energy comes from to spontaneously move objects across a distance. Why can a magnet lift a paperclip off a desk? Where does the energy to lift the clip come from?</p>
<p>Edit: Wow! Thanks everyone. I feel like I'm learning so much. Magnets are wild. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physics is weird. One of the things they teach you is that an object sitting on a table is applying force to the table, and the table is applying an equal force to the object, just in the opposite direction. This does not require any energy input. No work is being done.</p>
<p>Magnets are similar. They apply a force on each other that is similar to the force of gravity, only with a different type of field (2 poles). They'll seek the lowest energy state, which is where the opposite poles are together. It requires energy to pull them apart, just like it requires energy to lift the object off the table.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like a boulder sitting on a hill. It took energy for someone to roll that boulder all the way up the hill, energy which the boulder has stored as gravitational potential energy. And although the boulder is in an equilibrium state and is not currently in motion, it still has potential energy waiting to be unleashed. If the force of friction holding the boulder in place on top of the hill were to be overcome - say, but a man pushing on the boulder enough to get it rolling - that potential energy which it has stored would be converted into momentum and the boulder would go tumbling down the slope until it settled at a lower energy state at the bottom of the hill. </p>
<p>Magnets, too, are full of potential energy. Ordinarily the atoms in a material tend to have their electric poles aligned in a random fashion, but if a strong magnetic field is applied to the atoms as the substance is changing phase - such as cooling from a liquid to a solid - then all of the tiny magnetic fields of the atoms in the material align to this external field and get locked in a single direction. This can form a permanent magnet, and is analogous to the material &quot;storing&quot; a bit of the energy supplied by the external magnetic field. Incidentally, when a magnet is then used to pull something towards it, the magnet is weakened - some of the energy stored by the atoms in the magnet is converted into momentum, and their alignment becomes a little less well organized. Done enough times, a magnet will no longer be a magnet, as enough of the atoms inside of the magnet will lose their special alignment and the material will de-magnetize. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the simplest answer to this question is: they get the energy from you! You give them the energy to come together when you pull them apart, same as you give a book the energy to fall to the ground when you lift it up and put it on the table.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ask yourself why if you release a paperclip in mid-air it spontaneously moves to the ground, where does the energy come from that makes it move downwards so quickly?  </p>
<p>The term you are looking for is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy" target="_blank">Potential Energy</a>, like in the link a good description is &quot;the energy held by an object because of its position relative to other objects&quot;. The paperclip already holds that potential energy (in relation to the magnet or vice versa), what you are seeing is the conversion of that energy to kinetic energy (movement).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
