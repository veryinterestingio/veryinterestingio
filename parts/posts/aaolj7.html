		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is called Olber's Paradox.</p>
<p>In essence, if we posit that the universe is infinitely large and contains an infinite number of stars (and they are largely randomly distributed), then every line of sight an observer can see should eventually end at a star.
So if the universe is infinitely old, every point in the sky should be as bright as the surface of a star.</p>
<p>Since it clearly isn't - we have to discard one or more of our assumptions.
(They are the universe is infinitely large, contains an infinite number of stars and is infinitely old)</p>
<p>This is evidence for the big bang - we discard the idea that the universe is infinitely old, so although every line of sight does end in a star, the light from those stars has not had time to arrive yet. (As the speed of light is slow compared to the size of the universe).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s nothing for the starlight to reflect off of (mostly). Imagine an empty room, without any light. If someone turns on a flashlight and points it towards you, the rest of the room still looks black, since that light isn’t hitting anything.</p>
<p>Edit: That’s enough of the “a star shines in all directions” replies, it’s a very simple, imperfect analogy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While they emit light, very few photons actually hit us. If you take a high exposure picture of the sky you will see a lot of stars and galaxies that you normally can't see. However, that doesn't fully explain it. The universe is big, really big, so where is everything? The universe is expanding faster than the speed of light, so we can only see light from objects within a certain distance of us because the light coming from outside our visible universe can't reach us. It gets more interesting than that, the expansion of the universe is accelerating. Because of this, our visible universe is slowly shrinking. At some point in the very very far future we won't be able to see the rest of the universe because the light can't reach us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why is the sky dark at night? This was a question raised by an astronomer many years ago. He reasoned that in any direction, there would eventually be a star. Why don't we see them all, as a canopy of light.</p>
<p>Briefly, the reason is that the further away a star (nebula, galaxy, etc.) is from us, the faster it is retreating from us, producing a red-shift and this reducing the energy of the light from it. Eventually, there are things so far away and retreating from us so fast that we can't see them at all.</p>
