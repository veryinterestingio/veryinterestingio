		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is, but it's slower and quieter.  You can for sure find people talking about how especially switching to heat pumps will be an important part of limiting climate change. Because they're just moving heat around instead of creating it, heat pumps can (sort of) be more than 100% efficient.  Or at least, you can use 1000 watts of electricity to bring 2500-3000 watts of heat inside.</p>
<p>It's slower and quieter because cars get replaced much more quickly than houses and apartment buildings do, and probably more quickly than residential climate control systems do.  Also, retrofitting heat pumps into homes that weren't designed for forced-air heating/cooling can be expensive.</p>
<p>In 2040, the housing stock in the US is overwhelmingly going to be the same houses and apartments we have right now, and at least a substantial minority of those places are going to be using the same heating/cooling systems they are right now.  But in 2040, the stock of cars driving around will be mostly cars built in about 2030. (unneeded word deleted)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Norway there's no infrastructure for gas, and liquid fossil for heating is banned. Electricity is used for everything, with assistance from wood in many houses.
There are some houses with gas burners in the kitchen, but those use 5kg bottles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
