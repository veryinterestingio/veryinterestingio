		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the VAST majority of wine is meant to be consumed within the first few years of release. </p>
<p>many fine red wines have tannins and phenolic compounds that can be intense and forward in a young wine, and will change chemically over time as they bind with each other, soften and become more integrated. kind of like a food dish that requires some length simmering to really develop deep and complex flavors. </p>
<p>as many have already stated, there is a point where a wine can age too long and lose much of what made it enjoyable. </p>
<p>my biggest advice is to try wines of young, mid and older ages to find what you like best. although im somewhat of a wine geek, i don’t enjoy substantially aged wines. i prefer my wines on the mid-young range, generally in years 6-12 after vintage date. i find there’s still plenty of forward fruit flavors, with some added secondary flavors and a softer structure. if i’m presented with a very young wine and a very old wine, i’m always choosing the young wine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was at a party a few years ago the host had a very expansive wine collection.  He brought out a bottle of something from 1970 (cant remember the name) He opened it up let it breath, gave out small samples so everyone at the party so we could have a taste.  After he tasted it he said - that was disappointing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also pretty much every single white wine that is produced other than certain types from world class producers and regions is meant to be drank now or soon. Typical white wines don’t age well. </p>
<p>Also even though you didn’t ask I will add that wine, unlike other things like scotch or whiskey or any other high alcohol beverage, can age in the bottle. Whereas as a bottle of scotch doesn’t. So if you buy a scotch that says 12 years old on the bottle and you don’t open it for 10 years you don’t have a 22 year old scotch. You still have a 12 year old scotch as scotch is aged in barrels before it’s bottled. It doesn’t age in the bottle like wine does.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wine isn't often aged like whiskey is, it's usually good to go within a few months to a year. The draw of older wine is usually the vintage. Batches of grapes have different flavor profiles depending on the conditions and weather it's grown in. You never know how a years crop is going to turn out until you taste it. Especially good years (for whatever meaning of good, what's prized depends on the type of wine) are only known after the fact, and will have a limited supply (can't grow more of 10 years ago's grapes) so it will be saved and shown off, drank on special occasions or whatever.</p>
<p>Leave wine to long and it'll eventually spoil in to vinegar, so there is an upper time limit on it, but well sealed and protected bottles can last a century or so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
