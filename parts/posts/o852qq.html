		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It may depend on your personal anatomy, but if the pain is due to poor circulation then the reason standing is worse is because the contracting of muscles when walking actually helps circulation return back up your legs to your heart, where when simply standing blood pools in your feet and ankles more easily</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A big challenge for your body is lifting the blood from your feet, back to your heart. You do this by having valves in your leg veins, and relying on the movements of your leg muscles to repeatedly squeeze the veins, pushing blood past those valves upwards.</p>
<p>If you are walking, muscles are constantly moving, but if you are standing still, then the muscles aren't moving much. The blood remains in your feet, becoming low in oxygen, as well as increasing the pressure in your feet. This is painful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They will help with venous return and this reduce your pain. Also elevate your legs above the level of your hips as often as you can.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
