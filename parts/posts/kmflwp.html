		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A material with no band gap is called a conductor. With a large band gap it'll be called a insulator.</p>
<p>Materials with an in-between band gap are thus semiconductors.</p>
<p>There isn't an exact cutoff, just that enough electrons can rise into the conduction band at the temperature you're interested in. (And temperature can also change a material's band gap.)</p>
<p>SiC has an indirect band gap of 2 to 3 eV, so you'll still have a few electrons in the conduction band. Much fewer electrons than compared with Silicon with a band gap of ~1.1 eV, but many more than diamond (Carbon) with a band gap of ~5.5 eV.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say that SiC has larger bandgap than most semiconductors. SiC is ~2.5eV, GaN is ~3.2eV, Ga2O3 is ~5eV, Diamond is ~5.5eV, AlN is ~6eV. So there are many semiconductors with large bandgap. Of course its true that there are many more with smaller bandgap including the Si/Ge family, AlGaInAs family, AlGaInP family. Realizing larger bandgap materials was a big challenge for almost half a century because you needed large bandgap to make blue LEDs which was only realized in 1990s with GaN.</p>
<p>On to your main question about &quot;why is SiC bandgap large&quot;. There is no simple way to answer it that would also be precise. Generally bandgap depends on the elements in question, their bonding type and strength, the crystal structure, lattice constant. In general stronger bonds between small atoms lead to small lattice constant and larger bandgaps. Si and C independently both have diamond type lattice but C being a smaller atom with a stronger bond has much smaller lattice constant and larger bandgap vs Si. When you mix the two 50:50 to make SiC you get properties somewhere in between. The lattice type is still diamond but the lattice constant is in between Si and C. The bandgap is also in between Si and C.</p>
<p>One thing to note here is that these type of relative comparisons and argument work well if you stay within a material family like Si/Ge/C family or AlGaInN family. To compare across different families you need to do some more math to understand why their properties are the way they are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As with everything else in the periodic table, it's probably easiest to think of things in terms of trends. Smaller atoms at the top of the periodic table will have smaller electron shells, reduced polarizability, and more tightly bound valence electrons. When the bonding in a compound with one of these elements is ionic or covalent in nature this will lead to more energy being required to free bound carriers into the conduction band = larger band gap.</p>
<p>For carbon-carbon covalent systems, this means that it's effectively an insulator with a large band gap. Si-Si will have a smaller band gap, Ge-Ge will be smaller still. From this trend, we would expect SiC to be in between Si-Si and C-C, and it is.</p>
<p>Similar trends emerge if you consider compound seminconductors, like the III-V Ga(N,P,As) series. GaN has the highest band gap, GaP smaller, and GaAs smallest. Move to a AlN instead of GaN and this holds true as well, with AlN having a larger band gap than GaN.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On a side note, the high bandgap of SiC makes it a great contender for usage in HV power electronic semiconductors. The semiconductor devices created with SiC are almost comparable with Si devices, even with the trivial amount of research in comparison. The Navy dumped a ton of money into researching several years ago and there is a lot of ongoing research and development regarding it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
