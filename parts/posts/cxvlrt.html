		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>on top of things that other people have mentioned, the two misaligned grids cause whats called a moire. the grids of your camera and computer screens are too small to make out with the human eye but when two grids are angled to one another, other larger patterns form.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depending on what type of line you mean, it could either be the framerate mismatch that all the other comments are refering to, or something called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern" target="_blank">Moiré effect</a>, where two misaligned grids, in this case the pixels on the subject screen and the pixels on the camera screen, create lines that don't exist. It's the same reason that games often struggle with fine grilles and grids, where these pattens appear unintentionally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Televisions work by constantly refreshing a string of lights across the screen, one line at a time. Especially on older displays, this refresh leaves flashes of colored and black lines, which happen too quickly for most human eyes to see.</p>
<p>However, your camera is closing it's shutter much faster than you process an image, allowing it to capture the incomplete image of the television screen, while your brain would fill in any noticable gaps with other information.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s called Aliasing. One example is the Moire effect. In general, when you sample something (like taking a picture) with a resolution that is coarser than some repeating features in the picture that are finer (that is, they have a higher spatial frequency), they get “aliased” and look like features of a lower spatial frequency, resulting in lines or bands. A similar example happens with video, when something rotating at a speed faster than the video sampling rate looks like it is rotating much slower, or even in the opposite direction (like sometimes the wheels of a car that seem to rotate backwards).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
