		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When light hits the back of your eye (the retina), each photon causes a change in a protein that then Cascades down signals to compose vision. This protein then has to be converted  back to the original state to accept another photon. This happens extremely  fast, but when I looking at bright light the conversion of back to normal can't occur fast enough. The process of converting the protein back to normal is what causes the spots to remain. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you turn off certain kinds of light bulbs they glow a little bit and then fade off because the chemicals that make them glow still have some electricity in them. Same with your eyes; they had such a strong light shined on them it takes those bits of your eye a while to go back to 'off'</p>
<p>Edit: spelling</p>
<p>Edit 2: As I suspected, my light bulb physics we're a bit invorrect.  See u/omgcowps4 below for how light bulbs actually work. As far as the ELI5, it's still conceptually accurate for anyone trying to get an answer to the original question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's like bedhead</p>
<p>If you lay down for a 10 minute nap, you probably won't get bedhead, as your hair that was displaced is easily fixed</p>
<p>If you lay down for 7 hours, when you wake up the part of your hair that was on the pillow is all bent at the follicle and it will take a long time to get back to normal, even with combing</p>
<p>So, the pressure on your head from the pillow is like the brightness of the light, and time asleep is like the time you're looking at the source.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
