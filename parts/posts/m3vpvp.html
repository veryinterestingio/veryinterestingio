<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The hippocampus is in charge of long term memory. The more things you study/memorize, it actually gets bigger. So if I wanted to learn &quot;How does multiplication work&quot; or &quot;Who are all of the named characters on Game of Thrones,&quot; the hippocampus holds onto that information. </p>
<p>The prefrontal cortex is in charge of short term memory. So let's assume I already know how multiplication works. And I need to answer the question... </p>
<p><strong>&quot;It takes 25 toothpicks to make one Iron Throne replica. It takes 20 more toothpicks to make a second Iron Throne replica that attaches alongside the first one like Legos. And 20 more toothpicks for a third Iron Throne, 20 more for a fourth, on and on. So how many toothpicks will you need to make 21 total Iron Thrones, sandwiched together in a row?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>The prefrontal cortex is where I would keep track of the figures that tell me &quot;21 Thrones... the first one has 25 toothpicks... so that's 25 toothpicks plus 20 more Thrones worth of toothpicks... it goes up by 20 each time... 20 times 20 is 400... that's 400 + 25. That's 425 toothpicks.&quot; It's where I juggle the &quot;live calculations.&quot;</p>
<p>But say someone tells me &quot;Now turn that into a math formula that anyone can use to figure out the amount of toothpicks needed for ANY amount of Iron Toothpick Thrones stuck together.&quot; What part of the brain is able to translate logic like that? </p>
<p>A good formula might be &quot;25 + 20(♥-1)&quot; where &quot;♥&quot; is the number of Thrones I need. But just because I can do math in my head doesn't mean I know how to take that logic and write it down in formula form.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>a bit of a correction,</p>
<p>Hippocampus is part of the limbic system, which turns the short term memory into long term through the circuit of Papez, this info is then stored in the Association cortexes. </p>
<p>while the Prefrontal cortex's main job is to plan out the actions before we do them, for example: &quot;I want to drink water, then:</p>
<p>Step 1: move X muscles so the hand would go down</p>
<p>Step 2: move Y muscles so the cup is held in the hand</p>
<p>Step3:..... etc&quot;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>what you're speaking of, in my best guess/estimation, would be the <a href="https://www.imaios.com/en/e-Anatomy/Anatomical-Parts/Angular-gyrus#:~:text=The%20angular%20gyrus%20is%20a,retrieval%2C%20attention%2C%20and%20theory%20of" target="_blank">Angular Gyrus</a>, damage to this area in the dominant hemisphere of the brain would cause Acalculia, or known as inability to calculate or use numbers. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>and just as a reminder, the brain is a huge complex network of neurons, it's not just one part does one thing, they all do everything, and interconnected, for simplification of this case, association Cortex remembers the amount of toothpicks needed for 1 throne, this info is then sent to the Angular gyrus, which then says &quot;alright, X toothpicks for 1 throne, for Y amount of thrones we're going to need X amount of toothpicks&quot;</p>
<p>now try to write that in a formula, the angular tells the association cortex &quot;what is a template for a formula? that we learned all the way back in 8th grade?&quot; the association cortex gives a template and the angular gyrus gives you the answer</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a fascinating question, especially since a lot of cognitive neuroscientists today might consider the parts of the brain that 'do language' separate from the parts that 'do math' (e.g., <a href="https://evlab.mit.edu/assets/papers/Fedorenko_et_al_2013_PNAS.pdf" target="_blank">Fedorenko et al., 2013</a>). So what's up with word problems, where you have to translate from a linguistic representation to a mathematical representation?</p>
<p>I don't want to get too far out of my wheelhouse here, but other posters are right, this is much more complicate than just one area. You need prefrontal cortex to keep all the individual units (working memory), parietal cortex to carry out the mathematical operations, temporal cortex to access any semantic (meaning) relationships that matter (what is a toothpick? what is lego?), etc. </p>
<p>A major question in cognitive neuroscience today is how mental faculties (like solving word problems) arise not because of computations in one brain area, but by way of the coordination of diverse computations carried out across multiple brain areas. So when we think of a &quot;cognitive operation&quot; like solving a word problem, we are thinking not of the output of one processing center, but of the output of a dynamic network assembled by the brain across multiple centers, and it is this kind of dynamic coordination in the human brain that allows us to flexibly do complex things like solve word problems (e.g., <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/112/37/11678.short" target="_blank">Braun et al., 2015</a>).</p>
<p>If you want to really get into this, I want to strongly recommend the book &quot;Number Sense: How the Mind Creates Mathematics&quot; by Stan Dehaene (who previously had an outstanding and accessible book about how the brain learns to read).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>for a cognitive process that complex, I seriously doubt it's just one part of the brain that is responsible.<br />
it's probably similar to reading and writing, since equations are essentially a written language. There is some evidence from fMRI studies that the temporal lobe, and specifically the inferior temporal gyrus, are important for both reading and writing, and for some mathemetical tasks, so that would be a good place to start looking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others are saying, many parts of the brain are going to be engaged in this process. At minimum I’d say:</p>
<p>-hippocampus, association areas, as discussed by u/acrosword20 </p>
<p>-Language areas: fronto-temporal cortex and inferior temporal gyrus are involved in number recognition and processing, and pre-frontalmotor cortices (for actually writing, imagining writing, speaking or sub-vocalizing the spoken words). </p>
<ul>
<li>visual areas (e.g., picturing the throne set up)</li>
</ul>
<p>-Prefrontal cortex which is going to handle “executive functions”, such as sustained attention, planning, sequencing, and inhibiting distracting stimuli. </p>
<p>Each person’s brain is different, duh. But what I mean is, the way you might go about solving that problem is likely different than how I would solve it. For example, I’m not a visual learning but I’m very word-oriented. So my brain might depend less of visual areas to solve a math equation than someone else. Someone else might be more auditory, so they might whisper the words to themselves as they think through the logic. That would activate motor and language parts of the brain, as well as auditory cortices. Anyway, all of this to say that I think brains are distributing problem solving and kind lots of different solutions to complex problems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To think of the brain this way is an oversimplification.</p>
<p>I wont get into details, others have already done that.</p>
<p>In doing any action, the brain is very decentralized.
This makws it hard for us to understand in our current models of computation because every modern computation model (like those in a CPU) are highly centralized and modular because a human needs to design and understand it.</p>
<p>The brain was created through an evolution algorithm, it is efficient and decentralized. When doing most things, you are not using some module of the brain but using a collection of parts of the brain and they all combine together like a symphony played by an orchestra. Sure you could say the strings are holding the melody, or even that the double base is the guiding rhythm, but to be accurate it only makes sense when the piece is played as a whole.</p>
<p>We think of the brain in segments or modules because our human brains have to break things down into classifications to understand them and put them into words. This is the same thing we do for color, objects, and everything else we think about.</p>
<p>The human brain is basically a very fancy classification algorithm. We seperate the vase in your living room from the rest of the world but that vase is as connected to the rest of the world as much as a branch is connected to the rest of the tree.</p>
<p>The same goes for you. Humans tend to view themselves as an independent observer, a conscious entity with free will. But our own actions, our own brain activity doesnt enter our awareness until after the brain has already done it. Your brain has a mechanism called &quot;the interpeter&quot; that looks a given mental state and makes up an assessment for it. </p>
<p>I highly recommend Dr. Michael Gazzaniga's gifford lectures. Particularly the one about the interpreter.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/mJKloz2vwlc" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/mJKloz2vwlc</a></p>
<p>The point is, humans think of themselves as if the universe is not also a function of them. You are as much the universe as a branch is the tree.</p>
<p>Now back to the brain. Neuroscientists seperate the brain into different pieces, to try and make it look like how we design our machines and how we process information to understand it better. But in reality, the brain is not modular, your hippocampus is a branch of the tree of the brain. There is not actually a &quot;hippocampus&quot;, thats an arbitrary line that humans have made. The brain does not operate according to that human defined modularity. </p>
<p>In short, the brain is a vast interconnected network of neurons, not a interconnected network of modular pieces.
A symphony of neurons.</p>
<p>Side Note: Im a robotics science guy that has studied a lot of AI and more recently on an adventure to understand the human brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
