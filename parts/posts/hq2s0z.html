<p>TL;DR: Realistically dark mode is just much more complicated than it seems on the surface, and there are many reasons why.</p>
<p>First is your design and how easy it is to translate to dark mode. Sure, you can go ahead and ctrl+f all whites to blacks and vice versa, but the result will be much like a negative photograph - it just looks and feels weird. Shadows meant for a light app will feel out of place on a dark background. You may find your brand colours do not fit at all in a dark theme. The list goes on, but to build a usable dark mode many things need to be slightly &quot;redesigned&quot; to fit a dark theme. And this is not a one-time task: having dark mode available also means that any new features will need to also be designed to work in it, which increases design work needed to ship new things.</p>
<p>From a software development perspective, implementing dark mode requires the overall theming of your app to be setup well, ideally such that you can change a single line of code to e.g. change the accent or background color across your entire app. This is pretty much a prerequisite for being able to have dark mode (the user clicks a button and the theme changes). Traditionally it has been quite rare that you would need to change your theme colors, which also means that many apps and websites are built without any such fancy theming system in place - colors are just hardcoded and other more important features have been prioritised. Or perhaps development of the app was started some time ago, when the entire idea of users being able to change the colors according to their preferences was not very trendy. In any case, if your app has not been built with a theming system in place, the effort required to implement such a system now – in a large project – might be many weeks of work and involves slightly editing almost every single file in your project. </p>
<p>Often development/design resources are limited and implementing dark mode would then mean that some other work will be delayed for however long it takes. In the end, dark mode is a purely quality-of-life update for an arguably niche user group and it can be very hard to convince your sales team that the value of adding dark mode is higher than all of the other things waiting on your roadmap.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very specific example: email readers... if I write an email to you using my light mode and use my brand colors, which are a dark purple and a burnt orange for the purposes of this discussion, for my signature, how should it render on your dark-mode email reader? How does the software know which colors to replace those purples and oranges with so as to preserve the integrity of the original message, while also allowing you to comfortably read it with the settings you have in place?</p>
<p>All this to say... So much of the web and apps are dependent on people to create content who are not the designers/developers that things like this take forever to think of, research, create a plan for, code, and test in order to create a usable product.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>3 major things:</p>
<p>1) Not every graphical item you see on the screen has easily configurable color controls. Web sites are generally 100% controlled by the developer, but for applications on your computer, a lot of the widgets drawn on the screen are set by the OS designers (Microsoft or Apple). Without them making changes to their OS and the widgets the OS provides, developers either don't have control, or have to go through every single widget and replace it with custom widgets where they were previously using standard OS widgets.</p>
<p>2) Not every graphical item you see on the screen is a drawn widget, some of them are pictures, JPGs or PNGs that are the colors that they are, and without extensive photoshoping couldn't be converted. Or something might be designed with transparency, that works really well as long as the background is white or some other light color, and looks terrible if the background is grey or some other dark color.</p>
<p>3) There's more to &quot;dark mode&quot; than just inverting all the colors. Both Windows and Mac OS already have the ability to just invert all the colors on the screen (on macOS, go to Preferences -&gt; Accesssibility -&gt; Display -&gt; Invert Colors, for windows Settings -&gt; Ease of Access -&gt; and either Color Filters or High Contrast). But if you go and invert the colors on your screen and then use your computer for a bit you'll find it looks kind of ugly in a lot of places and definitely doesn't look like the dark modes of your major apps. A lot of thought, time and effort goes into choosing color schemes and picking out the right set of colors that go together. To do dark mode properly, you have to do all of that same work, for an entirely different color palette. Doing that work takes time, and even if it's just one person, that person isn't doing other things while they're doing that work. So for every software developer, it's also a question of is it worth not doing X so that I can instead have &quot;dark mode&quot; for my application.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
