Many things have been hit by tiny bits, they have to be tough enough to take it.  The larger pieces are tracked, and paths chosen to fly around them.  Eventually we're going to have to start picking up the trash, but NASA projects to do that still seem too expensive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We watch for the big ones and avoid them.  The little ones tend to come from a similar source as the big ones so there's some clustering but even if you spread them all out evenly there really isn't that much debris compared to the amount of space out there.</p>
<p>Space is big! Mindbogglingly big, yadda yadda yadda.</p>
<p>There are about 128 million pieces of space debris with over 99% being smaller than 1 cm.  For easier math lets consider 1 Billion pieces that are each 1 meter wide floating in an orbit of 400 km(about the height of the ISS).  That makes 1 billion square meters of that shell unusable, but that that orbital shell is 183 trillion square meters so that generous assumption of debris takes up 0.00055% of the orbital real estate even in this conservative estimate.</p>
<p>In reality, satellites and the debris are spread around in a thick shell over Earth so they're quite spaced out.  Similar to flying through the asteroid belt, if you pick any random straight path the odds of you hitting something are very low.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While there is a lot of debris out there there is an awful lot more space out there, the debris is tracked by radar and visual reports so they know where things are and generally can avoid them, also the debris is concentrated in certain areas and levels. When they hit the speed normal means that they create even more debris so making the situation worse - <a href="https://youtu.be/Km2uemAqbbM" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/Km2uemAqbbM</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are about 128,000,000 <del>500,000</del> pieces of debris, many of them no larger than a grain of sand.  But space is big.</p>
<p>Now imagine you actually had that much sand.  It would fit into a cube about <del>2</del> 14 cm across.  You could easily hold it in <del>your hand</del> a bucket.  Now imagine that you spread that sand evenly across the entire United States.  If you had to drive from New York to Los Angeles, how worried would you be about running into one of those grains of sand.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that space is actually much larger than the United States...  Not just because it covers the whole globe but also because it is a volume, not a surface.  You might cross paths with a grain of sand but be a mile below it or a mile above it, easily.</p>
<p>On top of this, the large objects up there are constantly tracked, and an impact with a sand grain sized object is probably going to be survivable (it's happened before)</p>
