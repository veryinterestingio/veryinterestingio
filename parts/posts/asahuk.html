		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few of the &quot;broad categories&quot; that come to mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actual anatomy -- presence or absence of anatomical features, differences in relative sizes of anatomical features or organs, etc.</li>
<li>Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics -- how quickly drugs are taken up by the body, distributed within the body, metabolized, and excreted</li>
<li>Immune system response -- how the body reacts to foreign species (e.g. implanted devices)</li>
<li>General considerations about genetic diversity -- animal models may use individuals more closely related to one another than a human trial would, which can confound study effects</li>
</ul>
<p>There are more factors, to be sure. </p>
<p>I don't think that anyone using animal models of disease in their research expects the models to be perfect analogues of human physiology / biochemistry, but the idea is that the animal models are far closer to the &quot;real thing&quot; than an in-vitro test / cell culture or computer simulation would be. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Premise is flawed.</p>
<p>Actually many advances originally developed in animal models are functional and effective. Also, testing in animal models is a fundamental requirement for drug development and approval. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, drugs don't make it into the clinic for myriad reasons (not just non-efficacious, but also poor pharmacodynamics, negative interactions/adverse events, better alternative, patents and ownership, high cost, insufficient revenue possible, other business decisions, etc, etc). Many of these are uncovered at the animal model stage, but it's not &quot;lack of human translatability&quot; that halts development.</p>
<p>Many people also misunderstand how long it takes to develop drugs and/or other knowledge through a pipeline and how much it costs. Even if everything is perfect. Ten years is typical, and $1 billion from end to end is not unusual, where each clinical trial averages a median cost of $19 million . So, you should not expect a major therapeutic advance this year from an animal model/basic science story that broke last year... Also, something merely &quot;good&quot; and &quot;functional&quot; might not make the cut. With that kind of time and money on the line, pharmaceutical companies need to be ruthless with cutting pipelines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So we use animals as model systems to approximate human biological complexity. There are several problems in doing this. While it is true that we are very similar in terms of genes to mice etc., there are fundamental differences. Our genes are always a little different due to mutations accrued during evolutionary time - so they are often different in terms of absolute sequence. Sometimes the same gene in different species, even closely related ones, can have different functions. This is not too common, but even uncommon events in a large enough population begin to add up and this divergence results in global unpredictability.  </p>
<p>In addition to this, a large portion of our genome codes for the remains of retroviruses that have integrated into our ancestors genomes. This &quot;endovirome&quot; is tightly regulated and while most of it has been inactivated some of it is active (especially L1 elements) - causing gene duplications and inversions  (jumping genes) etc. This causes genes to be duplicated and even appear in new regions. More often, this activity leads to vastly diverse networks of gene regulation sequences that are markedly different between species.   </p>
<p>tl;dr</p>
<p>Different genes and differences in their regulation mean that discoveries in mice don't directly translate into understanding human biology.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m on mobile so I apologize for formatting.</p>
<p>To make an effective model, you want at least three things: construct, face and predictive validity. Construct validity means your animal model of a disease recapitulates the same mechanism that occurs in humans. In infectious diseases, this means you would infect your animal with the same virus/bacterium/etc. that causes disease in humans.
Face validity is when the phenotype is the same- if pathogen A causes cold sores and respiratory illness in a mouse model and in humans, then the mouse model has some face validity. Predictive validity is when your animal model’s disease progression is similar and treatments given to the animal model affect the same symptoms in humans- basically, does your understanding of the animal model translate well to the human case?</p>
<p>There are a few issues that arise for all of these.</p>
<p>CONSTRUCT- (I’m mostly gonna talk about genes)
1) With the advent of genetic engineering technologies, construct validity should be clear cut for diseases with genetic bases. While this is mostly the case for monogenic diseases (diseases caused by specific mutations in a single gene), most diseases are not the result of alterations in a single gene. Oftentimes, many genes can come into play, with the types of mutations in some genes having downstream effects on other genes. Some patterns of gene inheritance can be deleterious, while others are protective. Also, this doesn’t account for environmental factors that can further alter genetic mechanisms with time. This means that for some more complex diseases (most are not monogenic), our understanding of the mechanism is lacking, so we can’t even make models that are true to the human disease.
2) Human genes are not always like non-human genes. For example, in the human, one gene can come in several variants, with only one of them being associated with disease; in the mouse, the same gene may only have one form. In this case, we cannot copy the exact mechanism to create a model with precise construct validity.
3) Mouse genes are easy to manipulate. So are fly genes. Rat genes are a bit harder, but we’re getting there. Precise manipulation of genetics in monkeys, even small ones like marmosets? A ways away- there are emerging techniques and some small successes, but only with select genes, and we are nowhere near what we can do with mice. And evolutionarily, humans and monkeys are much closer (and presumably more biologically similar) than humans and mice. That means we have to make lots of compromises when we make animal models.</p>
<p>FACE-
How do we know our models feel the same as humans? In the case of diseases and disorders of the brain with cognitive issues, how do we measure phenotypes in a mouse or a rat? Schizophrenia is very cognitive- how can we tell if a mouse is having hallucinations? How can we ask animals to report symptoms that aren’t easily measured? If we can’t measure it, we can’t tell if our treatments are working effectively without trying it in humans first. This isn’t the case as much in things like cancer or diseases where symptoms are visible/easily measurable, but is for brain disorders or things like fibromyalgia.</p>
<p>PREDICTIVE-
I’ll just give some examples here. Lifespans can be an issue for studying aging and its related diseases. There are problems human bodies have to deal with due to average lifespans on the scale of decades that mouse bodies don’t have to address- metabolic processes will be different, as will the accumulation of damage over time. When it comes to brain diseases, humans have a lot more frontal cortex, which can often make up for in other parts of the brain, that popular animals like mice can’t.</p>
<p>To answer your question briefly, it turns out making the models properly in the first place is hard, for various reasons, and disease mechanisms are more complicated than we hoped for. We can approximate a lot of stuff, but as you point out, that’s usually not good enough for things to work in humans as well as they do in other animals. As my advisor says, it’s a great time to be a mouse, as we can cure just about anything in them— but humans still need a bit more luck.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
