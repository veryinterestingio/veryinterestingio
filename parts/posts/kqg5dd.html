		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is usually a distinction between racing games and racing simulators. A racing simulator will try to replicate the exact stats of the cars they are simulating. Car manufacturer may share their data from the design, especially for a car that have not been launched or is otherwise unavailable. However racing simulators prefer getting their hands on the actual car and race it around with instruments so they can measure the actual characteristics of the car.</p>
<p>Racing games on the other hand allow themselves to change the simulator model for the cars to get a better gaming experience. It is usually no fun racing around if all the cars behave the same except that some are just faster the others. So they tend to make the cars have more similar lap times but make them more different in other ways. They might change the handling characteristics, how fast they corner versus high speed, how hard they are to set up, how much fuel and tyres they use, etc. This tends to make for a more engaging gaming experience on the cost of accuracy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a huge amount of variables that go into car performance in modern racing games. Back in the mid 2000s with games like Need for Speed, it was pretty much just guesswork and arcade physics. But in games like Forza Horizon 4, you can go into the stats page and see a ridiculous wealth of information about cars. They go as far as to model things like suspension travel, hundreds of different types of surfaces, even tire width, all in the name of getting performance as realistic as possible. They also work closely with most manufacturers to get as close as possible to reality.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
