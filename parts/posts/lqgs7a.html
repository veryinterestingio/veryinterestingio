		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello everyone, thank you for joining the Reddit AMA for rare diseases. To start, we’d like to provide the U.S. definition for a rare disease (as defined in the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, and the Rare Disease Act of 2002): In the United States, a rare disease is defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in this country. Rare diseases are sometimes called orphan diseases, and we tend to use “rare disease” and “orphan disease” interchangeably.</p>
<p>A few FAQs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most rare diseases are genetic disorders, typically affecting a single gene.</li>
<li>At the current time, there are about 7,000 different rare diseases, each affecting only a few hundred to a few thousand people (sometimes fewer). As we continue to uncover the <a href="https://www.omim.org/" target="_blank">underlying genetics of more rare diseases</a>, the number of known rare diseases increases by about 200-250 diseases each year.</li>
<li>Only about 5% of rare diseases have an FDA-approved treatment. (The FDA estimates about 450-500 drugs and biologics are approved to treat a variety of rare diseases)</li>
<li>NIH devoted around $6 billion to rare diseases research in Fiscal Year 2019. This research is very diverse, ranging from basic science to translational science to clinical trials in a broad array of diseases and conditions.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://ncats.nih.gov/" target="_blank">National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)</a> within NIH has identified rare diseases as a priority research area. Some examples of NCATS-supported rare diseases research programs include:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/" target="_blank">Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN)</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/" target="_blank">Genetics and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD)</a>. Did you know GARD can accept individual inquiries for rare diseases questions and concerns? You may contact a GARD information specialist at 1-888-205-2311, or <a href="https://ncats.force.com/gccinquiries/GccInquiryFormEn" target="_blank">online</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://ncats.nih.gov/trnd" target="_blank">Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases program (TRND)</a>. TRND works with companies, academic centers and patient groups to further preclinical development of candidate therapies, with the goal of moving these candidates toward clinical trials.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://pave-gt.ncats.nih.gov/" target="_blank">Platform Vector Gene Therapy program (PaVe-GT)</a>.  PaVe-GT is a new program whose goal is to try to develop 4 gene therapies for 4 diseases in parallel to try to improve the efficiency of gene therapy development.</li>
<li>Please visit the <a href="https://ncats.nih.gov/" target="_blank">NCATS website</a> for more information.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Rare Disease Day at NIH will virtually take place on March 1. Please join us! <a href="https://events-support.com/events/NIH_Rare_Disease_Day" target="_blank">Registration is open</a>.<br />

<p>As rare disease experts, how often do you actually see these rare diseases? Are they not rare to you anymore? </p>
<p>Is it hard to feel competent handling these if they are too rare? How do you get past this?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
