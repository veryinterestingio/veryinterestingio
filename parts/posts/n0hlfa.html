		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eye movement is one of the most complicated aspects of the nervous system. There are 6 main muscles and 3 main nerves that control each eye around 3 axes. As others are saying it's very common for the left eye to look right and the right eye to look left at the same time (i.e. cross-eyed)—this happens when we look at something close to us and is called convergence.</p>
<p>However, we are generally not able to make the left eye look left and the right eye look right at the same time. This is due to a connection in the brainstem called the medial longitudinal fasiculus (MLF). This is a difficult ELI5.</p>
<p>If you want your left eye to look left, you need the left lateral rectus muscle, which is controlled by the left abducens nerve (cranial nerve VI).</p>
<p>If you want your right eye to look left, you need the right medial rectus muscle, which is controlled by the right oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III).</p>
<p>The MLF runs from the abducens nucleus on one side to the oculomotor nucleus on the other side and is activated whenever the brain activates the abducens nerve, so when your brain sends a signal to look left with your left eye, your right eye also gets a signal to look left.</p>
<p>Thus in people who are neurologically intact, when one eye moves outwards, the other eye essentially always follows. The MLF specifically can be affected by a variety of neurologic disorders, classically multiple sclerosis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nothing really. If you hold your finger in front of your nose and focus on it, you're technically looking left and right at the same time, because at this point your right eye is looking left and your left eye is looking right.</p>
<p>If you're talking about moving your eyes independently of each other on purpose, that doesn't really work because your brain is trying to control your eye muscles in such a way that they're both looking at the same thing. If they weren't, you'd be suffering from diplopia (double vision) and you'd likely get dizzy. There are certain neurological conditions that cause the eyes not to be looking at the same thing(pointing in different directions), and people suffering from those conditions usually have to wear an eye patch in order not to have problems with double vision.</p>
<p>Of course some animals can move their eyes independently of each other, but those are usually animals with the eyes on the side of their heads, so independent movement can give them a wide field of view.</p>
<p>For predators that tend to have both eyes facing forward, independent movement wouldn't really help much in expanding the field of view, but you'd lose the perception of depth, so it makes sense that this is not a skill that has evolved in humans, and that your brain can't really make sense of the situation if due to some kind of condition your eyes aren't looking at the same thing. There's no real advantage if both eyes have roughly the same field of vision and you don't get more 'coverage' by moving them independently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Oculomotor system consists of a bunch of muscles controlled by cranial nerve innervation and eye movements. Basically, when you try to look in a certain direction, your brain tries to inhibit the movement preventing that while simultaneously stimulating the movement which allows it. If there’s an object in front of you, for example, if you move both eyes to the left, in order to stay focused on it in front of you you would need to activate the right lateral rectus (moves right eye to the right) and inhibit the right medial rectus (movies right eye left) while stimulating the left eye medial rectus (moves left eye right) and inhibiting the left lateral rectus (left eye left). It is quite complicated and there are also other factors which play into it, but basically our set point for coordinated eye movement is to optimize what we can see and prevent defect in vision. Being able to activate both lateral rectus on each eye (right eye right and left eye left simultaneously) is not really feasible unless you were somehow trained to do so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its pretty easy to do it.  Look at your nose, now look left.  You will feel only your left eyeball moving.  concentrate on feeling of that one eyeball moving so your brain learns which muscle it is moving.  Now do it the other direction.  Keep doing this and you will train your brain to be able to address each eyeball somewhat independently.   Next step, freak drunk people out at parties.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
