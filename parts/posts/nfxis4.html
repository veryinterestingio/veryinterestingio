		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Babies don't speak any language so they have no way of knowing when you're talking to them or not.  Knowing whether or not an adult is talking to them is critical for a baby to learn language.  </p>
<p>Speaking in an artificially high voice is a way to tell the baby &quot;pay attention to me now, I'm saying words to you and using body language to help you figure out what I'm talking about.&quot;</p>
<p>Conversely, babies know to ignore you when you speak in a normal voice.  This way they don't learn incorrect word associations because you were talking about one thing but pointing at another.</p>
<p>This is also why you feel compelled to repeat simple words while gesturing over and over again when using baby speak - IE, saying &quot;thats your hand&quot; &quot;that's my head&quot; &quot;that's the door&quot; ect...</p>
<p>In other words, humans have an alternate language set that they use to program normal language into babies - &quot;baby speak.&quot;  Babies, on the other hand, are hardwired to pay attention to baby speak and ignore normal language.</p>
<p>Humans use baby speak when talking to cute animals because cute animals have many of the same physical identifiers as babies (IE, they have big eyes, make high pitched noises, act clumsy and stupid, ect...).  Those physical identifiers trigger you to try to program language into cute animals and so you use baby speak when talking to them.  </p>
<p>In essence, humans use baby speak when talking to cute animals because a pattern recognition error in your brain causes you to identify them as babies, causing you to enter a state in which you feel compelled to teach them language.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It gets their attention. I believe (I would need a source check) that babies and pets are more sensitive to higher pitches, and thus react more to them. It also helps make an association of &quot;high pitch=friendly and happy&quot; without them needing to understand the particular words used.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One other point nobody's made: Babies are smol. Smol voices are, as a matter of physics, higher-pitched than bigfolk voices. And humans have some amount of &quot;mirror what the person I'm talking to is sounding like, and doing&quot; also evolved into their brains, as the mirror neurons that let us realize other people are people, and understand what their expressions and actions might mean, leak through into our own actions.</p>
<p>So when you're talking to a baby, the high-pitched is coming, in part, because the baby itself is high-pitched compared to older folk. Happens with children too, though not to such an extent, especially with that syrupy sweet &quot;fake&quot; voice some adults condescend to them with. Ditto puppies and kittens vs cats &amp; dogs. Etc.</p>
<p>--Dave, and we're also a bit programmed to know that something with a big head, big eyes, big paws, and small body/tail, especially a wobbly one, is probably a baby of its kind. Thus why chibi are drawn the way they are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, some animals, cats for example, work at higher pitched levels. If I call me cats in a normal tone, they ignore, because its not what their brains focus on. They do with higher pitched, because thats the level they vocalize at.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
