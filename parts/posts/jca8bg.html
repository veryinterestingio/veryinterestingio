		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I understand that electrons can be entangled through a variety of methods. This entanglement ties their two spins together with the result that when one is measured, the other's measurement is predictable.</p>
<p>I have done considerable &quot;internet research&quot; on the properties of entangled subatomic particles and concluded with a design for data transmission. Since scientific consensus has ruled that such a device is impossible, my question must be: <em>How is my understanding of entanglement properties flawed, given the following design?</em></p>
<p><strong>Creation:</strong> </p>
<p>A group of sequenced entangled particles is made, A (length <em>La</em>). A1 remains on earth, while A2 is carried on a starship for an interstellar mission, along with a clock having a constant tick rate K relative to earth (compensation for relativistic speeds is done by a computer).</p>
<p><strong>Data Transmission:</strong></p>
<p>The core idea here is the idea that you can &quot;set&quot; the value of a spin. I have encountered little information about how quantum states are measured, but from the look of the Stern-Gerlach experiment, once a state is exposed to a magnetic field, its spin is simultaneously measured and held at that measured value. To change it, just keep &quot;rolling the dice&quot; and passing electrons with incorrect spins through the magnetic field until you get the value you want. To create a custom signal of bit length <em>La</em>, the average amount of passes will be proportional to the (square/factorial?) of <em>La</em>. </p>
<p><strong>Usage:</strong></p>
<p>If the previously described process is possible, it is trivial to imagine a machine that checks the spins of the electrons in A2 at the clock rate K. To be sure it was receiving non-random, current data, a timestamp could come with each packet to keep clocks synchronized. K would be constrained both by the ability of the sender to &quot;set&quot; the spins and the receiver to take a snapshot of spin positions.</p>
<p>So yeah, please tell me how wrong I am.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You do have a misunderstanding of Quantum Entanglement, but it's not really your fault- pop-sci articles almost all screw up describing what entanglement really is. Entanglement is essentially conservation laws, on the sub-atomic level. Here's an example:</p>
<p>Imagine you and I are on ice skates, and we face each other and push off from each other so we head in opposite directions. Now, if there is someone on the other end of the ice skating rink, they can measure your velocity and mass, and then, without ever seeing me, they can know my momentum- it has to be opposite yours. In classical physics, we call this the &quot;conservation of momentum&quot; but if we were sub-atomic we'd have &quot;entangled momentum.&quot; </p>
<p>Now, taking this (admittedly, limited) analogy further, imagine you're heading backwards, but then you start to skate, instead of just slide. By doing that, our momentums are no longer &quot;linked&quot; at all- knowing your momentum does not allow anyone to know anything about mine. Our momentums are no longer &quot;linked&quot; or &quot;entangled.&quot; </p>
<p>It's the same with sub-atomic particles. Entanglement happens all the time, but just as frequently, entanglement breaks. So, it's true. You could have spin 0 (no angular momentum) particle decay into two particles, one spin up, the other spin down (one with positive angular momentum, the other with negative so their sum is zero- that's the conservation laws in practice), and then you could take your particle on a space ship, travel as far away as you wanted, and measure the spin of your particle, and you would instantly know the spin of my particle. But, if you changed the spin of your particle, that effect does not transfer to mine at all. That's like you starting to skate- the entanglement is broken. </p>
<p>Now, to go a little further, entanglement isn't &quot;just&quot; conservation laws, otherwise why would it have it's own name, and so much confusion surrounding it. The main difference is that with entangled particles, it's not just that we haven't measured the spin of one so we know the spin of the other yet- it's that until one is measured, neither have a defined spin (which- I actually don't like saying it this way. Really, both are a superposition of spins, which is just as valid of a state as spin up/down, but measuring will always collapse the state to an eigenstate, but this is a whole other topic). So, it's not a lack of knowledge, it's that until a measurement takes place, the particle states are undetermined. </p>
<p>Why does this matter, and how do we know that it's truly undetermined until we measure? We know, because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem" target="_blank">Bell's Theorem</a>. Bell's theorem has a lot of awesome uses- for example, it allows you to detect if you have an eavesdropper on your line so you can securely transmit data which cannot be listened in on (you can read about it more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_cryptography" target="_blank">here</a>). </p>
<p>This is a topic that can be written about forever, but I think that's a good start of a summary and if you have any questions, feel free to follow up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's where you're going wrong:</p>
<p>You can't <em>set</em> the spin of an entangled particle. Any way you try to do that, you'll just break the entanglement.</p>
<p>You can <em>measure</em> the spin of an entangled particle, and once you do, you can <em>know</em> the other particle has the opposite spin. But that doesn't communicate anything. You can't send any information just by measuring your entangled particle, you had no control over the outcome.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Quantum entanglement <em>can</em> be used for really effective encryption, though. The trick is that there are two axes that you can choose to measure spin. For simplicity sake, let's call them horizontal and vertical. If both sides measure spin in the same axis, they'll find particles with the entangled property: the spins will be opposite. However, if one side measures spin in the horizontal axis, and the other measures spin in the vertical axis, they'll get unentangled, random results. ----- So, let's assume each side gets a supply of one half of a pair of entangled particles, and they each use the same secret key to generate a pseudorandom sequence of 0s and 1s, and use that sequence to decide which axis to measure. The measurements produce a new sequence of 0s and 1s, which each can simply xor on one end and xnor on the other end to encrypt and decrypt a series of transmitted &amp; received bits.</p>
<p>No eavesdropper can mess with the stream of entangled particles because they won't know which axis to measure spin (it's a shared secret). If they measure a particle on the wrong axis, they've broken the entanglement and cause the communications to fail any simple verification, such as packet checksum or CRC check.</p>
<p>This provides the basics of a secure communications stream. In practice, you'd like to communicate more bits at a higher rate than the rate of the stream of entangled particles, so this basic secure stream is used to provide dynamic encryption keys for an even higher data rate information stream. Since no one can eavesdrop on the secure stream and get the dynamic encryption keys, no one can eavesdrop and decode the higher rate information stream either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The issue is that if you take two entangled particles and isolate them, they <em>individually</em> behave as if they are in the so-called “fully mixed” state. </p>
<p>Fully mixed means: any measurement is completely unpredictable. Random. Decohered. Uniform probability distribution over all outcomes whatever the measurement basis. </p>
<p>So the individual measurement outcomes are random every time. The separated observers couldn’t distinguish between two entangled-but-separated particles from two fully independent and mixed state particles. </p>
<p>Until they compare notes. By communicating their measurement basis and outcomes for each individual measurement, they will be astounded to find superclassical correlations. But if they need to communicate anyway, the entanglement doesn’t add anything. </p>
<p>The protocol is great for encryption (google quantum key distribution) but can’t transmit information directly.</p>
<p>Edit: I’ll add that during my undergrad quantum mechanics course I hit the same stumbling block and had a very similar question as you and it took years to fully wrap my head around the math that proves it just won’t work. So you’re on the right track :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The tl;dr is that is that &quot;measurement&quot; does <em>not</em> allow you to <em>choose</em> what eigenstate you measure, what eigenstate is collapsed to. When you measure an entangled particle, you collapse the previous (possibly entangled) state to a special eigenstate, a physically measurable value (up or down, those are the only choices of spin), but you cannot <em>choose</em> which value is the outcome of the measurement of that originally-entangled-state. You and your relativistically-separated partner can measure together, but it's basically like flipping a coin together. You each flip the coin, and you each see the same result of every flip, but neither of you can ever control the result of the flip.</p>
<p>If you try to control the result of the flip, then you're changing the original state anyways and destroying the entanglement.</p>
<p>Therefore, the only way to assign meaning to your entangled readings is to already have pre-established the meaning of your coin flips, before you separate the entangled particle-coins. Once separated, you can never transmit any new information, you can only agree to which results the coin flips had.</p>
<p>(The common example is to decide a battle strategy; if you have a variety of choices of battle strategy, which rely on perfect coordination between two relativistically-separated ships, then entanglement allows you to choose from among those options at random, quite literally preventing espionage since the choice isn't made until the battle starts; however, the only way to actually know what the choices are, what the coin flips <em>mean</em>, is to have agreed to those choice of plans before you separate the entangled particles. They don't allow you to communicate <em>new</em> plans (for instance if the ability to execute one of those plans has disappeared after separation, the one ship will never be able to tell the other except by undoing the separation), they only let you coordinate your choice of old plans. It's good that it doesn't let you communicate new plans, but even coordinating known plans at a distant is indeed quite spooky, even if it's not true communication.)</p>
<p>Indeed, as the other guy says, if you <em>insist</em> on choosing your measurement outcomes, that means changing the state, and changing the state by definition destroys the entanglement, so any further measurements thereafter aren't related to those of the other group. Any particle you run thru a Stern-Gerlach set up loses its entanglement.</p>
<p>Now, if you want to know more about wavefunctions:</p>
<p>Particles states (&quot;wavefunctions&quot;) exist as combinations of <em>eigen</em>states. That's a mathematical word, and its meaning is not directly important here. We can sort of illustrate it like so:</p>
<p>We could perhaps compare a wavefunction of two possible states with a compass. A flat area has two major dimensions/directions, call them North and East. It's kinda arbitrary which directions are North and East, but the key thing is that you can pick one direction as North, wherever you like, and then East is automatically perpendicular to North. Then, <em>any other</em> direction can be described as some combination of East and North on your compass. A heading of 45°, NE, is equal parts North and East; a heading of 210°, a sort of WestSouthWest, is about one half of negative East (which is to say, 1/2 West) and about sqrt(3)/2 of negative North (did you take trig in highschool? if so, you recognize these numbers). So heading of 210° is about sqrt(3) more negative-North than negative-East. Ultimately, every direction is just a combination of your two perpendicular <em>base</em> directions.</p>
<p>The screwball thing about quantum mechanics -- I mean really, really screwball, is that <em>only</em> the <em>base</em> states (called <em>eigen</em>states for mathematical reasons) represent physical quantities. In the non-quantum world, any direction is possible; in the quantum world, you can <em>only</em> go North or East (if direction were quantized, which it is not, this is only an analogy). For an actually quantized property, like spin or momentum, there are gaps between quantum-allowed states. Spin can only be up or down, there is no sideways or slightly-sideways or mostly-sideways like with a real billiards ball or something. (Even &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; is a misnomer -- the point is that there's only two of them, and they're opposite, and we have to call them <em>something</em>, so we call them &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; for convenience.)</p>
<p>When something hasn't been measured recently, and has interacted with some environment around it, then its state gets pushed around the compass to any combination of North and East/Up and Down. <em>Measurement</em>, by definition, means getting a physically allowed value, and that can only be Up or Down, North or East. Whenever we <em>look</em> at the quantum compass, it only ever reads North or East, Up or Down, never the other directions. But all the other directions are states that can be made by interaction with other particles -- but when we measure it, it always shrinks back to North or East or Up or Down. (The key thing is that <em>which</em> of North and East it points to is proportional to how much of North and East are in current direction. That 210° we discussed before would yield North with probability 3/4 (square of -sqrt(3)/2), and East with probability 1/4 (square of 1/2).)</p>
<p>So when you entangle a pair of particles, you arrange that they share some conserved quantity -- most typically spin. If they're entangled to have a total spin of 0, then when you measure one spin Up, the other must be spin Down. This is kind of like saying that their compass directions must be pointed perpendicular to each other -- we don't know <em>where</em> they point, only that where they point is perpendicular, and when we measure one and force it back to pointing North or East (Up or Down), the other must still be perpendicular, and thus must be pointing East or North (Down or Up). This is the weird part of quantum mechanics, is that we know before the measurement that the particles are entangled, that their compass directions are perpendicular, but when we <em>measure</em> the one, and somehow <em>find</em> the needle pointing to the <em>allowed</em> base state, North or East, <em>the relativistically-separated entangled pair-needle also moves in exactly the same way to stay perpendicular</em>. That's the crazy spooky part. We can't transmit information because we can't <em>choose</em> which of North or East, Up or Down, that &quot;our&quot; particle collapses to, but when our particle collapses, is forced to point back to North or East, so does the other distant particle in perfect harmony. That's really weird, even tho it can't transmit information. (The <em>how</em> of a measurement forcing a particle back to a base state is fundamentally random, according to all human experiments thus far. Utterly, mathematically random, a fundamental randomness about the universe that we don't understand, and indeed may not be understandable, but that gets into really tough and weird branches of mathematics that I'm not totally familiar with myself.)</p>
<p>Of course, once both particles have collapsed back to North or East, their compass drifts away from the base states in totally independent manners, since they're causally separated. Their needles point totally apart, instead of staying fixed perpendicular to each other. Once measured, the entanglement is gone (even tho the entanglement forced that first measurement to be in total harmony between the two particles). As they interact with their environment, the two particles' needles do totally different things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The core idea here is the idea that you can &quot;set&quot; the value of a spin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not really. Or rather, if you do, you destroy the entanglement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To change it, just keep &quot;rolling the dice&quot; and passing electrons with incorrect spins through the magnetic field until you get the value you want. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Same here, you can't rinse and repeat, each entangled particle only gives you one roll of that dice. Once it's rolled, the entanglement is gone and any further measurements on that particle are totally unrelated to its partner across the galaxy. If you brought N entangled particles, you get N dice rolls and no way to control the outcome of any of those rolls -- they're all truly random. The skater analogy is a good one. Two skaters that pushed off each other only have <em>entangled</em> momentum as long as neither of them pushes off again. Measuring the particle == the skater pushing off again and ruining the  entanglement.</p>
<p>Now, this compass analogy has its own problems for a variety of reasons, but the key part is that quantum states, wavefunctions, are combinations of <em>base</em> states, and that only the <em>base</em> states are actually physically allowed values of the property in question (location, momentum, spin, etc), but that all the <em>combinations</em> of base states are &quot;allowed&quot; under the hood, mathematically; Bell's inequality states that we can actually experimentally determine the difference between the needles &quot;secretly&quot; pointing and North or East before we look at the needle, and the needle actually pointing somewhere else until we look, and wildly enough, it's the latter. The needle does in fact point elsewhere until we look at it, and when we look at it, it must be North or East, but when we're not looking, the needle definitely moves away from North and East, rather than just &quot;secretly&quot; being fixed to one or the other. Quantum mechanics is <em>really</em> <strong>really</strong> weird.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
