		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have just announced the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/nasas-parker-solar-probe-sheds-new-light-on-the-sun/" target="_blank">first results</a> from Parker Solar Probe, NASA’s mission to touch the Sun!</p>
<p>Parker Solar Probe has flown closer to the Sun than any spacecraft has gone before, and its data from this region has given us insight into how the Sun releases the solar wind, clouds of solar material, and powerful bursts of energetic particles. The spacecraft also sent new views of what the dust environment is like near the Sun. These findings are based on data from the
spacecraft’s first two orbits. With 21 more solar flybys scheduled, there’s still much more to learn.</p>
<p>Ask us anything about what we’ve learned so far and what we’re looking forward to studying next!</p>
<p>Joining us today at 2 p.m. ET (19 UT) are:</p>

I know that now that the Voyager I mission has made it into interstellar space that NASA has measured an increase in the turbulence of gas on small length scales compared with what's &quot;expected&quot; from other interstellar medium measurements (i.e., jargon-y: the power spectrum shows a bump at large wavenumbers). With Parker solar probe really looking at the solar wind/interplanetary plasma right up against the Sun, do you find similar oddities at the same or even smaller scales than what Voyager I has probed? A complete departure? Something even crazier?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
