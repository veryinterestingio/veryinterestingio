		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In order for your body to get nutrients out of food it needs to break it down into smaller and simpler pieces. Your stomach makes a strong acid to help with this, but it's a bad idea to make it all the time because that acid can damage the stomach. Because of this, your body will try to predict when you usually eat and start making this acid beforehand so that it's ready for the food.</p>
<p>If you go a long time without eating when you normally would, this excess acid can irritate your stomach and esophagus which then causes nausea and discomfort. </p>
<p>Sipping water can help dilute the acid and will also help prevent dehydration (we get a lot of water from our food).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not everyone gets nauseous though some do. I get hunger pangs when I haven’t eaten but essentially it comes down to the pH of your stomach contents which varies depending on what you’re eating/drinking. Having a high carb snack when you’re hungry can help with nausea as well as just drink some water. It gives your stomach a feeling of “fullness” and so you’re less likely to get cramps</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's low blood sugar if you get hungry enough and don't have proteins/fats getting digested more slowly.  What I want to know is why tf morning sickness is a thing?  It's the so-hungry-you're-nauseous thing but constant and also bad enough that your appetite is gone. I can't figure out how this is in any way an advantage for humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Feeling nauseous bescuse you haven't ate is both your body and mind telling you that they want food. There is like 80 different reasons for feeling nauseous because you haven't eaten so don't expect a completely clear answer. </p>
<p>Most of it stems from the switch between running on the calories in your stomach or the fat you've stored in your body. </p>
<p>The brain can and will only run on sugar. So you body transforms the fat into something like sugar called ketones.
You brain functions just fine on ketones but the switch has that nauseous feeling you talk about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The correct term is nauseated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you feel nauseous or nauseated?
The word nauseated means “to be affected with nausea” or “to feel sick to your stomach.” Nauseous describes “something that causes a feeling of nausea.” These words have the same root word, nausea, a Latin word that refers specifically to seasickness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn't know the difference until 35 so I'm spreading the live, lol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
