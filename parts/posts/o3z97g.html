Here's a copy/paste from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1m3yql/since_time_is_relative_how_do_we_define_it_when/cc5kh6z" target="_blank">my answer to an old /r/askscience thread on the topic that included lots of good discussion.</a></p>
<hr />
<p>It depends on how we measure it, but all reasonable reference frames give about the same value.</p>
<p>The most precise measurements are based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background" target="_blank">Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)</a>.  There is a convenient reference frame called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comoving_coordinates#Comoving_coordinates" target="_blank">comoving frame</a>, in which the CMB light coming from all directions is equally redshifted.  This is also the reference frame in which the universe is the oldest, and is the reference frame we use when doing most cosmology.</p>
<p>Our solar system is moving at about 371 km/s relative to the comoving frame, which gives a time dilation factor of only 1.0000008, which is why it doesn't matter much what (reasonable) reference frame we pick.  In this frame the universe is only about 10,000 years younger, out of 13.8 billion years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The oldest anything in the universe could be is 13.8 billion years old. This would be a hypothetical object that came into existence at the big bang and has been stationary (called comoving) relative to the cosmic microwave background for its entire existence. You are correct that there is no universal time for the whole universe, and any reference frame is valid, but using the CMB makes the most sense since it's the leftover radiation from the big bang.</p>
<p>It's also important to note that most parts of the universe are pretty close to being comoving with the CMB, so most of the universe is pretty close to this age. The only places where you'd expect a large difference in the measure of elapsed time would be close to massive objects like black holes and things that have been moving at relativistic speeds for most of the existence of the universe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>We are trying to measure the age of our part of the universe. The assumption is that physics works the same in every part of the universe so if we could instantly teleport to the farthest place we can see and take a measurement there we would get the same answer.</p>
<p>Of course time dilation, univers expansion and the like produced some interesting effects like Methuselah star:</p>

<p>And we're not even so sure about the 13.8 billion years old part:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several good answers here, but I think it's worth mentioning how rare relativistic things are. Most things in space tend to be moving at about 0.1% the speed of light. Now that seems fast, but it turns out the relativistic effects that make clocks move differently are very small until you hit about 90% the speed of light. You can also change the clock's speed with heavy gravity, but again you need to be near a black hole for that to matter.</p>
<p>Overall, you get that for pretty much all the clocks out there, the age of the universe is going to be the same, give or take a few thousand years.</p>
<p>Last thing worth noting is the cosmic microwave background. Basically there was a time the universe was full of gas that was so hot we can still see the glow from it today. You can tell from this glow whether you are moving with respect to that gas, so you can use it as a reference point for a standard speed, and so a standard clock, for the universe. As I describe above, it doesn't make much difference to account for this, but it's pretty cool.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
