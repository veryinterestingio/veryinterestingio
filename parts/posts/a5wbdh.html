		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many different browns.  As other posters described, you can get them by mixing many different colors together.  Many color blends are this way, which is why individuals with tetrachromatic vision see different color blends. When the brain sees a mix of various frequencies, it puts them together as a muddy brown. Purple and pink also have no single frequency, but are a mix of frequencies.</p>
<p>There is the raw color with wavelength around 600 nm, right around the transition from yellow to orange, <a href="https://learn.parallax.com/sites/default/files/content/shield/robo_ch6/wave.jpg" target="_blank">that is a golden brown.</a> That color shows up in a rainbow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of answers are saying that brown is a mix of other colors in the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, etc.), but I feel this is misleading on how the eye interprets light into colors. All colors can be gotten as a combination of other colors. </p>
<p>The shortest and best answer in my opinion is that brown IS in the rainbow, as it's just dark orange, and orange is in the rainbow. You don't see &quot;dark&quot; versions of any of the other colors, either, in the rainbow. That's because darkness is just low levels of light. If there were an area of the rainbow that let out low levels of orange such that it would be &quot;dark&quot;, it would just get drowned out by the brighter blue sky behind it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Color&quot; can mean quite a few things, depending on context. Let's start from the physics and move up from there.</p>
<hr />
<p>First, there's the physics of color. A unit of light is called a photon, and in many ways, it's like a wave. The distance between the peaks of the wave is called the <em>wavelength</em>, and its this distance that determines the properties of the light. There's an infinite range of possible wavelengths for light, but only a narrow band is visible to the eye. <a href="http://energywavetheory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Photon-Wavelength.png" target="_blank">Red light has a wavelength of ~670 nm, orange has 610 nm, etc., down to purple, which has a wavelength of ~420 nm</a>. Shorter than that, you get ultraviolet light, and above red, you get infrared.</p>
<p>This gets us to our first definition of color: a specific wavelength of light. These are sometimes called <em>pure spectral</em> or <em>monochromatic</em> colors. These are the colors you see when you look at a rainbow: a smoothly varying range of wavelengths. Under this definition, red, violet, green are colors, but pink, brown, and gray are not. </p>
<hr />
<p>But a light source can emit photons of many wavelengths! <a href="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-47d35ae236534f28bfab70825b9a151c" target="_blank">For example, the sun emits a pretty smooth distribution of wavelengths, while a fluorescent light emits only at specific peaks</a>. This is how you can get colors like white, brown, gray. They're not pure spectral colors, but combinations of them.</p>
<p>So, second definition, a color is a distribution of wavelengths.</p>
<p>But there's a bit of a problem here; this doesn't explain our intuitive notion of color yet. Why do the sun and light bulbs all look white when their distributions look so different? Why do we have 3 primary colors, not 2 or 4? How does the color wheel work?</p>
<hr />
<p>Okay, so now we gotta move from physics to biology. There's two kinds of light-sensing cells in our eye: rods and cones. The rods are activated by light of basically any wavelength, but cones are pickier. We'll ignore rods, because they don't play much of a role in color vision. We have three types, named after the color they are most sensitive to: red, green, and blue. When light enters the eye, these three types of cones get excited by different amounts, depending on what wavelengths are present. And so the infinitely flexible space of wavelength distributions gets crunched down to just 3 parameters that actually get sent to the brain. It's these signals that determine our perception of color.</p>
<p>A light that emits a pure spectral yellow will excite the red and green cones a lot, but not the blue ones very much. We see this combination as yellow, of course. But a light that emits a mix of pure red and pure green photons will excite our cones in the exact same way, and so we'll see yellow again. Even though the distribution is different, the perceived color is the same.</p>
<p>Our last, and most human, definition of color is: a particular pattern of cone excitement levels. </p>
<hr />
<p>So, time to finally answer your question!</p>
<p>Brown is what you see when both your red and green cones are weakly excited. It's not a spectral color, so it doesn't appear in a rainbow. This is also why white, pink, olive, and teal don't either.</p>
<hr />
<p>Further things that don't directly answer your question, but might help understanding:</p>
<p>This is how computer screens work: each pixel is made of three small light sources, emitting a pure spectral red, green, and blue. By changing the intensity of each light source, we can get a particular cone response, and therefore the desired color perception. We can't produce arbitrary wavelength distributions, but that's okay as long as we can get the cone responses correct. </p>
<p>This is also why we have 3 primary colors; because there's three output channels to produce, we need three inputs to control.</p>
<p>The color wheel also arises from these three channels. Consider the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RGB_Cube_Show_lowgamma_cutout_b.png" target="_blank">color cube</a>, a way of representing all of the colors. Each axis of the cube corresponds to one of the primary colors. Notice how, if you look around the edges of the cube, you see the color wheel!</p>
<p>Lastly, sometimes you'll hear people say &quot;pink isn't a real color&quot;. What they mean by this is that, around most of the color wheel, you can find a pure spectral color that produces a similar cone response. But this doesn't work for pink. There is no spectral color that hits only red and blue cones. In some sense, pink is our brain's way of &quot;closing the loop&quot; between the extremes of long wavelength red and short wavelength purple. We can't just average them, cause that's yellowish green. So we just construct a new, totally non spectral color. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every other color on the wheel either cannot be achieved by mixing (red, yellow, and blue) or they're made by mixing specific colors together. Orange is red and yellow, for example. Green is blue and yellow. The colors on the wheel are ordered according to how they're mixed--orange would be placed right between yellow and red. Brown, however, can be mixed in multiple ways. Green and red will give you brown. Orange and blue. Yellow and purple. There's nowhere to put brown on the wheel because there's no one way to mix it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
