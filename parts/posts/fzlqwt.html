		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is definitely the case for newer movies as well. The levels are mixed for movie theater systems where loud explosions and other effects can be exciting without scaring your pets or annoying your neighbors. Dialog is generally panned so it affects only the front speakers and other effects are distributed depending on their source. When it all gets boiled down to a simpler speaker system (in your home), the mismatch in balance becomes horrible apparent.   </p>
<p>Drives me crazy.  I wish streaming services evened out the levels (normalization or compression) when they convert to digital format.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This applies to movies in general, regardless of when they were made. The reason is dynamic range.</p>
<p>Movies are mixed to be realistic. In the real world, you sometimes have very loud sounds and very quiet sounds. Even the range of volumes that a person's voice can have is very large - just compare someone talking quietly at night, vs. someone shouting.</p>
<p>Your TV's speakers, or typical computer speakers or cheap HiFi systems, cannot reproduce this range. They don't go loud enough, so if they play back everything quieter than expected, now the quiet parts are too quiet. And you're probably going to be listening in an environment with background noise (people moving, cars outside, appliance hum, etc). Basically, the level of background noise sets the quietest thing you can hear, and the maximum level of your speakers sets the loudest thing you can hear. Anything else has to fit between there. So music and TV productions have their audio <em>compressed</em> (this has nothing to do with file compression like MP3s, the same word is used for two things). Quieter things are made louder and louder things are made quieter. Then everything fits comfortably in the volume range that your TV or HiFi can reproduce in your living room, and all is well.</p>
<p>Radio stations compress things even more, especially because they expect people to be listening in their cars, and cars are an even worse environment with a lot of background noise.</p>
<p>But movies are mixed for a movie theater. That's a very quiet environment with a huge speaker system, so it can comfortably reproduce sounds from whispers to loud explosions. In a movie theater, you can hear the quietest details without issue, and still have bangs blasted at you. As long as the movie gives some time between those sections for your ears to adjust, it all sounds great.</p>
<p>But if you now take the same movie audio track and play it back at home... It doesn't sound so great. Loud sound effects will be about as loud as your speakers can handle, but dialogue will now be too low, and whispers all but inaudible, and buried in background noise.</p>
<p>Modern home releases probably remaster the audio a bit more to reduce the dynamic range under the expectation that people will listen to it on something simpler than a high-end home theater system, but only to an extent. The more you adjust for low end systems, the crappier it sounds on high end ones, so it's not something that studios want to do lightly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of TVs have built in volume normalization that you can turn on to compress the audio and reduce the dynamic range. Another nice thing about having a PC as a media center is if your TV doesn't have a decibel limiter or volume balancer you can setup a customizable compressor of your choosing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of this is down to videos that have surround sound soundtracks being played on misconfigured equipment.</p>
<p>Videos with multichannel audio (i.e. more channels than just left and right) places focused dialogue mainly in the centre channel. For cinemas and those of us with multichannel setups at home the centre  speaker sits directly under, above or behind the screen.  </p>
<p>Now if you don't have a dedicated centre speaker on your system and find that dialogue is really quiet in the left/right speakers compared to other sounds you're just hearing the overbleed or ambience of the dialogue in the stereo channels because your TV/audio system is not properly downmixing the multichannel audio down to two channels. It is just playing the left/right channels of a multichannel soundtrack and discarding the rest (the centre, surround and subwoofer channels).</p>
<p>Dig into the audio settings of the player (blu-ray, media player, console, smart TV, Kodi etc.) and whatever's producing the audio (TV, soundbar, amplifier etc.) and make sure everything has the number of channels/speakers set to Stereo or 2.0.  </p>
<p>That should mix down the output of all those other channels into the left and right channels on your TV or stereo/2.0 system and should fix your dialogue problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
