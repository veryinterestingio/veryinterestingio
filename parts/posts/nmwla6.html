		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>More data</p>
<p>All video is compressed, some more than others.  When you ask for a 1080p video, YouTube sends you the file that has been compressed with settings that should looks pretty good on a 1080p screen, it won't be as good as the original and there will be artifacts you can pick out but it'll be about 1/100th the size which is good for their servers and your internet connection.</p>
<p>When you ask for the 4k video it sends you the file which would look pretty good on a 4k screen, but to keep it looking pretty good they have to send more data which means its a bit closer to the original.  Your TV/computer takes the 4k data and goes &quot;I can't use that, let me shrink it down&quot; and gets to take all that extra data to create finer details on the 1080p screen that weren't included in the much smaller 1080p video stream.</p>
<p>If you were to watch your bandwidth usage this would make sense too.  Streaming a 1080p video for an hour might be 2GB while a 4k video is 7GB.  That 3x increase in data results in an increase in fine detail on the screen.</p>
<p>For reference, uncompressed 60 fps 4k video should be around 5TB per hour so we really squish it down so you can get it without crushing the server, your network connection, and even your own computer's ability to process data.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way Youtube works is that it allocates a certain amount of bandwidth to each quality of supported video. Since 4K allows much higher bandwidth than 1080p compression artifacts will be reduced and so the video will appear higher quality, even when shown at the same resolution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>4K downscaled will always look better than 1080p because it is essentially averaging four pixels for ever pixel resulting in antialiasing and truer colors. Throw in data compression on videos and you end up getting less compression artifacts, as you have more “blocks” that are used for motion vectors in compressed video on top of the pixel averaging</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a little dirty secret of common digital video: the image is sent in 3 &quot;layers&quot;: a brightness layer, and 2 colour layers. You might think the 3 layers would be Red, Green and Blue but they're not. If you blanked out the two colour layers you would basically get a black&amp;white image.</p>
<p>.. However, for a 1080p video the colour layers are actually sent at 540p resolution. For every 2x2 of pixels the basic colour is the same and only the relative brightness varies. This is one of those &quot;your eyes can barely see the difference&quot; things that really saves disk space/bit rates, but has a permanent impact on image quality.</p>
<p>This does mean, however, that a 4k resolution video would have 1080p resolution colour layers. When the 4k video is downscaled to 1080p you effectively have full colour information for each individual pixel. This can subtly improve image quality.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People say bandwidth. But in reality, it’s because of chroma sampling. </p>
<p>Digital vídeo usually is represented with 4:2:0 colorspace. </p>
<p>That means that for every 4 pixels, the video file only stores information about how bright the pixel is for all 4 pixels. It only stores an average of the 4 pixels into 2 pixels for color information.</p>
<p>Without getting into the whole chroma/luma Blackhole, a 4K video has twice the color resolution of a 1080p video when the 4K is scaled down to 1080p</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
