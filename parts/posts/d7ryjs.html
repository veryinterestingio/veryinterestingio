		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>News over-reports and mistranslates research regularly.   And there are a lot of different things which cancer can do, and types of cancer.</p>
<p>When research shows one treatment to be slightly more effective than another treatment in a select population under very controlled circumstances with a specific early stage of a relatively benign cancer, that doesnâ€™t make much of a headline.</p>
<p>But, if you pass that same statement through a few layers of hype and simplification to go from research group to University PR team, to local press reporting, to national news conglomeration , to word of mouth among people chatting at a bar: the message can change quite considerably.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Killing cancer cells is easy. The problem is killing cancer cells without killing everything else. We've found lots of ways to kill cancer cells, but they need to go through years of trials to make sure they're (relatively) safe for human use.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is  a slow and challenging process  to develop cancer treatment method that is selective toward cancer cells without undesired side effects. Sometimes some treatments did work on stem cells or animal model but not doing well in actual patients. Also not all cancers and patients are exactly the same, so results may not be reproduced perfectly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
