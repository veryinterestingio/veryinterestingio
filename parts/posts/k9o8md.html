Making people that have caught Covid and survived immune to the virus since their body has already dealt with the virus and knows what to look for.</p>
<p>I remember around June - July that nobody was sure if you became immune once you caught Covid. but with this vaccine and how it works, it would make sense that you would be immune after catching covid. So with that, has anyone heard of &quot;Covid survivors&quot; getting the vaccine? Or am I wrong in thinking you'd be immune after catching Covid?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don’t know how long natural immunity to COVID (that is, immunity after natural infection with wild virus) lasts, and probably the answer is something like “between three months and thirty years, depending”. Several studies have found long-lasting immunity following clinical cases of COVID, but there are also a handful of cases of repeat infections. </p>
<p>The bottom line is that natural immunity probably</p>
<ul>
<li>is extremely variable</li>
<li>generally lasts <em>at least</em> three months, and potentially much more</li>
<li>can be boosted by vaccination with minimal risk</li>
</ul>
<p>So though there’s no official guideline yet, it’s been suggested that (for now) COVID survivors not get the vaccine for 90 days after they recover, given that vaccine is in short supply. After 90 days, they would be put in the same priority baskets as everyone else. </p>
<p>Over the next few months we will probably get a better idea of what proportion of recovered patients are immune for various lengths of time, and decide if 90 days is the right period or not. And as vaccines become more available, there will be less concern over sparing it and recovered people will be put in the standard lineups.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The A.C.I.P., which makes recommendations to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about vaccine distribution, said at a meeting on Wednesday that people who had not been infected should get priority over those who contracted the virus in the past 90 days.</p>
<p>“At some point we’ll need to figure out whether 90 days is the right number,” Dr. Maldonado said. But for now, “people who have evidence of infection recently should probably not be vaccinated at first in line because there’s so little vaccine available.”</p>

<p>Long story short, within in the context of Pfizer vaccine study, long term immunity has not been established. It is unclear how long prior infection and recovery or immunization with the 20ug/30ug schedule will last.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I’ve heard that vaccine triggers a pretty quick response from our immune system... meaning mild flu-like symptoms for the first day or so, post-vaccine.</p>
<p>Would people who have already had COVID exhibit this response or skip it because they have already been exposed?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>However, the vaccine data suggests that immunity increases with dose (e.g, increased after the second dose) but adverse events all increase.  It's something to consider when dosing someone that presumably already had an immune exposure to the virus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
