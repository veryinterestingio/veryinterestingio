		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All the US-operated ground-strike UAVs use the AGM-114 'Hellfire' air-to-ground missile, in addition to several types bomb. The hellfire missile, as well as the some types of guided bomb, are guided with laser beam riding. Basically, there is a fancy <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/images/images2000x2000/flir_n133ed_2_1mp_poe_day_night_1168089.jpg" target="_blank">dome camera</a> on the bottom of the drone with a powerful laser pointer with a very specific color that isnt visible to human eyes. In order to guide the missile to a target, the camera points the laser at the target, and a fancy camera on the front of the missile uses fins on the missile to steer it to point at the laser dot on the ground. If the target is moving, the camera just moves the laser to follow the target as it moves, and the missile will continually adjust to point at the laser dot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Now imagine the cat was thrown out of an airplane and blows up when it catches the dot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Drones are just remote control aircraft, and they can employ the same guided bombs and missiles that manned aircraft do. The drone operator &quot;paints&quot; the target with a laser on the drone, and the missile or bomb follows the laser to the target.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Missile follows a laser being fired by a targeting pod on the UAV. The targeting pod camera can follow the target it's shooting the laser at simply by tracking the difference in contrast between the target object and the ground.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>some older generation laser/ thermal imaging seekers could be defeated temporarily at least by close flare/ smoke ejectors and/ or chaffe bursts as well by ' dazzle ' multi faceted IR/ UV (?) reflectors, attempting to actively misguide various guided ground and air to air weapons. fog, bad weather, thick smoke and/ or industrial smog could significantly degrade their capabilities. then came GPS and suddenly far less missed, allowing for smaller but far more accurate weapons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
