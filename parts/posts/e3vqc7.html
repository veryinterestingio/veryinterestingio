<p>There are basically two methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Surveys. The company asks a representative sample of people &quot;which radio shows did you hear last week&quot;? A similar method is diaries, where each person in the survey keeps a list of every show they hear.</li>
<li>People meters. Each person in the survey has a special machine that tracks which channel they tune to. This was usually done for TV, not radio. A new method has a machine listening the whole time, and it recognises which show, song or advertisement is heard.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a radio broadcaster for a living. It’s an imperfect science, but they are able to get a ballpark figure using two different methods depending on the market size.</p>
<p>The first method is called the diary method. This is used in smaller markets, but people volunteer and record who they were listening to, when, and for how long. Radio ratings work in 15 minute increments, the quarter of every hour, not rolling 15 intervals. Say you listen from the 13th to the 17th minute of an hour, the station listened to gets credit for the whole half hour of listening.</p>
<p>This gives an indication for not just CUME, which is “circulation” aka number of listeners, but also TSL (time spent listening) and is how overall ratings are generated. The real issue with this method is people often simply forget to record their listening habits into their diaries before submitting them back to the ratings agency, try and remember what they were listening to and fill in the blanks. However, for smaller markets, it’s the best method they have.</p>
<p>I work in a medium market, but we broadcast into the largest market in my country and are the #1 station for our genre. We know this through PPM ratings. PPM’s or portable people meters are like Shazam’s for radio stations constantly picking up on radio frequencies. Far better than the diary method because whatever station the person is interacting with is constantly being absorbed by the meter. The same 15 minute interval rules apply, however the overall TSL data is far more precise. </p>
<p>There is one notable flaw with this method, and that is that people very often passively listen to stations they didn’t choose. I.e if you’re sitting in the dentist chair and they have some top 40 broadcasting that you wouldn’t normally listen to, the PPM still picks that up, same in retail stores, other peoples cars, etc. Even still, it’s the best method stations have for terrestrial radio (fancy radio industry talk for not satellite).</p>
<p>Most if not all stations do also run digital broadcasts via say, the iHeartRadio app, and those give exact data on everything, but most listeners still access their content via a traditional radio.</p>
<p>If you’ve got any questions I’m happy to answer!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I worked at iHeart they had the Nielsen reports that would come in. From what I remember there was a group of different people that were a part of the Nielsen family and had special devices that they would have to carry around to listen into the radio. I also believe they were sent surveys as well. This was in 2016, been out of radio since then but I'm sure it's still the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
