		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know, it isn't a common experience for someone to feel hunger pangs after looking at, say, a living cow or pig.  Instead, we feel hungry when we look at food that has been prepared for consumption (such as a steak or bacon).  Even uncooked meat probably doesn't elicit that reaction in many of us, nor would a field of corn (versus buttered corn on the cobb).</p>
<p>In comparison, I imagine that for other carnivorous animals, the sight of a living prey species would actually activate the &quot;yummy food&quot; areas of their brain and make them want to eat.  I imagine that an owl, for instance, would see a mouse running across a field and feel an urge to put it in its mouth.</p>
<p>My question: how far back would we have to go to find that most humans would look at a wildebeest or bird and feel hunger pangs?</p></div></div>

<p>If we went back to a hunt + gather system today, it wouldn't take long for our brains to associate the reward with our living prey.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
