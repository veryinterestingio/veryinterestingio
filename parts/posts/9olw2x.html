		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When pee is in your bladder, it is kept behind two valves. The one closer to the bladder (a) is automatic and the one further down your urethra (b) is &quot;semi-automatic&quot; - you can consciously control it with your pelvic muscles. Opening this valve consciously to start to pee automatically opens the one further up, which will not (usually) close until the bladder has emptied.</p>
<p>The force of the urine coming down your urethra after valve (a) opens is too strong for you to easily stop with your secondary (b) valve.</p>
<p>The feeling you get when you need to pee is pressure on the top valve, (a).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever crimped a hose? When there is no water it's easy, you then turn the water on and nothing goes through and you can easily hold the crimp. Now if you have the water flowing through the hose beforehand and you try to crimp the hose it's much harder. It's the same principle, water flowing through a tube is hard to cut off. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ugh, when I was pregnant with my first, I was told to drink X number of bottles of water in X amount of time prior to the anatomy scan. I obliged and had to pee SO BAD. They tried to do the scan, but my bladder was too full and was basically blocking things or causing them to be blocked. The nurse goes, “can you maybe let out about half of the pee?” ARE YOU NUTS LADY? It was the worst. I managed but it was awful. Haha. Thanks for the memory, that was over 17 years ago now! ?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
