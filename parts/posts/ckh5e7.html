<p>Its an evolutionary advantage to reduce useless translation and save energy. Here's the short summary: </p>
<p>► We assume that the synchronization shift of length 3 in DNA or RNA is violated. ► Then the probability of reading a shifted stop codon is quite high. ► Thus the synthesis of undesired proteins will soon terminate. ► In this way cells save energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3105428/" target="_blank">actually are other start codons</a>; they're just very uncommon in eukaryotes (everything other than bacteria and archaea). They're slightly more common in RNA than DNA, and they are a lot more common in mitochondrial DNA, which makes sense because they are a lot more common in prokaryokes such as bacteria and mitochondria are probably descended captured prokaryotes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A possible reason is that having a narrow range of possible “start” signals means the RNA is more sensitive to errors in translation. Basically, if you do not have the right code to even START the process, then you likely have other issues in the sequence down the line. Stopping translation before it even really starts is also more favorable from a metabolic perspective for the cell.</p>
<p>A second reason could be that RNA can get spliced and make slightly different proteins. Perhaps by having different stop codons, you are giving a wider range for the “end” of a protein to be signaled. This could be helpful because you COULD possibly still have a function protein.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there are actually other start codons that just transcribe Met when they are at the beginning of a protein, regardless of what they code elsewhere. See: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Start_codon#Alternative_start_codons" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Start_codon#Alternative_start_codons</a></p>
<p>As for why Met is always the start of a protein, it has to do with tRNA and protein synthesis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
