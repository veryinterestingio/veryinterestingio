<p>If you pay for a bulk order of 50,000 units compared to buying the parts yourself and building it, the bulk order is going to get a cheaper deal</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The stock answer is &quot;because the companies that make the consoles sell them for less than it costs to produce them because they want to sell games.&quot;  That used to be true, but hasn't been true in a long time.  </p>
<p>The current reality is that when a gaming site tries to figure out what the &quot;equivalent&quot; hardware in a console is that isn't super meaningful, because console's aren't general purpose PCs.</p>
<p>They have a custom made motherboard in which nearly everything is being handled by the GPU.  While the GPU itself is based on commercially available graphics cards, its had a lot of stuff cut out of it.  For example, it's unthinkable for even a low end computer graphics card to not have multi monitor support - which is a costly feature to include on a card - while no console, present or future, supports that.</p>
<p>So when you buy a console you're not buying something that is directly comparable to any general purpose PC.  What you're really buying is a Frankenstein's monster of a graphics card that's had a lot of its core features cut out, while having core features from other PC hardware added into it so that it can play video games and run a very basic UI.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Consoles are sold at a very low profit margin (comparatively) and they make up for that in games sales and monthly subscriptions and so on. You buy a console you buy into an ecosystem controlled by one company, they are willing to lower their margin to acquire a new long term customer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most basic answer is that they don't. You should easily be able to find parts lists out there that perform similarly to consoles for the same cost or lower. This could easily be seen when the updated xbox and ps4 came out and every PC youtuber put out a bunch of videos showing how to match the capability of those consoles with a PC for the same or lower cost.</p>
<p>Consoles are able to get their prices down in several ways:</p>
<p>Mass production. There are many many consoles produced that are all exactly the same or extremely similar to the point of being indistinguishable to the user and manufacturer unless they look at individual part numbers for the various parts. </p>
<p>Selling services and games as opposed to consoles. You still have to buy the console and nowadays you pay full price for it as opposed to years past when you paid less than the cost of the console. The company (Sony, Nintendo, etc.) makes more money from the subscriptions and games than from the console sales.</p>
<p>Functionality. Largely consoles serve as a way to play video games. Although they have added more functionality with each new release, a computer has much more functionality than a console outside of certain limited circumstances. More functionality equals more cost, and consoles are not computers with all the functionality that computers provide.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
