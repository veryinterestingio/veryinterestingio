		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the ancients certainly did go on holidays in other countries and wanted to see the sights.</p>
<p>Pausanias' <em>Guide to Greece</em> was written in the 2nd century AD.  He wrote travelogues to enable Romans to plan trips to Greece to “see the sights”.  He had detailed directions, descriptions, and the myths associated with each interesting locations.</p>
<p>The Romans visited places in ancient Egypt in the same way we visit Roman ruins.  We have their written descriptions, as well as their graffiti.</p>
<p>Herodotus, in the 430’s BCE toured many places in Egypt and wrote about them. He was likely there on business and enjoyed seeing things when time was available.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are thousand year old graffiti  that Roman soldiers carved into Egyptian temples to signify they were visiting. But in general, the rich travelled specifically for what we’d call “tourism”  in 17th, 18th and 19th century - it was common for British/NL/German upper classes to do Grand Tours of Europe (usually France , Italy and German states), and there are plenty of records of people who weren’t really doing anything more than tourism under the guise of “scientific mission”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know it isn't that long ago, but I was amused to learn that Agatha Christie's family traveled because it was cheaper to let the house and travel...sometimes to visit family sometimes to go overseas. This was apparently pretty common in the day for those who lived in &quot;genteel poverty&quot;. (This is per her autobiography and a few other readings about her, and would be right around 1900) So they got to do a lot of touring but mostly just to save the money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The peasantry used religious pilgrimages as vacations. They would often, yearly or bi yearly, go on pilgrimages to see some relic or site and use that trip as a vacation. They would travel from town to town sleeping in churches or other people's homes. </p>
<p>Nobility did it too, but they didn't require the religion aspect due to financial reasons. Also they more often than not stayed in the lords house.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
