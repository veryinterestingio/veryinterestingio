			<a href="/posts/g8bfvl" onclick="return false">If the axial tilt of Uranus (97°) was caused by a giant impact that flipped it on its side, then why do Uranus' moons orbit around its equator at the same tilt (≈97°)? Shouldn't their orbits follow whatever mild axial tilt Uranus had before the hypothetical giant impact?</a>

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the most accepted explanation for Uranus' sideway axial tilt is that it once had a normal tilt like the other planets bar Venus (0° to 30°) but then a certain massive object collided with it and caused it to tilt sideways. </p>
<p>But by that explanation then shouldn't Uranus' moons be orbiting 0° to 30° (or whatever tilt Uranus had before) rather than over its equator?</p>
<p>Did the moons only start forming after the impact? If they were formed before when Uranus still had a mild axial tilt then it makes no sense for them to orbit exactly over present-day Uranus' equator.</p></div></div>

They would orbit on their original plane for a while, but slowly start matching the new rotation due to tidal forces, as no planet has a perfectly smooth and distributed field of gravity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Planetary rotation causes Uranus to bulge around its equator, so there is more mass along the equatorial plane.  The moons would have slowly migrated to follow that plane due to the excess gravitational pull of the equatorial bulge.  It's likely that Uranus had more moons prior to the impact event as some orbits destabilized during the migration.</p>
<p>This is the same effect that causes ring systems to be so narrow.  Ejecta from moons forms the bulk of the rings and it can fly off in any direction but most of it settles down into that plane.    </p>
<p>If it helps, picture a sphere with a string wrapped around the middle.  Place an object anywhere around the sphere and imagine the gravitational forces.  The gravitational force of the sphere can be placed at the center.  If the object is in line with the string wrapped around the sphere, then the gravitational pull of that string is also towards the center of the sphere.  But if the object is offset, then there is a pull towards the string that doesn't match the vector towards the center of the sphere, and so the orbit of the object is shifted towards the equator, little by little.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Question: why is it 97 degrees instead of 83 degrees? </p>
<p>Sure the degree adjustment may be from original axis locations but considering the lack of information on formation and composition would it not be more accurate to refer to the axis as relative to the orbital plane?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're right in the sense that the moons should be orbiting at an inclination that preserves the total angular momentum of the Uranian system before impact. If Uranus's tilt was initially 0 degrees, then tilted to 180 degrees by a giant collision, the moon's orbits would not change. However, once Uranus's tilt reached 98 degrees, the inclination of the moons' orbits are now 98 degrees. Kozai resonance is a mechanism that transfers inclination with eccentricity, and is active when satellites' orbits are inclined greater than 40 ish degrees. So now their orbits are increasing in eccentricity, leading to crossed orbits and collisions. The resulting debris disk would realign with the total angular momentum of the system and so we should be observing the satellites orbit in the opposite direction to what we observe today. The solution is for Uranus to have had an initial tilt of greater than 10 degrees before the giant impact, so that the moons would have a 50% chance of orbiting prograde to Uranus's spin. The initial tilting can be caused by another impact or a spin orbit resonance. See <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.4685" target="_blank">Morbidelli et al. (2012).</a> The moons are suspected to have formed primordially, but there have been recent papers that suggest that the moons could have been formed from after the giant impact. However, the total mass of the satellite system is consistent with the other giant planets, and their compositions suggest they formed with the planet. The jury is still out on this one, but there have been a few papers published recently that suggest a post-impact formation scenario (e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13582" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13582</a>)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
