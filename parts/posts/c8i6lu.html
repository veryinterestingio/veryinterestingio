From what I’ve gathered, the answer isn’t simple haha and it is somewhat philosophical by how the question is interpreted. But thank you, I’ve been given a lot to ponder</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone is missing an extremely important distinction between &quot;DNA&quot; and the expression of that DNA.  ALLIRIX alluded to this but I'll go into more detail.</p>
<p>We have a ton of DNA, many times we have multiple copies of traits that you may have learned in school are dominant and recessive.  Well we also have a vast amount of DNA that is not &quot;turned on&quot; or expressed.  These pieces make up an incredibly complex ecosystem of traits that can be turned on or off throughout an organisms life in reaction to external stimuli.  A great example of this is Jews that survived the Holocaust.  If we simply went the evolution route we would say that people who are able to survive famine better would be the most likely to survive and reproduce.  What we actually see is a change in genetic expression of how their metabolisms reacted to food.</p>
<p>Epigenetics is such an amazing study that we still know very little about.  But one thing that is very impressive is the ability to change the expression, or in simplified terms &quot;turn on or off&quot; specific traits.  While we simplify this in middle/high school science and say dark hair is a dominant trait while light hair is recessive, there are many traits which are controlled by multiple pieces of DNA which combine to create an outcome (or in this case a protein) that causes certain physical or mental manifestations of said information.</p>
<p>Epigenetics is so curious that we can actually change the expression of our DNA simply through thought.  Now this seems like some crazy witchcraft but there are studies showing things like meditation, saying positive things about yourself and the way we treat others can physically change our expression of our own DNA (which may be more complicated as these actions also reduce stress and increase oxytocin levels which could be causing or compounding the changes in expression).</p>
<p>Now the kicker, epigenetics is also a really great tool in genetic modification because instead of adding or removing DNA, which comes with a slew of ethical issues and is very difficult to do to EVERY cell in the area you wish to effect, you can simply turn on/off the genes that are already there to cause your body to change/react/suppress certain processes or traits that may not be beneficial (such as allergies or susceptibility to disease etc.)</p>
<p>I originally learned of epigenetics in my botany classes and many plants have the ability to grow in completely different morphological forms based on their environment.  My professor compared it to people who could get extremely dark from sun exposure.  We all have these abilities that we don't really see as epigenetic expression but it's there.  When you go to the gym often and yearn for that feeling of afterglow you get from working out, when you find your love for cooking, when you learn to play an instrument, when you spend time with loved ones.  Everything that happens in life is constantly effecting our expression of genetic material that is already inside of us.</p>
<p>We all understand that we pass down physical copies of our DNA but scientists are starting to show more and more that we actually can pass down our epigenetic expression of that DNA as well as in the example of Jews that survived the Holocaust above.  Recently there has been a lot of discussion on the effects of PTSD and anxiety on epigenetic expression and children of parents who had either of the aforementioned issues are more likely to have it as well.  Interestingly enough, before having children if you seek help and treat these issues with counseling and therapy you can prevent the passing of this trait (or so scientist theorize based on the limited data and studies so far).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>simple example right now baby turtles follow the light of the moon reflected in the sea when they hatch to get to the ocean.</p>
<p>Now lets go back before any such behaviour happened. The baby turtles would go to random directions when hatching.Only those lucky to get to the water would survive.<br />
Then a mutation happened that baby turtles were attracted to light. Those who had it were way more likely to get to the ocean so spread the gene. </p>
<p>Now how can you code for something to happen, not that complicated just when they saw a light the brain rewarded them with serotonin or some similar neurochemical. so the baby's were chasing the high :)<br />
Now this behaviour doesn't have to persist , it just need to be active at the beginning of their life then it can be inactivated. </p>
<p>This is a simple example, but you can build upon it, like the magnetic field leaves an imprint on a baby so it knows to return to the same beach to lay eggs instead of searching for other more dangerous places.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s parts of your brain that are genetically wired. It kind of has a hard coded structure and purpose, independent of your life experiences.</p>
<p>Your cerebral cortex is a general purpose brain power section. It can learn to do things and is meant to be reprogrammed.</p>
<p>Evolution shaped certain instincts. Eg the turtles that, for some random genetic mutation reason, returned home to spawn proliferated over those that didn’t.  The people with phobias of snakes and spiders. Etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
