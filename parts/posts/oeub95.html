		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To understand this I think you want to understand what differentiate killing a task, sending a shutdown command and pressing the &quot;X&quot;.</p>
<p>A shutdown command (Pressing X, quit from the software, in some cases alt - f4) is like when the factory closes down at the end of the day. Workers will put tools back, turn of all machines calmly and orderly and clean up the work space. In computers that would be writing caches/deleting caches, writing saved setting to a config file, sending some data to a server, making sure open documents are saved.</p>
<p>A &quot;kill&quot; command, what task manager does, is like the fire alarm going off in a factory. Everyone just drops everything and runs out. (Maybe more accurately it would be like if someone just took the factory and launched into space with no traces left of it. The OS just drops the task associated with the application&quot;) </p>
<p>Alt - F4 is a Windows OS specific shortcut that sends a kill command to currently focused window. Which is why it often doesn't work for some application that fail to launch completely. Applications can be made to &quot;intercept&quot; this command though.</p>
<p>I don't know the full technical details of how an OS handles the different terminate signals it can send, but I feel this analogy explains why task manager often works, it simply doesn't do all the things a normal shutdown of an application does.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of programs have what is called &quot;shutdown hooks&quot; which is basically a piece of code that does something when you click Close or Alt-F4. The easiest example is the dialog you get when closing browser (&quot;Do you want to close multiple tabs?&quot;) or when closing Word or Excel (&quot;Do you want to save your changes?&quot;). When the program freezes it can get blocked completely so the hooks are waiting for the program to unfreeze which it never will so the program can't close at all.</p>
<p>Ending the program in task manager bypasses all that and &quot;kills&quot; the process (think depriving it of resources). So it's more effective in closing the applications but can result in unwanted things, i.e. losing changes, stuff not being saved to DB, connections not closing properly etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

When your wife texts the bouncer she knows he picks you up and throws you out of your ass.  Option two is faster, but not always better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In general you want the first one, because it allows things to finish in an orderly manner, and allows the program to ask &quot;Do you want to save the last 6 hours of work?&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
