		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To put it bluntly, they didn’t. The first attempts at explaining the states and reactions of matter led to the postulates that theorized the existence of the atom, so they were mutually dependent. Reactions such as fire and the creation of alloys were found empirically, but never studied like they are now. </p>
<p>There were early theories as to what composed matter, such as the idea that all matter consists of fire, water, earth, etc. But such theories never tried to “explain” reactions other than saying that things were how they were.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's one example:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlogiston_theory" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlogiston_theory</a></p>
<p>&quot;Phlogiston theory states that phlogisticated substances are substances that contain phlogiston and dephlogisticate when burned. Dephlogisticating is the process of releasing stored phlogiston, which is absorbed by the air. Growing plants then absorb this phlogiston, which is why air does not spontaneously combust and also why plant matter burns as well as it does.&quot;</p>
<p>Surprisingly accurate, if you ignore the nonsense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Their explanations were very ambiguous. For example, there was knowledge of what an acid was before the discovery of the atom based on physical and chemical properties, but there wasn't an explanation of what an acidic molecule was like. So a reaction would be run and the scientist would say they made an acid based on testing the properties. A lot of the analysis of products was done by comparing melting point, acidity, relative reactivity, and sometimes even taste (!) to known natural chemicals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like many subjects, chemistry has evolved over time. </p>
<p>Initially things started out as a kind of mythological understanding (i.e. ancient alchemy.) A lack of true understanding lead to people trying to turn various things into gold. We now know that you can't do that, but back in antiquity people had no idea. They knew if you mixed A with B you'd get C. So in theory, you could mix D with E to get gold. You just need to figure out what D and E were. </p>
<p>The ancient civilizations understood that everything was made up of stuff. Originally this was as simple as fire, earth, water, air. Then people started to understand that stuff was made up of other smaller stuff. The word &quot;atom&quot; comes from the latin &quot;atomos&quot; meaning indivisible or uncuttable. Atoms therefore became name for the smallest building block of everything. (We now know this isn't exactly correct. Atoms can actually be further divided.) We went from saying things were made of fire and water to understanding that there were other things (i.e. elements.) </p>
<p>There were varied explanations as to why certain things worked but no real concrete explanation. As time goes on, people start focusing on the <em>why.</em> Experiments were designed to test these theories. For example, wind. We can't really see it, but it is there. We feel it on our skin and see it move the leaves on trees. Well, why does wind move trees? It's probably not the breath of Zeus or the wrath of Athena. There must be something that makes the leaves move.  What are those things? Atoms! What do those look like? There have been many explanations of this: Bohr, Rutherford, Thomson, etc all had theories. Continued exploration eventually figured out that atoms are positive centers with orbiting negative particles and so on.</p>
<p>The more we learned about the composition of the parts of compounds, the more we understood how they work. The more we understood the more we could explain.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So in short, they just kinda BS'd it. Fake it til you make it irl. If you want a more detailed explanation, grab any gen chem textbook. One of the first chapters in most textbooks will cover the discovery of the atom from the simplest models to the current quantum mechanical theory.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>For example: Lead white is a compound that has been synthetically made and used since antiquity in white paints. The preparation for this compound has been described as early as 300BC by Theophrastus. Theophrastus' description says lead was placed in a vessel with vinegar and left until it formed a crust. The crust was then scraped off and the lead was placed back in the vessel and the process repeated until there was no more lead.  The scraped off crusts were dried and powdered andddd bam! You've got paint pigment. Why does this work? They had no idea, but it's how you get white lead. Now we know it's a process called corrosion (aka the formation of a metal oxide.)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>tl;dr Fake it til you make it. Explanations were given based off the information of the time and evolved as the science became more understood. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The classical philosophers argued about three forces of life and other reactions: vitalism, purpose, and atomism.
Vitalism where objects and creatures had life forces and heat inside them and when that ran out they died or burned up (instead of the other way around).
Plato spoke of forms which pointed to things life and objects doing what they did because it was their purpose and made that way.
Others thought of a mechanistic world of atoms and void, but with with them being of infinite shapes and sizes.
