		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Through a process called micro-encapsulation a patch/sticker or whatever is treated with a certain scent, basically coated in a perfume. It's then coated with easily breakable microbubbles that preserve the smell and break easily to release the smell when rubbed</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It works the same way as post-it notes do.</p>
<p>For post-it notes it's glue that's encapsulated in tiny bubbles and released when pressure is applied or it's scratched. </p>
<p>For perfume it's the perfume that's encapsulated in polymers that easily break when scratched. </p>
<p>Those 48h deodorants use the same mechanism as well: Polymer-encapsulated perfum that <del>geht's</del> gets released due to mostly friction.</p>
<p>Even those laundry scent things work that way.</p>
<p>The earliest form if scratch'n'sniff worked by using gelatine as the polymer.</p>
<p>Basically you use water, oil and soap to make an emulsion, and when gelatine is added and the emulsion is dried you'll get tiny droplets of oil coated in gelatine. </p>
<p>If perfume is added you get scratch'n'sniff powder, if drugs get added you get pre-dissolved medication which for some drugs is necessary for them to be properly absorbed by the body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lol oh man, so I had like 3 massive sticker books growing up and my scratch and sniff sections were incredible now that I think about it. I had stickers like &quot;tennis balls&quot; and &quot;dirty shoes&quot; and &quot;roast beef&quot;. Man....i must have had at least 500 different scents and they were all accurate lol to this day I think that'd be an awesome job lol &quot;we need you to replicate the smell of tennis balls and spray it on stickers lol people want this&quot; bahaha too funny. I think I even had a sticker that smelled like garbage!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
