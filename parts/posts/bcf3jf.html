		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cardiac muscle has a very different cellular architecture than skeletal muscle. </p>
<p>Skeletal muscles get tired and lose contractility because you deplete the muscles' stores of glycogen (basically the stored form of sugar). They lose their easy to access energy source and stop working as well.</p>
<p>Cardiac muscle feeds primarily on circulating fats, and are designed to harness this very efficiently. Because they aren't relying on stored energy but instead circulating energy, they don't need to worry about depleting their stores.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On the cellular level cardiac tissue has Bunch more mitocondria in it than skeletal muscle. Mitochondria break down glucose and release ATP (adenosine triphospate) or energy...  cardiac tissue has far more energy factories than skeletal muscle tissue, thus don't need rest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there are three types of muscles: skeletal (which are voluntary), cardiac, and smooth (which are both involuntary). Cardiac muscles control you heart, while smooth muscles control your brain and stuff. They move without you having to think about it, they are what keep the rest of your body moving, and they don’t retain lactic acid. Lactic acid is what makes your muscles feel tired when they’re overworked. The voluntary muscles need time to rest due to the lactic acid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Efficiency, to have muscle work indefinitely requires more energy, which requires more food. A human who's every muscle can work flat out indefinitely wouldn't be able to gather enough energy to survive during a food shortage.</p>
<p>Also, the heart has a single mostly unchanging task, it too gets tired and fails when overworked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
