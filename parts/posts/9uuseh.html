		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you’ll find when medicines are manufactured is a specification limit of something along the lines of 21.2 mg +/- 0.5 mg. This ensures that the consumer is getting at minimum the label claim without adding too much active ingredient (for both financial waste and accidental overdose reasons). The manufacturer will have validated a process that has been proven to consistently meet that specification, and the validation is subject to inspection by the FDA.  Samples will also be taken throughout production to make sure each pill is within specification. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chemist at a pharmaceutical company  here.  It's pretty close. Usually within 3 percent of label claim depending on the active ingredient.  So 100mg is somewhere in the 97-103mg range, but more than likely will be 99-101mg.  Any pharma company has release limits also, meaning they can't let anything out the door that doesn't meet FDA ch11 compliance and whatever the established release limits are for that specific drug.  At my company all of our release limits are stricter than the FDA's, so you can pretty much always rely on whatever you're getting to be spot on. </p>
<p>Edit: Whoa guys sorry, I didn't expect this to blow up!  Working on replying to everyone at the moment, but definitely got bombarded with DM's also.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pharmacy student here. Everyone else answered the question already, but I just wanted to mention something tangentially related. </p>
<p>A medication may only be active in an ionized form (having a positive or negative charge). You cannot make a tablet with an ionized drug, so it's combined with a salt in order to make a stable product to put in a tablet. If you look at the label for esomeprazole (Nexium), it will state that it has 40mg of esomeprazole, but actually has 44.5mg of esomeprazole magnesium, the salt form of the drug. In your body, the salt and the drug dissociate which is equivalent to taking 40mg of esomeprazole alone. </p>
<p>This is still subject to the margin of error as stated before, just thought it would be interesting to add. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several folks have talked about the testing against specifications, but these products also must undergo stability studies as well.  The finished product (bottles of pills, blister packs, etc.) are stored in controlled conditions for specific periods of time and retested at these intervals.  For example, the sealed bottles can be stored at 5C (similar to a fridge) or 40C/75% relative humidity (think of your medicine cabinet in a steamy bathroom).  These stability profiles allow manufacturers to establish the expiry dating for the product so you know it’s still 18-22mg after x months and the impurity profile is also within established tolerances.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, the 40C condition typically yields the worst stability, which is why many medicines recommend storing in a cool, dry place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Pakistan—a few years ago at least—it’s a big joke. The government had imposed price controls on certain OTC and prescription medicines, not adjusted to inflation, so drug makers kept the prices and the listed quantities the same but dropped the true amount of the active ingredient by half or more. Everyone knew (or at least, everyone I talked to about it did), so people and medical professionals just adjusted the number of pills they took or prescribed. A dentist recommended that I take a particular antibiotic before a procedure as a prophylactic. But when he found out that I had already brought the drug over from the US, he slashed the specified dosage exactly in half, since my pills would actually match the label amount.</p>
<p>I’m curious if this happens in other countries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
