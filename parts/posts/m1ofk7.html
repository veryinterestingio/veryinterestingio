		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Old TVs were analog. The signal was encoded in a simple way than needed just basic electronics to decode and display. This was fast, so old TVs changed channels quickly. However, such a method of transmission was inefficient: just one TV channel per frequency. It also did not allow for a high quality of image. The only edge of analog signal is that it is robust: it can be displayed no matter what the interference, it will get blurry, snowy or lose color, but it still will be decipherable.</p>
<p>Modern TV is digital, it uses complex computerized encoding that allows to pack ten or twenty channels in one frequency with much more quality. However, deciphering this signal is harder and needs a mini-computer that is built in every modern TV set. That's why the slow down: it's the wait while the minicomputer processes things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Television, both broadcast and cable, is a digital signal. When you switch from one channel to the next, perhaps half a second of data from the new channel needs to be processed before the television can begin displaying video and audio.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most digital TV providers use something called multicast to distribute their programming down to customers.  This saves them a massive amount of bandwidth, because only one of each packet (think like a frame of your show) is needed on each circuit.  Multicast is built in &quot;tree&quot; through the provider network where the source (your channel) is the base of the tree and the customers are all spread out like the branches.</p>
<p>When you change the channel, you change to a new tree because you are listening to a new source.  This takes about ten seconds to fully establish the new tree from the source to your receiver. </p>
<p>In the meantime, your receiver sends a request to the source to get a unicast flow of the channel while the multicast tree builds.  A unicast flow means the provider creates a copy of that channel's data and sends it only to you.  The advantage to this is that this flow can be set up much faster because no tree needs to be built, so you can start streaming your channel in only half a second or so.  The disadvantage is this uses much more data in the ISP network, so the ISP wants you on multicast.</p>
<p>After the multicast flow is built, your set top box will seamlessly swap over to the multicast tree, and now you will be part of the exact same data stream that your neighbors who are on the same channel have. </p>
<p>ELI5: it takes time to set up the ip data flow for your new channel.  First, your set top box performs a direct download of the channel for about ten seconds.  This means you get a whole new copy of the data from the channel provider that is built just for you.</p>
<p>After those ten seconds, you join a &quot;room&quot; with your neighbors so that all of you who are on the same channel receieve the data together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because of how the compression works. Analogue TV sends a stream of analogue information. The channel changes as soon as the TV receives a signal saying it's the start of the image. This will tak 1/60 seconds in countries where they use 60Hz refresh (e.g. North America), and 1/50 seconds everywhere else.</p>
<p>Digital TV doesn't send every frame in full detail. It sends a key frame, and the next few frames just show the differences. So it has to wait for a key frame. That will happen a decent fraction of a second later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Old school analog channels literally conveyed the signal that was being projected onto the phosphor of the tv screen, line by line. There was no buffering or interframe compression, it arrived at the antenna and immediately displayed, pixel by pixel, line by line. At worst the screen had to wait 1 vertical blanking pulse, \~1/24th of a second to recognize that the newest data referred to the top info on the screen to start drawing the new picture.</p>
<p>Then came digital. The data is still streamed in, but it's not just line by line. It's video format encoded, compressed, and often encrypted, then broken into packets of data for transmission. First, the tv has to acquire enough packet data to know what it has received - reassemble the packets to see how tall and wide the picture should be, the framerate, encoding information, decrypt it (if you have bought the channel or not in your package), and then decompressed* to an actual picture that can be drawn on the screen.  In the case of a cable box + tv, the cable box then has to take the picture it's formed and RE-ENCRYPT it to go over the HDMI cable for copy protection. Only then can the licensed TV with proper HDCP keys decrypt that signal again to have the picture to put on screen.</p>
<p>Basically...a LOT of steps have to happen, and each takes time.</p>
<p>*decrompression - For a very simple example, for a video of a black screen with a white dot moving in a circle, it's more efficient to transmit 'most of the screen didn't change, just this bit with the moving dot needs to be updated/moved/distorted'. The old school method of sending every pixel of every image one after another just won't cut it. Multiply that technique times a bajillion and you have the modern compression algorithms used for video transmission. Uncompressed there would be no way to fit all the HD video and audio streams down the pipe simultaneously.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
