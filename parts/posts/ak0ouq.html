<p>Don't bone marrow patients go through chemo to suppress or wipe our their immune system to reduce the chance of rejection of the donor marrow? Seems like a virus that does the same thing, if it could be less . .. virulent, might be a way around that horrible process. Just throwing out ideas.</p></div></div>

Ciclosporin and similar drugs are much more effective and can be switched off easily (stop taking it), something that cannot be said about a lot of viruses.
To avoid gvhd and similar unwanted immunoreactions you usually want to suppress only the t-cells as those are identifying the targets. </p>

One of the fundamental advantages of the immune system is to remember for futures exposures. It’s also a double edged sword, bc when the body recognizes ‘self’ as foreign and leads to an autoimmune disease (I’m thinking T1D as I write this) that memory persists. So even if there was a therapy to regenerate the cells that produce insulin (or fix whatever step in the process is messed up for that individual) the body would again recognize this same epitope as foreign and initiate destruction once again.</p>
<p>If one could selectively forget some of the immune systems memory this could be very valuable for a host of autoimmune diseases. </p>
<p>Lots of caveats wrapped up in this post, but those are some broad strokes sprinkled with some optimism. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There seem to be some good answers here from people who I think may know more about this than me, but in reference to your text question about “bone marrow patients.” </p>
<p>I’m assuming you mean bone marrow recipients that go through chemo? This is 100% necessary not to strictly wipe out their immune system, per se, but you can’t transplant bone marrow into someone that already HAS bone marrow (sounds kinda stupid when you say it like that but bear with me). Chemo wipes out the recipients bone marrow so new bone marrow can be transplanted and take hold. This can cause some other immune related diseases, however, such as graft versus host disease.</p>
<p>When someone gets a different kind of transplants, let’s say a kidney, they have to take immunosuppressive drugs, as their own bone marrow (which makes our white and red blood cells, white being the immune system) will try and fight off the “foreign“ organ. </p>
<p>These are two distinctly different situations, as in the former, the new bone marrow’s WBC’s are recognizing the entire person as foreign and trying to attack lots of things. In the second, the person’s own “original immune system” is just trying to attack a single transplanted organ. Hypothetically, I guess a system like what you’re asking about could maybe be used for both. But there would have to be very strict ways to control it and right now there are probably much safer options as described by other answers in this thread. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If the cited authors' hypotheses are correct (that measles may reduce immune memory), then it might be a reasonable option to re-vaccinate measles patients. At this point, it's still only a hypothesis. One way we can measure whether your body is immune to a particular disease is to check the specific antibody levels in your blood. Checking these levels after a measles infection might help direct revaccination.</p>
<p>Identifying a medical use for this effect would be fairly difficult for a few reasons. It's an interesting idea to use for transplant patients. While bone marrow patients do need their whole immune system wiped out, infecting someone with an already weakened immune system could cause some life-threatening problems. Additionally, causing long-term global immunosuppression is much more dangerous, especially if we can't reverse stop the process like we can with our current meds.  Lastly, for some diseases, we can pinpoint the exact cells/cell types causing the disease. In those cases, it would be better to a more precise approach than a measles-esque shotgun approach.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
