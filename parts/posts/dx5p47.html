		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Does anyone else remember Kenny, the inbred white tiger? I remember people saying he had Down's Syndrome, but apparently that's not true.</p>
<p>&quot;The diagnosis of Down’s Syndrome is also questionable. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014067360312987X" target="_blank">Down’s Syndrome</a> results from a third copy of chromosome 21. Although a mouse model for Down’s Syndrome exists, tigers have 19 chromosomes to humans’ 23. While Kenny’s face does bear a superficial resemblance to that seen in people with Down’s Syndrome, it’s far from clear that this was the result of a third copy of any chromosome, let alone one that could be matched to our 21st.</p>
<p>What is clear is that Kenny was a victim of the greed of the breeding industry. White tigers are very rare. With so few of them, the genetic pool is limited, and inbreeding is an inevitable consequence. Kenny’s parents were brother and sister. Most of his siblings were stillborn, or died very young, according to Patricia Quinn, a spokesperson for Turpentine Creek Wildlife Reserve, where Kenny lived from the age of two.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Animals can be born with genetic defects similar to Down syndrome, but not that exact condition. However, other great apes can have a similar defect.
Down syndrome is a sort of defect called a chromosomal abnormality, meaning that either there is an extra chromosome or an excessive repetition of the same genes on a particular chromosome. In the case of Down syndrome, that repetition is in on a region of the 21st chromosome. Similar abnormalities in other chromosomes are possible, such as the abnormality which causes Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18).
Although other animals do of course have chromosomes, they have different chromosomes than humans do. For instance, a horse has 32 pairs of chromosomes whereas a human has 23 pairs. Other great apes are most similar to humans having 24 pairs of chromosomes. Therefore, if trisomy is found, other great apes would be most likely to have the most similar form.
Essentially, due to differences in the genomes, there is no direct equivalent, however other animals can get trisomies.</p>
<p>The area on chromosome 21 in humans that is responsible for trisomy is found analogously on chromosome 22 in other great apes.
Trisomy 22 is a chromosomal disorder in which there are three copies of chromosome 22.
These apes can exhibit a genetic defect comparable to Down syndrome.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human Down syndrome is a result of having a triplicate of many (most?) of the genes on chromosome 21.  Because the equivalent genes are on different chromosomes (and not all on the same different chromosome, but shuffled) in other animals there may be no exact equivalent.  That said there will be similar results with a triplicate chromosome in an other animal that has many of the same genes as human chromosome 21.</p>
<p>The best demonstration of the above, is that to create a superior Down Syndrome model mouse, the solution was <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11371509" target="_blank">to put most of a whole human chromosome 21</a> into mice.  This way there is a &quot;triplicate&quot; of all the genes one would find on a human chromosome 21 in the mouse, which couldn't be done by making a triplicate of any one mouse chromosome – its just the &quot;mouse effective trisomy 21&quot; is represented by 2 copies of each of the relevant mouse genes scattered across many mouse chromosomes, and then the &quot;triplicate&quot; is created with an additional copy of the relevant genes ... just a human copy all lumped together on one human chromosome 21.  The behavior of these genes even across species is similar enough that this human 21 copy &quot;Down Syndrome&quot; mouse is a really good model of down syndrome in mice, probably the best yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
