		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In your body, you have essentially two different &quot;nervous systems&quot;, the &quot;Somatic Nervous System&quot; (SNS) that involves VOLUNTARY movements and sensations, meaning your brain purposely commands them and the &quot;Autonomic Nervous System&quot; (ANS) that involves <strong><em>involuntary</em></strong> actions, like breathing, blinking, sweating etc. that happen without you having to think about it. Some types of emotional responses can trigger the ANS to engage the SNS, for example when you are in danger and you need to &quot;fight or flight&quot; to save yourself or if you think you might be engaging in sex. When you feel &quot;the chills&quot;, it is that crossover event of your ANS triggering your SNS to prepare your body for what it thinks might happen. So your blood vessels dilate (to get more blood to the muscles if necessary), your body hairs raise up to allow more air to cool your blood, your breathing and heart rate increase etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Its more prevalent in some than others. For me music does it regularly when I'm actively listening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain and nervous system are connected to muscle cells, called arrector pili, at the base of hairs all over your body. When you think about things that make you very emotional these muscle cells sometimes contract to create little bumps on your skin and the hairs to stand up. Usually accompanied by a pleasant tingling sensation or chills.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I imagine this is the same mechanism that causes most mammals hair to raise when they are startled or feel threatened (I assume the is an evolutionary adaptation to make the animal appear larger than it is). As a humans, we have a much more nuanced emotional spectrum, but I’m guessing they are all linked to much more basic nervous system reactions.</p>
<p>I’m also completely making this up off the top of my head, but it seems like an answer that makes sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
