		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Based on <a href="https://deeptimemaps.com/global-series/" target="_blank">Ron Blakey's global paleogeography series maps</a>, it was some time in the later Triassic. Land area (not counting submerged continental margins) was close to even between the northern and southern hemispheres during most of the Jurassic and Cretaceous according to these maps, though, with only a slight excess in the north. Possibly within the error range of the reconstructions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
