		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cartilage/skin overlying the nose hole has become more prominent. Iâ€™ve heard theories that Neanderthals and humans evolved that feature in cold environments, to help warm up air as it entered our lungs (longer path, picks up more heat on the way in.) The same feature would help remove heat as it exited the nose (longer path drops more heat on the way out.)</p>
<p>Exact reason is unknown, and fossil record of human face bones is missing a lot of transitional stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple factors. Primary is the simple fact that humans are the only fully bipedal animal with dexterous hands. Our noses are no longer close to the ground and our hands bring our food to our mouths. Whereas animals don't grab their food, they get their mouth and nose close to it and take a bite. </p>
<p>For both humans and other animals scent is the primary indicator of the risk of eating something. Things we find smell gross often do because they contian similar aromas to that of rotting or poisonous things which obviously we wouldn't want to eat. So instinctively we find those scents disgusting. So how we smell is heavily connected with how we eat.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some interesting ideas here, but the one thing I would like to point out is that evolution is not a rigidly linear process. It also doesn't trend towards perfection, good enough is fine, so the reason could be incidental, but as long as the condition doesn't cause a disadvantage for those that have it there's no reason to &quot;get rid of it&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans are catarrhine primates.  This is a catarrhine trait shared with most old world monkeys and apes, barring a few of the odd nosed monkeys.  The variability we see in humans appears to be related to environment, with the nose shape related to the need to humidify or warm air depending on context.  </p>
