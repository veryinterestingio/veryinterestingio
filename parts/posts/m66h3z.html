I'll be here from 12pm to 3pm PT today (3-6 PM ET, 19-22 UT). My latest research on bullying (with coauthors Diane Felmlee and Cassie McMillan) was based on the idea that teens use aggression to gain social status in their school and tried to identify the most likely targets for their cruelty. To the extent that bullying is used this way, adolescents are likely to target their own friends and friends-of-friends, for these are their rivals for desired social positions and relationships.</p>
<p>We indeed found that, compared to schoolmates who are not friends, friends are four times as likely to bully each other, and friends-of-friends are more than twice as likely to do so. Additionally, &quot;structurally equivalent&quot; classmates - those who are not necessarily friends, but who share many friends in common - are more likely to bully or otherwise victimize each other. Our research received some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/lnd42g/teens_who_bully_harass_or_victimize_peers_are/" target="_blank">attention and commentary on r/science</a> so I'm here to answer your questions about bullying, frenemies, and why prevention programs have not been successful--AMA!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello Dr. Faris! I am a former UC Davis exchange student (I studied linguistics) and I have to say I loved UC Davis! Hoping to come back to visit one day.</p>
<p>Now that I have this amazing opportunity, I wanted to ask about a case that happened in my home country a little while ago and shocked the whole nation. A 16-year old boy was bullied to death by his friends (link here, content warning: description of extreme violence <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koskela_teen_murder" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koskela\_teen\_murder" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koskela\_teen\_murder</a></a>)</p>
<p>Everyone is obvioulsly wondering how this could happen. I would like to hear your comments on if there are any factors that caused the bullying to go as far as taking the victim's life. Could it be a hierarchy thing gone too far - getting rid of the weak individuals? The victim is said to have been shy, lonely and quiet. Or could there be something else behind the horrible actions? The case has really shaken our sense of humanity, so it would be interesting to hear your take on the matter. Thanks!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

As a teacher, I was taught (by school counselors) that friends getting in tiffs with each other is not bullying, yet I have seen pretty cold and cruel behavior among kids that call each other BFFs. Is the friendship itself real or is just grooming/positioning? What can I do as a teacher to help?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
