		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know that after you've held your breath for a while, you get a signal from your brain that indicates your blood oxygen is low, and that you need to breathe again. But this doesn't feel like a strictly mental thing. It feels like something is happening physiologically too, in your diaphragm; it's some kind of discomfort, tension... Hard to describe. What, precisely, <em>is</em> happening? Or am I way off the mark and interpreting something that isn't actually there?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Contrary to your post, your initial reaction to holding your breath is not a lack of oxygen. There is plenty of oxygen to go around in your blood volume and other jibbly bits. Your 'discomfort' sensation is the delicate pH balance of your blood being ever so slightly acidified by the Carbon Dioxide building up in your blood.</p>

<p>A lot of breath holding training (like free-diving) has to do with your tolerance of the pain from the CO2, not explicitly making your oxygen last longer; although that does of course play a role.</p>
<p>Edit: thanks for the awards peeps. Feels good to be a bit helpful from time to time instead of just snarky at people being wrong on the internet ;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The accumulation of carbon dioxide in your cells triggers your brain respiratory sensor. The pain travels the neural pathways to your lungs and diaphragm, where the diaphragm contracts for the lungs to fill. Resisting hurts more due to the contraction until you fall unconscious and gasp.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A sustained contraction of the diaphragm to breathe in and hold the breath. Another pressure on diaphragm that grows is the slowly building force against the closed glottis to breathe out to take another breath. That is the “pain” people must be talking about. The ability to hold in the breath in, in spite of the very hardwired reflex in our brainstem to breathe when CO2 and O2 are going in opposite directions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rather than a lack of oxygen or high CO2 levels causing that sensation like other commenters are talking about. I think you just might be stretching out the muscles used for breathing, especially if you're feeling the strain in your diaphragm.
If you do repeated breathing exercises, especially deep breathing where you maximize your lung capacity, this feeling will probably lessen and subside with time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
