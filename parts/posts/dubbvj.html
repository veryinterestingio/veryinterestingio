		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5 why most animals share the same features is because of the evolution tree: they have developed out of the same ancestor, like siblings look a lot like their parents, and thus like each other, but are A BIT different. Do this a lot more often and you have very different, but related faces.</p>
<p>ELI5 why two eyes: the common ancestor had an advantage in hunting, feeding and moving when they have 3d vision and thus depth-perception compared to 2d vision and no depth perception. Thus all children and children's children got those features and this ancestor had a lot more successful children that survived and reproduced again.</p>
<p>ELI5 two eyes and a nose in the same place: most likely because it evolved that it is most favorable if the nose and eyes are close together as the brain is there too. Signal travel shortest this way and also you  only need one central brain instead of two. You know that the brain is essential and thus a weakness, so it always is better to have one instead of two weaknesses.</p>
<p>ELI5 ears on either side of the head allows for direction-identification. As sound travels at a specific speed, it hits one ear before the other. The brain notices this and can thus locate things better. Moveable ears probably have evolved in order to THEN have more hearing accuracy when you have the location, in order to identify the origin of the sound (friend or foe) or in order to hear more clearly what happens and where it moves to (hunting).</p>
<p>All in all: common ancestry is the reason for common features, and &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; is the reason why it is THOSE features and not others.</p>
<p>Edit: I was confronted on the evolution of the eye and remembered I have seen an amazing video that clearly and understandably explains it better than words ever could and want to add it now (at 53 upvotes, sorry yall missed this):  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwew5gHoh3E" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwew5gHoh3E" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwew5gHoh3E</a></a> u/In-Kii</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's because almost every living thing have common origin,That means fundamentally they all evolved from a common specie very long time ago.</p>
<p>Its because of evolution that has branced so many different species today we know of including us thus in terms of blue print like layout u talked about senses-eyes,nose etc,
And even the internal organs and way they work we are all pretty similar that's cuz this blueprint have worked well enough for survival of living thing till now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I want to open with I haven't finished my morning coffee yet and read &quot;animals&quot; as &quot;criminals&quot; so I was coming here to rant, initially. </p>
<p>However, having more than one of a sensory organ increases an organism's perception drastically. </p>
<p>For the eyes it's field of vision, the range of objects that you see around you, combined with depth perception, your ability to tell how far away things are. These characteristics vary depending on the organism's place in the food chain. A prey animal, like a bunny, has eyes on the sides of its head to allow for a very large field of vision so it can see predators coming, while a predator like a fox has forward facing eyes that allow it to focus better on its prey. As for depth perception, the bunny's depth perception isn't great because of the spacing of the eyes, while the fox has great depth perception due to the eyes being closer together. This is because depth is perceived at the point that the line of sight of each eye crosses. </p>
<p>Ears are similar to this, but it's more about direction than the area that can be heard. Reptiles that don't have fleshy ear tend to hear that things are to the right or to the left, while mammals with ears that move can adjust the direction to pinpoint sounds. The bunny's large ears helps it hear things approach in its surroundings, and it can swivel them around to better determine the direction of the sound without moving the rest of its body. Same for the fox. </p>
<p>Owls have specialized ears, being that one ear is higher on the head while the other is lower. This helps them to better locate prey in the dark through sound. </p>
<p>As for the nose, most creatures only need a general direction for the source of an odor, so it's in the middle of the other sensory organs. </p>
<p>The mouth exists to consume food, and again it's in the middle of everything else. It tends to be under the nose because most food has a smell, and a lot of what you &quot;taste&quot; is actually from the smell. As for teeth, these evolved to fit the diet of the organism that has them. Herbivores have flat, grinding teeth to crush vegetation, while carnivores have sharp teeth to aid in catching prey and tearing meat. Omnivores, such as yourself, have sharp teeth in the front and grinding teeth in the back so they can consume whatever is available. </p>
<p>I believe that covers it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eyes give lots of information to the brain so they need to be close to it, in top half of face.  High up on the face is better as you can see more if you are high.  Eyes come in pairs so you can see how far away things are better.  If you are an animal that gets hunted, having them towards each side of your head will help you see behind you too.  If you are a hunter then having them closer together on the front will help focus on your dinner.  </p>
<p>Ears also come in pairs as then you can hear which way things are coming from.  Generally, the wider apart the better.</p>
<p>Nose is feeding lungs with air and passing smell information to brain so having it in the middle of the face half way between the two makes sense.  There is no need for two noses, but having the nose separated into two halves (nostrils) could be a handy in keeping one half open if there is a blockage.</p>
<p>Mouth is taking in food to stomach so it is good if it is even lower than nose as you wouldn't want your soup tumbling out of it.</p>
<p>There we go, two eyes and ears up at top of face, one nose with two nostrils in middle, one mouth at bottom of face.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
