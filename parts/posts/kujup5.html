		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They blend the materials during the thread making process, not during the shirt making process. So a thread is spun with a mix of fibers, and that thread is used to make fabric, and that fabric is cut and sewn into a shirt, for example. Different parts of the shirt, like the collar or sleeves, may use different fabric made of different blends too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way for the &quot;blending&quot; is done within the spinning of the the fiber that makes the cloth before it is used on the loom. It would be that at 90% cotton after every nineth strand of fiber would be a strand of polyester spun together to make the thread used to make the cloth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends! Usually, the fibers are blended together before spinning into yarn/thread. Sometimes, like with stretch fibers such as elastane/spandex, the fibers are spun separately and plied together into one yarn/thread or held together while weaving or knitting. And sometimes, the other material is a coating required to be reported on consumer labeling, although there aren't too many of those. Trims and notions such as elastic aren't always included in the consumer labeling but when they are, they are often listed separately.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Shirts are made of fabric, which is woven from thread. Thread is made by twisting little strands of fibers together so that the tension of the twisting keeps it together. </p>
<p>When a shirt is made of a blend of fibers, that means that 90% of the fibers used to make the thread were cotton, and 10% were rayon for example. It does not mean &quot;9 cotton threads for every 1 rayon thread&quot;, it means that every thread that makes the fabric is that same blend ratio.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however the specific blend listed on a garment does not refer just to the fabric, but to the peice as a whole. For example, the fabric is 100% cotton and the embroidery on it is 100% rayon so overall the garment is 90% cotton and 10% rayon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A clothing item can have different parts, which are not always blended. Your underwear has a rubber elastic in the waist, so it may be mostly cotton but a part of it is rubber or other elastic material. </p>
<p>A good example is to look at a car. It can be 80% metal and 20% plastic, but they are not blended in any material sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
