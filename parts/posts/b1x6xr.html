<p>Also the reason so many of the comments keep getting removed is likely do to being low effort (evolution, they live there, or salt doesn’t hurt my eyes) comments. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Somewhat related, human children can actually train their eyes to be able to see clearly underwater! This was first observed in the Moken people of Thailand who spend a large amount of time diving for shellfish, but was replicated in European children who underwent training.  The ability to see clearly underwater was achieved by tightening  the pupil and extended the accommodation of the lens. Humans lose this ability as the lens stiffens with age. </p>
<p>The Moken children also did not seem to experience the same salt water irritation in their eyes as European children, but the researcher didn't study that particular effect. </p>
