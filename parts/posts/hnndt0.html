		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most human voice is between 300 Hz and 3000 Hz. So most phone systems are designed for these frequencies. In addition human voice have a lot of familiar patterns so you can save bandwidth by compressing it with special algorithms for voice. However music is usually between 30 Hz and 20,000 Hz and follow very different patterns. So the high and low notes will get cut off and the voice compressor will mangle the rest of the notes. This makes the music very strange to listen to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Thatâ€™s a video by Tom Scott with the most accessible, on-topic explanation that anyone could hope for.</p>
<p>TL;DW compromises to quality are made in the name of efficiency, especially for non-voice sounds.</p>
<ul>
<li>The data stream is heavily <strong>compressed</strong> by algorithms designed to focus on preserving voice patterns, not music patterns.  And this is made worse because the decompression needs to be runnable on old mobile devices with primitive processors.</li>
<li>The sound waveform itself is <strong>band-passed</strong> to the frequency range covered by human voice (a few hundred to a few thousand hertz).</li>
</ul>
<p>Compression artifacts are the main reason behind the specific underwater-like effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically it's becomes it's being compressed into the same frequency range as the majority of human voices. The POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service) can't carry the frequencies above/below that. More specifically, it is restricted to between 300 and 3,000 Hz, where your hearing is 20 to 20,000 Hz range. The restricted frequencies mean that music doesn't sound like it's supposed to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the technical problem of insufficient bandwidth for music, there is also the legal issue of licensing. A business must have permission to play a song and because they don't want to keep track of every time it's played they will go with a royalty-free (pay one, unlimited plays) license. A royalty-free music track is way more expensive that the same track sold to a consumer (for generally less than 1$).</p>
<p>When all this music was originally on cassette tapes they would have made <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_loss" target="_blank">copies of copies of copies</a> of the cassettes as they wore out. Every time a digital storage <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_telephone_system#Private_branch_exchange" target="_blank">PBX</a> started to die or was upgraded they would have placed the telephone handset on a laptop's microphone so some intern could record the hold music and load in in to the new system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's like a rainbow. Music is the full ROYGBIV, but the phone only allows for Orange and Yellow. Our voices would be orange and yellow. The phone is designed for voices so it cuts out the other colors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
