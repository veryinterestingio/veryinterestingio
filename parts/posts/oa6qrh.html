		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every blade adds to efficiency but you pretty rapidly enter diminishing returns.</p>
<p>A top of the range three blade wind turbine extracts about 80% of the theoretical maximum energy. A two bladed variant is only slightly less efficient, about 5% less. A four bladed turbine only gets you a couple of percent extra efficiency.</p>
<p>Each blade is very expensive, so fewer blades allows a return on your capital investment faster which allows you to build more turbines sooner. Ultimately two three blade turbines harvests way more energy than one six blade, and three two blade turbines even more.</p>
<p>Two blade turbines have a few issues which results in three being the default choice:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They cause &quot;pulsing&quot; shadows when the sun is side on which is really disturbing to any houses/cars that end up in the shadow. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aesthetically they aren't as pleasing and people don't like the look of them on the landscape.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When one blade passes in front of the tower, the force on it drops due to the tower's wind shadow. This emparts a twisting force onto the assembly that requires special design to adsorb. The twisting force is lesser with three blades because there isn't a blade directly opposite the one in the shadow.</p>
</li>
<li>Three blade designs are easier to turn to face the wind. With two blades the inertia of the system changes depending whether the blades are pointing up or sideways. This can cause the tower to wobble when rotating to point into the wind.</li>
</ol>
<p>Edit:
To add a single blade turbine is actually quite good efficiency wise! It needs a counterweight and looks really weird, and the move to giant turbines has killed them off, but they did use to be a cost effective solution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They can have more but it becomes not worth it</p>
<p>Three blades are balanced and avoid massive vibrations (unlike 1 or 2 blades).  Three blades also do a decent job capturing the energy from the air, adding a 4th blade increases the cost of the rotor by 33% but doesn't capture 33% more energy.  Each blade also induces turbulence behind it which means a close follower is significantly less efficient.</p>
<p>And probably the most counterintuitive thing of all - you don't want to capture all the energy of the wind.  Wind turbines need to operate across a range of wind speeds and survive significantly higher speeds than they can safely operate, adding more blades means more wind resistance when a big storm comes to town.  Either you build a bigger/stronger/$$$$ tower to counter the extra load from the additional blades or your tower falls over.</p>
<p>The most cost effective way to increase the output of a wind turbine is to make the blades longer so they capture a wider area.  A 10% increase in length is a 21% increase in peak power because its about the area of the disc swept</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I heard an explanation a little different than the other answers. </p>
<p>The basic idea is that you want to gather the wind without blocking the wind. The moment you block the wind you have diminishing returns. So you want as few thin blades as possible.</p>
<p>This video goes over it</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>3 things:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The first and most important is balance.</p>
<p>If you take a stick and sort of find the halfway point you can balance it fairly easily.</p>
<p>If you start spinning it, it spins fairly easily but you can feel your hand wobbling a little.</p>
<p>That wobble for your hand isn't much but for a 50 ton arm hung 150m in the air it become a HUGE wobble.</p>
<p>if you could have a perfectly matched 3 prong stick that wobble would be almost non existant compared to a 2 sided stick.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There is a LOT of heavy math to prove this but let's keep this ELI5.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There are a number of other number of prongs that are balanced but then comes point 2:</p>
<p>The wind isn't pushing the blades, the air behind the blades is sucking the blades.</p>
<p>That means that if I cover the entire disc the blades would cover then nothing comes through, it just bends the disk and potentially breaks the arm (Take an umpbrella out into a high wind and my point will be well made)</p>
<p>So there's a balance between covering the circle completely and not at all that will give us the most suck.</p>
<p>5 is actually pretty good BUT its only slightly better then 3 (Again, fairly heavy math).</p>
<p>So when you add in the price of each blade 3 makes a LOT more sense financially and structurally (Weight of the blades on the arm).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Finally you have to worry about how fast they will go depending on wind speed. and while there isn't that much difference between 3 and 5 the range of safe wind speeds for 3 is better than for 5. (Again heavy math)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Have you seen any of these blades travelling down the road? I imagine they are more expensive than a sailboat of the same size.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
