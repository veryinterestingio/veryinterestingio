<p>I came across records from the coast of the island Usedom today (was looking into something related for work) and it may be a stupid question, but I thought you could see the sea level rise, but there wasn't much of a trend in the data. Is the time period of 60 years too short? Or are there other reasons for this, like tectonic movements or the fact that the water exchange with the Atlantic Ocean is limited?</p></div></div>

<p>Longer: A sea level record in a place is a measure of <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs40641-016-0045-7" target="_blank">relative sea level as opposed to eustatic sea level</a>, meaning that the observed change in average level of the ocean relative to a fixed point on land is the product of the rate at which sea level is changing, but also the rate at which land elevation is changing (both with respect to some fixed datum). In the case of many places in the northern parts of Eurasia and North America, due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isostasy" target="_blank">isostasy</a> and the removal of mass from the land by melting of the ice sheets that existed during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Glacial_Maximum" target="_blank">last glacial maximum</a>, the land surface elevation is going up faster than sea level is rising, so in those locations, you observe a relative sea level fall. In the case of Northern Germany / Poland, the rate of post glacial rebound (refer to the map in the first link) is pretty similar to the rate of eustatic sea level rise, so you would expect to basically see not much of a trend.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
