		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The early universe is opaque, so there's a limit to how far you can see before you hit this opaque region. The furthest we can see is back to the point in time when the universe got cool enough and thin enough that it transitioned from opaque to transparent. We're looking back in time with distance, so what we see is a sort of wall behind everything, a kind of <em>background</em> to the universe.</p>
<p>In this background we see the surface of the very hot gas that our portion of the universe evolved from. Over time, the light from this background has been redshifted down to microwaves. So this is the <em>cosmic microwave background</em>, and we have lots of maps of it.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that telescopes don't see &quot;far&quot;, they're just good at capturing lots of light to see dim things, and at magnifying things to see things at higher resolution. So a low resolution telescope will still get the light from lots of distant galaxies, it just won't resolve them well enough to see them as individual galaxies - they'll just all get muddled up together. And a small telescope just won't capture many photons from these galaxies at all.</p>
<p>But the cosmic microwave background comes from all directions, so it's not too hard to detect. Newer instruments have just been able to map it in higher precision.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's import to also understand the galaxies 13.2 Billion ly away that the Hubble can/has imaged, are now a lot further away: on the order of 32-34 Billion ly away, due to the expansion of the universe in the 13.2 billion years since the light left those galaxies. There is a point already out there where all the light that was ever going to get here from there has already arrived. The expansion of the universe has now made those things so far away, that its light will no longer reach earth. It may be, the light of the very first stars to shine in the universe through opaque clouds of gas in the early universe falls into this category. The light of the big bang, if it existed, probably also falls into this category: it is outside the light cone of what it is possible to see from where we are. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>13.8 Light years isn’t that far. 13.8 billion light years is. The issue isn’t our ability to see that far away, it’s that the space between us and there is getting bigger. Not just that things are moving away, there is physically more space.</p>
<p>For instance, our observable universe’s border isn’t as far back as time goes, it’s the distance at which all the space between us and there is expanding faster than light, so no light from beyond that point will ever reach us. It’s like trying to run south on an infinitely long northbound train. You will never make it back to the station. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the universe’s expansion is faster than light and accelerating, so looking at something 13.8 billion light years away is not necessarily 13.8 billion years old. this is why the observable universe is 93 billion light years wide and not 27.5. No, you will never see big bang.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
