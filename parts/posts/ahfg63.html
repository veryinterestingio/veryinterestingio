		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple of reasons that we can hear what direction a sound is coming from:</p>
<p>•Left to right is the simplest, we can pick up the slight delay from the sound taking a little longer to get to one of our ears and figure it out from there</p>
<p>•The other directions are because of the unusual shape of our ears - in getting to the eardrum the sound will bounce around in various different ways depending on where the sound is coming from, and our brains have had so much practice at listening to those echoes that it knows exactly what direction just from that exact echo.</p>
<p>Binaural recordings are literally just recording the exact sound that gets to your eardrum, and so it tricks your brain into thinking that it echoed off your ear to have come from that exact spot instead of coming from your headphones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of binaural recording has to do with the way the sound is transmitted within your head.  In regular life, as sound makes it's way to your cochlea, it doesn't just go straight down your ear canal, it also goes through your skull.  The way many binaural recordings are made, this is simulated by using microphones specially attached to a fake head.</p>
<p>When you listen to these recordings, your brain (just as it always does) takes the frequencies and delays of the sound that are hitting your cochlea and builds an aural picture of where the sound is coming from.</p>
<p>For example, if someone is clicks their fingers right by your ear, the sound would travel a much more direct route to your cochlea, retaining a lot of the higher frequencies in only one ear.  But, if someone clicked directly above your head, the higher frequencies of sound would be filtered out by your skull before it hits the cochlea (creating a more bass-y sound), and then you would get a slightly delayed higher frequency equally in both ears as the higher frequencies of the click reverberated into your ear canal from the walls.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For lower frequency sounds, you can tell from the delay of arrival between your two ears.  High pitches deprive you of this capability, which is why it's sometimes hard to locate sharp chirping sounds.</p>
<p>Beyond that, your brain has gotten very good and judging left/right direction from the way your head blocks the sound coming from either side.</p>
<p>Finally, up and down comes from the shape of your ears themselves, which cause the sound waves to bounce around and attenuate slightly differently depending on the vertical angle of the source.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Oai7HUqncAA?t=270" target="_blank">This video by Smarter Every Day</a> demonstrates this very well.  They fill his kid's ears with basically play-dough, and he becomes unable to localize the height of a sound source (but can still do horizontal angle of arrival). </p>
<p>The biaural records would do this by putting microphones inside some ear-like casing, so that the two sound channels are colored with roughly the same kind of distortions your ears condition the incoming sound with so when that sound is put <em>into</em> your ear with an earbud, you get the proper effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read this explanation a few years ago: our shoulders reflect a small amount of sound back to our ears and the auditory parts of our brain can detect the time difference between the main sound and that slight &quot;echo&quot;, which is a bit different for both ears because of the shape of our shoulders, the obstruction from our own head, etc. This resolves to a direction for the origin of the sound. A recording can replicate this by adding such a faint echo of the main sound at just the right time differential in each ear to fool us into perceiving that it comes from this direction or that direction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain has learned to determine the position of a sound based on a lot of subtle information.</p>
<p>&quot;Localization can be described in terms of three-dimensional position: the azimuth or horizontal angle, the elevation or vertical angle, and the distance (for static sounds) or velocity (for moving sounds).</p>
<p>The azimuth of a sound is signaled by the <strong>difference in arrival times between the ears</strong>, by the relative amplitude of high-frequency sounds (the shadow effect), and by the asymmetrical spectral <strong>reflections from various parts of our bodies, including torso, shoulders, and</strong> <strong><em>pinnae</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The distance cues are the loss of amplitude, the loss of high frequencies, and the ratio of the direct signal to the reverberated signal.</p>
<p>Depending on where the source is located, our head acts as a barrier to change the timbre, intensity, and spectral qualities of the sound, helping the brain orient where the sound emanated from. These minute differences between the two ears are known as <strong>interaural cues</strong>.&quot;</p>
