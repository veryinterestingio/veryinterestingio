		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it hurts.</p>
<p>From an evolutionary perspective it could serve several purposes.</p>
<p>First it summons help. This is massively important particularly in species where child rearing is an investment of significant time and resources.</p>
<p>Second it warns the community of potential hazards.</p>
<p>Both of these best function as a reflex, as a rational process requires both intention and the time and complexity to form that intention.</p>
<p>The reflex is so important that both yelling and cursing produce a neurological reward in the form of released analgesics.</p>
<p>You literally feel better if you yell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It draws attention.   </p>
<p>For mammals, it might attract the attention of our family/social unit, who might come to our aid.   </p>
<p>For every creature, it stands a chance of frightening the creature that is hurting/eating us, enough to drop us and run.</p>
<p>It also stands a chance of attracting the attention of more predators who will quarrel, giving a chance for escape.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not all mammals yell. Cats often suffer in secret because if they make too much noise they would withdraw attention from their enemies. It makes it harder for the owner's to notice if something is wrong with their pet. </p>
<p>Social animals yell to get help from the other members of their society. It is also a warning  to the aggressor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is both a warning and a call. Pain knowledge keeps us safe also. We remember a hot stove if we touch it so we dont touch it again or any other fire. We learn to be cautious and alert if you're paying attention. If you are like me and have autism, some of this is messed up in you. I will touch the preverbaial hot stove over and over. Who knows why.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I like to think that the natural state of humans is to be screaming and we are just taught to hold it in.  That's why babies start as soon as they can breath, and when we get hurt (or really excited or angry), we momentarily forget to contain the screaming.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
