		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure why you’re getting such weird answers, but there are 7 main strains of the coronavirus in humans. </p>
<p>The four mundane ones are referred to as “HCoV”, such as HCoV-HKU1. </p>
<p>These strains are constantly present in humans and are known for causing common colds, and very rarely leading to complications. Our bodies are typically quite used to them. </p>
<p>And then there are 3 novel strains, new strains that have emerged in the past 20 years. They are: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV 2.  </p>
<p>SARS, or “severe acute respiratory syndrome”, emerged in the early 2000s and, unlike COVID-19, it was easily controlled through international cooperation. Most people only heard about it in the news. We were so effective at controlling it that we gave up on a vaccine because it no longer served a purpose. </p>
<p>MERS-COV, or “Middle East respiratory syndrome”, is significantly more deadly than any other coronavirus, with a mortality rate as high as 35%. Thankful it also proved easy to contain and while it still exists in the wild, yearly cases are low enough to not be a concern. </p>
<p>SARS-CoV-2, or COVID-19, is something I’m sure you’re aware of. </p>
<p>Note that these coronaviruses compete with each other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a paper analyzing the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17687-3" target="_blank">evolutionary origins of SARS-CoV-2</a>, the virus that causes COVID-19. </p>
<p>They identified over 600 new coronaviruses in this paper alone.</p>
<p>Edit: for awareness, this research group's grant was <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/04/nih-s-axing-bat-coronavirus-grant-horrible-precedent-and-might-break-rules-critics-say" target="_blank">cancelled for political reasons</a> earlier this year by the Trump Administration. If you think this is important research and that science agencies should be free from political interference, vote this November</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, there’s SARS, MERS, and SARS-2, not to mention the ones that just give you a cold, so more than 7 that just infect humans. Hundreds that infect the animal kingdom.</p>
<p>As far as strains of <em>SARS-CoV-2</em> which is <em>probably</em> what you were asking about, there’s definitely two, and may be 6 or 7. But we’re sure S and L are different strains of SARS-2.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
