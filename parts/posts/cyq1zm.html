		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Feathers, Hair, and Scales</strong>:</p>
<p>The first thing to notice is that feathers and scales can be a wider variety of vibrant colors than hair can. So mammals may have exciting stripes and spots, but the bright colors are going to be on reptiles, birds, and fish.</p>
<p><strong>Birds</strong>:</p>
<p>The truth is, as far as birds are concerned, we don't have reason to believe that there is a larger <strong>percentage</strong> of colorful birds in the tropics: <a href="https://www.asianscientist.com/2016/11/in-the-lab/bird-plumage-evolution-australia/" target="_blank">https://www.asianscientist.com/2016/11/in-the-lab/bird-plumage-evolution-australia/</a></p>
<p>There are just more <strong>species in total</strong> in the tropics, and so the total number of colorful bird species is greater. </p>
<p><strong>Reptiles</strong>:</p>
<p>There are definitely more reptile species in the tropics and subtropics than in more poleward regions. I've seen no study comparing the <em>percentage</em> of them that are colorful, but the same general notion would apply either way---there are more species in total to be colorful. Though there certainly are some colorful species in temperate regions---like the Lacertids in Europe, which can be vibrant greens and blues, the Garter snakes and smooth green snakes of the USA, etc. </p>
<p><strong>Fish</strong>:</p>
<p>I think you're primarily thinking of near-surface coral reefs.</p>
<p>It's really just piggybacking the coral reefs. There happen to be these organisms which thrive in very low-nutrient, clear, shallow, warm water----creating diverse ecosystems. And within those diverse ecosystems, there will be a diversity of species all evolving bright colors for signaling things, because the bright colors can be seen in the clear, shallow, brightly lit water.</p>
<p>But there are other aquatic environments in the tropics----more sediment-laden waters, murky rivers, mangroves, etc. and there are also highly oligotrophic (clear, low-nutrient) waters in temperate regions where you may find colorful fish like the tangerine darter.</p>
<p>So is life in the tropics actually more colorful? I don't see that as an obvious conclusion. But the sheer total diversity of species in the tropics certainly allows for more possible expression in general.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Closer to the equator are much better conditions for life to exist (warmer temps, more vegetation, etc). That’s why there’s a huge amount of diversity there. With more diversity and more flora/fauna comes more competition. With more competition, flora/fauna really have to bring their A-game in order to survive and successfully propagate THEIR species.</p>
<p>(“A-game” meaning, brighter colors to attract/impress mates. And in the case of plant life, to attract pollinators)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My high school science fair project dealt with this. I subjected two populations of goldfish to different levels of light. One with full sun during the day and one that was covered and received minimal sunlight. I then took samples of their scales and measured the chromatophores, the cells that determine color, kind of like when we humans tan, in terms of their size shape and diameter under a microscope. In my super professional high school experiment I found there was a statistically significant difference. I wonder if this applies to this situation. Can any actual scientists weigh in? A bigger orange cell is more colorful than a small cell. I don’t know. I couldn’t go to the science fair to follow through because my boss wouldn’t let me off work. I was fourteen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Color is about display, and display is about sexual selection.  Producing and maintaining features like a bright external surface requires surplus energy above merely staying alive, so reduces your fitness.  However, demonstrating that you have the ability to survive while maintaining these anti-adaptive features demonstrates to your potential mates that your genes are good enough to take the fitness hit and still thrive.  For a sexual fitness display to work biologically it must have a real physiological and/or adaptive cost.  If you could fake it, it would not work as a signal.  This is established evolutionary biology that dates back to Darwin's second major work <em>The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex</em> and has been well demonstrated<em>.</em>  </p>
<p>One feature of tropical reefs and forests is the abundance of life, arising from the extra sunlight producing high levels of primary production from photosynthesis.  This means that there is going to be a lot of competition about, so an animal needs to stand out from other potential suitors.  Sexual selection mechanisms become more important.  I would expect that an organism that lives in a sparsely populated region, like in the deep sea or out on the tundra would not put a lot of energy into its appearance.  Just surviving to meet a mate is enough, there may no one to compete with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly you could ask the same question about the color choices of human clothing. Winter clothes tend to toward dark, drab colours, while summer clothes tend to be way more colourful.</p>
<p>This means the answer could be the same, function over fashion. </p>
<p>If your main concern in colder regions is staying warm then evolution may select for a dull brown coat of fur, feathers, etc which is warm over a colourful one which is more attractive to mates.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
