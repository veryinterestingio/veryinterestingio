These two articles are a good summary of what we know on the subject and when more studies might come out.</p>

<p>“We are seeing a very clear reduction in the risk of long Covid in all age groups if you have had two shots of vaccine,” she said. “We know the vaccines really work to reduce your risk of getting infected in the first place, and then if you are unlucky enough to get Covid we are showing your risk of long Covid is much reduced.”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't know for sure, but it's expected that it reduces long-haul cases.</p>
<ol>
<li>The breakthrough rate is low. </li>
<li>Majority of breakthrough cases are asymptomatic (~27% of detected cases: it's hard to detect asymptomatic breakthrough: most are detected when test is run for hospital admittance for other reasons)</li>
<li>The vaccine hasn't been out long enough in quantity to measure long haul once vaccinated.</li>
</ol>
<p>What we do know is that vaccinated people get less severe Covid when they do have a breakthrough. That would lead to the expectation that the long haul rate would be less. </p>

<p>We're also seeing that vaccination helps long haul symptoms in many patients (~40%). The mechanism isn't really known yet.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There hasn't been any high quality prospective epidemiological studies to even know the true incidence rates.</p>
<p>But I'm willing to bet the vaccine efficacy against Long Covid is similar to the efficacy against symptomatic infection, if it is at all similar to other post-viral conditions which I have been following the research of for the past 15 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
