		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chickens lay eggs whether they are fertilized or not, so the easiest way to make commercial eggs is to not allow the males to mix with the females.</p>
<p>But if you need to check an egg you just hold it up to a bright light. You can see enough through the shell to tell if a chick is in there. Commercial operations do this with automated machinery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chickens will lay eggs no matter what. It’s basically a daily chicken period. Only if they are fertilized by a rooster beforehand will they form baby chicks. If you keep chickens away from roosters, all eggs will be eating eggs.</p>
<p>Edit: I know both fertilized and unfertilized eggs can be eaten. OP said eating eggs and reproductive eggs so I stuck with the same terminology assuming they meant how do farmers know what eggs are able to become chicks and which ones won’t.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You can eat eggs whether they’re fertilized or not.  The embryo doesn’t develop unless the egg is incubated either by a hen or a machine.</p>
<p>Eggs can be “candled” to see an embryo.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hens lay fertile eggs within about 3 weeks of being 'visited' by a rooster. She then doles out the semen one egg at a time as she lays a clutch. After laying as many as she wants to incubate, she sits on them, keeping them uniformly ~99° F for 21 days. </p>
<p>Fertile eggs are indiscernible from infertile eggs and can only be proven one way or the other by incubating or cracking them open. Only a trained eye can tell the difference, even by cracking and examining. Noticeable development  is only present after 5-7 days at incubation temperatures.</p>
<p>Eggs are generally collected within a few hours of being laid, so there's normally no danger of finding any development, as they aren't incubated.</p>
<p>TL;DR:  Farmers collect eggs regardless of whether they are fertile or not. Fertilization is absolutely irrelevant, as a normal person couldn't possibly discern whether the uncracked egg was fertile until day 8 or so of intentional incubation. They look and taste the same either way.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All eggs are eating eggs unless you want to hatch more chickens. Hatching eggs require fertilization from a rooster. On commercial farms, hens that lay eating eggs rarely, if ever, are given any 'private time' with a rooster. They may bring in a rooster to give them motivation but not allow fertilization.  My family raised chickens when I was a kid and we had a rooster. There is a visible difference when you crack open a fertilized eggs because the yolk and the egg white are joined together by threads or tubules. I don't recall the eggs tasting any different (Summertime eggs were definitely better because the chickens were eating a lot of bugs. The yolk is a deeper yellow.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
