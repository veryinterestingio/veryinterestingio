		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wish more people mentioned the aspect of anxiety that goes into ADHD procrastination. ADHD affects mood way more than people realize. A lot of procrastination is an anxiety response—being overwhelmed by just the idea of being overwhelmed. It’s an avoidance measure against feeling out of control and like a failure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ADHD likely interrupts and causes deficits in what is known as prospective memory. Think of it as your ability to see forward. As a result someone with ADHD generally has difficulty conceptualizing future goals and direction. </p>
<p>In addition (and more related to your question) it also lowers the likelihood that one considers the consequences of their actions outside of the most immediate. Someone with ADHD may skip homework or break a house rule because they will escape any real consequence in the immediate sense. Those consequences will almost certainly appear hours or days later but they’ll struggle to consider something that far out</p>
<p>Edit: on a more behavioral level this can be improved or exacerbated by increasing accountability in a more direct sense. patterns of behavior that allow further consequence escape (extremely lax parenting, manipulation, etc) or tighten it exacerbate/improve the underlying issues and worsen/improve the patterns of behavior we recognize as “ADHD”. Although to be clear interventions are by no means limited to this</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to things other people mentioned,  our ADHD brains have a harder time producing/processing all those happy chemicals like Dopamine.  Its why we have such varied interests that change so often,  its why we fidget and daydream and lose focus;  our brains are looking for stimuli.   How this relates to the question is that a lot of the things we procrastinate about are low dopamine things,  like chores,  so when our battery is low, we don't wanna do the things that will drain it more.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also Executive function issues,  object permanence issues...</p>
<p>Also the Name: ADHD is basically named after the way it annoyed our family and doctors growing up.  I have a lack of attention?  Only cuz yer boring.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>That rant got away form me.  Goodnight!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To put it into basic terms: your body has a built in reward system to help you survive. It is meant to reward actions that are good for you (eating, exercising..). One very important chemical in this process is dopamine. Dopamine is released from one neuron into a tiny space, and is meant to be received by the next neuron. This transfer of dopamine is what tells your brain ‘good job, you ran 5 miles, here’s some happy hormones to make sure you do it again’.</p>
<p>People with adhd often have disruptions in this pathway. Sometimes they don’t make enough dopamine, but more often their recycling system work overtime. This means that the neuron that releases the dopamine, immediately sucks it back in, which doesn’t let the second neuron enough time to receive the signal. The result is that the good action doesn’t feel rewarding.</p>
<p>Psychologically, this is translated into low motivation and low levels of concentration. Any new task will release some dopamine (your monkey brain used that to investigate new objects and make sure they were safe), but the effect fades quickly (to keep the monkey brain from obsessing over a rock for 3 hours under the effect of dopamine). People with adhd will constantly seek that little hit of dopamine that new things give. It makes us extra observant, very easily distracted, and unlikely to stick to boring tasks because it’s so much more rewarding to us to stare out the window and notice all the small things.</p>
<p>Specifically with procrastination, another issue is at play called time blindness. We tend to not be aware of time passing by. Time has two setting for us: now, or not now. The concept of ‘in an hour’ is hard to grasp. If a task requires several low dopamine steps to get started, it’s hard to motivate yourself to do them. This is not due to lack of internal motivation, rather the brain is unequipped to feel the satisfaction of getting up to do something. People with adhd often find themselves procrastinating even fun things they want to do, because they have trouble switching between tasks.</p>
<p>It’s like an excitable monkey driving a huge cargo ship. It sees an island right and left and will constantly want to go there, changing course of the boat and zig zagging around, not paying attention to the reefs on the ships radar because a pretty bird is flying by. But once it’s landed on an island and is exploring it, it’s hard to get back on the ship to move to the next island.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Executive function.  The ability to confidently select a decision among a list of options.  Persons with ADHD have difficulty with this in particular.  They can experience frequent episodes of analysis paralysis, where overthinking the perfect way to proceed may take more time than was saved from the planning it out to begin with.  They can have a hard time committing to a decision.  Especially if that task requires follow up at a later point.  </p>
<p>A person with ADHD will mostly prefer to work in the &quot;now&quot;, or with whatever is immediately in front of them, but this is often impeded by their hyper-reactive response to stimuli.  This is why they trail of on non-essential tasks that catch their attention while attempting to perform higher priority tasks. The lack of executive function prevents their brain from thinking, &quot;I'll get that in a sec, right after I wrap up what I'm doing here.&quot;  The fear of forgetting can encourage them address lower priority tasks immediately. </p>
<p>And this is all really about inhibitors.  The part of your brain that actually does all the functional stuff is located near the spinal column.  It's your lizard brain taking care of all of your motor function, sensory input, and so on.  Basically all the rest of your brain is communication lines and inhibitors.  The wrinkled exterior is almost entirely inhibitory neurons.  So when we're talking about mental hindrances, most conditions involve a loss of restraint.  Even brain trauma often results in behavioral outbursts. </p>
<p>Physiologically speaking, ADHD is characterized by reduced activity in certain inhibitory areas of the brain. Maybe you've heard this as &quot;lacking filters&quot;.  Their ability to dismiss unimportant stimuli is hindered.  They're often hard to talk to if there is a TV on in the background, because TV programing is specifically geared to be visually attention grabbing. When our brain processes the things we see, it gives higher priority to things that are moving.  When TVs flash a bunch of colorful visuals, our brains are seeing high priority input, and it takes a strong filter to leave our thoughts unimpeded.   </p>
<p>Hopefully this makes it apparent how some with ADHD are said to be procrastinating, when really they're just spinning their wheels.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
