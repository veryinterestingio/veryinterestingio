I am likely getting that part wrong, but whatever the concept was it made me wonder if the same could be true for light.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, what you describe is possible through a process called difference sum generation. The idea is that if you pass two beams through special types of matter, one at a frequency f1 and another at f2 you can produce a beam at a frequency f3 given by:</p>
<p>f3=f1-f2.</p>
<p>The process is roughly shown in <a href="https://i.imgur.com/O6FY7FM.png" target="_blank">this diagram.</a> A slightly more famous cousin of this effect is where the frequencies add up (such that f3=f1+f2), called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sum-frequency_generation" target="_blank">sum frequency generation</a>. The latter effect is apparently more famous to get its own Wiki article, but the physics is very similar. </p>
<p>The reason you need to pass the beams through matter is that this effect is non-linear. Normally two light waves passing passed each other absolutely would not give a fuck that the other was there. In more sciency terms we would say that the cross-section for non-linear interactions was very low. But in certain types of materials these effects get rather probable. </p>
<p>To get back to your original question though, yes this effect has an analogue in acoustics called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_(acoustics\)" target="_blank">beating</a>. While the physical mechanism is a bit different when talking about sound waves and light, some aspects stay the same, e.g. the fact that the effect kicks in at the difference in frequency of the two interacting waves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Each frequency of light obeys one equation and they cannot beat or add frequencies without some material (a nonlinear element such as certain crystals) which can couple different frequencies.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyones talking about DFG. Based on OP's post my understanding of the question is can two streams of a laser cross (no specific medium to interact with) to produce something different than the original two, so simply interference. </p>
<p>I know if you shine a red and blue laser at the same spot on a white wall, they will reflect magenta. However the two beams will not interact like that in free space. I could be wrong, but I assume that if you &quot;cross the beams of a UV laser and an infrared laser&quot; (in open space) they will not produce visible light until they have a surface or medium to interact on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's two parts to this problem, the first being whether or not you can apply the concept of acoustic beats to EM waves, and the second being, if you can, can humans perceive the lower frequency as being a new shade of color.</p>
<p>If we limit ourselves to only pure tones (sine waves) for both sound and light, then I believe acoustic beats would indeed happen with light (note: I am not saying that we could <em>perceive</em> them, but that you would get the same shape of wave). This is because of the superposition principle, the idea that you can simply add the intensity of two EM waves to get the resulting wave. A consequence of the superposition principle is that waves don't interact with each other i.e. they're independent. </p>
<p>The superposition principle holds for acoustics as well, meaning that the waves don't interact. So how can two new frequencies come about if the waves don't interact? It's because two sine waves of differing frequencies, when added together, are mathematically equivalent to a sine wave with a <em>higher</em> frequency that varies in <em>volume</em> at a lower frequency (see the wikipedia page for beats (acoustics)). This is NOT the same as two new waves being formed with these two new frequencies, it's actually that a new higher frequency wave results that is <em>multiplied</em> (not added with) the lower frequency wave (this can also be stated as the lower frequency wave being multiplied by the higher frequency one). This is due purely to the math and requires just no direct interaction, and no human perception. So I believe the answer to the first part of the problem is that yes, you will get an EM wave with the same shape as an acoustic wave corresponding to acoustic beats because the math is the same, so now we can focus on whether or not we can perceive it.</p>
<p>For the second part, I honestly don't have an answer, but I will tell you what I know to hopefully create some discussion to figure out the answer.</p>
<p>Our ears work through Fourier decomposition (imagine graphing intensity vs. frequency), but despite that, we will still hear a beat tone if two sine waves are close enough in frequency. Once they're farther apart, we hear the two tones independently, which corresponds to the equivalent Fourier decomposition of two spikes, one at each frequency of the two sound sources. So even for acoustics, the answer to whether or not we perceive the beat frequency can be either yes or no, even when the beat frequency in question is in the audible range!</p>
<p>As for light, the cones in our eyes work completely differently, with each type of cone having its own frequency response, with a given cone (red, green, or blue) being able to react to a large frequency of visible light spanning multiple colors. We perceive color through the brain interpreting the differing intensities of light hitting each cone, meaning that you can perceive yellow both from a pure yellow wave as well as from a combination of red and green added together. In the case of red + green, the lower beat frequency is in the infrared range (roughly 25-100Thz), and the upper beat frequency is in the yellow to orange range (being the average of the two) so the fact that we see yellow is purely based on the ratios of how much each of the three cone types is firing and NOT due to EM beats.</p>
<p>As you suggested in your question, OP, combining UV and infrared light of the right frequencies would indeed produce light with a lower beat frequency in the visible spectrum, and I would be extremely interested to know if this beating can be picked up by our eyes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If you do this in sun light, uv rays would intersect the infrared beam. You don't see a cool laser show of rainbow awesomeness when you do this, so no, the uv sun rays dont interact with infrared rays to create visible light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
