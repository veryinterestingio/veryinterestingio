		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Consensual sex usually involves lubrication - in a woman that lubrication comes from preparation, foreplay, and sometimes external lube. </p>
<p>A consenting woman is more relaxed about the act of penetration, so there's a lot less chance of tearing and bruising of the vaginal tissue.  </p>
<p>A woman who does not consent to sex will struggle, and is likely to incur bruises from being held down.  Wrists, thighs, buttocks, waist, throat. </p>
<p>Obviously, an alive victim can tell their story. A dead victim's assault is also likely to be revealed from body positioning, any missing clothing (underwear), the state of the clothing (rips), and if the victim was dressed / re-dressed properly (clothing inside out, buttons lined up improperly,) in addition to physical clues on the body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A Sexual Assault Nurse Examination (SANE) kit can identify indicators of sexual assault by photo documentation of vaginal or anal tearing (this is not always a definitive source of evidence as some degree of tearing can take place even through consensual sex and the absence of tearing is not by itself an indicator of consent), bruising, or other physical indicators.</p>
<p>Swabs are also taken from the mouth and genitals to gather semen or other DNA evidence and sexual assault survivors are typically advised not to drink fluids or wash their genitals between their most recent assault and exam in order to avoid contaminating evidence. A SANE nurse might also run pregnancy, STI, and/or toxicity screens to determine the presence of rohypnol or other intoxicants/inebriants. Most of the above can also be used in post-mortem analysis.</p>
<p>For chronic or long term abuse (especially in the case of minors), a forensic psychologist may conduct interviews with the survivor in order to better determine the nature or extent of the abuse - but that involves an entirely seperate process and might be a bit outside of the scope of OP's question.</p>
<p>It is rare for any one indicator to serve as conclusive evidence of sexual assault; rather, exam results, statements to law enforcement, crime scene investigation, and other factors are combined to develop an assault narrative.</p>
<p>Sidenote: having worked in this field, I can attest that claims of widespread false reporting are not plausible. The process is so extensive, humiliating, time consuming, and emotionally draining that (rare) disingenuous claims tend to dissolve long before they reach a courtroom.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is really hard to tell tbh. The obvious signs (though still not definitive) are internal tears and bruising. The secondary are outside tears and bruising. But we need to remember such markings can also occur during consenting rough play or &quot;playrape&quot; and bdsm, and it is damn near impossible to tell if the bruising is from rough play or rape if the possibility of rough play is present.</p>
<p>Live victims can tell what happened to them, and visible bruising would strengthen the story. Dead victims are usually assumed raped if found in a compromising position and fresh lubrication/semen.</p>
<p>Either way, injury and story is easy to fake and there is no foolproof way of telling. Internal injury is what doctors will look at first and foremost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Swelling and redness around genitals, defensive wounds, and Fluid swabs are all indicative sexual abuse. And if the victim is alive, then first hand testimony as well. Sadly many surviving victims never come forward.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
