		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The title of your post and the contents are different in a subtle, but important way. The title says &quot;impossible to prove through our current mathematical axioms&quot;, whereas the post body says &quot; it has not been able to be proven by our current mathematical knowledge&quot;.</p>
<p>The first version is the most profound. Given a set of axioms, we can find problems that are &quot;undecidable&quot; based on those axioms. That is, there is no way to develop an algorithm that always leads to a (correct) yes/no answer. There are quite a number of problems we know are undecidable, but I can't think of any that would be easy to conceptualize by any high school student.</p>
<p>The second version, however, is much more approachable. It simply asks for problems that we've not been able to prove so far, indicating that a proof could exist, but it has simply eluded us. There are a number of such unsolved problems that are relatively easy to conceptualize.</p>
<p><strong>Goldbach's Conjecture</strong> Any even number larger than 2 can be written as the sum of two prime numbers. For example: 42 can be written as 37 + 5, both of which are prime. Goldbach's Conjecture has been checked computationally for a very large set of numbers and so far it always works. But a full proof remains elusive.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect Numbers</strong> A &quot;perfect number&quot; is defined as a number whose divisors (other than the number itself) add up to that number. 6 is perfect, because it's divisors, 1, 2 and 3, add up to 6. On the other hand, 8 is not perfect, because it's divisors, 1, 2 and 4, don't add up to 8. After 6, the next perfect number is 28 (1, 2, 4, 7, 14), followed by 496 and 8128. So far, all perfect numbers that have been found are even. It is unknown whether odd perfect numbers exist. Or if there are infinitely many perfect numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Collatz Conjecture</strong> Create a sequence by starting with any positive integer. If it is even, the next number in the sequence is obtained by dividing the previous one by 2. If it's odd, the next number is obtained by multiplying the previous one by 3 and adding 1. Repeat this procedure. For example: 3 -&gt; 10 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 16 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1. Once this sequence reaches 1, it'll start to repeat (1 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1). An open question is: Does this sequence always end at 1, regardless of the starting number? This question has been tested computationally for a very large set of starting values and all have ended up with the sequence reaching 1. But a definitive proof is still missing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't know if there is an infinite number of 7s in the decimal expansion of pi = 3,141592653589<strong>7</strong>932384626433832<strong>7</strong>9...</p>
<p>It sounds obvious, and yet we have no idea how to prove this apparently easy statement. (Note that it's not a problem specific about pi, you can ask the same question for almost all the other irrational constants that you know, sqrt(2), e, golden ratio, etc ...)</p>
<p>This is a subproblem of a larger problem to determine whether these numbers are  normal or not. But I think this problem is more striking because it shows how little we understand about decimal expansions in general.</p>
<p>EDIT : Someone suggested that I should give an example of a number that is transcendental and doesn't have any 7 in its decimal expansion. I choose <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LiouvillesConstant.html" target="_blank">Liouville constant</a></p>
<p>It's the infinite series whose general term is 10^(-n!). In other words 10^(-1)+10^(-2)+10^(-6)+10^(-24)+10^(-120)+... This number is transcendental (it was the first example of a transcendental number actually). Its decimal expansion is :</p>
<p>0.<strong>11</strong>000<strong>1</strong>00000000000000000<strong>1</strong>0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<strong>1</strong>000...</p>
<p>and it obviously doesn't contain any 7. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_prime" target="_blank">Twin Prime Conjecture</a>?</p>
<p>If your students can understand what a prime number is (a positive integer that only has two divisors - itself and 1), then the conjecture itself is pretty easy to conceptualize:</p>
<p>A twin prime is a prime number that is two more or two less than another prime. (So, 5 and 7 are twin primes. 11 and 13 are twin primes. 29 and 31 are twin primes.) The conjecture assumes that there are infinitely many twin prime pairs.</p>
<p>We currently have no proof to demonstrate that this is true.</p>

<p>At some point it'll reach one. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know one from Knot theory.</p>
<p>Knots are loops. Think like a rope that you tangled and then fused the ends together, end to end.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: as a knot becomes more tangled and complex, it requires more rope. </p>
<p>Answer: Probably. We have decided that the minimum length for a nontrivial knot is 15.66*diameter. But minimum ropelength for a specific knot is difficult. We can kinda define lower or upper bounds for a minimum, but this is just saying the minimum value is somewhere between [a,b] but we don't know where, and doesn't lend itself to proving how knots get longer or by how much as they cross themselves more. We think the upper bound is generally linear, but it's conjecture.</p>
<p>If you can figure out a way to increase what we know about general statements about either bound that should net you a PhD, perhaps a Fields Medal depending on how far you advance the field.</p>
<p>Applications of knot theory are difficult for people how haven't dealt with it to wrap their heads around. </p>
<p>** Quantum computing is a good example. Knot braids can model the path of anyons in one. </p>
<p>** DNA structure</p>
<p>Anyone with a head for math can go look up the volume conjecture and the unknotting problem, both totally unsolved.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
