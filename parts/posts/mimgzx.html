As far as I know we already observe galaxies 13 BLY away. Are these in any way more &quot;primordial&quot; than our own Milky Way?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have detected objects that may indeed be protogalaxies (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/science/astronomy-galaxies-black-hole.html" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/science/astronomy-galaxies-black-hole.html</a>), but in general they would be very difficult to detect. </p>
<p>The following paragraph might help explain why. It’s outdated by a couple decades I think but it should still be instructive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So the task of discussing protogalaxies now becomes one of suggesting reasons why they have escaped detection. We close with the following four possibilities. The most obvious possibility is that the first phase of vigorous star formation was essentially complete prior to z = 10 (which, coincidentally, is when the universe is approximately 1 galactic free-fall time old). However, in this case the radiation from the hot young stars is redshifted into the near-infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g., 1-5 µm). Searches for this population with newly developed near-infrared imaging arrays are presently underway. Second, because the ultraviolet radiation from young stars is strongly absorbed by dust, it is possible that the early universe is not transparent to this radiation. This provides a rather effective screen that can potentially hide the process of galaxy formation from us. In this case, the absorbed ultraviolet photons should heat the dust to a temperature of 50-100 K. The radiation from this heated dust will be redshifted to the submillimeter portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The energy density of these hypothetical sources is thought to be detectable with the SIRTF mission to be launched sometime around the year 2000. Third, it is well known that the peak in the redshift distribution of quasars is at z approx 3. Because quasars are now known to be in the nuclei of galaxies and the energy source is thought to be the infall of gas onto a massive black hole, it is possible that this infall process is facilitated by protogalactic collapse. In that case the radiation from the quasar effectively overwhelms that from the rest of the galaxy, imposing a sort of cosmic censorship against observing galaxies in the act of formation. Finally, our expectation that protogalaxies should be observable stems from a relatively naive physical argument. Perhaps, galaxy formation is a far more gentle and quiescent process than we have assumed and there simply is no ultraluminous phase which marks the birth of a galaxy. Future advances in telescopes and instrumentation will hopefully yield firm detections of protogalaxies, from which we can finally study their formation in detail.</p>

Astronomers have found that the mix of shapes (morphologies) depends on redshift. You probably already know that the more redshifted the galaxy, the further back in time you are looking. Galaxies with redshift z=2 (about 8 billion years ago) or more are mostly 'peculiar' galaxies with poorly defined shapes. By z=1.5 (7 billion years ago) there are about as many structured galaxies (like spirals and ellipticals) as there are peculiars.</p>
<p>Those distant galaxies are more primordial in the sense that, as a group, they haven't developed structure compared to galaxies in the near universe.</p>
<p>Here is a good review paper I found: <a href="https://www.astro.umd.edu/~richard/ASTRO620/Conselice_galaxy_structure.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.astro.umd.edu/\~richard/ASTRO620/Conselice\_galaxy\_structure.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.astro.umd.edu/\~richard/ASTRO620/Conselice\_galaxy\_structure.pdf</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Galaxy evolution, or formation is well understood, but with some areas of uncertainty.</p>
<p>The current theory is that primordial black holes began to gravitationally attract gas and form the first stars. These proto galaxies grew to become the large galaxies we see today. Galaxies grow by collecting gas and turning that gas into stars. But if two galaxies get close to each other then they will start a burst of star formation as they slowly merge together. If a small or medium sized galaxy merge with a dwarf galaxy we call that a minor merger. If two galaxies of the same size merge we call that a major merger. With every merger a galaxy creates more stars. The largest galaxies are the result of several major mergers.</p>
<p>Our Milky Way galaxy has had a few minor mergers but no major mergers. We will have a major merger with the Andromeda Galaxy in about 2-3 billion years.</p>
<p>We know this because we can see galaxies in all stages of growth from the dwarf stage up to the largest galaxies that have already had several mergers. We can &quot;look back&quot; in time by looking at more distant galaxies but for about 12 billion years they all look about the same. There are differences in things like the star formation rate and the metallicity, but we generally see galaxies in all stages of evolution.</p>
<p>But at some point we can't see any more galaxies because around 700 million years after the big bang there is too much neutral hydrogen and it blocks basically all the light from galaxies. We really can't see anything before that except for a few of the brightest sources. That is what we call the cosmic dark ages. The only thing we can really see before that is the cosmic microwave background.</p>
<p>So as far as we can see we see galaxies in all stages of development for as far back as we can see. There are some differences that we can detect but the process is all still the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
