But does this also work in languages that don't use true alphabets, like abjads (Arabic), syllabaries (Japanese and Korean) and logographs (Chinese and Japanese)?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't see how you could do the same in standard Chinese. You can do wordplays with sounds (like 布吉岛 instead of 不知道) for example that can be understood in text messaging. You could also theoretically express a sentence by using the right characters with the wrong radical and people would probably be able to understand more or less but it wouldn't be fluid like we read your title's sentence in English.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It works well with Japanese if the sentence is purely composed of Hiragana or Katakana but not as well when there are Kanji (Chinese characters in Japanese) because reasons pointed out by other comments. I would assume it works well with Hiragana and Katakana as they are relatively closer to Alphabet in terms of how they are 'read'</p>
<p>For those who can Japanese, if the original typoglycemia sentence is translated into Japanese Hiragana, it would look like this:</p>
<p>こんちには みさなん おんげき ですか？　わしたは げんき です。
この ぶんょしう は いりぎす の ケブンッリジ だがいく の けゅきんう の けっか
にんげんは たごんを にしんき する ときに</p>
<p>その さしいょ と さいご の もさじえ あいてっれば
じばんゅん は めくちちゃゃ でも ちんゃと よめる という けゅきんう に もづいとて
わざと もじの じんばゅん を いかれえて あまりす。
どでうす？　ちんゃと よゃちめう でしょ？</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The above sentence is scrambled, but I can read it almost as fast as reading the unscrambled version. So based on a sample size of 1, I would say yes it does apply to Chinese. </p>
<p>If you are curious what the sentence says: research shows, the order of words does not affect your understanding, for instance, after you read this sentence, you would realize the order of the words are scrambled. And the unscrambled version is:  “研究表明，汉字的顺序并不一定能影响阅读，比如当你看完这句话后，才发现这里的字全是乱的。”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what is the equivalent you are thinking of for Chinese. Since in English the letters are scrambled, the most direct equivalent would be swapping the positions of strokes around within a character.  I would say in general this produces completely gibberish characters that are near impossible to decipher. For English you basically just need to mentally shift alphabets left and right to decipher a jumbled up word, but in Chinese the strokes can move &quot;360 degrees&quot; within a character so the permutations are endless. Take a common character like 我 (wo), which means &quot;me&quot; or &quot;I&quot;. Maybe some slight shifting of the strokes is ok, but swapping the strokes around creates mutant characters that literally don't exist in the Chinese dictionary and would be unpronounceable and have no meaning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>in arabic language i can kind of figure out what are trying to say if i hear it even if it's broken but visualy it's kind of hard to read depending on the sentence each word can be confused with another diffrent word entirely and sometimes there are words that will read the same even if you mirror them other than that i can still kind of read it just painfull to look at and probably look like am reading gibbrish for the most part</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
