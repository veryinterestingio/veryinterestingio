		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are nuclides which decay by simply emitting protons, but generally only when the outermost proton(s) are not really bound to the rest of the nucleus. Those nuclides tend to be very proton-rich and have half-lives of fractions of a second, so they're not found in any meaningful amount in nature.</p>
<p>As for less exotic nuclides where the protons are all in bound states, it's just not a competitive decay mode with beta/electron capture or alpha.</p>
<p>For really heavy nuclides, they would prefer to emit alpha particles because alpha particles are very tightly-bound systems, so that's an energetically favorable way to decay.</p>
<p>And for intermediate-mass, proton-rich nuclides, they can just undergo a weak decay (beta-plus or electron capture) over a timescale that's much shorter than waiting for a bound proton to tunnel out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nuclei are defined as a cohesive number of protons and neutrons such that one would exist for at least some measurable amount of time before decaying. As you add more protons the proton separation energy (how much energy there is in letting a proton fly out) increases. S_p &lt; 0 essentially means the proton is unbound and energy is gained just by spitting one out, so it happens very fast ( O(ns) ).  </p>
<p>So in super high energy, super high density stellar events like supernovae, or just in stars in right conditions, lots of proton (and neutron non-trivially in supernovae case we think) heavy asymmetric nuclei can be produced. The strong force is responsible for holding an energy separation against all these nucleons of one type being held in one place. As said the strong force is real strong, it fires them out very fast, so they decay pretty much straight after they're made. Fast and slow nucleon fusion rates compared to decays define the s(slow) and r(rapid) process types of nucleus generation in stars. The boundaries of separation energy for single-particle emission are called the drip lines.  </p>
<p>So in short, they all decay way too fast to ever be found. Even if you're in a S_p,n &gt; 0 region but still far from stability, beta decays due to the weak force allowing for energy gain via nucleon exchange through electron/neutrino reactions will also move you to the stability line (not N=Z due to coulomb effects) over time. This process is extremely important for formation and defines all the abundances of each heavy element we see even after their associated formation by the s&amp;r-process.  </p>
<p>If a particle is so huge that the strong force is available for decay in the same way it would be in single-particle emission but not the weak via asymmetry, you will see alpha particle decay dominate anyway. This is because alpha particles have massively binding energy due to magic numbers (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_theorem" target="_blank">shell theorem</a>/QM), making them favourable to 'exist' (quantum mechanically) and get emitted from the nucleus to reduce nuclear size by strong emission.  </p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that any decay could happen at any time, and it is the energy available for such a decay that just defines the amplitude or probability of such a decay. Even a decay through some positive energy can happen via tunnelling. So technically, a single particle emission might happen randomly, at a ridiculously low negligible probability for any nuclei. Alpha and even other stuff like spontaneous fusion competes and overwhelms such a chance for all typical nuclei, however.  </p>
<p>Intuition of how alpha and beta decay operate can be gained from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-empirical_mass_formula" target="_blank">SEMF</a>, that does a decent job describing how all the nuclear effects match up and define stable regions, neglecting quantum shells.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
