		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Memory works by forming connections between things. Song lyrics get extra connections because there is a basic underlying structure to the song. Thus if you can remember the basic pattern of the song, it acts as a memory jog for the specific lyrics.</p>
<p>Instead of the hands of a clock,<br />
I tell time by the crow of my _____</p>
<p>You’ve never heard that before, because I just made it up, but based on assumptions about rhythm and rhyme scheme, it’s very easy to fill in the blank with the correct word. Technically, there’d be nothing wrong with “rooster” as an answer, but that’s not the word you filled it in with.</p>
<p>Songs work the same way. If you forget a word, the surrounding structure of the song creates a specifically shaped hole that limits the possibilities of what could fit in it, and that makes it easy to remember the right word.</p>
<p>A phone number is a semi-arbitrary string of numbers. If you forget the last digit, nothing in the preceding digits is going to give you any clue as to what that last number could possibly be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The melody of the song helps you to remember the words. If you were to take a random number like 8675309 and set that to a catchy tune I bet you’d say “I got it!” </p>
<p>It’s actually a great way to commit stuff to memory is to make a rhyme or song out of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>But telephone numbers or memorizing short sequences I find pretty easy.</p>
<p>So definitely not universal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, people used to remember phone numbers, tons of them, and it was usually remembered in some rhythmic pattern, similar to a song. The reason we don't remember numbers now is because we have a device that stores them for us so you don't have to remember them now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
