		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It can work at all scales under the same assumptions as where fluid equations work. This is because it is essentially a parcel argument theory. That is it considers a blob of fluid heated and then rising before depositing its heat and falling back down. This kind of answers your 3rd question as the point at which our description breaks down is at worst the same as where our approximations of fluids breaks down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The criteria for the onset of convection is that the entropy gradient is smaller than the radiative gradient. This is the most basic definition known as Schwarzschilds criteria. Composition plays a role but that becomes more complicated as we need to consider the compositional gradient, this is known as double-diffusive convection, where we now care about both the Schwarszchild criteria as well as the Ledeux criteria for the onset of convective instibility. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What the Schwarszchild  criteria basically says is that for there to be convection there needs to be more available energy locally (that is available do work) than can be redistributed by radiation. Thus in order to redistribute the energy into a stable configuration the fluid undergoes large scale motion (convection). This is consistent for all convection regardless of scale and so we typically nondimensionalise the relevant equations (in this case the Rayleigh-Benard equations) to give us two free parameters. These are the nondimensional numbers known as the Rayleigh number and the Prandtl number. This essentially answers your 2nd question as since the equations describing convection are nondimensinalised they are not scale dependent. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an extension to this if we have some problem setup we can, in principle, derive the linearised equations for the problem (and appropriate boundary conditions) and find criteria on the Rayleigh and Prandtl number for the onset of the convective instability. Typically the Prandtl number does not play a role, but the Rayleigh number is always required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For your 1st question... I dont know what cytoplasm of cells actually is so not sure if there is actually convection there or not. In principle if you have a strong enough temperature difference across your gravity direction then you will be able to cause convection. Sometimes it would take a rather extreme temperature difference due to the efficiency of heat transport by radiation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At that scale, not so much. The other parameter the other poster neglected is the Reynolds number. This is a measure of the extent to which the fluid is driven by friction or by inertia. Most biological flows are friction-dominated, and won't form convection cells in the same manner that you might expect for larger scales. </p>
<p>This is not a breakdown due to the size of the molecules, but rather this is a limit determined by the conditions where turbulence can exist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cytoplasm is mostly water but it's interspersed with microtubules and a &quot;cytoskeleton&quot;, not to mention solid organelles like golgi and mitochondria. It's also thickened by formed proteins and saccharides.</p>
<p>There are no hot spots in the human body to create enough differential for significant convection. All the interfaces (skin, gut) are protected by flat epithelial cells that are mostly dead and free of cytoplasm.</p>
<p>Lastly the microtubule transport system is always causing the cytoplasm to stream. This ATP-driven pumping probably outweighs anything but the strongest convection sources.</p>
<p>Convection is weak, it's all the same temp, cytoplasm is a viscous pudding that moves too much to be influenced by convection.</p>
<p>There is a very neat convection effect on a larger scale called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krukenberg%27s_spindle" target="_blank">Krukenberg Spindle</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
