		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of my favorite biological theories is the concept of ‘Hyper-Tumors’, or cancer getting cancer. Massive animals like elephants or whales have smaller rates of cancer than animals that are human sized, like dogs or deer, and one of the scientific theories is that cancers in large animals have to get so big before they cause problems that the cancer tumors develop their own cancerous tumors that kill the original tumors. It hasnt been proven with any significance but its one of the only theories around as to why massive animals have such low cancer rates.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>yes! prokaryotes can be attacked by bacteriophages.
this is very interesting, as prokaryotes possess a defense mechanism similar to our adaptive immune response.
in short, after being infected, they cut the attackers' dna and store it in their own. These stored sequences are called spacers, and are found in a longer array of sequences called CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced palyndromic repeats). They are then used to quickly recognize and kill the same attacker during future attacks. This defense mechanism is currently being used to edit specific target genes of interest, and has the potential to cure tons of diseases caused by mutations (cancer, hiv, hepatitis, autoimmune etc). Probably one of the biggest scientific discoveries of modern times</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>We get so good in manipulating virus that soon we can create virus to attack every bacteria we want! This is great news as it will open a path out antibiotica all time</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
