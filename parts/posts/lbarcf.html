		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There isn't going to be an eradication of the pandemic is probably the simplest statement to an underlying assumption in your question. That question assumes there will be a point where Covid is no longer something which moves around the population. North Korea may vaccinate if vaccines are made available, or they may simply have the virus &quot;run its course.&quot;</p>
<p>Places like North Korea, and frankly many places in other countries with more modernized healthcare systems but with less perfect vaccination rates, will maintain some reservoirs of covid. No one is certain, but the likelihood is that vaccination across most of the general population will slow spread such that something more like &quot;normal life&quot; will be able to happen, but that covid will still have several human reservoirs and will probably be common and dangerous similar to the flu as an ongoing issue. It will also evolve into new strains and pop up with worse and better years, similar to the flu but possibly more dangerous. We just don't know yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a bit confused by your statement - are you claiming that the DPRK is not maintaining the strict quarantine that has been recorded by the WHO(As of December 3, 33,223 people had been released from quarantine, according to figures reported to the WHO)? As of this week, the DPRK has reported no <a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/searo/whe/coronavirus19/sear-weekly-reports/searo-weekly-situation-report-3_2021.pdf?sfvrsn=651b3dbc_9" target="_blank">new cases</a>. As for your statement, that's entirely based on whether the US and other countries are going to maintain sanctions that could prevent distribution, which seeing how this is going to be seen as just another economic weapon, they'll probably try to bargain no new long range continent missiles for batches of vaccines</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
