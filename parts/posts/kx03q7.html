		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sleep electrophysiologist here. We study sleep in cats , mice and marmosets. Out of all three species, mouse sleep is the most fragmented, occurring in one to two hour bouts with some preference for the light portion of the circadian cycle (they are nocturnal so they like to sleep more during the day). Despite the fragmented nature of the their sleep, they definitely go into REM cycles although these are relatively short compared to cats, marmosets and humans. In REM, their brain produces strong theta waves occurring 5 to 8 times per second (theta rhythm - 5-8Hz). Their muscle tone is lower during REM but not absent which is different from   cats and humans during REM where there is essentially muscle paralysis.
Cat sleep is more consolidated and their REM cycles are long, getting longer with each successive sleep cycle (slow wave sleep --&gt; REM --&gt; slow wave sleep...). This is the same is  humans and primates. Theta waves are there but very sparse in comparison to mice. Muscle atonia and rapid eye movements are very clear and striking in a sleeping cat. If you have a cat, you can see these eye movements sometimes when it starts to twitch during sleep and there are plenty of videos showing this (this being the internet and well... cats).
We have to keep in mind that these animals have evolved for very different environments. For one, cats hunt mice but not vice versa. If you are a mouse, you don't want to be solidly paralyzed for hours on end because the cat is gonna get you (those few hours when it's awake). Also, some have argued that mice navigate mainly in two-dimensions while cats navigate up and down as well. The theta rhythm is very important for encoding two-dimensional trajectories that the animal takes (i.e. mazes, labyrinths) so it may be a reason why it is stronger in mice during REM. Lastly, these animals that we study are somewhat adapted to our rhythm (feeding time etc.). It is likely that their sleep architecture in the wild is actually different.
If you would like to see a cat brain going through REM , check out <a href="https://youtu.be/uDX8EHNi6So" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/uDX8EHNi6So</a>. The second trace from the top is a recording from a single neuron where those sharp vertical lines are single impulses (action potentials). EOG is eye movements and EMG is muscle tone.
Hope this helps.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sleep scientist here. There seems to be a lot of confusion about what REM sleep is and its role in sleep so allow me to paint a basic picture of [human] sleep cycling.</p>
<p>There are four stages of sleep: </p>
<p><strong>N1</strong>: transitional sleep. This stage bridges the gap between wake and sleep; typically only lasts a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>N2</strong>: light sleep. The bread and butter of your sleep; typically lasts around 30 minutes per cycle. </p>
<p><strong>Slow Wave Sleep</strong> (SWS): deep sleep. This is the restorative, regenerative sleep that makes you feel rested. The duration of SWS declines with age. So-called because its EEG presentation is high-amplitude, low-frequency (slow) waves. </p>
<p><strong>Rapid Eye Movement</strong> (REM) sleep: dream sleep. This is where your brain performs memory consolidation tasks, sifting through the information you've been exposed to throughout the day and forming new pathways and memories. Typically lasts around 30 minutes per cycle. Every other stage of sleep is collectively referred to as Non-REM (NREM) sleep; N1 = NREM Stage 1. </p>
<p><strong>REM sleep is not deep sleep</strong> - in fact, from an EEG perspective, it's more akin to N2 sleep in terms of brain wave frequency and amplitude. In a 'normal' sleep, we move through each of these four stages, in order, with a full cycle taking around two hours. In a 'normal' eight hour sleep, you will have ~four cycles. </p>
<p>I can't comment with certainty on animal sleep patterns, but I would speculate that any animal that relies on complex reasoning will require REM sleep in some capacity. We see in humans that people who miss out on REM sleep (because of interruption, sleep disorders, etc.) will over-compensate for missed REM when conditions are favourable, with what we call 'REM rebound'; i.e. instead of ~30 minutes of REM every two hours, they might exhibit, say, two, one-hour REM periods. They also exhibit shorter REM latency - instead of taking ~90 minutes to cycle into REM, it might only take them 30 minutes. So for an animal with a polyphasic rhythm that sleeps when they <em>can</em> and not when they <em>want</em>, I assume they still exhibit the same basic features but cycle differently. </p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://clinicalgate.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/B9780723437482000177_f017-003-9780723437482.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> is a rough picture of 'normal' sleep cycling. Stage 3 here refers to SWS.</p>
<p>Edit 2: /u/secondhand_goulash is an animal electrophysiologist who studies cats, mice, and marmosets, and has shared more direct responses to the original question <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/kx03q7/do_animals_that_sleep_in_multiple_short_naps_such/gj8683i/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm just starting to study sleep in animals, but the short answer is yes, they do require REM sleep. The number of cycles and length of REM differs across species. From a clinical perspective, sleep in animals is not well studied, though from a research perspective, animal models for comparisons are studied, so someone with that research background might be able to find you a better answer</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's this whole perception that horses cannot lie down or it'll kill them. While it's true they sleep standing up, and also true that lying down for too long will cause harm, they do need to lay down for deep sleep. When they sleep standing up it's a might lighter sleep. When they lay down, its a much deeper sleep that enables them to get REM sleep. It's a very vulnerable moment, so they don't do it for long. They tend to do it in short bursts throughout the day. Additionally, different members of the herds will do it at different times, so there's always someone on lookout. Luckily they don't need a lot, so they can get away with short bursts with more of the rest time being on-their-feet napping. And as someone who works with horses, lemme tell you: they nap a LOT.</p>
<p>I can't speak for every animal ever obviously, but at lot of animals do need REM sleep! How much they need depends.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do you live with a cat or a dog? Watch them sleep. You will note periods of rapid eye movement that are often accompanied by other types of movement: paddling of legs, twitching of ears and/or whiskers, even piloerection of fur. This is not proof that they need it, but simply that they have it. However, one would expect that the function of REM sleep in these animals is the same as the function in great apes like us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
