		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Famously, the first attempt to measure the mass of the earth is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavendish_experiment" target="_blank">Cavendish experiment</a>. Basically, the way that this experiment works is that at this point, we already had a good idea of how Newtonian gravity worked (F=GMm/r^2 ), where F is the force of gravity, M and m are the two masses, G is the gravitational constant, and r is the distance between the center of the two masses. However, we did not know the value of G.</p>
<p>The Cavendish experiment attempted to measure this by measuring the gravitational attraction between two lead spheres of known masses at a known distance. Once G was measured, then we could work out the mass of the Earth simply by measuring the gravitational force and mass of a known object, and by measuring the radius of the Earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Haven't seen quite the right answer here so I'll go ahead. The first successful attempt to measure the mass of the earth was the Schiehallion experiment. The idea of the experiment was to see how much a hanging weight was deflected from straight up and down by a mountain. Since they could easily measure the mass of the mountain by surveying and taking averages of the mountains density, and since they already knew the volume of the earth. They could use the deflection of the weight to get an approximation of the average density of the earth. They go into detail on the math they used in the Wikipedia article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schiehallion_experiment" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schiehallion_experiment</a> </p>
<p>Interesting side note. They also noticed from the experiment that the average density of the earth was much higher than that of the crust, which led them to theorize for the first time that the earth had a dense metallic core.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>GMm/r2 is the classical method (discussed above) ....but as a guestimate, an average value of density can be used. Since the size (radius, circumference) of the earth was figured out a while ago, use that to get the mass = density x 4/3pir^3.</p>
<p>Turns out that this was indeed used historically - for example, Newton estimated that the density of Earth is around 5 times the density of water. So they got the order of magnitude correct, but underestimated by around 30%.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We won't get anywhere close to the required accuracy, but let's have the following thought experiment.</p>
<p>Earth is 40 000 km around, by using l = 2 pi r we obtain Earth's radius of 6300ish, let's simplify to 6500 km radius. Volume of sphere is 4/3 pi r^3, which gives us 1.15 * 10^12 km^3 volume of Earth.</p>
<p>How dense is earth on average? Well, given crust is generally what floated to the top, it should be comparable to most metals or ores. Granite has density of 2.75 tons/m^3, basalt 2.9, iron ore just above 5, heavier metals like lead - 11ish. For simplicity, let's assume Earth average 5 tons per m^3.</p>
<p>Multiplying the numbers together we get... 5.75 <em> 10^24 kg for Earth's mass. Surprisingly accurate. Now, this relies on a fair amount of assumptions - but I suppose you'll agree our radius is with 5% of real, so volume within 15ish percent; and mass can't be much lighter than magma-based rocks on the surface or heavier than lead, so we're off by factor of 2 at most. So in the end, we can quite confidently say Earth's mass will be somewhere between 2.5 and 10  </em> 10^24 - which is quite narrow. All without making more than a couple napkin calculations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
