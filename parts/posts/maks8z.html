		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello r/askscience! We are infectious disease experts from the University of Chicago Medicine. Emily Landon, MD, specializes in infectious diseases and leads the academic health system's infection control and prevention efforts. As the medical specialist for the High-Consequence Pathogen Preparedness Program, Dr. Landon has helped steer UChicago Medicine, the University of Chicago, and its affiliates through the COVID-19 pandemic. She also regularly advises businesses, industries and government officials on how to best respond to the global crisis. Allison Bartlett, MD, MS, is a pediatric infectious disease expert who specializes in the medical management of acute and chronic infectious diseases in children and the associate medical director of the pediatric infection control program, and has spoken on the unique challenges and medical issues facing kids during the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>As multiple COVID-19 vaccines are rolling out around the world, infectious disease experts and government health agencies are beginning to issue new guidance on all aspects of life, from social distancing to mask wearing. But in this nebulous state where some are vaccinated and some are not, what does that mean for day-to-day life? What can (or should) you be doing differently, or the same, once you've been vaccinated? What can you expect after getting the vaccine? We'll be on at 4:30 PM ET (20:30 UT), ask us anything!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>2 questions please:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Why do you think China went with vaccinations based on inactive virus rather than the mRNA technology other countries are using?</p>
</li>
<li>If you are innoculated with one type of vaccine e.g. AZ and a booster is required, can you then take an mRNA one and vica versa?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to answer questions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
