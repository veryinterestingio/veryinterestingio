Mind blown trying to comprehend super massive black holes. Host Janna Levin is describing how as you fall into a black hole time would slow to a crawl.( As seen by an outside observer). Neil DeGrasse Tyson then chimes in and says that you would literally watch the entire future of the universe pass before you. If time slows for matter approaching a black hole then how does anything ever get &quot;consumed&quot;? Shouldn't there be a traffic jam of cosmic proportions around the accretion disc, of matter waiting for billions of years to pass before it falls in?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The coordinate time diverges as the object approaches the horizon, so an observer at infinity never sees the object cross. They just see it asymptotically approach the horizon, and redshift until it's no longer visible.</p>
<p>But the <em>proper</em> time remains finite. So if you're falling into the black hole, you always see your own time passing normally. At some point before you reach the singularity (which you will definitely do in finite proper time, as long as you cross the horizon), you will be ripped apart by tidal forces.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I'm not sure who this 'you' is supposed to be: An infalling observer would not see the entire future pass. There's a nice picture rendered in Kruskal-Szekeres coordinate in <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/82711" target="_blank">this stackexchange answer</a> clarifying the situation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So related question, how would an observer perceive time once they crossed the event horizon?  I assume in a big enough black hole, atoms or even people could survive crossing the horizon.
Would they survive just long enough to then get consumed by the singularity?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Related question: how quickly would you die once you cross the event horizon? Would it be instantaneous or, through that &quot;infinite time&quot; others have mentioned, would you basically be ripped apart for all eternity?</p>
<p>I know, it's a dumb question, but it's really intriguing to me for some reason.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
