		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When speaking English I've noticed that when we refer to Japanese names, they are &quot;flipped&quot;, i.e. we refer to them in the Western name order (given name-family name) as opposed to the Japanese order (family name-given name). E.g. the Japanese Prime Minister is referred to as Yoshihide Suga as opposed to Suga Yoshihide.</p>
<p>This doesn't seem to be the same for Korean names - for instance, Kim Jong-un is referred to as Kim Jong-un.</p>
<p>So why are Japanese names flipped, but Korean names not?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Answer: it's a standard introduced during the Meji era in Japan as a way of catering to westerners and &quot;modernizing&quot; (i.e. westernizing) Japan. When a Japanese name is written in western characters specifically they will then put the given name first and family name last, but only when written in western (Roman) characters.</p>
<p>Worth noting that in 2019 the government reversed policy on this and is now encouraging the traditional name order in all circumstances.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are really two answers to this question, and both have to do with the Japanese. </p>
<p>The short answer for both is to appease the English Overlords of Western Society / the International Circuit. </p>
<p>The first push towards this was when the Emperor at the time (Meiji) wanted to push for a more traditional Japan that went back to their imperialism roots during the mid 1800’s. This was known as the Meiji Restoration or Honorable Restoration, and other talk about this above/below. This restoration was the first main step in putting Japan into the International circuit once more, and in an effort to appear less ‘foreign’ the Japanese would elect to putting the Family Name AFTER the Given Name in an attempt to make them seem more alike. </p>
<p>This gained some traction, but it wasn’t until the debacle of WW2 where Japan suddenly needed to make restitution towards the Allied Powers (mainly America) that this practice was fully solidified. </p>
<p>After this, when other Asian Countries were joining the International circuit (China and Korea) they decided that the Westerners had enough exposure to Asian culture to respect their traditional naming culture and so they elected NOT to adopt the naming system as the Japanese had done. </p>
<p>However, the Japanese Gov’t has decided in 2019 that they are planning on transitioning back to the Family Name FIRST model. That being said this was put into place under PM Abe, and it is unclear if PM Suga will continue the policy to completion.</p>

<p>Heung Min Son being a prime example, is very often referred to as Son Heung Min also.  Might not be as definite as Japanese, but certainly happens</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When Japan modernized with the Meiji Restoration, they essentially took ideas from all sorts of culturally western societies and combined them as they saw fit. This included the military, their banking system, and in this case, general culture. Along with stuff like new clothes and hair styles coming into the picture, flipping the names was another thing that began in order to help Japan best mesh with western countries &amp; societies. They were quite keen on modernizing and being seen in the same echelon as western world powers, and decided that the cultural changes were needed alongside technological ones. Another factor, is that in the Korean language, the family name and given name are something of a &quot;package&quot;, called an ireum. There are many more nuances regarding naming conventions in Japan due to the Meiji Restoration, but Japan's willingness to become more Western in the global eye and Korea's &quot;ireum&quot; concept are a couple of the primary reasons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
