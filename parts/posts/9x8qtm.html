		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scientists are voting to redefine the kilogram using physical constants rather than the arbitrary block of metal we use now. Here's an article about it: <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/11/14/18072368/kilogram-kibble-redefine-weight-science" target="_blank">https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/11/14/18072368/kilogram-kibble-redefine-weight-science</a></p>
<p>From what I understand, this new method will allow us to generate &quot;reference&quot; kilogram masses by using fancy balances anywhere in the world. I'm confused how we can use the constant speed of light to do this. The speed of light in a vacuum is constant, but doesn't the time component change depending on the local gravity and speed? Wouldn't that mean that reference masses would vary slightly, depending on the gravity and the speed at that particular facility, according to general and special relativity? Is this canceled out somehow, or is it just so small that it's still an improvement in precision over what we have now? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's the full picture of how the new kilogram will be built up:</p>
<p>Firstly, we define the second as the time it takes for Caesium-133 to wibble between two specific states exactly 9,192,631,770 times.</p>
<p>Then, we define the speed of light to be exactly 299,792,458 m/s, and use this to define the metre. This means that it doesn't make sense to measure the speed of light in this system any more. What you're actually doing is measuring how long a metre is - a metre is how far light travels in 1/299,792,458 seconds.</p>
<p>Then we define Planck's constant to be 6.62607015 × 10^(-34) kg m^2 s^(-1). So, similarly, any experiment to measure Planck's constant is really just giving you the definition of the kilogram, because we already know the definition of the metre and the second from the other steps, and Planck's constant is defined as a specific number, so the only variable left is the definition of the kilogram.</p>
<p>So, for your specific question about whether general relativity and time dilation matter: the core thing about relativity is that the laws of physics are the same in every inertial frame. That is, everybody sees the same value for Planck's constant, the speed of light, and the wibble frequency for Caesium-133, provided the Caesium is at rest relative to the observer. Now, if you're looking at someone else's Caesium, it could appear to be vibrating at a slower frequency because of time dilation, but this is not used to define the second - you have to use Caesium that is stationary relative to the observer, and has no time dilation relative to the observer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the top comment captures it perfectly, but one thing I really like is <a href="https://www.bipm.org/en/measurement-units/rev-si/faqs.html" target="_blank">this FAQ</a> from the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, whom are affiliated with the vote tomorrow. Q's 15 and 16:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q15</strong>: How can you fix the value of a fundamental constant like h to define the kilogram, and e to define the ampere, and so on? How do you know what value to fix them to? What if it emerges that you have chosen the wrong value?</p>
<p>We do not fix – or change – the value of any constant that we use to define a unit. The values of the fundamental constants are constants of nature and we only fix the numerical value of each constant when expressed in its SI unit. By fixing its numerical value we define the magnitude of the unit in which we measure that constant at present.</p>
<p>Example: If c is the value of the speed of light, {c} is its numerical value, and [c] is the unit, so that</p>
<p>c = {c}[c] = 299 792 458 m/s</p>
<p>then the value c is the product of the number {c} times the unit [c], and the value never changes. However the factors {c} and [c] may be chosen in different ways such that the product c remains unchanged.</p>
<p>In 1983 it was decided to fix the number {c} to be exactly 299 792 458, which then defined the unit of speed [c] = m/s. Since the second, s, was already defined, the effect was to define the metre, m. The number {c} in the new definition was chosen so that the magnitude of the unit m/s was unchanged, thereby ensuring continuity between the new and old definitions of the units.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q16</strong>: OK, you actually only fix the numerical value of the constant expressed in its unit. For the kilogram, for example, you choose to fix the numerical value {h} of the Planck constant expressed in its unit [h] = kg m2 s−1. But the question remains: suppose a new experiment shortly after you change the definition suggests that you chose a wrong numerical value for {h}, what then?</p>
<p>After making the change, the mass of the international prototype of the kilogram (the IPK), which has defined the kilogram since 1889, will have to be determined by experiment. If we have chosen a &quot;wrong value&quot; it simply means that the new experiment will tell us that the mass of the IPK is not exactly 1 kg in the Revised SI. </p>
<p>This situation would only affect macroscopic mass measurements; the masses of atoms and the values of other constants related to quantum physics would not be affected. Continuing with the definition of the kilogram agreed in 1889 would continue the practice of using a reference quantity (i.e. the mass of the IPK) that we cannot be sure is not changing with time compared to a true invariant such as the mass of an atom or the Planck constant. </p>
<p>There has been much debate over the years about how much the mass of the IPK might be changing with respect to the mass of a true physical constant. The advantage of the new definition will be that we will be certain that the reference constant used to define the kilogram is a true invariant.</p>

<p>He talks to people who care for the existing kg, so I'd say this has some credibility.</p>

<p>//Edit: I was actually thinking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmSJXC6_qQ8" target="_blank">about this video</a>. But the other one also seems relevant.</p>
<p><em>While searching for this video, I also noticed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_e1wITe_ig" target="_blank">they uploaded another one 5 hours ago</a>, I can't say anything about that, however, because I haven't seen it yet.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
