		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In cold environments, heat is transferred from your warm body to the cold air/water around you. That transfer happens when the molecules of your skin collide with the molecules of the air/water. Each collision robs some of your heat.</p>
<p>The air is colder, so robs more heat per collision. But it's also MUCH thinner, so there are fewer collisions. Water is a bit warmer, but has far more collisions robbing heat, because the water is hundreds of times more dense than the air.</p>
<p>It's the same with cooking. To cook a chicken breast, you can put it in boiling water at 100 C, or an oven at 200 C (or more!). The oven, despite being hotter, usually takes longer to cook the chicken. Again, that's due to the fact that the air is less dense, and so there are fewer collisions, and therefore heat transfers more slowly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our bodies don't actually feel a temperature, it feels a sense of heat gain or heat loss. </p>
<p>Air isn't very good at absorbing heat from things so you don't feel as cold as quickly</p>
<p>Water on the other hand is a great conductor of heat so it takes the heat away from your body really quickly. </p>
<p>Fun fact 1: this is why you can grab a wooden spoon that has been sitting in a hot pan when you couldn't grab a metal spoon in that same pan </p>
<p>Fun Fact 2: NASA developed a material that you can hold when it's at metal melting temperatures.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While density and conductivity are factors, the most important consideration is water’s heat capacity (also called specific heat). Water has a heat capacity of 4.186J/K•g while air has a heat capacity of ~1J/K•g. This means it takes less water to steal the same amount of heat from your body as air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
