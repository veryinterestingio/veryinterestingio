FYI: this type of training schedule was initially implemented by a guy who was a drug addict—amphetamines or cocaine, I forget which. So staying up for huge stretches of time was not strange for him. For people who are not drug addicts, it can be grueling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctor here; yes they do work that long - and we sometimes work even longer shifts than that. I have been on call for an emergency department from 4 PM Friday afternoon-8 AM Monday morning (now I can hopefully grab a few hours here and there in that mess, but it does wear on you). In residency I routinely worked up to 32 hour shifts, all for less than some servers would make.</p>
<p>It absolutely impacts quality of care and that is why there is a push from physicians to limit on call time, as evidence shows that errors pile up the more tired someone is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In America, certain specialties do work for 24+ hours. In residency there have been rules implemented to limit the numbers of hours worked without sleeping and how many days you work a month. I’m in a residency that rarely has these types of hours, but I believe the rule is 24 hours of patient care plus 4 hours for documentation, at least four days off a month, and 8 hours between shifts. After residency, I’m almost certain there are no rules, except those in place by your employer. For your second question, the answer is yes. However it has also been shown that frequent handoffs between docs can also lead to errors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I literally just completed a 24 hr shift and this is my post call day. Luckily, last night I was able to get 3 hours of sleep before an emergency rolled in.  This is not always the case. Next month, I'll be taking 27 hours shifts every 3 days and almost certainly going to violate the 80 hr work week. Unfortunately, these 27 hrs will not include any sleep. There is a call room, but I've never seen it. If I'm lucky, I'll get 30 minutes for lunch and 30 minutes for dinner. In reality, I'll be in front of a computer looking up labs or finishing a note during this time as well.</p>
<p>By the evening, I'm less able to focus on tasks and it takes me a while longer to process the situation. I haven't made any major mistakes yet and hopefully never will, but I can see how it can happen. It takes a toll. Some people seem to handle it better than me, but I can honestly say that I'm burning out from this. </p>
