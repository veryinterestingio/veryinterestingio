		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to the current answer a little bit and address the question in your title, the majority of the world is right-handed due to genetics with some influence of culture. There is a lot of really interesting research out there trying to predict hand dominance early in life. Some people have done studies where the data suggests the direction a newborns head prefers to flop indicates their preferred hand during childhood suggesting that hand preference is something that is born into us. There are theories suggesting there is a single gene we have not identified with one of the more well known ones being the <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-00829-000" target="_blank">Right Shift Theory</a>. The short explanation of this theory is there is a dominant gene that shifts development towards a left-hemisphere dominant development of language that also shifts our handedness to prefer using our right hand. Most of these theories suggest that we have this gene that shifts us to right hand dominance, but if someone does not inherit the right shift gene then it becomes a 50/50 chance of developing right and left hand dominance which matches up with 10-15 percent of the population being left hand dominant. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3931166/" target="_blank">Other researchers</a> argue the genetics of handedness are not that simple though since we have not been able to identify a single gene that determines your handedness and instead most theories of handedness and genetics believe it is influenced by multiple genes.</p>
<p>We also know that genetics are not the only explanation for handedness due to differences we see across countries, which you can see here on the <a href="https://leftyfretz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/left-handed-percentage-by-country.png" target="_blank">infographic of rates of left-handedness by people by country</a>. There is also variation within countries as seen by <a href="https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RNVNMBK3V47A3EJ64V2QLMFBYQ.png" target="_blank">this map of the US</a> created by the Washington Post. So there is likely some cultural influence on whether someone will be right-hand dominant on top of the genetic components.</p>
<p>The why of right hand dominance is probably the hardest part of the question to answer since giving a definitive answer for why evolution resulted in certain aspects of humans is very difficult. It likely has to do with the specialization of our hemispheres or slight changes in the brain structure in some way, however, hand preference is not exclusive to humans. For example, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166432806001707" target="_blank">baboons show a strong right hand dominance</a>. Researchers have also found <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1357650X.2019.1578228" target="_blank">paw-preferences in cats and dogs</a>, although they are no necessarily biased towards the right side like primates. The animal research tends to point towards lateralization of the brain leading towards hand preference, but I can't say I know all of this particular section of research well enough to make a definitive conclusion about that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure that there is conclusive evidence, but the most probable theory I've read is that it's linked to the specialization of brain hemispheres (which in turn is believed to be advantageous for species of higher intelligence - this of course just shifts the problem to the question why our brain is wired as-is): For most people, the left brain hemisphere predominantly handles language and motor skills, and since it controls the right half of the body, this could be an explanation on why motorically difficult tasks are performed with the right hand.  It has also been suggested that right-handedness is a byproduct of the development of language (making the left brain hemisphere more important).</p>
<p>Also, I think that there is an evolutionary advantage of having a dominant handedness (though it doesn't matter which one here) when a species starts to work on tasks that require learning from others and/or use of tools (sharing knowledge and tools is simpler if both participants have the same dominant hand).</p>
<p>One last thing because I thougt it was interesting: If there really were an inherent evolutionary disadvantage of being left-handed, we could expect that the number of left-handers should be zero or close to zero now - this has lead to the hypothesis that left-handedness can also be an advantage in some situations, namely when fighting: Here, it is an advantage to be proficient at &quot;unusual&quot; moves, hence to belong to the minority (that this advantage exists can be seen in modern sports, take table-tennis where left-handedness is about twice as prevalent among top players as among the general population).</p>
<p>Edit: Most of what I wrote above came from articles to the general public (Why are most people right-handed), but if you're interested, here's an article that discusses the matter (particularly the section 6 on evolutionary forces acting on handedness): <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2666081/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2666081/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2666081/</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, it's not just us.  Most mammels are &quot;right sided&quot; as well.  And it goes even farther back on the evolutionary chain than that.  Frogs and toads are more likely to attack food when it is seen by the right eye than the left.</p>
<p>So, evolutionists say that right handedness goes back over a half billion years.</p>
<p>However, when simians (monkeys and apes) are on all fours, they demonstrate no handedness.  But when they stand on their two hind legs, they suddenly demonstrate mostly right handedness.  So it depends a lot on what they're doing.</p>
<p>And by the time a species called Homo heidelbergensis had appeared, roughly 600,000 years ago, there was a clear right-handed preference in prehistoric societies.  Wear on the preserved teeth of Homo heidelbergensis, for instance, suggest that food was usually brought to the mouth with the right hand, and chewed primarily on one side of the mouth.</p>
<p>All of this suggests that our brains were wired to become right handed over a half billion years ago, before we ever climbed down out of the trees and stood upright in the savanna.  Perhaps even before there were mammals.  It's also been proven that left handers have a surprise advantage over right handers, and have an advantage of experience in close combat.  The accumulated experience of a right hander fighting a left hander is of limited use, while the accumulated experience of a left hander fighting a right hander is not.  Thus, left handers have tactical advantages over right handers in close combat - an event that would have played out many millions of times over the course of human evolution. </p>
<p>So while the human brain may be wired for right handedness since before we were even human, left handedness persists because it provides tactical advantages, and thus an evolutionary advantage.  But only as long as it remains a small minority of people.  The more prevalent it becomes, the less tactical advantage it provides.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
