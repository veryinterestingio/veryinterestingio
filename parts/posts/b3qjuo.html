That's one possible reason. To maximize your vitamin D Production you need more UV rays-&gt; lighter skin</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that human skin is locked in an eternal battle to find a balance between creating vitamin D from sun exposure while protecting itself from UV exposure at the same time. If you're in a tropical area, darker skin is more appropriate--the amount of light exposure will still create vitamin D, but there is a need for enhanced UV protection. If you're in a northern area, darker skin would block vitamin D production while there is less UV exposure, so lighter skin is more appropriate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other people have answered your original question, but I wanted to correct the mistaken belief in the other half of your question -- and show that it's all a balance between vitamin B9 and vitamin D:</p>
<p>Darker skin most likely did <em>not</em> evolve as protection from cancer, contrary to popular belief. Cancer is generally something that attacks a body later in life. Even a pale person under the sun is likely to survive well beyond reproductive age before being killed by skin cancer.</p>
<p>Rather, it's thought that the largest selection pressure causing darker skin is folic acid production. Sunlight will break down folic acid (vitamin B9), which is needed throughout the body, particularly during pregnancy and infancy.</p>
<p>So skin color is an attempt to find the perfect balance between getting enough vitamin D and not breaking down too much folic acid.</p>
<p>One result of this (and further evidence for the vitamin D theory) is that if you actually have enough vitamin D in your diet, there is no need for lighter skin. This is why the Inuit people have darker skin than&quot;expected&quot; for their extreme northern latitude: their diet is high in vitamin D, and so they do not need as much from the sun, and therefore the folic acid side of the equation &quot;wins&quot; and dark skin is preferable.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s not that darker skin absorbs more heat energy. It’s that it is better at blocking out harmful rays from the sun. But in colder climes where the sun’s rays aren’t as strong, dark skin blocks too many rays so people with darker skin couldn’t make vitamin D as efficiently. Thus light skin evolved in those climes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Skin color evolves very rapidly in evolutionary sense.  Lack of vitamin D causes rickets which adversely affects viability of offspring.  Therefore, skin evolves to let in more vitamin D.  Conversely, in the tropics, light skin lets in too much UV light that destroys folate leading to poor birth outcomes.  Therefore, in tropical regions skin color evolves to be dark.  </p>
