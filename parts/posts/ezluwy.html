		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a girl named Lacie Lynette Smith in the 80s who had some disease that made her allergic to all foods except human milk. There are a number of articles about her needing milk when she was 3 years old, and a much smaller number of articles that followed up on her when she was 8 and still needed milk. I wanted to find information on when her disease finally went away but no results.</p>

<p>Developmentally, there is no definitive period where an infant should <em>stop</em> drinking their mother's milk. From the perspective of an infant it's a super rich food source that is full of hormones and pro-hormones that significantly enhance development. There is, however, a number of obstacles <em>preventing</em> infants from eating solid food at birth (low bile production, lack of glottis control, low peristaltic forces, ect.) Humans in particular have a very short gestation period for our size compared to other mammals. This is (probably) due to how fast out brain &amp; head grow en utero; If we waited until about 14 months to be born when our bodies were ready to eating solid food and move around our craniums would be too large and too rigid from the closing of the cranial sutures for a female to pass through her bipedal hips.  This correspond's with the general 4-6 month milestones for babies to start eating solid foods.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
