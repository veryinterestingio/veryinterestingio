		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This can be done as a geometry problem.   </p>
<p>So the moon's radius is approx. 1.75 million meters (assuming a perfect sphere).<br />
If you were standing on the moon, your eye height would be approx. 2m.   </p>
<p>The horizon would be at the point that a tangent line from your eyes hits to the surface of the moon.  Since tangents lines of circles make an angle of 90 degrees with the radius of a circle, we can use pythagorus' theorem to calculate the distance you could see.   </p>
<p>Horizon distance = sqrt[(Moon Radius + Eye Height)^2 - (Moon radius)^2]<br />
= approx. 2.64km.    </p>
<p>Okay, so now, your horizontal field of vision is about 120 degrees.  So now draw a triangle along the surface of the moon out to the horizon, coming out from you with an angle of 120 degrees. It would be an isosceles triangle with side lengths of 120km, so the remaining angles are 30 degrees each. To calculate the remaining side length of this triangle, we can use the sine law. This length corresponds to a chord across the horizon, from the edge of your field of vision on the left, to the edge of your field of vision on the right.       </p>
<p>Horizon chord length = sin(120)/sin(30)*2.6km = 4.5km  </p>
<p>So now, we know that from one corner of your vision to the other across the horizon is a length of 4.5km.   Because the surface of the moon is curved, the centre of this chord line should lie <em>below</em> the surface of the moon.  Now let's calculate just how far below the surface it would lie.<br />
Again we can use pythagorus' theorem.<br />
Chord line to surface = Moon radius - sqrt[(moon radius)^2 - (chord length/2)^2]   = 1.5m.    </p>
<p>So to summarize, if you were standing on the moon you could see the horizon 2.6km away. The horizon at the centre of your vision would appear 1.5m higher than the horizon at the corners of your vision. If you held out a meter stick at arms length (~1m) up to the horizon, the horizon would deviate from the straight line by less than 1mm.    So you probably wouldn't notice a curvature at all.  </p>
<p>To answer your second question, a planet about 1/4 the size of the moon would allow for a curvature of over 1mm as compared to your meter stick held up at arms length. It would take a planet with a radius of about 5.5km in order to see 1cm deviation across your meter stick.  One of Mars' moons, Phobos is about this size.  </p>
<p><strong><em>TL:DR;   No. You'd probably have to go to Phobos in order to notice any curvature.</em></strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how you mean it. You will see the horizon, just as you do on Earth. But, just as on earth, if you are standing on a smooth plane (IE: ignore hills and mountains and such) the horizon will be the same height in any direction you look. This is because the ball you are standing on curves away from you the same in any direction you look. There is no curve to be seen, except for the curve away from you that creates the horizon line, which is the same in every direction... Though closer than on earth. </p>
<p>To see the horizon curve like you are thinking you would have to leave the surface enough to perceive the moon or planet as a separate ball.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can only see the curve of a horizon when either you are of appreciable size relative to the sphere, or you are quite high above it. Whether it curves or not is related to how high above it you are.</p>
<p>What you would see is the horizon much closer to you than it is on Earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The differences in the horizons of earth and the moon were described by the astronauts who landed there.  They said the horizon on the moon was much closer.  Like freakishly close.  Even on a crater's rim they could not see very far.</p>
<p>Elevation expands the horizon, so the top of tall buildings on earth have some of the farthest horizons.</p>
<p>On the moon there are no sweeping vistas or distant mountains. </p>
<p>The moon landers also said the moon dust and rocks smelled like burnt gunpowder, so, there's that to think about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
