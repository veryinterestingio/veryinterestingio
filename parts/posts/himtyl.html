<p>EDIT: Thanks for the responses! For clarification I know the Second Law makes it impossible to use converted electrical energy for cooling without increasing total entropic heat in the atmosphere, just wondering about the hypothetical effects behind <em>storing</em> that electrical energy and not using it.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of different physics bundled into this question. The technical physics answer to your question is 'no,' but the real answer from a practical perspective is 'yes.' </p>
<p>First, the amount of energy arriving from the sun every second is absolutely ginormous, about 10^17 Watts of power. If you could collect all of this energy (like by covering the world in solar panels and batteries) you'd only need about an hour of sunlight to power civilization at current usage for a year. So all solar panels we currently have only collect a tiny fraction of a percent of incoming solar flux. </p>
<p>But there's an important thing here- collecting sunlight to use will generally heat the planet more than it will cool it. Yes, that energy does temporarily end up in batteries, but that energy is still on the earth and using it will eventually convert it to heat. That's just the laws of thermodynamics, used energy ends up dissipated as heat (it's why your laptop gets hot, especially so when it's using a lot of energy like when you're playing a video game). </p>
<p>Really, if you wanted to cool the planet you'd want to reflect sunlight back to space so that it never gets absorbed. This is what climatologists mean when they talk about the 'albedo' of different things. It's like a measure of the 'whiteness,' or how much light a thing reflects. Clouds are great at reflecting sunlight back to space, and so are the ice caps. Concrete, farmland, and especially solar panels are very bad at reflecting sunlight. In principle, if you build solar panels on a surface that has a worse albedo then you'll be effectively cooling the planet. The surface will reflect more light, and will also generate electricity sparing us fossil fuel burning.</p>
<p>And that's the final point- fossil fuels. Ultimately, if you want to cool the planet, you'll want to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. These gasses increase the atmosphere's opacity to infrared light, trapping more heat from the sun and raising the surface temperature like a blanket. That's really the primary thing driving the heating. So in the most relevant sense, solar panels are good for cooling the planet because they replace traditional fossil fuel burning energy sources.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With space based solar panels or reflectors yes. you could make a vast array of the them to block a portion of the sunlight coming to the earth which would cool it, while being able harness that light energy to power things. </p>
<p>Taking this to the extreme and harnessing all the energy from a star this way is what is known as a Dyson Sphere/Swarm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All of the common cooling techniques we have really just move heat around.   Think of a fridge or an air-conditioner.   They don't really &quot;cool&quot; the house, they just capture the heat and move it outside.</p>
<p>If you're trying to cool the planet... where would we move the heat to?</p>
<p>Solar panels do not generate &quot;cool&quot;.   They're black, so they actually warm up in the sun quite a bit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>for a moment I thought that you are asking whether sunlight can be used to power a planet wide refrigerator to cool down Earth, which doesnt work by the way, as refrigerators on total, convert electrical energy to heat energy.</p>
<p>anyway storing sunlight on earth in form of electrical energy in batteries will technically convert the solar energy that would have heated the Earth into electrical energy, but the amount of solar energy taken by Earth as a whole is lot more than we could ever store in batteries available on Earth. So it is virtually impossible unless we have unlimited supply of batteries which also should occupy negligible amount of space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quick and simple answer, because so many of the others are way way way too complicated.</p>
<p>Albedo is the ratio of solar energy reflected to incoming energy.  Something black has an albedo of zero, a mirror has an albedo of one.</p>
<p>Solar cells typically have an albedo  (\~0.15) that is lower than the earth average (\~0.35).  So solar panels increase the amount of heat energy that stays in the earth system instead of reflecting to space, so solar panels heat up the earth.  </p>
<p>And just so that this calculation does not end up on some Koch brothers web page....  The heating from the low albedo of solar panels is more than offset by the fact that they don't emit CO2.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
