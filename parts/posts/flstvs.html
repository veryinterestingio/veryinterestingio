		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simple answer: Hand sanitize removes nothing. It just tries to kill whatever is on your hands, but you are just moving it around while you rub it in. Two things here: 1. It may not actually ever kill the thing you are trying to kill and 2. It may need a long exposure while wet to kill what you are trying to kill. </p>
<p>So all the crap that was on your hands is still on your hands and it also may not be killed by the hand sanitizer. </p>
<p>Hand washing with soap and water REMOVES the stuff that is on your hands. The dead skin cells, dirt, oil, viruses, and bacteria all get washed off. The soap makes it so they don't adhere and they get rinsed off. Some bacteria and viruses are killed or disabled by the soap as well. </p>
<p>So soap removes contaminants if used right, keeping them away from you. Not on your hands=not rubbed into your eye or mouth. Sanitizer = contaminants spread evenly over your hand and maybe still alive or viable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not just about the strength of the cleaning agent, it's how it cleans. Alcohol will kill viruses and bacteria just fine and dandy, but rubbing your hands with sanitizer may not reach all the viruses or bacteria on your hands, beneath your fingernails, or in your pores. If you use something like soap, the molecular design of the soap is such that it attracts the viruses and some bacteria and &quot;sucks&quot; them up off your hands. It's worth noting that soap typically doesn't &quot;kill&quot; in the same way alcohol or other sanitizers do, but it can usually clean much better because once these viruses and things get &quot;sucked&quot; off your hands, they can be washed away very effectively versus just killing the surface viruses and not rinsing. It's always better to wash your hands, even without antibacterial soap, and use hand sanitizer as a supplement after the fact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many things which alcohol doesn't really kill that well, but which are easily removed with soap.</p>
<p>Another advantage of soap is that the organisms which are <em>supposed</em> to be present on your skin are well-attached. They are adapted to surviving in that environment.</p>
<p>In my microbiology lab at university, we did an experiment where we had some students wash their hands for like 10 minutes into various bowls. Each minute they would switch to a new bowl. After minutes of handwashing, they were STILL shedding bacteria into the bowls--but they were normal flora. We did counts of the bacteria in those bowls to check, and we looked at them on slides and did a few tests. They are supposed to be there and they are good for you.</p>
<p>We didn't actually put pathogens on their hands to test, but it's documented that pathogens don't generally attach well to your skin. They aren't meant to. And viruses particularly can't really do that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
