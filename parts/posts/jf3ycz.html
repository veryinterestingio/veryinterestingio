		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it does make a difference. Some seasonings will taste different based on when you add them. Things like onions and garlic (fresh, not powdered) mellow out and sweeten up when added early. Add them late and they will be much stronger and overpower more subtle flavors. Some seasonings like parsley and aromatics will disappear if added too early. </p>
<p>Adding seasonings at the right time can add depth and dimension to the flavor. Most of the traditional should be added early in so they can build a more rich, complex flavor.</p>
<p>Salt should be split up - many recipes need some early on in order to cook properly (sweating vegetables and browning meat) but you can easily end up with too much salt if you use it all up front. So half up front, then add to taste as the last ingredient. </p>
<p>Spicy seasonings can become spicier as you cook them, so I usually do the same with them - half up front to allow it to develop a flavorful spiciness, then add more at the end suit to my preference.</p>
<p>Acids (lemon, citrus, vinegar, etc) will cook out quickly, so if you want the lightness and bite from them they should be added towards the end too.</p>
<p>Powdered garlic and onion and similar spices should be added early so they aren'tgrainy or bitter, but after any liquid so they don't burn.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the first few pages about the importance of salt in her excellent cookbook, “Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat” chef and writer Samin Nosrat tells you how she was hit by its importance in food preparation.
i opened her book while browsing cookbooks, read it for about 30 minutes, bought it and continued reading it when i got home. it’s eye opening. Nosrat’s Netflix show was good as well. E02 deals with salt and should be watched by any inquisitive home-cook.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I always always season my meat a few hours before cooking.  Ideally, meat should be salted and left overnight in the fridge for the seasoning to work its way deep into the meat.  I find that the perfect amount of salt for me is about 1% of the meat's weight.  It seems like a lot, but it turns out perfectly every time.</p>
<p>From what I can figure, this is because when meat is raw the proteins are still relatively loose and there's still a lot of liquid for the salt to migrate through.  Once the meat is cooked though, the muscle proteins denature and tighten up, and salting after won't have nearly the same effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
