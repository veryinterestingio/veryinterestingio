<p>EDIT: beer, wine, or brandy were often mixed with the kegs of fresh water to keep the water from developing algae and making it palatable. In the 17th century, these beverages were replaced with Rum which brought forward  the existence of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grog" target="_blank">'Grog'</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They typically carried three types of beverage. </p>
<p>1) clean water, this didn’t last long.
2) beer, like 2% alcohol. Everyone could drink this and not really be “drunk” but it lasted a while in barrels.
3) liquor, like Rum. This was the last source of liquid that would be safe to drink. </p>
<p>Refill those supplies anytime you got and call it good. Low alcohol beer was used for people on land too. It was safe to drink, even somewhat nutritious, and lasted a while in storage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They would also take advantage of rainfall, setting up collection points.  But for the most part, water was the most limited resource on a sail age ship, every opportunity to replenish was taken advantage of.  In a voyage of more than a month, some stop for water was planned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They often drank beer instead, even children. Beer at the time had a lower alcohol content. Since beer is boiled during its manufacture and contained healthy bacteria, it was a much safer alternative to regular water. Beer also has higher nutrients and vitamins than regular water.</p>
<p>Nautical voyages also gave rise to punch, since higher proof alcohol keeps for long periods of time. Often the alcohol was not as refined (read: tasted horrible) so it was mixed with sugar and juices. There is an old rhyme for making punch from the 1600s that I still use to make punch today: “one part sour, two parts sweet, three parts strong, and four parts weak”.</p>
<p>In a practical recipe, that would be one part lemon juice, two parts simple syrup or juice, three parts alcohol (I like to mix Cava and vodka), and four parts seltzer. And add some citrus to keep the scurvy at bay.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
