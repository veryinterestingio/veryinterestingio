		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the popular theories is the surcoat, a light cotton coat worn over the armor. This would keep you a bit cooler because it would stop the (heat absorbing) metal armor from being exposed to sunlight while also shielding you from the sun, especially if it's a lighter color. Typical Arab clothing, even in the modern day, consists of a full-length white coat for exactly this reason. If you look at historical images of Persian, Turkish, and Mamluke warriors they're often wearing a surcoat or robe over their armor. Even more interestinglly if you look at the Bayeux tapestry, the Norman Knights are not wearing surcoats, but later depictions of English and French knights, from after the crusades, do show them wearing surcoats, suggesting it was a fashion the knights picked up in the middle east.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thing that hurts in that area of the world is the sunlight at the time you’re describing. The cultures of that part of the world often employed cloth and chainmail as much as they could, as it is light, climate resistant, and it’s adequate protection against the weapons of the ancient era, where metal armor worn by soldiers was actually common. Now, it’s a different story because full metal armor doesn’t often see combat unless mounted to a vehicle, which means you might be cooked alive inside it, but you aren’t carrying it yourself. But essentially, ancient middle eastern armor was only metal when it was necessary because of how much of a pain in the ass it was to use. So to answer your question, they <em>didn’t</em> survive wearing full metal body armor, because it wasn’t really what they wore. </p>
<p>Hell, even Persia, a country that could <em>afford</em> to outfit their troops in steel, never bothered with metal armor or shields and instead used cloth and leather armor, and they used wicker-woven shields, but used metal weaponry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was a huge problem, the battle of Hattin was won by the Muslims in large part because they cut off the crusader's supply of water and didn't attack until the next day. The armor they were wearing was a huge problem and they were roundly slaughtered and lost the cool cross they were trundling along. It was after that battle that Rayanald de Chatillon was executed by Saladin for speaking out of place, and multiple massacres of Muslim civilians.</p>
<p>So the answer is muli-pronged. Arab armies eschewed the kind of heavy armor that was popular in Europe and earlier Grecian armies. Roman armies would wear modified armor in battle, this was true of the Eastern Roman army that was dominant long after Rome fell. Leaders needed to make sure their armies had easy access to water and to shade. If they didn't, armies failed. </p>
<p>This was true even in WWII where a bunch of logistical resources were spent trying to get water on these arid and hot Pacific Islands. Veterans talk about the experience of being truly <em>thirsty</em> for the only time in their lives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
