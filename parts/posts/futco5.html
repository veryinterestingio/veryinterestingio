<p>I don't study physics but I have some understanding of a cosmology but this description has always bugged me and no one ever addresses it.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two length scales I think you may interested in. </p>
<p>One is the size of the &quot;observable universe&quot;.  If we think about two points at opposite sides of that, then in the past they were obviously closer together.  This is what some people are probably referring to when they say &quot;the universe was smaller&quot;.  </p>
<p>Another length scale is the size of &quot;all of space that exists, whether or not we can see it now, or will ever be able to see it&quot;.  I think that's what most of us mean by &quot;the universe&quot;.  We don't know that length scale;  we know it's a fair amount bigger than the size of the observable universe, and it could be infinite.  The simplest, most-pleasing-to-a-theorists-eye models say it's infinite.  That doesn't mean it actually is.  </p>
<p>And of course, if it is infinite, it was always infinite, and will always be infinite, in all directions.</p>
<p>So you're right, a better way to talk about the early universe is to refer to how things were closer together, so the density was higher.  Kudos to you for being a positive force for using the right language!  Keep it up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The part that was small is the volume that currently represents the visible universe, which currently has an estimated diameter of 96 billion light years. But we know that the whole shebang must be at least 250 times bigger than that, according to relativity.  Thatâ€™s because the universe is measured to be flat, within a measurement error of 0.4%. If truly flat, <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/123674/why-does-a-flat-universe-imply-an-infinite-universe" target="_blank">it must be infinite.</a> . And, if infinite, it was always infinite in extent, even at the big bang, but also very dense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
