		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The shock wave could kill you. Look at this problem from a different perspective, if you were in a container at rest full of water and sealed then the container was impacted with say a train, but not damaged, the shock wave inside the container would kill you. Water does actually compress under extreme force. this is how sound is conducted and shock waves. The ripple of &quot;sound&quot; in a shock wave would tear your tissues apart. You would be intact but dead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This is the only reference I had off the top of my head, one of the XKCD What If columns. It asks &quot;what would happen if you dropped all the water from a thunderstorm as one BIG drop?&quot; As an additional exercise, it imagines a person inside the drop as it falls.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the raindrop approached the ground, the buildup of air resistance would lead to an increase in pressure that would make your ears pop. But seconds later, when the water contacted the surface, you’d be crushed to death—the shock would briefly create pressures exceeding those at the bottom of the Marianas Trench.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm inclined to believe this, personally. The author tends to research physics questions like this fairly well.</p>
<p>It is bad to be inside an incompressible fluid when there's a sudden huge force on one side. Incompressible means it's all already packed as close as it can be. Imagine being in a container packed tight with steel ball bearings, then dropped 100 feet. Those are like big water molecules, with nowhere to transfer the energy of impact besides your much more compressible body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People bring up the Shockwave traveling through an Incompressible medium, which would be the case if it is in a container that won't break.</p>
<p>But let's say it is in a balloon that will expand and deform (and possibly even break). When the water hits the ground, a tremendous force will push upwards, but this force is not just pointing up but also outwards.</p>
<p>Your body will have a downward force on the water, which will push the water down and sideways. Slowing your fall. As long as there is enough water under you that can be displaced before you reach the critical upwards force from the ground, you'll be fine. </p>
<p>The only reason such a fall can kill you is if the water can't go sideways. Which will direct everything upwards... Thus hitting you with all that energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If it's a large enough container for the height of the fall, yeah the water could probably cushion your body to a certain extent.  That's essentially what's happening inside our skulls, the cerebral fluid cushions our brains against sudden acceleration/deceleration.</p>
<p>Of course this assumes that the container itself is strong enough to survive the fall and that it doesn't deform so much that the water flattens out too much to help cushion your body. And I imagine that there'll be a point where the force transferred to the water will also be enough to harm your body in turn.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
