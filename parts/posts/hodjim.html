		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 3 layers of skin : hypodermis (lowest), dermis (middle), epidermis (top layer). Skin that is regenerating regularly is epidermis (every 30-40 days).  </p>
<p>Meanwhile scars penetrate deeper to the middle layer of our skin (dermis) and that's why it heals way slower. To heal, it needs collagen to help promoting new skin tissue, meanwhile human body doesn't produce collagen that much and we produce even less as we age. As we need more collagen to heal scars, microneedling procedure tend help because it makes tons of new tiny &quot;scars&quot; and forces body to produce collagen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your skin is your first line of defence against pathogens. When you get a substantial injury, your body wants to fix the hole as quickly as possible to prevent infection. It does this by laying down new tissue in a less complex pattern that doesn’t take as long, and is sturdier. Scar tissue also has no blood vessels and no nerve endings. <a href="http://www.beatricebiologist.com/2012/10/scar-tissue/" target="_blank">This comic strip is a cute ELI5 of it</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh, good question.
Scars do fade. But they’re a different kind of cell from regular skin cells, so they don’t fully go away like skin cells. I am curious as to why they don’t behave the same way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
