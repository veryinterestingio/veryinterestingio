		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not directly.</p>
<p>The size of the star and its orbiting planets depends on the mass and distribution of the dust and gas from which it formed. </p>
<p>Since the size of the star as well as the size/number of its orbiting planets both depend on the same metrics, they're related, but one doesn't affect the other directly</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a pretty well-established correlation (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005ApJ...622.1102F/abstract" target="_blank">Fischer &amp; Valenti, 2005</a>) between a star's inherent  &quot;metallicity&quot; - how much mass it has in elements other than just hydrogen and helium - and the likelihood of that star hosting planets. </p>
<p>There's still a good deal of debate exactly <em>why</em> this correlation holds true, though the general concept makes sense. Most planets form from the accumulation of silicate and carbonate grains (rocks) as well as volatiles (ices). If these proto-planets can get big enough from rocks and ices alone (about 10 Earth-masses), then they have enough gravity to start holding on to hydrogen, as well, eventually becoming gas giants.</p>
<p>What's not terribly well-understood yet is why this relation holds so much better for gas giants than terrestrial rocky planets (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.7830" target="_blank">Wang &amp; Fischer, 2014</a>). You are much more likely to find gas giants around stars with high metallicity....but only a little more likely to find terrestrial planets around that same star.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Systems with high mass stars (M&gt;1.5 Msun) form giant planets and brown dwarfs at a much higher occurrence rate than around systems with low mass stars. Here is a nice reference: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05358" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05358</a></p>
<p>Like others have said, this is tied to the conditions in the protoplanetary disk, where the metallicity as well as the abundance of materials shape the formation processes. This is an exciting area of research and new things are being learned all the time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Isn’t it true that there is a Barycenter in the center of a solar system that is point around which a star rotates rather than bodies rotating around the star itself? Or is that incorrect?
