		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is a complex combination of physiology and psychology. As a couple users have pointed out taste buds diminish in time (although this doesn't begin until midlife for most adults.) Additionally, evidence indicates that children may be able to detect bitter compounds better than adults. However, neither of these is accurate alone, as taste <em>preference</em> is largely psychological^<a href="https://www.apa.org/research/action/speaking-of-psychology/foods-we-like" target="_blank">1</a>.</p>
<p>People <em>learn</em> to like the items they did not like as a child. The only thing changing is your own mind. Exposure to a flavor and the context in which it was experienced provide a major influence as to the like or dislike of that flavor. As you continue to be exposed, you develop an appreciation (or confirm your dislike as the case may be.) For example, perhaps you're hit by an illness following the eating of a specific food; you may be significantly less likely to enjoy or try that food again as a result (a common side-effect of food toxicity.)</p>
<p>Initial food preferences can be thought of as being the physical side of this all, and are based on our sensitivity to various tastes and chemicals. Humans tend to prioritize high energy foods so things high in fats tends to taste better universally^<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9216570" target="_blank">2</a> . When it comes to vegetables though, it's the bitter chemicals that stand out the most (edit: and is one reason why kids may not like them - because bitter is a taste instinctively linked to poison/toxic substances^<a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-09/mcsc-bti091206.php" target="_blank">3</a> .) The likely explanation for this is evolutionary pressure^<a href="https://www.popsci.com/science/article/2012-03/fyi-why-does-some-food-taste-bad-some-people-and-good-others/" target="_blank">4</a> which shaped our tastes to accommodate the region in which we lived. For instance, populations in malaria-infested areas are more likely to have genes which make them less sensitive to bitter tastes, in particular cyanide. There's speculation that cyanide - when consumed in low levels - may fight malarial parasites.</p>
<p>Like you were actually five explanation: Nothing <em>really</em> changes. We just learn to enjoy them over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

But when I get real high and hungry I'll try anything. Some things that I realized are dank that I never ate as a kid: cheese(other than American), broccoli, asparagus, sushi, cabbage (any variety really), yogurt, avocado, sour cream, and I'm sure there's more.</p>
<p>Some things I still can't do: Hawaiian pizza, squash, pumpkin pie, plain raw tomato, cottage cheese</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of it is child rearing practices. In cultures where bitter foods are what’s on the menu no matter what, you don’t get kids who are picky about it like most American children. In child development it takes 10-20 “tries” for a kid to learn a new flavor. Many first world parents will see a baby make a squinchy face after trying creamed spinach (for example) for the first time, decide she doesn’t “like it”, and won’t offer it again. This is one reason why some children become extremely resistant or even traumatized about certain foods. A lot of the child psychology reality television on Youtube is about “picky eaters” and it always comes down to parents just not offering enough variety for children to learn new flavors. </p>
<p>Some kids, especially on the spectrum, may have physiological sensitivities however and aren’t just normal-picky. This is hard to diagnose, however.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
