<p>Is there someone who has the data or who can do the math? I suspect having a planet fully &quot;behind you&quot; reflecting all of the suns light could mean that looking outward(Mercury to Venus, Venus to Earth or Mars to Jupiter) would make that arrangement much brighter &quot;when the planets align&quot;</p></div></div>

<p>Venus would reach an apparent magnitude up (down?) to -7.7.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Without a doubt, Venus observed from Mercury.  Venus at opposition would-be fully illuminated disc, on average a mere 31 million mi away.  </p>
<p>The brightest planet observable from Earth is also Venus.  But it achieves this maximum brightness while in a crescent phase (about 27% lit), and about 45 million miles away.  </p>
<p>With 4 times more illuminated area, and â…” the distance, I'd expect Venus to appear 4^(1.5^2) = about 22 times brighter (abt 3.4 magnitudes) from Mercury than at its max brightest as seen in the skies of Earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To get pithy a little (it's Venus from Mercury if we use a strict definition) and relax the requirements to include moons, it's Jupiter from Metis. Jupiter would subtend 68 degrees, covering 18% of the sky and would be 4% as bright as the Sun. That's enough light to read by.</p>
<p>Edit: No it isn't! The brightest body (not the Sun) from the surface of any other is Mars from Phobos. It subtends 42 degrees, and is 2,500x the brightness of the full moon from Earth.</p>
<p>In terms of pure surface brightness, Earth from the Moon takes it. Earth is much larger than the Moon and has a much higher albedo. Earth is 1.9 degrees across and fifty times brighter than viewing the Moon from Earth.</p>
<p>Earth from Venus is another great contender, but you have to be in Venusian orbit, as its atmosphere is opaque. Earth is magnitude -6.6 at opposition, and is accompanied by a -2.7 moon. Add these and you don't break -7.0 but do come close.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
