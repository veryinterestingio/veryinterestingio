How was all that uranium ore used? How much of it was directly required for the creation of that first nuke, versus experiments, the construction of nuclear reactors, etc.?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all &quot;uranium ore&quot; is about 2% uranium (and that's considered high-grade ore). See: <a href="https://geoinfo.nmt.edu/resources/uranium/where.html" target="_blank">https://geoinfo.nmt.edu/resources/uranium/where.html</a></p>
<p>Next, natural uranium is only 0.72% ^(235)U, which is the isotope needed for bombs. So the ore would contain ~144 ppm (let's round down to 100 ppm since the ore was probably less than 2% U). This gives 1890 pounds ^(235)U in the 18.9 million pounds of ore. </p>
<p>Now consider that enrichment to remove ^(238)U can't perfectly separate the two isotopes, so some ^(235)U is lost during enrichment and some ^(238)U remained in the final product (it still contained 11% of that isotope).</p>
<p>Besides the amount lost during enrichment, some uranium was also used for other purposes during the project, such as for the production of plutonium.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the ore came from several sources, each of which had different concentrations of uranium (the element) per pound of rock (the ore). The best ore came from the Belgian Congo, which could be as much as 75% uranium oxide per mass of ore. Canadian ores could be as much as 20-30%, and ores from the American southwest were more like 0.25%. There were some other sources, like tailings, sands, and &quot;slimes&quot; from vanadium mines that had uranium in them (which ranged from 0.25% to 45%, depending on the process that had produced them).</p>
<p>The African ores made up the bulk of the ore procured — some 29,734 tons of it. From that, 3,839 tons of oxide were produced. (That makes it have a low average, because of one gigantic shipment of 12,000 tons that was only 3% uranium, but most of its tonnage ranged between 20% and 65%.) From Canada, they got 4,149 tons of ore, which was turned into 1,137 tons of oxide. From domestic sources, they got 379,671 tons of ore, tailings, sands, and slimes, which yielded a mere 1,349 tons of oxide. And they had some &quot;miscellaneous&quot; sources that added another 270 tons of oxide to the mix. So that's 413,943 tons of ores or tailings (827 million pounds), from which they got 6,595 tons of oxide (13.2 million pounds). (These numbers come from the declassified <a href="http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2014/09/05/general-groves-secret-history/" target="_blank"><em>Manhattan District History</em></a>, volume on Feed Materials.)</p>
<p>OK, so where did all that go? Well, the ores and sands and whatnot had to first be turned into oxide, and from that into other chemicals. Much of that oxide was converted into a tetrachloride and sent to Oak Ridge, where it was put through enrichment of the U-235 isotope. Natural uranium contains 0.72% U-235, and the Little Boy fuel had 80% enrichment on average, so that means you already needed at least 9 tons of natural uranium if you're going to get that much out of it, assuming a <em>very</em> efficient and smooth enrichment process. They actually needed much more than this, because the process was not smooth or efficient. </p>
<p>A lot of the uranium oxide was turned into uranium metal (again, more chemistry), and sent to Hanford. This is where the first industrial-sized nuclear reactors were built. One of the by-products of a nuclear reactor is plutonium-239, which is another bomb fuel. To get the best plutonium-239 (that is, the least contaminated with plutonium-240, which makes it difficult to use and less reliable), you have to cycle the fuel through the reactors relatively quickly (unlike in reactors that are meant to generate power). Using the processes they had in World War II, they could get 225 <em>grams</em> of plutonium-239 from every <em>ton</em> of uranium they processed. The Hanford reactors could each process 30 tons of uranium per month at full power (though they often did not run at full power), and there were three of them. (Each reactor needed to have 200 tons of uranium in it in order to process that 30 tons through, though — so that's 600 tons right there, in the three reactors.) So in theory you could get about 20 kg of plutonium per month this way. The Trinity &quot;gadget,&quot; the Nagasaki bomb, and the un-used &quot;third core&quot; each were about 6.2 kg of plutonium (so about 18.6 kg of plutonium total was produced the time of Japanese surrender). </p>
<p>So you can see there are a lot of places uranium would go. The exact usage of uranium per plant is not something I have seen (yet — I've seen some numbers but they are spotty). Lastly I would just note that most of the numbers one finds on this are for the entire Manhattan Engineer District, which existed until the end of December 1946. If one is asking about what was <em>used</em> of that hoard of uranium by mid-1945, it is about 3,000 tons. Still a lot! But less than half of that total number!</p>
<p>Why'd they hoard so much? They needed a lot to make the bombs for the war, and intended to keep making more. But importantly, they also recognized that uranium would become a very valuable commodity after the war. So one of the actions of the Manhattan Project was to try and obtain as much known uranium as possible in the Allied sphere of influence, so that the US and UK would have a huge advantage over other nations in respect to nuclear technology. General Groves, head of the project, apparently thought this would keep the Soviets from developing the bomb, since there were no good pre-war sources of uranium within the boundaries of the USSR. However the Soviets not only were able to obtain some ores from outside of the country, but they also found poor sources of ore within their country that they were nonetheless capable of exploiting using their copious GULAG labor force.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Uranium ore usually has &lt;0.3% uranium content. U-235 is only 0.7% of the total natural uranium. From those two numbers, the enrichment procedures (conversion from the oxide to the fluoride, either gaseous diffusion or mass spectrometry, and reconversion to the metal) needed an overall efficiency of 35% or less (which seems very plausible) to get from 141 pounds to 18.9 million pounds. </p>
<p>This piece claims that 1 million pounds of ore is needed to get 7 pounds of U-235, which is about the same ratio as above. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was also the uranium being used to breed plutonium. A trial reactor called X-10 was erected at Oak Ridge was the first to produce usable quantities of plutonium, but the bomb plutonium was all from Hanford in Washington State. When fully-fuelled. the B reactor at Hanford used about 180 tonnes of natural uranium metal. After being irradiated in the core for a period, the spent fuel was pushed out of the back of the reactor and into a cooling pond ready for reprocessing. New fuel was inserted at the reactor face. The B was later joined by the D and F reactors at Hanford.</p>
<p>So at any one time there was about 600 tonnes of fuel in the reactors; plus the spent fuel at various stages of cooling, being dissolved and separated for plutonium.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
