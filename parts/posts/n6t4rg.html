		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tigers and lions both belong to the same genus, Panthera, their ancestors only diverged from each other around 4-5 million years ago. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panthera_hybrid" target="_blank">Many members</a> of the Panthera genus can interbreed, not just tigers and lions. They can also breed with jaguars and leopards. It's not a specific rule and there probably are exceptions but members of the same genus are more closely related and more likely to be able to reproduce. Humans and chimpanzees for example are not in the same genus, we are in the genus Homo and chimps and bonobos are in the genus Pan. Gorillas are in their own genus. We were in the same genus as Homo Erectus so there's a chance we might have been able to produce offspring with them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, the term species is a convenient kludge.  It is not as based on solid biological differences as people tend to think, especially because we often assign organisms to different species before we have fully studied their ability to breed.</p>
<p>Pretty much all of the big cats have some degree of inter fertility with each other, which one could argue makes them a single species. But lions and tigers and leopards all look so different and behave differently enough that of course the earliest scientists just assume that they were different enough to call different species.</p>
<p>It gets even more complicated when you're dealing with things like bacteria. Two different strains of e coli, which we refer to as the same species, can be as genetically distinct from each other as you are from a catfish.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the simplest level, there are three requirements for successful breeding</p>
<p><strong>Can sex occur</strong>:  Species need to have compatible genitalia, and have sufficient interest in each other to have sex and/or recognise fertile periods in each other</p>
<p><strong>Can sperm penetrate the egg</strong>:  The sperm needs to be able to survive the trip to the egg and then penetrate into the egg when it arrives.  The more different two species are, the greater the chance that female's immune system will be overly hostile to the sprem, or that the sperm  lacks the chemical tools to penetrate the egg.</p>
<p><strong>Can the species combine genetic information to make a viable offspring</strong>:  Sexual reproduction means taking one chromosome from each parent's pair for all chromosomes.  Collectively, the DNA in these chromosomes are like blueprints and instructions for what each cell in the body should do.  At the largescale this determines bone, organ and muscle locations;  and the micro-scale this determines the protein productions and cellular activity that keeps tissue alive.</p>
<p>Randomly combining chromosomes and getting a viable blueprint for an offspring is not trivial.  Even among the same species, most fertilised eggs are miscarriages due to the embryo failing to thrive or triggering hostile activity from the mother's immune system.</p>
<p>---------------</p>
<p>In summary, the strictest limit on inter-breeding is &quot;If I randomly combine chromosomes from these species, do I get a valid set of microbiological instructions that can keep an animal alive&quot;.   The longer it has been since two organisms interbred, the more likely it is that they have some mutual incompatibility in their genetics that will cause a reproductive failure.</p>
<p>There is no hard and fast rule about when this will occur or why, so I can't tell you why Ligers are a thing, but you can't crossbreed a golden eagle with a red-tailed hawk.  Ultimately it is some combination of &quot;they won't have sex&quot; or &quot;something in the genes is too different, they are too dissimilar&quot;.  Which is all true, but not a precise, single answer.</p>
<p>The overall idea is clear in theory though:  If two animals have different genetic instructions to make their bodies, eventually the two of them are so different that their DNA cannot be combined to make a valid set of instructions for a child.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Animals that are different species but the same genus can produce sterile offspring.  That just means they are close enough related evolutionary speaking, like he difference between cousins and siblings. The offspring are called hybrids, another popular example is horse + donkey = mule.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it has to do with how long ago they split genetically. The more recent the change, the more likely it is that they can still interbreed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
