		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically:</p>
<p>It's a UV transmission rating</p>
<p>SPF 60 means 1 part in 60 of the UV radiation from the sun are transmitted to your skin, assuming you follow their instructions.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Realistically:</p>
<p>1 SPF is like growing 1 layer of skin to tank the sunburn for you.</p>
<p>30 SPF = about 30 times the protection of your regular skin</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It dose't actually tell you how long you have before you need to re-apply, since it's just a transmission rating self reported by the sunscreen manufacturer. Duration depends on the composition of the sunscreen, some of them break down/ wash off faster than others, as well as how prone you are to sunburns. If in doubt, follow the instructions just in case.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Skin Protection Factor (SPF) represents how many times longer you can stay out in the sun <strong>if you completely follow the directions about applying and reapplying</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, if you were extremely pale and sunburn in 10 minutes under the sun, using SPF 30 properly will allow you 300 min under the sun before you get to that sunburn state.</p>
<p>To reiterate, the SPF rating only applies if you follow all the directions especially about reapplying after a certain amount of time or if you go in the water. People often think that starting out with higher SPF allows them to go longer without reapplying but this is not aways true. If most of the sunscreen washes out from swimming and you don't reapply, you will be feeling the fury of the sun and burn much quicker than if you reapplied a lower SPF sunscreen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You should reapply sunscreen every hour. We live in Florida and are naturally pretty tan. We use 15 SPF every hour. Our friends who are not tan but don’t burn easy (plus on my face) use SPF 30 every hour. Another friend who is extremely pale and burns immediately uses SPF 60 every 45 minutes to an hour. More if she goes in the water. SPF is related to protection rating, but unless you reapply often it won’t matter if you use 5 or 50.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>SPF stands for Skin Protection Factor and is, in testing, how much longer it takes to burn wiith the sunscreen compared to without it (so if you'd normally take 1 hour to burn it would now take 5 hours with SPF 5).</p>
<p>Note however that they apply the sunscreen much thicker in testing than you would normally do on the beach. The industry standard is 2 milligrams of product per square cm. Which means that you'd have to slobber on a 30 grams of product to cover your entire body (that's about 2 fluid ounces or 4 tablespoons) to get the advertised level  of protection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
