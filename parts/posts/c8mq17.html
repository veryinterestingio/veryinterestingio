		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! My name is Alicia McGrew, and I am a PhD candidate at the University of Florida.</p>
<p>My PhD research at the University of Florida is focused on the food web that lives inside the leaves of a carnivorous pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea).  Florida is the carnivorous plant hotspot of North America; however, this particular pitcher plant is unique, as it relies on a community of aquatic micro-organisms to help decompose its prey and acquire important nutrients for growth.</p>
<p>I use this model food web to ask a number of questions about ecological communities:  which organisms are there, how do they interact, and how does this composition and structure vary across different ecological and environmental conditions?  I'm particularly interested in the role of nutrients and predation on structuring aquatic communities.</p>
<p>I'm from Michigan, and first began doing research on aquatic communities in the Great Lakes region, where I spent many hours on a microscope!  I worked as a technician to sample and identify zooplankton taxa in a variety of habitats.  For my Master's research, I investigated the feeding ecology of an aquatic invasive species to the Great Lakes region, the bloody red shrimp.</p>
<p>When I'm not doing science, my other interests include teaching, reading, gardening (including a mini pitcher plant bog!), traveling, and hiking.</p>
<p>You can read more about the work being done at the UF/IFAS Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation <a href="https://wec.ifas.ufl.edu/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UFIFASWildlife/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>I'll be on at noon EDT (16 UT), AMA!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Carnivorous plants inspire fascination I think because they seem to cross a mental line people conceive separating plants and animals. Your intro seems be indicating pitcher plants have the equivalent of a &quot;gut biome&quot; enabling them consume flesh; but is this completely true? Do the plants themselves share any metabolic processes usually only seen in animal cells (and not seen in other non-carnivorous plants)?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

That sounds like a dream for me but I don't know how to break into that type of career. What was your education path like and how did you get into such specific research? Does your education path leave open options to research other macro/micro environments?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

1.What's the biggest prey a carnivorous plant can eat?</p>
<p>2.are carnivorous plants typically apex predators or is there something that eats them?</p>
<p>3.Is there potential for a plant to grow like the one from the rocky horror picture show?
Edit :as in it can eat people and not that it's an alien,has teeth and a fantastic vocal range</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
