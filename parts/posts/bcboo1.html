		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the degree of burn or severity of the injury.</p>
<p>First degree burns only affect the epidermal layer, and when it is regenerated by the underlying dermis it will have essentially the same whorls and ridges—unless there was severe mechanical deformation—like severe blistering and tearing.</p>
<p>Second degree burns affect both the epidermis and the dermis, but the later not completely. The dermis first has to regenerate from whatever is left of it, and then it regenerates the epidermis. Barring severe, extensive or very deep damage (destruction or tearing), the epidermis recovers partially its whorls and ridges, but usually with some deformation.</p>
<p>But third degree burns destroy both dermal layers, and even some deep tissue. With enough medical care it is possible to recover the dermal layer—even if that requires a skin transplant—and the dermal layer will usually (with some help) regenerate the epidermal layer. But many times the whorls and ridges will be missing or too thin, and even when present they will be completely different.</p>
<p>Edit:
TL;DR: Basically we have ridges beneath the surface of our skin which are responsible for the formation of fingerprints. As long as they are left unharmed, your fingerprints will regrow along with your skin</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
