		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>[ive got my answer now thanks guys:)]Can someone explain to me why 1-methyl pentane doesn’t exist as a structural isomer of hexane? I’ve read a few explanations online but I don’t understand them. Can you guys help? It’s for a piece of work I’m doing on structural isomerism.(Im an a-level chemist who has just started work on isomers and biochemistry)</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cause that’s Hexane and not an isomer, it’s just the longest chain of carbons you can count, so without any substituents along the chain, you’ll have six carbons either way, no matter if the 6th carbon is in a methyl group or not</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1 methyl pentane = wrongly named hexane. Naming the ___ane part always uses the longest chain of carbons. Looking at hexane as a pentane with a methyl group at the one position does not use the longest carbon chain as the reference for naming. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because 1-methyl pentane is identical to n-Hexane (same for a hypothetical 5-methyl pentane)</p>
<p>the problem is likely in the way you draw these things in your head/notes vs the reality.</p>
<p>try to draw both and number each C, now compare them and see how they differ...</p>
<p>likely the only difference between the 2 is the angle at which you drew the methyl... in reality that angle isn't different and they both look <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Hexane-3D-balls.png" target="_blank">like this</a> (still a flawed representation but it illustrates the point...)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As u/uncleswillis said, when figuring out what to call it, you count the longest carbon chain, the 1-methyl group is on the first carbon so it just adds onto the chain. This makes a 6 carbon chain and therefore just hexane.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like you found your answer.  While we're here, help me out with an A-level chemistry reminiscence? In my chem classroom we had a big chart on the wall called The Boat, which was a diagram of all the different reactions possible between types of organic molecule.  It was shaped kind of like a sailboat, with (I think) haloalkanes in the middle, and then the curving bottom of the hull was alcohols, aldehydes/ketones and carboxylic acids, and the big triangular sail was between haloalkanes, alcohols and something else I don't remember.</p>
<p>Is this a standard thing that I just can't find anywhere, or is it something my teacher invented and do you have an equivalent?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
