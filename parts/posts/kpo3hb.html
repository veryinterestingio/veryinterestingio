		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm talking of course about the musical scale. Is there a parallel universe (or maybe a particular culture) where there are actually 16, or 9, or 5 subdivisions between octaves? I get the concept of an octave (a sound frequency and its double sound similar), but the rest seems somewhat arbitrary to me, even though it sounds perfect.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the 12-tone system is an 'invention'. People can (and do) divide the octave into different numbers. BUT every system is a conpromise that tries to preserve as many pleasing intervals (combinations of two notes) as possible. Intervals that have simpler ratios generally sound better - some of the most universally pleasing are 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, etc - but culture has a large influence on this as well.</p>
<p>So if you want to divide the octave into evenly spaced notes, you want to do so in a way that appproximates those pleasing intervals while also being actually useful. The 12-tone system seems to do a pretty good job of that. Other systems might be more harmonically accurate, but might not be as versatile or might be overly complicated.</p>
<p>So while it is an invention, it is also a compromise between the culturally evolved idea of what sounds 'good', and the constraints of math.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dividing an octave into 12th's gives you notes that are really close to the harmonies from integer ratios of frequencies, while keeping a reasonably small number of notes.</p>
<p>16 notes is close, but misses the 4th and 5th by more than the set of 12 notes.</p>
<p>You can add more notes to get closer, but 12 suffices.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>i like a lot of answers here discussing the math. ex: when frequencies mix in the air, 466Hz and 440Hz sound bad to us, meanwhile 330Hz and 440Hz can sound great together. if we keep it simple, it can be easy to see why (those frequencies correspond to keys on a piano, A#, A, E.) Eventually A and E share harmonics, which match perfectly, frequency-wise. </p>

<p>if notes were crayons, you can mix blue and yellow crayons and make a nice green color; you can mix red and yellow to make orange; but most crayons mixed make poopy brown colors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Sounds that vibrate in different multiples of a particular frequency sound pleasing together. The ancients noticed that this was the same as dampening vibrating strings at nice fractional amounts.</p>
<p>The simplest fractions sound best, and in early Christian chants only these were allowed. Gradually, more intervals were added. Eventually, the list expanded to 12 intervals, roughly equally spaced.</p>
<p>The composer Bach and the mathematician Euler worked together to form a mathematical theory of the &quot;Well-Tempered Scale&quot; that we use today. Rather than using fractions, it uses the 12th root of 2 to produce the intervals, so this is definitely a modern invention. The intervals are close to the original ones, but noticeably wrong.</p>
<p>The advantage of the tempered scale is that it allows instruments to not be limited to only certain keys. An instrument tuned to the G scale in the untempered system sounds great on songs written in G, and okay on songs in the keys of C or D, but much worse on songs in keys other than these ones. The tempered instrument sounds equally good (or bad) in every key.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
