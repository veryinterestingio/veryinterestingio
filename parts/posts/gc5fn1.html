<p>The rapidly expanding gas drives the turbine blades which rotate the shaft and is used to power the chopper.</p>
<p>Your car if it has rear facing exhaust produces thrust by expelling hot gasses but your car does not move because of it. </p>

<p>They are used all over the place from helicopter to tanks to ships.</p>
<p>They fire hot exhaust gasses into a series of turbines that slow the gas down, and the energy is used to rotate the turbines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>Very little. A turbine doesn't actually need to generate thrust if you fully expand the gas prior to exhausting it, which is what you do when all you care about is mechanical/electrical power, which is the case for a helicopter where you want all of the energy going to the main rotors. In jet engines, the exhaust is only <em>partially</em> expanded on the tail end of the turbine (in order to provide a small amount of electrical power for the aircraft's systems), and the remaining energy in the exhaust gas translates into thrust.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
