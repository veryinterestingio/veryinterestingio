<p>It's false color because you can't really take color images at that scale (and certainly not with electron microscopy), but it's a real picture.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  It is a physical object, just very small.  The round surface is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipid" target="_blank">phospholipid</a> - an oily substance.  The spikes are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein" target="_blank">proteins</a>, chains of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid" target="_blank">amino acids</a> in a particular coding sequence.  That sequence determines the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarity_(molecular_biology)" target="_blank">reverse-sense sequence</a> the protein targets to hybridize with, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin-converting_enzyme_2" target="_blank">receptor in your lung cells</a>.</p>
<p>It literally is an oily droplet that uses surface anchors to attach and fuse with the membranes of your own cells.  When it fuses, it dumps genetic material in your cell.  That material gets into the nucleus through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome" target="_blank">ribosome</a>, and the nucleus translates that genetic material instead of your own, <del>using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_polymerase" target="_blank">DNA polymerase</a> - or in this case it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcribing_viruses" target="_blank">reverses the RNA back into DNA as an initializing step</a> because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_diseases" target="_blank">COVID is an RNA virus</a></del>.  [[Some have pointed out that I mixed taxonomic kingdoms of viruses here (orthonavirae and paranavirae, they're both RNA viruses) - Coronavirus uses messenger-RNA instead of reverse transcriptase.  EXCUSE ME GUYS!]]  This produces more viral particles, and eventually kills the cell doing so.  Particles move on to the next cell.  On and on until you're coughing spores of colonizing oily droplets, then die.  Spores colonize the next person.  Rinse, repeat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Coronavirus gets its name because corona which kinda means like crown. So on an EM you only really get a 2D representation of a 3D object. So in 2D it looks like a crown, but a spherical version could be easily considered as a sphere with spikes</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
