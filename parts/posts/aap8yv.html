<p>his music was great, he had so many sides to show us, he was the voice of the streets, but also the voice that pretty much any marginalized or misfit could relate to</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok I’ll attempt it. </p>
<p>So Pac was to rap music what Elvis was to Pop Music
At the height of his fame he was involved with a rivalry with The Notorious BIG who was his equal. </p>
<p>Think Lionel Messi and Ronaldo.</p>
<p>He was a symbol of rebellion and anti establishment. He wore his heart on his sleeve and put it down on record. His infamy was heightened when he was shot in a New York recording studio, in the same building Biggie smalls and Junior mafia were, speculation increased that it was biggies crew who did this.
2 Pac went to prison to serve a sentence for alleged sexual assault. Whilst inside Biggie released the song ‘who shot ya’ as well as his debut album Ready to die.</p>
<p>Once 2 Pac got out he released arguably his most influential album All Eyez on me, as well as the song Hit em up, a diss song to Biggie, Junior Mafia &amp; Mobb Deep.</p>
<p>This ramped up the east coast vs west coast beef.</p>
<p>After his death following a shooting in Las Vegas in 96. His legacy shone for the rest of the hip hop world to follow. He was an icon in a relatively new genre of music. He influenced so many in years to come, he carried an entire coast on his back and is regarded as the Greatest rapper of all time. </p>
<p>Hendrix, Jim Morrison, Cobain, are all in the same bracket as Pac for the legacy he left</p>
<p>Not only did Pac create some of the best west coast albums he created some of the best hip hop and albums period.</p>
<p>Start with All Eyez on Me, Then 7 day theory, Then me against the world. </p>
<p>THUGGGG LIFFFFEEEEE</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what others have said a lot of his music is surprisingly positive despite the thug life lifestyle most people associate with him.</p>
<p>I would recommend checking out changes, hold ya head up, baby don't cry, and Brenda's got a baby for some good examples of that. </p>
<p>The last 3 of those listed are very empathetic towards women which goes against common rap stereotypes. A lot of his music is still relevant today too, changes is a good example of that. </p>
<p>And his music is good as shit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tupac and his “fuck you” and “fuck it” attitude were perfect for me and how I felt at the time. I started shaving my head because Pac did. I smoked weed because Pac did. His lyrics were deep spiritually and emotionally. He was a poet. And near his death he was preaching more about unity and diversity which stuck with me after his death. He was a great artist and has over 4000 recorded songs we haven’t heard yet. “Changes” is a great song, meant to be on All Eyez On Me, but PAC hated it. He was a perfectionist and we haven’t heard the best from him yet. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically because 22 years later the issues and problems of society Pac pointed at and criticised are as present today as they were when he wrote about them.</p>
<p>“Cops give a damn about a negro? Pull the trigger kill a nigga he's a hero”  “Can't a brother get a little peace? It's war on the streets and the war in the Middle East. Instead of war on poverty they got a war on drugs so the police can bother me”  </p>
<p>The lyrics are as biting and as relevant to the listener in 2018 as they were when written in 92. Songs about hanging out by the pay phones or taking your date out for a chocolate soda and a drive through movie are unrelatable now but many listeners especially young male minorities will feel much of the same frustrations and anger at being treated like a second class citizen in their own countries much the same as Tupac protestsed and fought against.</p>
<p>Edit: Stoies like Pac shooting two law breaking police officers in the ass AND WALKING FREE never hurt to make you a permanent hood legend </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
