		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is not enough information to make a determination. There are examples of both &quot;young&quot; and &quot;old&quot; landscapes that are either very flat or very rugged depending on the geologic and geomorphic details (and a related problem is &quot;young&quot; and &quot;old&quot; are completely ambiguous in this context). I'll interpret &quot;young&quot; and &quot;old&quot; in terms of the geologic timescale and what I would say is a somewhat common viewpoint and say that things only a few million years old are &quot;young&quot; and things multiple tens of millions of years old or older are &quot;old&quot; (this would vary by geologist, one who primarily works on quaternary geology would probably consider anything older than ~1 million years &quot;old&quot; vs a geologist who works exclusively on the precambrian would probably think of anything during the paleozoic as &quot;young&quot;, etc). For &quot;young&quot; and very flat, any place experiencing active deposition like a river delta would be a good example of a very flat, relatively young landscape. For &quot;old&quot; and very flat, classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peneplain" target="_blank">&quot;peneplains&quot;</a> (though is a deeply problematic term that pretty much any modern geomorphologist would cringe at using) or relatively flat &quot;relict landscapes&quot;, like that which has been argued to exist in eastern Tibet (e.g., <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2005JF000294" target="_blank">Clark et al., 2006</a>). For &quot;young&quot; and very rugged, pretty much any &quot;young&quot; mountain range like Taiwan or the Greater Caucasus could work (the former is ~4 million years old, the latter between 5-10 million years old). Significantly younger would be any number of large volcanic edifices, e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauna_Loa" target="_blank">Mauna Loa</a> to pick a random one. Because rugged topography actually takes a while to be removed, there are plenty of examples of &quot;old&quot; and still rugged landscapes. Mountain ranges like the Pyrenees have been (mostly) tectonically dead for tens of millions of years, but still host relatively rugged topography. Older still are ranges like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural_Mountains#Geology" target="_blank">Urals</a> which formed &gt;250 million years ago but are still quite rugged given their age.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends. If it’s an alluvial or glacial valley then it’s probably part of the flood plain or glacial landform. If it’s high desert with few low lying outcrops then there is probably an unconformity (an relatively recent (but not always) erosional level surface over rocks of undetermined age.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Could be either, depending. A sea coast could see such a thing arise from the movement of sand during a storm, for example, or just from a shift in tidal patterns. Or it could be old mountains very graded down from eons of erosion. There are other examples, but they would produce similar results.</p>
<p>So...yeah. It depends!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
