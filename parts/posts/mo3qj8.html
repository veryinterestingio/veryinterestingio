		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ping time is the time it takes for data to leave your computer, reach a destination and be returned. Many computers on the internet listen for a specific packet and it echos that packet back to the computer that sent it. Your computer measures the time it takes for that specific piece of data to get echoed back to you. That's the &quot;Ping time&quot;.</p>
<p>A single ping only tells you part of the puzzle. It's a single snapshot in time. The next ping could take longer or be faster. A high jitter means inconsistent ping times. Low jitter means more predictable performance. High jitter can indicate network congestion. Think of it like cars on a highway. High jitter is like start-and-stop traffic. Low jitter is like traffic flowing smoothly. It may be going fast or slow, but it's consistent.</p>
<p>For viewing web pages, or scrolling Reddit or other social media services, jitter doesn't really matter. But if you're playing a video game that depends on a server, like Fortnite or Call of Duty, jitter can create quality-of-play issues. If you're streaming video, jitter can cause delays and stuttering in video playback.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ping is a tool to measure round trip time (RTT). This is how long it takes for a message to both reach the other side and return. </p>
<p>Many other posts are describing ping as one way time which is incorrect.</p>
<p>The tool was named ping because the idea is similar to sonar. You send out a &quot;ping&quot;. It travels out until it hits some thing and bounces back. The time between sending and receiving the bounce back.</p>

<p>The jitter is any external stops Ping has to make on his way. Construction zones, traffic, bad roads all lead to Ping sometimes taking longer than 30ms to get there and back with the package due to bad and unstable connections. Sometimes, Ping has to go through checkpoints or make other stops on his way, depending on where he's going, which can increase your jitter, and oftentimes your ping as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Jitter is more simply put the variability of latency(ping time). If you get pings consistently in the 30 millisecond range, but suddenly get a ping of twice that (60 millisecond) thatâ€™s 30 milliseconds of jitter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In an ELI5 way:</p>
<p>Ping is like measuring the time it takes for you to go to one state and back to your starting state. It's the full round trip time. Like if you go on google map and get directions that's the one way trip, but ping includes the time it takes to return as well.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Jitter is a little more complicated, but I think I made a good metaphor:</p>
<p>So when nasa needs to transport a rocket to a launch site, they typically break it up into small pieces to reconstruct it at the site later. They send these smaller pieces (packets) on multiple trucks and one by one the trucks arrive at the destination. You should expect these trucks to arrive one after another on a relatively stable interval because they all left one after another (basically one truck pulls in then 5 seconds later another and 5 seconds later another and so on). However, sometimes one truck is stopped at a red light and another one isn't, this is a cause of jitter: traffic (and network congestion), but jitter itself is the time in between packets arriving. It is the inconsistency of the interval of packets arriving. Typically also measured in milliseconds.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In an actual network, these &quot;trucks&quot; could all take different routes, perhaps won't even be sent at all, break down half way, etc. Packets are all routed individually, and can arrive at any time in any order. But that is a different topic for UDP vs TCP.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
