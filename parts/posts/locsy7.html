		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A battery's voltage changes with its charge. A 12v car battery might go as low as 10 volts when dead or as high as 14 when topped off. By measuring the voltage and knowing the battery type, the battery's charge can be estimated. This is, however, imperfect and especially as the device ages it becomes inaccurate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 2 methods to calculate the remaining power in a battery, and they're both kinda inexact.</p>
<p>One is measuring the voltage of the cell(s) and approximating or looking up on a table how that voltage corresponds with a given amount of energy remaining, but it's also dependent on many things like the temperature, and how fast you are drawing current. The battery cell is undergoing a chemical reaction to make up the electrons that flow through the circuit. The chemicals can 'wear out' by degrading and breaking down to non-useful unreactive products. There can be physical damage, etc. For most people, however, this estimate is close enough. Eg. An alkaline 1.5v AA battery starts at around 1.55v, and is completely depleted at 0.8v. You can then take a measurement and cross multiply to know how much of that 0.75v envelope is remaining.</p>
<p>Another method is to (approximately) count the electrons that the battery has produced, and again knowing the characteristics of the battery, you can say how many are remaining. Applications like electric cars and quadcopters use this, where by monitoring the current consumption as well as the voltage, they can ascertain how much charge is left. A 1000mAh battery measured drawing 1000mA for 0.5 hours has about half left. Some drone pilots display their consumed mAh in the headset so they know not just to watch the voltage count down, but also 'this 1000mAh battery has been depleted of 900mAh, best come in to land', regardless of the voltage remaining.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe you are talking about batteries that have built in indicators.</p>
<p>Such as some disposable batteries.</p>
<p>The easiest answer is based off of reactivity of the medium to a given charge.
The more charge the more the tiny strip is energized and the more of the strip becomes visible. </p>
<p>In more advanced battery indicators a resistance method is used. Such as in volt meters resistance is used to measure output voltage of the battery. This is then read as % of full charge or as actual voltage depending the desired interpretation. Such as in electric fork trucks.
Display of % of full charge conveys more meaningful information than 43 volts (in a 48 volt system) </p>
<p>Most good methods of battery charge indicators use an 'on demand' indicator so that the indicator itself does not drain the system.
Another method used in most always displayed system is to use very little power to display the actual power via voltage reduction. The indicator will use a lower power requirement to display the actual charge left in the battery.
IE. THE 48v is not needed and only 0.5v is. </p>
<p>This does not go into amps/hour (draw) and how that factor affects the actual amount of usage a battery will give at a voltage range for a given duration.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
