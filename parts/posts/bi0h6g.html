		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Peanut butter normally has added oil. To reduce the fat, you don't add the oil. To further reduce the fat, you spin it (in a centrifuge) so the lightest part—the peanuts' own oil—floats to the top, and then pour it off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Jiff low fat peanut butter replaces oil (needed to keep the butter spreadable) with corn syrup, and replaces some of the peanuts with nearly fat free pea protein. It's 60 percent peanuts! Good enough for government work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking they create the product by substituting other nonfat ingredients for the fat, for example low fat peanut butter can have corn surup instead of fat, which can have roughly the same texture.  Ingredients like inulin (not insulin) are a naturally occurring food fiber that has few calories but gives the feeling of being full and can also substitute for fat, this is often used in nut-flavored bars.  These substitutions are not necessarily good for you and the fat that occurs in peanut butter is not necessarily bad for you, but many consumers will buy anything labeled &quot;low fat&quot; or &quot;reduced fat&quot; and think it is better for you, and as long as there is a market for it, food producers will produce it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good god, so much disinformation here.  I used to work for the company that made Skippy peanut butter.  In the US, peanut butter has a standard of identity that says that peanut butter has to have at least 90% peanuts, can have sugar and/or honey, salt, and partially hydrogenated vegetable oil for stability (prevents oil separation).</p>
<p>Reduced fat has only 60% peanuts, so the natural fat in the other 30% of peanuts is gone from the product.  It is replaced by a lot of stuff that makes texture and flavor palatable (arguably).  Overall, the fat is reduced.  The fat in the peanut is the same, just fewer peanuts in the jar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
