		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are various methods, such as using computer models of stellar life cycles, but the most tangible way is simply that we know that other things that probably formed around the same time as the Sun were formed around 5 billion years ago.</p>
<p>It's likely that the entire solar system (the Sun and the planets) formed at roughly the same time, so to approximate the age of the Sun, we can take a look at the age of objects in our solar system.  The oldest meteorites we've found are approximately 4.6 billion years old, according to radiometric dating; round that up to 5 billion and there you have it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Earth rocks tell us the age of the Earth, finding the oldest meteorites tells us the age of the Sun, as those meteorites were formed at the same time as the Sun. When using the scale of hundreds of millions or billions of years, knowing that this took place around 5 billion is possible to estimate by comparing what we observe elsewhere in the universe as well.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We know the pattern of a stars make up as it ages, like wrinkles on a person, but much more accurately. The amounts of certain elements can be seen over time by observing the colour of a star. Our Sun has about half the amount of a chemical (sodium) in its outer layers than similar stars closer to death. We know that stars the size of our Sun last 10by, so know it must be about half way through its life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Im no documented science thing figurer outer but:</p>
<p>We know what the sun is made up of (probably very accurately).
We know what the sun does with the stuff we probably very accurately know it's made up of.</p>
<p>Working backwards using math that is probably only made up of letters and hieroglyphics, documented science thing figurer outers can provide us with a best guess of when it all happened.</p>
<p>There is room for error but on that scale 1% is the difference between dinosaurs walking the earth and the end of ww2.</p>
<p>There are various space goggles that have seen and are watching these things unfold to help these documented guys make &quot;corrections&quot; to or &quot;support&quot; the current math equation.</p>
<p>But again, this is just my guess of how it's done. Correct me if I'm wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sun and Jupiter formed from the same disk of matter.  Sun uses itself as fuel.  Differences between Jupiter and Sun show how long Sun has been burning.</p>
<p>ELI20:
We can type composition variances between the Sun and objects made from the same interstellar disk.  Jupiter is a fair example as it is far enough away that solar radiation has not caused large variations, and what variations exist can be accounted for through parameterization.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
