Human and apes are closely related,  yet if we don't have a haircut every once in a while our hair just keeps on growing and can become a disturbance. Why does human hair keep on growing?   Did it not cause problems for early humans that didn't have a way to cut it?</p>
<p>EDIT: First thing first, when writing &quot;apes&quot;, I meant &quot;primates&quot;. Secondly, a few responses to some of the comments: When saying hair &quot;can keep on growing&quot; I didn't mean forever, I meant that it keeps growing all the way to what seems to be an unpractical length (such as over 50cm which wouldn't be practical in an environment at which hair can get caught on stuff).</p></div></div>

<p>Why does human hair keep on growing?</p>

<p>It doesn't keep on growing forever. Like hair on the rest of your body, it will eventually stop growing, fall out, and start over.</p>
<p>Scientists don't know for sure why human head hair evolved to grow so long. It's possible that &quot;haircuts&quot; are actually the whole point - hair that requires someone else to groom it to look right can serve a social function, and hair can show status.</p>
<p>As for why it's on the head in particular, it could be because we walk upright, and that's where it does the most good to protect from the sun. (Or not, these are all just guesses people have made.)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>No, because we never didn't have a way to cut it. Cutting tools are probably older than long hair.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I doubt it got in the way much. People living and working mostly outdoors and having a very labor intensive lifestyle are going to have shorter hair due to sun and wind damage making it more brittle.  Breakage happens easily, especially if you are out stomping around in the woods looking for a moose to eat.  And as others have said, cutting it isn't impossible even without tools. A sharp piece of shale would a razor suffice.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Long lustrous hair down to the ass takes effort and resources;  out of the sun shelter, time consuming grooming and maybe some stuff to put in your hair - not to mention simple nutrition.  All of those are signs of success, especially back in our evolutionary crucible. And long hair as an outward sign success would be attractive to potential mates looking to ensure security for offspring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
