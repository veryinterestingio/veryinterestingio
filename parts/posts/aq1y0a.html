		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/APq2590" target="_blank">This cheat sheet</a> is a good very brief overview of what all the settings are.</p>
<p>The basic idea is this:  you want an image that is bright enough to see clearly, but not so bright that it's all white.  You have three knobs to control how much brightness you get.  Each affects the picture differently.</p>
<p>Shutter Speed:  Shorter times (like 1/2000) get you very little light, and longer times (like 30s) get you lots of light.  Shorter times also freeze action (because you're only gathering light over a very very short period, so nothing has time to move.  Longer times produce blur in anything that moves <em>even a tiny bit</em>.  Anything much longer than about 1/10th - 1/30th of a second, and you won't be able to hold the camera steady enough without aid (such as a tripod).</p>
<p>Sensitivity (ISO):  Lower numbers (like 100) mean less sensitivity, which means less brightness.  Higher numbers (like 6400) mean higher sensitivity, which means more brightness.  This is like boosting the gain on a microphone.  The more you turn it up, the more noise you get in your result.  Your image will look more &quot;grainy&quot; the higher you turn ISO.  It'll look like static is partially superimposed on your image.</p>
<p>Aperture (f-stop):  Lower numbers (like f/1.8) mean a wider opening and more brightness.  Higher numbers (like f/16) mean a narrow opening and less brightness.  Lower numbers (bigger opening) also allow more light that's coming in at odd angles, which will decrease how much of the image is in sharp focus (also called a &quot;shallow depth-of-field&quot;).  Higher numbers (smaller opening) will cause more of the image to be in focus together.  That cool &quot;portrait mode&quot; thing that all the new phones do with their multiple cameras is simulating the effect of a wide aperture (low number) -- where the subject is in focus and everything else is a creamy blur.</p>
<p>You pretty much always want an image whose brightest points are almost-but-not-quite 100% white, and whose darkest points are almost-but-not-quite 100% black.  You can play with these three adjustments in different ratios in order to achieve that, but you'll get a very different image depending on how you combine them.  That's the artistic part!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems that other users have covered shutter speed and aperture pretty well, so allow me to go into a little detail on ISO</p>
<p>Back when we used film, the film was covered in tiny grains of crystals which harden when exposed to light. If they dont get enough light to harden, they washed away when developed (blacks/underexposed), resulting in a clear portion of film. If they get too much light, they harden completely and cannot harden any more (washed out whites/overexposed). Hardened crystals do not wash away in the development process, resulting in an opaque portion of film</p>
<p>A bigger ISO number = a bigger crystal size. A bigger crystal is able to absorb more light (because they have a larger surface area), and so it needs less of it to become &quot;Exposed&quot;. However, the bigger crystals were more visible to the naked eye and made the images look grainy/noisy.</p>
<p>In digital photography, the crystals were replaced with pixels. The pixels dont get any bigger or smaller when you adjust the ISO, instead the image processor inside the camera takes the value of the output from the pixel and amplifies it. A photo with an ISO of 100 has its pixels amplified 100% more by the camera's image processor than a photo taken at ISO 50.</p>
<p>This would be fine and dandy, but electronic components do a funny thing when they have electricity run through them: they heat up. Not every pixel is created equally and one pixel might heat up more than its neighbors. As a pixel heats up, it becomes more and more sensitive to the light hitting it, resulting in a stronger signal which is then passed to the image processor. When the processor amplifies the signal, the already over-sensitive pixel is amplified even more. This is the digital noise created in high-ISO digital photography.</p>
<p>Because of this noise, if you are trying to produce the cleanest image possible, you want to use the lowest ISO possible. This is not a golden rule however, as the aperture and shutter speed also come into play.</p>
<p>Film grain and digital noise are not the exact same thing, but they work in similar ways. This isnt a complete answer, but I hope it helped you understand the basics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ISO refers to a standard (ISO 5800:2001) of how fast film responds to light. Digital cameras also rate their sensors using an equivalent system since that's what everybody knows.</p>
<p>Aperture is the size of the opening in the lens. A bigger opening lets in more light. Shutter speed is the amount of time the shutter is open letting light hit the film/sensor. You need to adjust all 3 of these so that your photo is properly exposed.</p>
<p>You probably want to start at ISO 100. Next you set your aperture or shutter speed based on the effect you want. If your shutter is open too long, anything that moves will be blurry. Maybe you want this if you want a bit of motion blur. If you want a crisp image then you want a fast shutter speed. </p>
<p>The bigger the aperture (which is actually a smaller number i.e. 2.8 is bigger aperture than 4) means less of your image will be in focus. Tiny aperture means everything in focus. Landscapes you probably want everything in focus. Portraits you probably want face in focus, everything else blurry.  </p>
<p>Once you know the range you want your shutter speed and aperture, if you can't get photo exposed properly, then it's time to change your ISO.</p>
<p>After auto, you probably want to try shutter priority or aperture priority mode. They will let you pick one of shutter or aperture which automatically adjusting the other of shutter or aperture to properly expose the photo. If it can't do it, you may need to manually change ISO. Higher (faster) ISO has more grain / noise than lower ISO, so you want to use lowest ISO possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Taking a picture is like filling up a bucket of water. The shutter speed is how long you keep the hose on. The aperture is how big the hose is. And the ISO controls how big your bucket is.</p>
<p>You don't want to overflow your bucket (over-exposed image) and you don't want to fill it too little (under-exposes image). You want to fill it about halfway.</p>
<p>So if you have a big hose (wide aperture) you need a bigger bucket (lower ISO) and/or only turn the hose on for a short time (faster shutter speed) in order to get the bucket filled just the right amount.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you have a small hose (narrow aperture) you might have to run the hose for a long time (slow shutter speed), or use a smaller bucket (higher ISO).</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Each of these decisions has trade offs in how the picture will turn out, but I don't know how to describe them as ELI5. Also, setting those values depends on available light, which doesn't really fit the analogy. The analogy works best if you assume you have constant lighting conditions, then figuring out what the settings should be can be done with some trial and error, which helps solidify the concepts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much everyone has given a good explanation of what the different parts mean, so just going to add this in as an extra tip. </p>
<p>One of the biggest changing points of my photography was learning about exposure. It took me way to long to learn that there’s a little meter that tells you how exposed a photo is going to be, and it saves you a hell of a lot of time taking photos and seeing if it’s what you want.</p>
<p>Find the exposure/light meter for your camera (google if you don’t know what it looks like) and it’ll help momentously. Once you’ve found that, it’s much easier to fiddle with the other settings to get the look you want. Best of luck! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
