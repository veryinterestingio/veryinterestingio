		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Starfish Prime was part of a larger series of high-altitude tests called Operation Fishbowl (a subset of Operation Dominic). As the researcher Chuck Hansen puts it pithily in his <em>Swords of Armageddon</em> (v2):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The purpose of the FISHBOWL program was to satisfy JCS requirements for weapons effects data about nuclear fireball transparency, growth and rise rates; intensity and duration of atmospheric ionization; missile RV structural response to thermal radiation; radiation flux measurements; electromagnetic pulse (EMP) effects and range; nuclear, thermal, and x-radiation output and effects; and radio and radar &quot;blackout&quot; effects (which would bear directly on antiballistic missile targeting and control). Knowledge of these effects was required to evaluate ICBM &quot;kill&quot; mechanisms and vulnerabilities; ABM effectiveness; communications and control; and the value of ICBM penetration aids.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the time, both the US and USSR were deploying anti-ballistic missile systems that would try to intercept incoming missiles at high altitudes with nuclear warheads, and used radio waves for communication and coordination of their forces. So understanding what would happen when a weapon went off very high above the atmosphere was important for this, especially since many of the effects of a nuclear weapon are somewhat different in versus outside of the atmosphere. And if you imagine lots of these things going off in the upper atmosphere, you get a picture of how &quot;messy&quot; it would be to try and detect incoming missiles and planes, and communicate outside of your home country, in the event of all-out war.</p>
<p>To highlight two of the most important of the above:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The &quot;blackout&quot; effects pertain to the fact that a high-altitude nuclear weapon will interfere with radar and radio. That means that there is a period after a weapon has detonated at that height that the radars on the ground can no longer see any incoming weapons. Understanding this is crucial if you are really trying to field a nuclear-armed ABM system, because every &quot;hit&quot; makes it harder for you to see any further, incoming missiles, and makes it very easy to defeat (just send a lot). </p>
</li>
<li>The electromagnetic pulse (EMP) was somewhat understood prior to these tests but Starfish Prime in particular highlighted its effects. Because it ionized the upper atmosphere, it produced a massive EMP effect over a very large area. This was of interest for a lot of reasons relating to both defense and attack strategies — if you are able to interfere with electronics on a large scale, that can be useful; if you have electronics you don't want interfered with in that way, you have to design them to be able to resist it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Starfish was an &quot;effects&quot; test — the goal was to see &quot;what happened&quot; not to learn about whether it would work or not. This is different than, say, Frigate Bird, which was a &quot;systems&quot; test (does the whole system work?) or the other tests in the Dominic series that tried out new warhead ideas (&quot;design&quot; tests).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main purpose was to test the effect of the electromagnetic pulse (EMP), which can affect much larger areas when the explosion takes place up in higher altitudes. The EMP was far larger than expected and affected Hawaiian islands more than 1000 km away from the launch point, damaging and destroying electrical objects like street lamps, which caused the public to become aware of this side effect of nuclear explosions.</p>
<p>Many more details of course on the corresponding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfish_Prime" target="_blank">wiki page</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>tl;dr We realized (unintentionally) that it's a terribly effective way to induce currents in our electrical infrastructure (e.g. frying all the power lines) and thus quickly agreed to stop, and learned a lot about our magnetosphere along the way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Various theories for the purpose of the test:</p>
<p>1) Assessment of the aerodynamics of a nuclear-armed missile with a live-fire test.  This isn't likely, as the cost of the warhead, the waste of the warhead for a test, etc., make this rather prohibitive that early in the US nuclear missile game.</p>
<p>2) Test the effects of a nuclear-based EMP at high altitude. This seems more likely, though the EMP created was far greater than anticipated, causing damage nearly 900 miles away. While the EMP of a nuclear blast was known at the time, the underlying physics were not well understood, likely resulting in a blast that pegged out the instruments.</p>
<p>3) Study the effect of fallout from a space-based blast. This might be another plausible theory, as fallout, particularly at such altitude, was poorly understood.</p>
<p>There are likely others, but it's difficult to discern given that the range safety officer destroyed the missile midflight under indications the missile, itself, was breaking up. If it was an aborted mission, the theory that it was a live-fire ballistic missile test seems plausible, despite the cost of using an actual nuke warhead (I'd have to look at the trajectory and potential weapons ranges in the ocean, though I doubt anything of that era would've been &quot;official&quot;).</p>
<p>Another theory that comes to mind is the investigation of the magnetic field of the Earth. The van Allen belts were theorized and discovered in the late 1950s, and Starfish Prime occurred in 1962, so it's reasonable to think the two might be linked, particularly as a nuclear deetonation would provide a significant mass of material by which to observe via aurora.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
