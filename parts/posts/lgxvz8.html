		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So it's not necessarily the cheese itself that makes you sick, rather the properties of the cheese and the types of mold growing. </p>
<p>Mold spores are all around us and on our food. When a mold spore lands on food it starts to grow little microscopic filaments called mycelia. These are sort of like roots. For very hard cheeses, these roots can't really penetrate into the cheese that well, so in general you can cut the mold away and eat the cheese with little worry of ingesting any mold. In the case of soft cheese, the roots are able to penetrate much deeper into the cheese and often will remain present in the cheese even if you cut away the visible mold. </p>
<p>Blue cheese - and other cheeses that are sold moldy -  is a special example of cheese that you can eat moldy. In the cheese making process, a particular type of mold (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/lgxvz8/eli5_why_can_you_eat_some_types_of_cheese_with/gmuapyb/" target="_blank">Penicillium roqueforti - a close member to the  mold we use to make penicillin</a>) is introduced into the cheese which is safe to eat.  This mold actually changes the texture of the cheese as well, making it more creamy. Importantly, the cheese makers also keep a close eye on the cheese during this process to make sure no dangerous molds are growing. Keep in mind, however, that even though it's safe to eat the mold in blue cheese, you should keep an eye out for any new smells or colors in cheese that's been in your fridge for too long because that can indicate the presence of  harmful molds taking over which may make you sick through the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/lgxvz8/eli5_why_can_you_eat_some_types_of_cheese_with/gmu543d/" target="_blank">toxins</a> they release.</p>
<p>Edit: Typos, and a couple of links to other comments for more info.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Since I only briefly said in the last sentence and didn't explicitly state/people aren't reading the linked comment: Some molds produce dangerous/toxic byproducts into its surroundings that make us sick when eaten, whereas others do not and are fine to consume. Because you won't know the type of mold growing on your cheese or whether its harmful it can be dangerous to eat moldy cheese that isn't sold moldy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many types of mold (aka fungus) that can grow on cheese, some types of mold are harmless while others can be toxic. In the cheese making process, the cheesemakers can tightly control the environmental conditions and encourage the correct type of mold to grow. If you get mold on a cheese that isn't meant to me moldy, it could be any type of fungus and potentially a harmful one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The type of mould that makes a blue cheese blue is different from the type of mould you will find in a lump of Gouda left in your fridge for too long.</p>
<p>Some mushrooms are safe to eat, while others are hugely dangerous and will kill you if you eat them - mould is the same. Blue cheese is made in such a way as to grow certain types of good mould, while the stuff that appears naturally in your fridge is the bad stuff that can make you ill.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the type of mold. Different molds produce different waste products. The waste produced by the mold in blue cheese isn't toxic to us. The waste created by other types of mold are toxic to us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
