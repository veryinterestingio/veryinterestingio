		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of this has to do with pricing policies. There are variations to these depending on the manufacturer, but at the core of pricing you have 3 ways to go: Competitive pricing, MAP pricing, and MSP/UMRP pricing.</p>
<p>Competitive means there is no defined minimum price a retailer has to abide to in order to sell a product. The only thing the retailer has to ultimately worry about is their margins and their competition's pricing.</p>
<p>MAP means Minimum Advertised Price. Different companies have their own rules for this, but it basically means a retailer can't advertise for a price lower than what the manufacturer dictates. The retailer can, however, sell the item at a lower price, so long as it is not made public.</p>
<p>MSP/UMRP means Minimum Sale Price or Universal Minimum Retail Price. This means that the retailer not only can't advertise lower than what the manufacturer dictates, but they also can't sell lower than that price.</p>
<p>Automotive manufacturers are usually either using Competitive or MAP pricing. Pair that with many car salesman working on commission, and you have a high chance of being able to negotiate price. The salesman wants the commission, and they have the price structure that allows them to reduce the price for you.</p>
<p>For standard retail stores, all of the products they sell could have any of those 3 pricing structures, so they technically could sell at least some of it for lower than the sale price. They don't have incentive to do it, though. Their employees more than likely aren't being paid by commission, margins may be too tight to budge, and chances are they have more than enough customers willing to purchase at the sale price that the few who aren't really don't matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Computer equipment has such a small profit margin that there isn't any room for a discount.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Car dealerships in the US are legally required middle men, and as such cannot be undercut by manufacturer direct sales. This means that they can increase their margins on sales. on top of this Car salesmen make commission on sales, and as such have a reason to reduce the sale price to get the sale. basically car salesmen donâ€™t expect people to just pay full price, but the price being lower due to haggling is a way to entice the buyer who thinks it is an exclusive 1 time offer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say a shop buys an item X for 80 USD and wishes to sell it for 100 USD in order to gain a 20 USD margin.</p>
<p>With a fixed price (100 USD), the buyer is certain whoever will buy it will spend 100 USD. This is &quot;good&quot; because gains are more predictable, but can be &quot;bad&quot; because it cuts potential buyers who would buy that at a slightly lower price (like 90 USD).</p>
<p>When you allow haggling, the seller may get more customers, but gains are less predictable and potentially very low if the original gain margin was not so high. If the original margin is 20 USD and you allow haggling, you could accept a customer buying your item at 90 USD, maybe because otherwise you would lose that customer, but your margin is now 10 USD.</p>
<p>If the lowering in margin can be balanced by an increase in customers and/or people buying at more than the original price, it can be reasonable to allow haggling. </p>
<p>There are also strong social and cultural differences. In many non-Western countries, haggling is not only acceptable, but a long-standing tradition and it seems &quot;weird&quot; not to. This is because haggling is supposed to show &quot;good faith&quot; and &quot;trust&quot;, in a way.</p>
<p>Also, you'll find that, generally speaking, haggling only works in &quot;small&quot; shops, when the number of buyers is comparatively similar to that of sellers. </p>
<p>In a modern Western supermarket, you have maybe 1 cashier for 10-20 people. There's no time and resource to negotiate prices with everybody. </p>
<p>In a bazaar-like market, 1 seller deals with maybe 2-3 people at a time, at most. Because of the different scales, and because (again) those cultures and societies tend to work more &quot;slowly&quot;, it is acceptable to negotiate prices every time. You're not &quot;in a hurry&quot; every time you buy something, so you can try to negotiate something good for you.</p>
<p>In fact, if you think about it, even in the West negotiable prices are often associated to goods (houses, paintings, cars,...) which are not bought very often, and which see a small-ish amount of customers per seller/cashier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
