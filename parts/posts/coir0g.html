		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's not a ton of empty space in there.  Your torso is a fairly efficiently packed bag of organs, and your arms and legs are just solid chunks of meat with bone, and blood vessels included. </p>
<p>You're so well packed that when we start messing with things it can cause problems.  My mom had a partial hysterectomy in her 30's (removed a problematic uterus).  As a result things shifted around a bit, and other organs put pressure on her bladder.  End result, she'll pee herself a bit when sneezing, or moving around to roughly (lots of jumping).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the thoracic cavity, basically your lungs and heart fill the entire area, with a bit left over for your esophagus, windpipe and aorta. It's an enclosed area with no air or anything inside; in fact, getting air inside can be potentially life-threateningly dangerous. This condition is known as pneumothorax. In the off case that air can get in but not go out, your lungs would be compressed by the extra air and you would literally be unable to breathe. This case is known as a tension pneumothorax. The emergency treatment is to poke another hole open so that the pressurized air can flow out until you can get further treatment. Not fun.</p>
<p>As for the abdominal cavity. There's a fair bit of intestinal fat surrounding your organs and cushioning them, as well as another structure made of fat called the &quot;omentum&quot; which drapes over them like an apron. There are quite a few ligaments and other tissue holding everything together, and of course a few layers of membrane and muscles to keep it all inside. But aside from that, there's not much room for anything else. So little room, in fact, that when laparoscopic surgery is done, we need to pump in CO2 so that we can actually see anything. People have a surprisingly large amount of intestines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
