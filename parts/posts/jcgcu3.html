		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we cry, everything tenses up. Our vocal chords are just little flaps of tissue that get vibrated by air coming through our throats, and we tense them different amounts to get different pitches. The tone of that pitch is then heavily influenced by mouth/tongue shape and general mouth/nose/sinus structure. If your whole face and upper body is tense because you're upset and crying, you just can't control all those fine muscles like you usually would. We tend to have higher pitch due to more tension in the vocal chords and a different tone due to widening and flattening of the mouth when your cheeks pull back while crying.</p>

<p>Your breathing isn't really as steady as it normally is when you're crying and it's a bit harder to control (especially a really hard cry). So when you suddenly suck in air while trying to talk you mess yourself up</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Crying in humans is the display of physical or emotional distress. Your body undergoes several reactions when you cry, not just having tears come from your eyes. Your voice tensing up is part of that.</p>
<p>It's advantageous for our species to have evolved this way. Since we are a social species that relies on communal cooperation to survive, it's beneficial to have as many outward signs of distress as possible so that the other members of our tribe can pick up on these cues and  react to them or assist us (if possible).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
