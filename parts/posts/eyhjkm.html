		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On the contrary, it seems that the kind of weather you want for the maximum number of ticks to die is <em>cold and clear</em>. Snow provides an insulating cover, and causes temperatures near the ground (where ticks hibernate) to stabilize near the freezing point. Without snow cover the ground can get much colder, especially in the night.</p>
<p>Cold weather and limited snow during winter have been linked to poor tick survival (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hans_Dautel/publication/311097269_24_How_an_extreme_weather_spell_in_winter_can_influence_vector_tick_abundance_and_tick-borne_disease_incidence/links/5a8bdcdc0f7e9b1a955608c5/24-How-an-extreme-weather-spell-in-winter-can-influence-vector-tick-abundance-and-tick-borne-disease-incidence.pdf" target="_blank">source 1</a>; <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ian_Barker/publication/15590063_Survival_and_Development_of_Ixodes_scapularis_Acari_Ixodidae_Under_Various_Climatic_Conditions_in_Ontario_Canada/links/5858b4ab08aeabd9a589fad7/Survival-and-Development-of-Ixodes-scapularis-Acari-Ixodidae-Under-Various-Climatic-Conditions-in-Ontario-Canada.pdf" target="_blank">source 2</a>) as well as to lower prevalence of tick-borne diseases (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673600052508#bib11" target="_blank">source</a>).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak so much on the germs side but for ticks a good cold period (numerous days at or below 10°F) will kill off many which would result in a smaller population in the spring.
While this cold does kill some off, some ticks are active all winter long (deer or blacklegged tick) which means one should always be careful of the possibility being bitten by a tick.</p>
<p>Edit 1: you asked about snowfall. The ticks are more concerned with temperature rather than snow. It is important to note that snow can act as an insulator.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s not snowfall specifically, just a decent period of cold enough temperatures that keeps tick and other insect populations (like fleas) under control. When it doesn’t get cold enough they can stay active all winter, leading to a larger population come spring than they’d have otherwise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the reasons why the forests of Western North America have been ravaged by the mountain pine beetle (which is endemic) is that they were kept under control by winters where there was sustained -30C for at least a week. Thanks to climate change that rarely happens, so the beetles have been expanding like crazy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A cold winter will kill most ticks, but actually allow germs to reproduce and sustain themselves on the ground due to the overall temperature being more stable under an insulating blanket of snow than under the conditions of a chs5nging temperature of exposed ground that happens during day/night.</p>
<p>However, as the cold kills off ticks during the winter, it will cause a boom in population during spring and a more constant population during summer, meaning it's hard to observe a noticeable difference as when ticks appear more often, that's when the population stabilises again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
