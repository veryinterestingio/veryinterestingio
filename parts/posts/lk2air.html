I wonder why we should prevent our body to cough, even if it allows us to get rid of some virus. I understand that it slows down the spreading of the disease, however I don't understand, from an evolutionary point of view, why this feature was kept. If it is so disadvantageous, why would this trait survive ? If it's advantageous, why do we suppress it ?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Coughing does aid in clearing the airways of particulate debris and mucus. It is a reflex mediated in part by the vagus nerve (CN X). However, coughing is violent and forceful and too much can be detrimental. </p>
<p>In many respiratory viral illnesses, the skin lining the airways is a target and port of entry. These skin cells can slough off the airways and mix with mucus and get coughed out of the lungs. However, when the skin sloughs off, it can expose nerve endings called J-fibers. These J-fibers can stimulate more cough, leading to more skin cells sloughing off and more exposed J-fibers and the process builds on itself in a positive feedback loop. </p>
<p>Additionally, coughing can be so violent that a person can break ribs, dislocate joints, suffer a pneumothorax or pneumonediastinum, or any number of unintended consequences. </p>
<p>Suppressing cough is typically done for comfort, and to allow the skin lining to calm down and heal after a viral illness, and to prevent any unwanted sequelae from uncontrolled cough. </p>
<p>Cough suppression is not without risk however, and can put a person at risk for secondary bacterial pneumonia or any number of other lung diseases. The choice to treat cough is a risk vs benefit calculation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Evolution does not have a purpose. </p>
<p>Coughing was likely re-enforced in the past due to an advantage in some circumstances (but not all). Many traits have negative consequences that are re-enforced for unrelated reasons.</p>
<p>It is easy to see what a peacock carrying around a huge tail would get in the way for hunting or fleeing but at some point, it became a thing for peahens to want it so there it is.</p>
<p>Coughing is pretty essential when you breath in water and any other time you cough may be  just the reaction from that trait developing. Or not, we really are just guessing although we can often figure out an advantage to some trait in which case we assume that helped re-enforce it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If there's something new tickling the back of the throat then a good cough reflex is a great thing. It's all about airway protection. Nothing should have gotten past the epiglottis down near the vocal folds, so let's create a big old squeeze and a forceful push of air to get rid of it. Protects the lungs. This is a good idea, and keeps you alive. Things in the lungs lead to infection and the blocking of things you would rather not have blocked. </p>
<p>The 200th time it happens that day though, well there wasn't likely actually something down there that woulda caused damage to the lungs, instead what's now happening is just repeated forceful events at the layrnx. And they can be really damaging AND self-reinforcing. A cough causes damage which causes sensation in the throat which makes the person feel the need to cough again... and so they again slam their vocal folds together and...</p>
<p>It causes all sorts of voice problems and growths, we don't want it to become a habit. </p>
<p>A cough or two is good.
200 is damaging, and in a vicious-cycle that can cause yet more damage and more coughing...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cough is a response mechanism of our body normally. But if it is due to disease for example bacterial infection(bordetella pertussis which can lead to whooping cough), need to suppress it. The excessive, continuous cough leads to increase in intraabdominal pressure which can leads to many consequences such as abdominal hernia or rupture vessels (e.g. berry’s aneurysm) . I mean if cough is due to disease which disturb daily life activity, it’s needed to suppress. For more info, should read medicine textbooks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
