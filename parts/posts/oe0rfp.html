		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The air would get thin enough that the rotor couldn't produce a greater force of lift than the weight of the helicopter, at full engine power. Either that or the engines would get starved of air, again, because it's too thin, and they wouldn't be able to produce enough thrust to counteract gravity. These two effects complement each other, and they determine the service ceiling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of two things can happen:</p>
<p>a) The amount of oxygen in the air gets low enough that the engine cannot maintain combustion and stalls out.</p>
<p>b) The density of the air reduces enough that the blades cannot rotate fast enough to produce more lift meaning you cannot climb any higher.</p>
<p>Which will happen first depends entirely on how the engine is designed, and both happening would be almost impossible as you'll run out of oxygen before you run out of lift, or you will run out of lift before you run out of oxygen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Air is a very thin fluid that the helicopter blades push against. If the air is too thin, there’s not enough to push against, it can’t go any higher. Plus, like any engine, it uses oxygen in the motor’s gasoline burn. No air, engine won’t fire. I can’t tell you how high up it is, but my understanding is you can’t fly a helicopter to the top of Mt. Everest. (Someone will tell me if I’m wrong.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>All the comments are right-ish. </p>
<p>The air isn’t “thinner” it is less dense. The density of air is what allows all aircraft to fly. More density=more lift, less density= less lift. </p>
<p>In order to compensate for the reduction in lift, the pilot adjusted the pitch of the blades, increasing the angle of attack (the angle at which the rotor blade meets the incoming force of wind. More pitch, more lift.) if nothing else changed after increasing pitch, the rotor would slow down and the helicopter would not climb. So… we need more power now to overcome the increased drag. </p>
<p>That brings us to the second aspect: engines need air to combust for power. Not enough air density, means less power. </p>
<p>So, at a certain point the amount of power required to overcome the increased drag to produce the needed lift is not possible. This can lead to engine stall, or a condition known as “settling with power” at low air speeds. </p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the limiting altitude is not going to be based on altitude above ground level (AGL) rather mean sea level (MSL), which is more like a measurement of air density set against a constant and is based on temperature and humidity, as well as barometric pressure. </p>
<p>A great example is the Everest landing mentioned by one of the commenters. That same helicopter can’t make that same landing anytime, under any conditions. It has to have a “Goldilocks” environment for that to be accomplished—best pressure, best temp, best winds, best humidity gave them the conditions necessary to make that landing. Also, that helicopter was likely reduced to its bare minimum weight. No more fuel than was absolutely necessary, no bags, one pilot, I wouldn’t be surprised if they removed some seats as well, though I can’t say for certain without looking up that event. </p>
<p>As far as how high can they go? It’s relative to the conditions, but typically anything around 10,000’ MSL is pushing the limits of your average helicopter. </p>
<p>It’s been awhile since I’ve been an active pilot, so forgive me if some of this isn’t exact.</p>
<p>Edit: some spelling</p>
<p>Edit again: Dense, or thin. It isn’t a big deal. I’m just using the technically correct term because it’s what we’re taught in flight school. Density is the measure of the mass of anything (air in the instance) divided by the space it occupies. Thin is, thin. We know what it means, but it isn’t a measurable term.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
