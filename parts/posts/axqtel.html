		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can do this, and we do. It's call desalination. The process you describe is called distillation desalination, and historically was the only way to turn salt water into drinking water. However, this is getting less and less common these days. Now it is mainly done by &quot;reverse osmosis&quot; where pressure is applied to sea water to drive it through a special filter that separates the salt from the water.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The reason these technologies are not more widely used is because they are expensive. Obviously distillation desalination requires you to boil water, when we're talking gigalitres of water a year, this means a lot of electricity is needed. Reverse osmosis isn't cheap either. You have to pump the water to develop pressure, and the reverse osmosis membranes are always getting fouled and damaged. Roughly speaking, the highest efficiency desalination plants make water at about 10x the price of rain water collection. That is why desalination is somewhat rare (though more common than a lot of people think) and is only used in large amounts in very dry places. Australia, for instance, is extremely dependent on desalination for drinking water, and the large desalination plant in the world operates in Saudi Arabia. </p>
<p>EDIT: I'm having lots of complaints from Australian. If your city's backup supply of water is desalination, you are dependent on it. Australia has some of the highest desalination capacity per capita in the world. The are huge plants in three states. I never said they supply your daily drinking water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Israel actually does a lot of desalination, 55% of their water now comes from the sea. 70% of their drinking water is from desalination (from a different article).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sun deposits about 1000 watts of energy per square meter at the earth’s surface on a clear day.  At 1000 watts it would take about 96 straight hours (give or take a week of sunny summer days) to boil a cubic meter of seawater from a relatively warm 65F with perfect efficiency.</p>
<p>The price for 1000 watts in an expensive coastal location like California is about $0.20/hour.  That means it would cost about $20 to boil one cubic meter of water.  But you’re not gunna get perfect efficiency in any system, so the price is probably a few multiples of that.</p>
<p>California uses about 38 billion gallons (144 million cubic meters) of fresh water per day.  Meaning it would cost about $3 billion per day minimum, and realistically probably closer to $5-10 billion just in electricity, to meet the state’s needs through boiling seawater.  Or more than the entire state GDP ($2.5 trillion) per year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There were two methods to create fresh water from seawater on US Navy submarines. One of them was to heat the water with the low-pressure waste steam from the ships main turbines. It didn't actually &quot;boil&quot; per se, but it was heated enough to give off a water vapor, which was then condensed by a heat-exchanger that was cooled by 55F seawater, from 200 feet down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can, but it takes a lot of energy to do it. There's another method for removing salt, called reverse osmosis, that takes a bit less energy (still a fair bit, mind), but it requires more expensive equipment than boiling water does.</p>
<p>It's much easier to filter and sanitize dirty freshwater. Basic filtration can be achieved with natural materials like gravel and sand, and a single gallon of bleach can sanitize a thousand gallons of filtered water (as one example. There are a multitude of other ways to kill pathogens in clear water). Most first-world countries use more advanced versions of this method, and it's easy to implement even in remote areas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
