Then I took a long break. Now I'm trying to organize my notes, which are in disarray, and I want to make sure that I get everything essentially accurate.</p>
<p>I know that thermal energy contained within an object will be released in the form of electromagnetic radiation. And I know that as the temperature of an object increases, the spectrum of wavelengths emitted by that object will also change. But I'm not completely sure what the relationship is between temperature and emitted wavelengths.</p>
<p>I assume that hotter objects will release more high-energy wavelengths than colder objects - so for example, if Object X and Object Y are made out the same material, and Object X releases ultraviolet radiation, while Object Y doesn't release anything with a higher energy level than infrared, then I would assume that Object X is hotter than Object Y. Would that be an accurate assumption on my part?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you say is correct: the number of photons emitted at a given frequency will increase with the temperature. The physical picture is that a hotter object has more energy, and thus the particles forming the body 'shake' more vigorously. Since these particles are charged, and shaking charges radiate light, the particle emits electromagnetic radiation. The more energy to shake, the faster the charges shake, and the higher the frequencies of the emitted photons.</p>
<p>More technically, the thermodynamic statistical fluctuations in the atomic motion induce (in thermodynamic equilibrium) fluctuating electric dipoles across the body. The exchange of energy between the atoms and the surrounding electromagnetic field occurs through these dipoles and can be calculated using the Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem.</p>
<p>I don't want to extend this, but if you're interested, this phenomenon is still the focus of research in fundamental physics, as it drastically changes for very small objects or for objects out of thermodynamic equilibrium. I can provide more info about this if you like, it's a fascinating area of physics. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a distribution of light emitted. At higher temperatures the curve is broader, taller, and has its peak shifted towards higher frequencies. The curve is given by:</p>
<p>B = 2hf^2 / (c^2 * (e^hf/kT - 1) )</p>
<p>B = spectreal radiance (how much light is emitted)<br />
h = Planck constant<br />
f = frequency of light<br />
k = Boltzmann constant<br />
T = temperature of the blackbody</p>
<p><a href="https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/BlackbodySpectrum/" target="_blank">Here's a little online demo of how the curve changes</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In SI units, this is (wavelength in meters) = 0.0029 / (temp in Kelvin).</p>
<p>The actual distribution of radiation vs wavelength is, as others have said, given by the blackbody distribution</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you're looking for is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien%27s_displacement_law" target="_blank">Wein's law</a>. Increasing temperature causes more energetic emissions, but the intensity of emissions increases at all lower wavelengths. It's like building a pyramid in that it takes a huge number of blocks at the lower levels to support the one block at the top. If we want to increase height at the top we have to add more blocks below. So, in order to increase emissions at the high end of the spectrum we have to increase emissions at the low end to a far greater degree in order to drive the temperature higher. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
