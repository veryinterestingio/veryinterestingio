<p>Hello Reddit, I'm <a href="https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/hannah-rumble" target="_blank">Dr Hannah Rumble</a> from the Centre for Death and Society at the University of Bath. I've been researching funeral practices and attitudes to death and the disposal of corpses via (direct) cremation and (natural) burial for 14 years. I'm here to talk about any of these and more, in relation to the current global Covid-19 pandemic. My qualitative research has mostly been conducted in Britain, but as a social anthropologist by training I am interested in cross cultural comparative practices and values also.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi there, thanks for doing this! I'm guessing that there will or already is a large increase in the number of virtually-attended funerals during the current pandemic. My question is on whether or not there has been any research into the emotional/psychological variation for people due to this virtual attendance versus being able to attend a funeral in person. I realize that's kind of broad and quite possibly unknown thing that has been looked at, and for what I am thinking of I'm going to guess that there probably aren't a lot of studies on the impacts during a pandemic unless perhaps there's information from the Spanish Flu era (or maybe there's been a rise in virtual attendance before COVID-19 anyway?). But, there are always people who simply cannot attend a funeral generally and I'm wondering if there is some known difference in the grieving process just due to a difference inability to find closure or not in being at a funeral in person.</p>
<p>If I may also ask one more (if this is outside of your area then please feel free to ignore!), do people handle the impact of someone dying in relation to a large group versus an isolated event? That is, during mass tragedies (natural disasters, wars, etc.), is there some difference in how people grieve just on the basis of the person who died being part of a larger tragedy or not?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Should societal views on managing end of life radically change? (Note: This is focused on aging and late stage health decline; not accidental or sudden events)</p>
<p>I’m in the US and I have seen the unexpected stresses of my family managing (or mis-managing) aging family members final days (sometimes months or years).</p>
<p>Typical human stressors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is responsible for what?</li>
<li>What’s an emergency vs. a natural decline?</li>
<li>How long might it take and is there anything we can do to comfort?</li>
<li>How much time and money to spend?</li>
<li>Should they be at home or facility?</li>
<li>What about all their stuff? Is there a Will?</li>
<li>Should friends be allowed to share the same time?</li>
</ul>
<p>I can go on and on. The hardest part of it all is the helpless feeling of an archaic situation that is controlling your every decision, rather than a carefully coordinated set of events that lead to a comforted end.</p>
<p>Interested to know whether you have an opinion on the typical end of life events... should it be upended, transformed and reintroduced to society?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
