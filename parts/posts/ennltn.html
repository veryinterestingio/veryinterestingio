		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The key with most radiometric dating techniques is that you are dating the time at which the system becomes closed, i.e. you have a parent isotope that decays to a child isotope, but the child isotope doesn't accumulate in a target material until something changes. </p>
<p>Let's take the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium%E2%80%93lead_dating" target="_blank">U-Pb</a> system in the mineral zircon for example. Uranium (either 238 or 235) that is incorporated into zircon is decaying to lead (206 or 207, respectively) at a fixed rate (though the decay rate for U-238 and U-235 are different), but until the zircon cools below a certain temperature, the lead is diffusing out of the zircon at a rate such that it would appear to have a zero age (i.e. there is no Pb 206 or Pb 207 accumulating in the zircon). This temperature is often referred to as a 'closure temperature'. In the case of U-Pb in zircon, the closure temperature is essentially the same as its crystallization temperature, so the U-Pb age of a zircon is (generally) the crystallization age of the zircon. </p>
<p>For other minerals and other radiogenic systems, that's not the case, so a date from those systems will indicate the time at which a mineral cooled below a given temperature (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermochronology" target="_blank">thermochronology</a>). To further illustrate our point, let's consider a different system within zircon, the <a href="https://www.geo.arizona.edu/~reiners/Reinersetal2004.pdf" target="_blank">U-Th/He system</a>. The closure temperature for this decay system is ~150-175 degrees C, so if we have a zircon that crystallizes out of some magma it will lock in its U-Pb age at this time (the closure temp of U-Pb in zircon is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0009254100002333" target="_blank">~900 degrees C</a>), but will not lock in U-Th/He age until it cools below 150-175 C. If that zircon was then heated again, above 175 C the U-Th/He age would 'reset', i.e. the helium would diffuse out returning the U-Th/He age to zero as there is no child isotope stored in the mineral, but the U-Pb age would stay the same (unless the zircon was remelted and then recrystallized).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In simplest terms, they aren't dating the isotope alone, they're dating the ratio of that isotope to the things it decays into.  When the rock solidifies from magma, that's when the decay products can no longer escape and start to build up inside the rock.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different elements have different chemistries which mean they do not crystallise together, instead one element will be separated from others when crystals form from magma or solution.</p>
<p>As a simple example, uranium eventually decays to lead which means that U-Pb dating is a standard method of dating rocks containing reasonable amounts of uranium. When the rock forms, uranium is concentrated in certain minerals, but the chemistry of uranium is sufficiently different from that of lead to ensure the crystals containing uranium initially contain essentially no lead.</p>
<p>We have to assume that the crystal is ‘closed’ - that is no atoms can leave or enter the crystal. As time passes some of the uranium atoms in the crystal will decay into lead. A crystal that once contained no lead will accumulate lead at a fixed rate from the decay of uranium. Essentially, dating requires finding a suitable crystal and measuring the proportion of lead to uranium.</p>
<p>There are many complications, essentially if the crystal is not closed - it might be cracked which would allow water to enter the crystal or it can be reheated sufficiently that the products of decay can escape - all of which will throw off the dating. This is a real problem for dating where the decay product is a gas such as the popular potassium argon method. </p>
<p>For this reason, geologists love rocks containing the mineral zircon which often concentrates uranium, is immensely tough and closes at very high temperatures which means that it can survive pretty much everything short of complete melting.</p>
<p>Selecting suitable crystals can be really challenging and involve lots of crushing, cleaning and picking out individual crystals by hand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are different part to that question. For one, not all radioactive isotopes come from super novae. Let's look at the probably most-known dating method, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating" target="_blank">14C-Dating</a>. The key idea behind that is the fact that the earth is constantly bombarded by cosmic rays, &quot;carrying&quot; Neutrons. If those neutrons then hit a 14N-Atom, atomic fission (yes, more or less the same process like that in fission reactors) happens. As a result you get a 14C and a proton (therefor; more or less like in fission reactors). The assumption is now that more or less every living organism accumulates a define concentration of 14C in their body during their lifetime (there are actually changes in the rate of production of 14C and stuff and we can calculate that but this would be too much right now). Now, with that assumption we can then (of course correction have to be made for possible contamination and such; it's not that one just takes a sample, determines the amount of 14C and is happy) take a sample, measure the amount of 14C and then look at the appropriate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life" target="_blank">half-life</a> graph (exponential graph) of 14C and then the age can be calculated.<br />
Another example for that would be <a href="https://ams.arizona.edu/beryllium" target="_blank">10Be</a>, which can also generated in the atmosphere and can be used to date sediments (e.g. <a href="https://www.geochronology.net/1/1/2019/gchron-1-1-2019.pdf" target="_blank">Balco et al. 2019</a>).  </p>
<p>Edit: in the paper there the 10Be was actually not &quot;produced&quot; in the atmosphere but in the ground. Thanks u/CrustalTrudger for pointing that out.  </p>
<p>So then, but what about metamorphic or magmatic rocks? Surely, atmosphere-generated nuclides play no role for that. Therefor, other factors are at play here. u/CrustalTrudger explained basically the whole issue that is considered here. In addition to that; not every element likes to go into each mineral. Instead, the &quot;ability&quot; of an element to get incorporated into a crystal is described by the partition coefficient (works kinda similar to the acid dissociation constant in application). Let's look at an example here. As you can see <a href="https://earthref.org/KDD/e:38/" target="_blank">here</a>, the partition coefficient (from now &quot;D&quot;) for the element Sr is &gt;1 for the mineral Plagioclase (a Na-Ca-feldspar mixibility series) in many instances. Meaning, when plagioclase crystallises from a magma, it will incorporate Sr. The element <a href="https://earthref.org/KDD/e:37/" target="_blank">Rb</a> however shows D-values &lt;1 for plagioclase( meaning, rather then being incorporated into the mineral, the element will more often stay in the liquid magma than going into the crystal). However, the D-value is &gt;1 for Biotite, a K-bearing mineral, meaning Rb can be incorporated into Biotite, whilst D for Sr in Biotite is mostly &lt;1. Now; 87Rb decays into 87Sr. That means that we have to know the initial composition of the magma source (we can do this by using chondrites and infer the possible ratio of Rb/Sr [we don't know the exact ratio, but we know the ratio &quot;good enough&quot;]) in a melt. From that we can then e.g. measure the amount of 87Rb and 87Sr in our biotites via mass spectroscopy and then calculate the age of the rock, since the Rb decays into Sr and therefor their ratio will change over time.</p>
<p>Ok, then. I hope that this was not too complicated and I did not made any grave error in describing the concept. If so; go for it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When rocks solidify they have parts with higher concentrations of one element than another. As time goes by, these different parts of the same rock decay differently. By measuring different samples of the same rock and plotting them in such a way that the slope  contains the half-life and time, you can solve for time. This is called the isochron method. </p>
