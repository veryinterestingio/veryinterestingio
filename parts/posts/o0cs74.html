<p>That image is from high resolution Hubble imagery, but those galaxies are big enough and close enough that they aren't too hard to see. I found them using the 'worldwidetelescope' <a href="http://worldwidetelescope.org/webclient/?wtml=http%3A%2F%2Fwwtcoreapp-data-app.azurewebsites.net%3A80%2Fwwtweb%2FShowImage.aspx%3Fra%3D53.1266361292%26dec%3D-27.8031323267%26x%3D640.0%26y%3D390.7836419073964%26scale%3D0.74515395805994%26rotation%3D250.32%26name%3DGOODS%2BSouth%2BField%26imageurl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fesahubble.org%252Fmedia%252Farchives%252Fimages%252Fscreen%252Fheic1620a.jpg%26thumb%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fesahubble.org%252Fmedia%252Farchives%252Fimages%252Fthumbs%252Fheic1620a.jpg%26credits%3D%26creditsUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fesahubble.org%252Fimages%252Fheic1620a%252F%26wtml%3Dtrue#/place=Open_Collections.GOODS_South_Field.0&amp;ra=3.54558&amp;dec=-27.86169&amp;fov=0.02498" target="_blank">here</a>. (Yes, that is a giant url)</p>
<p>That gave me the RA and Dec coordinates, which I used to search the objects on Simbad <a href="https://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-coo?Coord=03+32+44.17+-27+51+42.5&amp;CooFrame=ICRS&amp;CooEpoch=2000&amp;CooEqui=2000&amp;CooDefinedFrames=none&amp;Radius=2&amp;Radius.unit=arcsec&amp;submit=submit+query&amp;CoordList=" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>What I found is there are <em>two</em> active galactic nuclei (AGNs) listed there. <a href="https://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=%405449606&amp;Name=2XMM%20J033244.0-275140&amp;submit=submit" target="_blank">This one</a> and <a href="https://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=%40655192&amp;Name=CXOCDFS%20J033244.3-275142&amp;submit=submit" target="_blank">this one</a>. To tell if they're at the same distance, we look at the redshift or radial velocity, which is 0.2781 for one and 0.281 for the other, which is pretty close.</p>
<p>An AGN is produced when the supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy is accreting a lot of gas and has a really bright accretion disc, bright enough to give off a lot of light and heat up the gas around it. They <em>may</em> be triggered by merging, because the gas get stirred up by all the crazy gravitational forces and tends to fall towards the black holes.</p>
<p>They are overlapping galaxies at the same redshift, and both are AGNs, so it does look like they are merging. Of course, at a redshift of z=0.28, we're seeing the galaxies as they were about 3 billion years ago, so they should be merged by now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
