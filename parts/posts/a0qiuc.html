First of all, martial law is established in 10 regions of 27 - ones bordering Russia, Transnistria (territory of Moldova occupied by russian forces), Black or Azov seas. Country's capital, Kyiv, is not affected. Second, it will last only 30 days and cannot be prolonged without approval of Parliament. That means elections will not be postponed: election campaign starts at 31 Dec and election day is at the end of May. This decision was approved by 2 non-coalition parties, including party of president's main rival, Tymoshenko, who currently is #1 at polls. Tymoshenko herself supported the decision too.</p>
<p>For civilians, currently there will be no restrictions, unless russia will start full-scale ground operation. Financial sector will continue work as usual, even IMF will not stop any cooperation. Airports will not stop working and people won't be denied of entering/leaving the country. On the contrary, railroad will give priority to army etc, when it will be needed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Martial law</strong> is the imposition of direct military control of normal civilian functions of government, especially in response to a temporary emergency such as invasion or major disaster, or in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_occupation" target="_blank">occupied territory.</a></p>
<p>It means the military, not a civilian police force, is in charge of internal security and policing.</p>
<p>Martial laws are imposed in times of crisis, when there is a fear of widespread revolts, civil unrest, invasion from a foreign country or other disaster that would threaten public order.</p>
<p>Martial law can be enacted by Totalitarian states as a way to suppress dissent or crush political opposition without judicial interference, or by any state in a situation where public panic or unrest could cause massive destruction or loss of life, ie city-wide riots or ethnic violence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was reading on this earlier, and my interpretation of what was reported was that the declaration of Martial Law for Ukraine was a preemptive measure.  Apparently this is somewhat of a martial law “light” declaration.  It doesn’t mandate the full curfew and government takeover that a normal declaration would, and doesn’t go into effect until the Soviets proceed with a land invasion.  Ukraine doesn’t want to be messing with paperwork to declare martial law as the ruskies are marching across the lawn.  With the land grabs of the past years and the recent ship seizures though, it appears that the Ukrainians feel this may be eminent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Martial law means normal laws are put aside. This greatly increases the power of the state and weakens protections of ordinary citizens.  </p>
<p>It can mean the state can seize property. Take direct control of radio, TV, and newspapers. Jail people without trial. Execute people without trial.  Restrict free travel. Commander vehicles  Suspend or cancel elections.  </p>
<p>It's a dangerous and desperate measure for desperate times.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
