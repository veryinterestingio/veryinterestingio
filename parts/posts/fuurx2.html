It would depend on why the person is obese. You can become obese without having those disorders the same way you can become underweight without having anorexia.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You’re comparing apples to oranges. </p>
<p>Being overweight isn’t necessarily an eating disorder. Neither is being underweight. </p>
<p>However, there <strong>are</strong> several disorders that can lead to either being over- or underweight (anorexia is one such disorder). </p>
<p>Or, to put it another way: being obese isn’t necessarily an eating disorder, but it can certainly be the result of one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your weight/weight loss behaviors are only parts of diagnosing anorexia and bulimia.  One key part of anorexia/bulimia is a disordered body image that drives those behaviors. For example: believing you're massively overweight to the point of delusion when you're actually skin and bones. This is common in a vast majority of folks with those conditions.</p>
<p>On the flip side, it's not really common in overweight folks - by and large, they're not out there saying, &quot;I'm so tiny! Must eat more to be a healthy weight!&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they aren't the same. You can be obese without having a mental problem. You can also be underweight without being anorexic. Food addiction is an eating disorder iirc, and can lead to obesity. Anorexia is an eating disorder that can lead to being underweight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
