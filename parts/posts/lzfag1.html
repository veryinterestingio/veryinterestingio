		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just looked it up to try to understand. Peppers and hot sauce have a chemical called capsaicin. Capsaicin is <del>water soluble</del> , which means it can mix into water and get carried around your mouth. It also interacts with a special protein in the nerves of your mouth that is designed to sense heat. So the nerves send &quot;hot&quot; signals to your brain, even though the food isn't hot.</p>
<p>Wasabi and horseradish don't have capsaicin, they have allyl isothiocyanate. Unlike capsaicin, allyl isothiocyanate tends to form a vapor. So instead of mixing around in your mouth, it floats up into your nose.</p>
<p><em>Edit</em>: I have some errors about capsaicin. Broad points still stand</p>
<p>Edit 2: I love that I just googled this and got a ton of credit</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your tongue has cells (neurons) with proteins that sense heat. But there are several different proteins that can sense heat. One protein is called TRP-V1, and the other is called TRP-A. They both do the same basic thing, they sense heat and tell your brain &quot;this part of the body is hot!&quot;.</p>
<p>Hot peppers and and wasabi both trick the proteins into thinking it's hot, when it's not. But they each activate a different protein. Hot peppers activate TRP-V1, and Wasabi activates TRP-A. So you get a similar sensation, but slightly different, because these proteins are found in different parts of your mouth and nose. there's a lot more TRP-A in your nasal cavity, so you feel the wasabi in your nose a bit more. the stuff in Wasabi is also more volatile, so the vapors get up in your nose more.<br />
Cinnamon, by the way, activates both of them, but not as strongly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
