I overheard a coworker the other day say he didn't agree with forcing people to be vaccinated because the only pose a risk to themselves by not being vaccinated. I just want a way to rebutle his claim in a rationale way, or just to understand better myself. Thanks! </p></div></div>

<p>The best argument, though, in my opinion, is that  herd immunity, the prevention of outbreaks by limiting the number of potential hosts, protects babies too young to be fully vaccinated.  Babies are also far more likely to die from many of these diseases, be it whooping cough or just the plain old flu.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everybody brings up the &quot;herd immunity&quot;, which is fine. But there's another, an even more disturbing thing - unvaccinated people allow the illness to survive and mutate to a new form against which the current vaccine might be ineffective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They're needlessly taking it onto their children who are unable to make an informed decision. It's an important distinction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely yes.  Got hit with whooping cough (multiple people in the family did) a while back.  It could have killed my daughter, who was too young for the vaccine at the time.</p>
<p>I was vaccinated against it, but it generally wears off over time.  Same reason you often have to take your pet in every year for a rabies vaccine.  Tetanus lasts something like...7 years I think.</p>
<p>In the case of whooping cough, the very young can't get the vaccine and the disease has a good chance of killing them.  Once you can get the vaccine it protects you for quite a while.  As an adult it is not likely to kill you, but you can spread it to infants who can't be vaccinated or children who have issues with vaccinations.  And kill them.  Kill them.</p>
<p>Edit:  And sometimes vaccines just don't take.  The immune system is weird.  As an example, I am one of the rare number of people who got chicken pox twice due to the fact that my immune system fought it off the first time but didn't develop the antibodies long-term.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>unvaccinated masses cause multiple risk vectors.</p>
<p>first they pose the grievous risk of new mass outbreaks, causing terrible drains on society with lifelong care after things like polio ravage them for life.</p>
<p>secondary, they give vaccine preventable afflictions new grounds to infest, breed, and mutate within, potentially creating newer strains not preventable by vaccination.</p>
<p>both of these problems are vastly more awful than the 1/1000000 times a vaccine causes ill effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
