		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have several nuclear powered spacecraft. The most common kind us RTG (radio-isotope thermoelectric generators). A piece of enriched material (usually plutonium) is left to naturally decay. That material is naturally hot. That heat is then harvested usually with thermoelectric generators (relying on the Seebeck effect, like thermocouples and Peltier coolers) and dumped into external radiators.</p>
<p>This has been used for decades, principally on missions to the outer reaches of the solar systems like Voyager, Pioneer 11 and 12, Cassini, New Horizon and even the latest batch of Mars rovers Curiosity and Perseverance (set to take off in less than a month). They were even used during the Apollo missions to power some of the experiments they left on the Moon. <a href="https://cdn10.picryl.com/photo/1969/11/19/as12-46-6789-apollo-12-apollo-12-mission-image-alan-bean-unloads-alsep-rtg-6d7118-1600.jpg" target="_blank">Here you can see Alan Bean on Apollo 12 unloading it from the LEM.</a>. The advantage of those is that they are relatively simple. They have no moving parts and nothing really that can break down. However they don't generate that much power compared to how much they weight, especially compared to solar panels. So if you can get away without using those it's often better.</p>
<p>The second type of nuclear power in space is to have a real reactor, like the ones you find in nuclear power plants of submarines. Those needs to go critical and require control systems, and much more complex engineering. However they can (in theory) generate much more power for a given quantity of material. The US experimented with those first in 1965 with the SNAP-10A spacecraft but never flew any other reactors after that.
The Soviet were a lot more prolific with nuclear reactors in space. They launched 35 RORSAT spacecraft. Those were low flying radar satellites which tracked US naval movements. The nuclear reactors were used for powering the high power radar system. One of the most notable story associated with that was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_954" target="_blank">Kosmos-954 incident</a> where one of those reactors reentered above Canada and sprayed radioactive debris everywhere.</p>
<p>The USSR also developed an even more powerful TOPAZ reactors in the 80's which were coupled with electric plasma thrusters for propulsion needs.</p>
<p>The issue with real reactors (as opposed to RTG) is that they require a lot of complex auxiliary systems (control, cooling, energy generation). So small ones are hard to make and they really only become interesting in larger systems which are expensive and not needed often.</p>
<p>Since then there has been several other proposal and research projects for nuclear reactors in space. <del>JUICE</del> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_Icy_Moons_Orbiter" target="_blank">JIMO</a> was a proposal for a massive mission to Jupiter where a reactor would be providing power to ion thrusters. This got canceled after going pretty far into development.</p>
<p>Lately NASA has developed the Kilopower reactor which is a small reactor aimed at providing power for things like lunar and martian bases primarily but can be adapted for use on board spacecraft (IIRC).</p>
<p>Of course this is only for nuclear reactors used to produce electricity. There is also a whole other branch of technology where the heat for the reactor is directly used for propulsion. I can expend a bit on it but this is a bottomless pit of concepts, more or less crazy ideas, tested systems and plain science fiction concepts. A really good ressource for that kind of topic is <a href="https://beyondnerva.com/" target="_blank">https://beyondnerva.com/</a> which goes over historical designs and tradeoff in great depth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tangentially, there was work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_Nuclear_Propulsion" target="_blank">Nuclear powered aircraft</a> as well. An interesting artifact of this work can be <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@35.8987544,-84.3009342,991m/data=!3m1!1e3" target="_blank">found outside of Oak Ridge, Tennessee</a>. There two towers still rise up over the surrounding hills. The towers were used to test shielding for nuclear reactors, by suspending the reactors 200 feet over the surrounding landscape. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gschweiger/43142591050/lightbox" target="_blank">My image</a> of the towers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You may be confusing <em>fuel</em> and <em>propellant</em>. Many spacecraft use nuclear fuel for their powerplants. But simply generating power will not make you move around in space -- for that, you need propellant. Here is a summary from <a href="http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/misconceptions.php#notpropellant" target="_blank">Atomic Rockets:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a rocket, there is a difference between &quot;fuel&quot; and &quot;reaction mass.&quot; Rockets use Newton's third law of Action and Reaction in order to move. Mass is violently thrown away in the form of the rocket's exhaust and the reaction accelerates the rocket forward. This mass is of course the &quot;reaction mass.&quot; It is sometimes also called &quot;remass&quot; or &quot;propellant.&quot;  </p>
<p>The &quot;fuel&quot; is what is burned or whatever to generated the energy to expel the reaction mass. For example, in a classic atomic rocket, the fuel is the uranium-235 rods in the nuclear reactor, the reaction mass is the hydrogen gas heated in the reactor and expelled from the exhaust nozzle.  </p>
<p>There are only a few confusing cases where the fuel and the reaction mass are the same thing. This is the case with chemical rockets such as the Space Shuttle and the Saturn 5, which is how the misconception started in the first place.  </p>
<p>Automobiles, airplanes, and boats are sizable vehicles with relatively small fuel tanks. Not so rockets. An incredibly powerful rocket might approach having half its mass composed of reaction mass and the other half structure, hull plates, crew members, and everything else. But it is more likely that 75% of the mass will be reaction mass. Or worse. Most rockets are huge propellant tanks with a rocket engine stuck on the tail and a tiny crew habitat stuck on the top.</p>
