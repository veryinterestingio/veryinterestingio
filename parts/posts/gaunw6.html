The heyday of quasars was a long time ago. The peak of quasars corresponds to redshifts of z = 2 to 3, which is approximately 11 billion years ago (or 2 to 3 billion years after the Big Bang). They were thousands of times more active than they are now. But what does 'now' mean, in terms of relativity? When we observe quasars 'now', we look back in time, and thus see how they were a very long time ago. So aren’t all quasars in the universe already gone?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We do need to be clear on what we mean by &quot;now&quot;. There are two potential sources of confusion here - one physical, and one semantic.</p>
<p>In terms of physics, there is no universal &quot;now&quot; - different objects experience time at different rates, and events that are simultaneous from one perspective may not be simultaneous from another perspective. <em>However</em> in practice this is actually a very weak effect, and is only really significant in very strong gravitational fields and/or at very high speeds, unless you're taking extremely precise measurements. When we look at distant galaxies and quasars, we don't have to worry about this too much, except if we look at a very tiny region around the supermassive black hole in the centre of the quasar. But overall, the light was emitted in the past, and after millions or billions of years has reached us, so we are indeed seeing the galaxy or quasar as it was millions or billions of years in the past. Within some small error, most things in the universe do take place in a roughly simultaneous frame.</p>
<p>But by <em>convention</em> we tend to talk about events happening at the time we see them happening. This is not really true, and this doesn't come from General Relativity. It's simply a shorthand for describing what's going on without getting tongue-tied - especially when you don't actually know how far away the object is. So we might say &quot;Betelgeuse is getting brighter now&quot; or &quot;this quasar is dimming now&quot;, but we really mean that the object changed at some point in the past, and we're only seeing it now. This is just semantics and conventions of speech, and doesn't mean that the event is happening &quot;now&quot; in any physical sense. Every different General Relativistic point of view will agree on this - the light was emitted before it was observed.</p>
<p>So, yes, the cosmic high noon of quasars (and also star formation) was at a redshift of 2 or so, about 10 billion years ago. The universe has a lot less free gas around to fuel quasars (and star formation), so there are fewer quasars than there used to be.</p>
<p>But there's still <em>some</em> fuel. It's not enough to power many quasars, but quasars are only the most powerful active galactic nucleus - the only difference between an active galactic nucleus and a quasar is that we only count the brightest active galactic nuclei as quasars. They're the same thing, but bigger. And there are many active galactic nuclei within the local universe - i.e. within a hundred million light years or so, which is like &lt;1% of the age of the universe. There's even some genuine quasars only about a billion of so light years away.</p>
<p>So yeah, the most exciting time of the universe when it was full of quasars (and lots of bright young stars) is indeed in the past, but there's a bit of a tail of activity still going on. It's just not quite as dramatic as it was in the old days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>3C 273 is the closest record quasar to the Milky Way which is several billions of light years away. Thus, the existence of this object is several of billions of years old. We have not discovered a quasar closer than 3C 273 which strongly suggest that they are a remnant of the past.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;There isn't any way we can possibly get the information any faster, so trying to wrap your head around the speed of causality is just going to give you a headache. Things are much more fun if you just ignore that and pretend things are happening as we see them.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The Quasars we have seen or hypothesize have happened in the past. However, as other users have pointed out, the exist in our observational timeline despite occurring x amount of years in the past. These are just the one’s in the observable universe.</p>
<p>With better technology and observational technology, we are learning that there is the possibility of different big bangs far past our observable universe in the far reaches of space. This means there are regions that are on a different “timelines” that can easily have active quasars that are beyond our observational capacity. However, these entities are so far away, they might as well be hypothetical.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
