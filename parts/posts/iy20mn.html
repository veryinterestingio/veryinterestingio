		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The old equipment is gone. It was inefficient, unsafe, and didn't have to contend with things like all the space debris and satellites that orbit the Earth now. We have much better technology now, good enough to allow astronauts to spend more time on the Moon. So we'll get more bang for our tax-payer buck.</p>
<p>Also, NASA research very often benefits humankind in areas outside of space travel. So allowing them to develop new tech is usually a good investment in the future here on Earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically speaking we don't. However, technology has improved, and off the shelf parts that were used in the 60s are no longer available.  We can make Pretty much everything lighter, more reliable, and better than we did before. </p>
<p>Just to put into perspective how far we've come, the computer that landed us on these moon in the 60s was 32kg, and had ~45 kilobytes of storage, and ran at ~2MHz. The average phone today is less than 3% of the weight,  has 250,000 times the storage (assuming 16GB storage), and runs 1500x faster (assuming processor speed of 3GHz).</p>
<p>We may not <em>need</em> to redesign, but the flight computer example alone should indicate why it's a good idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The major expense in &quot;designing&quot; a new rocket isn't in actually designing the rocket.  That's easy to do.  Its building the equipment that you need to build the rocket.</p>
<p>You can't just go out into the jungle in Ghana, hand some dude step by step instructions on how to build a rocket engine, and expect that you're going to get anything built.  Building a rocket engine requires a lot of machinery and without that machinery you can't even begin to get started on it.  </p>
<p>On a basic level you need things like lathes, presses, cranes, and all of the other stuff that you need to work with metal and plastic.  That stuff is <em>mostly</em> generic int that you can just buy it off the market.  But even the generic stuff is expensive and some of this equipment will need to be custom made, which is even more expensive.</p>
<p>Imagine, for example, that you need a really big crane.  But nobody else needs cranes that big so nobody else can build cranes that big.  Now you need to build all of the equipment to build the really big crane and then throw all of that equipment out when you're done because you're the only person that needed a crane that big so once the crane is built, the equipment becomes useless.  With a huge rocket there is going to be a lot of equipment like that and its all really expensive to build.</p>
<p>Then you're going to need things that have been specifically made for this particular project, such as molds and dies.  Every single piece on the rocket needs its own mold or die, so you're going to end up needing millions of them and all of this has to be custom built.</p>
<p>Then once you've got all of this shit made you need somewhere to put it, so you're going to have to go out and build at least 1 new factory, probably more.  Then you're going to need a way to transport this shit from the factory(ies) to the assembly station to the launchpad.  Again, the equipment needed to transport this all needs to be custom built.  And as before, if there's no factory that can build a rocket carrier then you need to build <em>another</em> factory for that and all of the equipment in that factory.</p>
<p>So why can't we just use all of this stuff from the Apollo Program?  The answer is that this equipment isn't just immensely expensive to build, its also expensive to maintain.  When they shut down the Apollo Program they made the decision that they were never going to use that equipment again so they sold it for scrap to avoid having to pay for maintenance on otherwise worthless equipment. </p>
<p>Deciding to rebuild a Saturn 5 rocket wouldn't save any money because you still need to rebuild all of the equipment needed to build the rocket, and that's the main source of the &quot;design&quot; costs that you see quoted to build a new rocket.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, there have been 60 years of advances in material science since they started working on the Apollo program. Those advances allow you to use better, cheaper materials and the cost savings from that more than offset whatever minimal amount you save from not having to duplicate some of the old engineering work on the rocket itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically we can. But we will achieve nothing by doing so. The goal now is not just to go to the moon, plant a flag, take a few rocks and return. If we want to do new experiments or to build a base we need to send much more equipment than was sent on previous missions. And to do that we need much more efficient rocket, we can't just make it bigger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apollo astronauts took risks that wouldn’t be acceptable today. Some essential systems had no backup at all, due in part to the tight weight limits they were operating under. </p>
<p>One example is the ascent system used to leave the moon. If that had failed to ignite for any reason there was no backup and the astronauts would have been stranded on the moon with no chance of rescue. </p>
<p>While space exploration will always be a risky endeavour, it’s unthinkable that we’d send out a mission now with no contingency for such a major system failure. Hence we need to find a new way to do it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
