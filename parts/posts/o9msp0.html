		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't it be better for the body to just stockpile ATP rather than store energy as triacylglycerol?</p>
<hr />
<p>Edit: my best guess is that ATP is less energy dense than fats, so if you kept making it you'd inflate like a balloon. I'm also thinking that maybe we don't have enough adenosine to be using it all up on excess ATP, so it makes more sense to just constantly recycle a small quantity than it does to stockpile it. Am I on to something here?</p>
<hr />
<p>Edit 2: Figured I'd update my question with some of the reasons as they've been explained to me, as well as some I found through subsequent consideration &amp; reading. There are a lot of reasons, it turns out. Some of them contribute more than others. </p>
<p>Firstly, it seems a portion of my hypothesis was correct to an extent. ATP is less dense than storage molecules, too unstable to be held long-term, and far too reactive to exist without being exhausted unnecessarily, causing a host of cell processes to proceed without inhibition. It also cannot be easily transported to other tissues, unlike energy-rich molecules such as glucose. Lastly, an intracellular accumulation of ATP would cause an increase in osmotic pressure that could potentially result in cell lysis if there were sufficiently high levels. It's also possible that the synthesis of ATP is regulated to some extent by equilibrium points (likely upstream of ATP synthesis). Also, the body needs storage molecules for reasons aside from simply storage. For instance, the synthesis of triacylglycerols, adipose tissue, NADPH, ribose sugars for nucleotide synthesis, and de novo biosynthesis of cholesterol requires precursors, electron carriers, and cofactors that would otherwise be consumed or absent if ATP synthesis were to proceed uninhibited. These perform functions beyond just energy storage, such as insulation for the body or the structure of the cell membrane. Also, some reactions utilize other energy carriers such as cAMP, Creatine Phosphate, AMP or Glucose 6-phosphate which would otherwise be unavailable if ATP synthesis proceeded non-stop. The last reason would be the heat produced from non-stop ATP production causing a dangerous fever in the human body, reminiscent of drugs such as 2,4-Dinitrophenol which causes the mitochondrial membrane to &quot;leak&quot; protons forcing the cell to work harder to undergo oxidative phosphorylation. </p>
<p>I'm sure there's a multitude of other reasons.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few reasons. Firstly, ATP is very easily hydrolyzed to ADP and inorganic phosphate (deltaG of about -31kJ/mol), so it would not be very feasible to store it in large amounts in the cell. It is more efficient and effective to store &quot;energy&quot; in other biomolecules such as glucose, which is then stored as glycogen. The reason glucose is stored as glycogen is related to another reason ATP is not stored in excess: osmotic pressure. Large amounts of glucose and ATP will increase the osmotic pressure of the cell and cause it to burst if there are too many of these molecules. As for other answers, I will have to look at the very many other reactions in the cell that involve ATP hydrolysis, but you are correct that several other vital processes other than oxidative phosphorylation may be disrupted or inhibited with the increase in ATP.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it's also worth noting that ATP is a highly charged molecule. it has 4 negative charges on it.<br />
So a buildup of ATP^(4-) will throw off the electrochemical gradient (membrane potential) of the cell membrane. at the very least it would require the cell to pump some kind of counter-ion (probably Magnesium) into the cell to balance the charge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey! I'm a doctor who loves to geek out about biochem, and I'll try to contribute some thoughts. First, things that have already been mentioned - a good storage molecule for energy is something energy dense and not osmotically active, like glycogen and fat. ATP is none of the above - it's a relatively big molecule for carrying around just two high energy phosphate bonds. Its energy density is 0.014 kcal/g, glucose is 4 and fat is 9. It's no easy task to make a nucleotide, and to have extra ATP you need extra adenosine, which is metabolically expensive. An analogy would be individually packaging your cheerios one by one. Creatine phosphate is also a backup for muscle cells, so there is some extra energy stored there.</p>
<p>ATP and its partially phosphorylated counterparts act as hormones for biologic processes such as vasodilation (more AMP means you're using up all your ATP, so let's get some more oxygen to those tissues). Increasing concentrations of ATP would alter the regulation of innumerable metabolic and physiologic processes, as all things in the body are controlled by <em>concentrations</em> of molecules.</p>
<p>And finally, by some of your posts it looks like you are chugging your way through some of the toughest basic science topics of undergrad, and I applaud you for being so inquisitive. The bad news is that you are learning things right now in incredibly simplistic context, and while asking questions is great, the answer will often be your intro courses just aren't going to teach you what you need to know to answer them. Sometimes it's a relief to understand you're being fed digestible bites of knowledge from a planet-sized gob of science pudding that we don't understand very well. </p>
<p>Sorry for the food metaphors, I'm really hungry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I haven’t seen anyone mention it yet for some reason… </p>
<p>Cells must regulate oxidative phosphorylation to ensure there is minimal reactive oxygen species generated. Continued oxphos in times of plentiful ATP can create imbalances in the ETC and membrane potential of the mitochondria that create conditions to generate lots of ROS leading to cellular damage.</p>
<p>Furthermore it’s important to look at the upstream pathways and not just oxphos in isolation. Yes overall the delta G of glycolysis is negative, but specific steps require an input of energy (from ATP) and it wouldn’t make sense to continue to make ATP when there is an abundance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason is the same reason why ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is used for energy: it’s unstable. ATP is used by the body for energy by being dephosphphorylated (removes a phosphate) becoming ADP (adenosine diphosphate). ATP by itself is rather unstable because of the three phosphate groups being very negative and very close to each other. This allows it to be used as a tool to give up one of the phosphate groups to a protein as needed (phosphorylation, the “on switch” for tons of proteins), the breaking of this unstable bond provides the energy needed. Think of the bond like a stick being bent: there’s lots of pressure and energy being built in the stick until it finally breaks, releasing the energy.
This aspect makes it perfect for giving proteins energy as needed, but the molecule won’t stay stable for long. Thus, the body stores energy before it is converted to ATP, either in the form of glycogen (long chains of glucose molecules for short term storage, much more stable) and triglycerides (long term storage).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
