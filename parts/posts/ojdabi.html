		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ear canal is s-shaped. Sometimes water gets stuck beyond the bend. To get it out, you do not need all the fancy things people are saying, just pull your ear back and up to straighten the canal, and turn your head to let gravity do the work. For young children the ear should be pulled down and back for the same results. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surface tension. Also the &quot;tube&quot; has a slight ridge on the bottom of it most often which also makes it more difficult to break the surface tension.
Alcohol will interrupt the surface tension.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Please never put anything in your ear on purpose besides your finger unless you know what you are doing. Yes, this includes q-tips/cotton swabs. It takes so little to damage your ear drum and it just sits there all exposed way closer to the outside than most people realize. Donâ€™t temp fate after reading this either by pushing your finger too far.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water can remain trapped in the ear for any number of reasons, including a narrow ear canal or because it's trapped by something inside the ear canal, such as excessive earwax or another foreign object. If you have even just a little bit of wax in your ear canals, the water can mix in with the wax or get stuck behind it, making it very hard to drain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of the inside of your ear like a straw with only one open end.</p>
<p>If you get some water in the straw, it's hard to get it out, because the water blocks incoming air, and with no air to take the place of the water, the water's not moving.</p>
<p>The advice to shake your head, or pull your ear back, is to try and shift around the insides of your ear canal just enough to let some air get past the standing water.  Once that seal is broken, the water will flow right out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
