		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the cellular level, concentration gradients are critical for cellular function. Saline is isotonic with human blood, meaning that it has roughly the same concentration of salt and water in solution as blood does- so there is effectively no difference between the two.</p>
<p>This means saline doesn't disrupt those concentration gradients by sucking water or electrolytes out of your cells or forcing them in. This is great for wound irrigation, since you can wash away dirt and bacteria without damaging your cells as they heal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Salt and water don't actually cause wound healing directly. It just keeps the wound clean and stops it from drying out. Basically it provides an ideal environment for the wound to heal as opposed to healing the wound. Salt is mixed with water, at a very specific ratio, because otherwise the cells would have their own ratio of sodium to water disrupted which would lead to saturation, dehydration and electrolyte imbalances in which case so long good wound healing environment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water flushes out anything bad- exudate or debris.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The small amount of salt makes sure that healing tissue isn't damaged.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Not enough salt makes cells absorb the water around them until they burst like an over-inflated water balloon.  Too much salt makes them shrivel up as they lose water.  9% Saline solution is juuuust right where the cells neither gain nor lose water.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The solution in itself doesn't promote healing in any way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
