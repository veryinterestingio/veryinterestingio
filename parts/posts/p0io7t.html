		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have to write academic papers about your research.  If your paper sucks, the other physicists make fun of you.  This is called “peer review”.  If you keep publishing papers that everyone else mocks, then the university figures out you aren’t a very good theoretical physicist, and they fire you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ol>
<li>Are you bringing in grant money that they can charge overhead to. Getting that grant money requires you to be publishing so there's motivation to keep doing that.</li>
<li>Are you teaching?</li>
<li>Are you doing any committee work for the dept or university?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that universities don't have managers that micromanage professors and their research. They don't really care for the short-term output, as meaningful research takes place on the order of weeks to months, even for a theorist. Practically speaking, profs are also typically well-motivated to produce results; for universities, these results are in the form of things like grant funding, which require publications to get. So if the prof does their work, they get publications out, and the university eventually sees that as funding, prestige, etc. </p>
<p>There are times in which profs do end up coasting, and the university won't really catch a whiff of that until they run out of funding and/or get graduate student complaints.</p>
<p>Finally, profs also do (typically) have some administrative or teaching responsibility, in which they do have harder set deadlines for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
