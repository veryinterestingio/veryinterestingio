		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Birds have efficient lungs, they have air sacs connected to the lungs and oesophagus, when they breath their lungs and sacs get filled with oxygen and when they breath out the spent air in the lungs leaves and the sac air goes into the lungs giving them a double dose of oxygen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar-headed_goose" target="_blank">bar-headed goose</a> has several mutations/adaptations that allow it to fly at altitudes in excess of 20,000’.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Birds have an incredibly efficient respiratory system that does a great job at oxygenating the blood. They also have a system of air sacs located in their hollow bones, which essentially act like little oxygen tanks for long, high-altitude flights.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They have a combination of air sacs and countercurrent exchange, the former giving them a boost to oxygen with each inhale and keeping a high oxygenated “uptime”, and the latter improving temperature and respiration by helping maintain an equilibrium throughout the body</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some geese are known to cross the Himalaya! They actually have a form of hemoglobin that has a higher affinity to oxygen and this can &quot;grab&quot; oxygen from somewhat lower partial pressures of oxygen than we can. The rest ist just pure awesomeness of geese in general...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
