		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I highly suspect that the sources you are referring to are talking about the temperature of the equivalent blackbody of Hawking radiation emitted from the black hole rather than the internal temperature of the black hole.</p>
<p>So, you might know that black holes emit a black body spectrum at their event horizon. This has a characteristic temperature that is inversely proportional to mass (basically it is 10^23 / Mass(in kg) K) such that a solar mass black hole would have a temp of ~ 10^-7  K. This inverse mass relationship is the reason why only tiny black holes ever exhaust themselves from Hawking radiation.</p>
<p>The internal temperature though is a different story. Maybe it makes no real physical sense to talk about it, certainly within the singularity itself the pressure and temperature are unrelated (same as in a white dwarf or neutron star), especially since it is obviously not observable...however, in the frame of reference of a cloud of gas falling in, it is clear that the gas will compress and heat up, eventually becoming degenerate matter, asymptotically approaching infinite temperature as it approaches infinite density.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Temperature is largely an irrelevant metric of the internals of an event horizon.</p>
<p>At a simple level, the escape velocity associated to the gravitational acceleration inside an event horizon exceeds C, the speed of light/causality. Since the force carriers - photons, gluons, etc - of the fundamental forces are also limited to C, nothing inside an event horizon can have any true volume, as force carriers cannot sustain a transfer of energy/information across a distance when our current understanding of gravity and space time allow for a case in which force carriers, which have momentum, must all act towards the singularity.</p>
<p>As an aside, this is effectively the space time dilation effect of general and special relativity, but within the parameters that exist within an event horizon.</p>
<p>Singularities are called singularities because they exist as a single, volume-less point because of this &quot;insufficient escape velocity&quot; issue - though modern understandings model them as 2 dimensional rings within spinning black holes. With no volume or particle-particle interactions, temperature is immeasurable.</p>
<p>Good question though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When talking about black holes, the &quot;temperature&quot; of the black hole is essentially a measure of the energy of the radiation it emits i.e. we treat it as a black-body and find the temperature that way (the name isn't really related as far as I know). You can similarly measure the temperature of stars by looking at the spectrum of emitted radiation. </p>
<p>In the case of black holes, however, the interior can't affect the outside, and we don't really have a theoretical model for what happens in there. So when we talk about the temperature of the black hole, we're actually talking about the temperature it would have if it <em>was</em> a black-body (which from an outside perspective, it may as well be) given the radiation it emits, and not necessarily the temperature <em>inside</em> the event horizon.</p>
<p>The radiation emitted by a black hole is actually dependent on its surface area; as a result, smaller black holes are actually &quot;hotter&quot;. Since black holes are created from collapsing stars (and big ones at that) they tend to be large enough that their black-body temperature is close to absolute zero. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something else that people aren't talking about is the compression of matter <em>before it cross the event horizon.</em> For many supermassive black holes, the matter and gases that fall into a black holes doesn't fall straight in but instead spiral around in tight and degrading orbits. The mass does compress to the point of fusion (really hot) which is one of the reason why supermassive black holes actually emit a lot of light. </p>
<p>This is a very simplistic description, but you are generally right. Matter compresses and gets really hot generally speaking before crossing the event horizon. As for what happens inside the event horizon, other comments cover this subject.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
