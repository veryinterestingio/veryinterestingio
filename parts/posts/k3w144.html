		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is more of a physics question.</p>
<p>The beverage is a solution of carbon dioxide, various flavorings, and some kind of sweetener. The beverage is pressurized, which is important because the solubility of gases increases with increasing pressure. This means that the beverage has more gas dissolved in it in the closed state than it could hold if it were at atmospheric pressure in the open state. However, gas coming out of solution is not instant and takes time (which is why carbonated beverages take many minutes to become flat). The main way to speed up the dissolution of the dissolved gasses is to introduce nucleation sites or bubble formation. Both of these are somewhat related. Starting a bubble is hard. For a bubble to form, it has to break the surface tension/adhesive forces of the liquid. Growing a bubble is a lot easier than starting one since the surface tension component is proportioal to the bubbles surface area where as the bubble grows with volume (and volume is proportioal to the amount of gas within the bubble). This means that as more gas goes into the bubble, it's easier for the next one to go in.</p>
<p>When the beverage is shaken, tiny bubbles form (that are for the most part formed irrespective of dissolved gasses). Since you've introduced a bunch of bubbles, when the beverage is opened, all the dissolved gas has an easy &quot;exit point&quot; and can go into all the existing bubbles. So all those tiny bubbles in the closed beverage rapidly expand when the beverage is opened, leading to the violent eruption.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before the carbonated beverage is opened, there is a layer of high pressure CO2 sitting on top of a layer of water containing dissolved CO2 (and sugar, flavours etc). When you shake it up, instead of the two layers being neatly stacked on top of one another, bubbles of CO2 will be dispersed through the liquid. You can see this kind of effect with a regular clear water bottle if you shake it up, though the bubbles do not persist for as long and are air not (just) CO2.</p>
<p>When the container is opened, the high pressure CO2 which was previously contained is now free to expand, to equilibrate to atmospheric pressure. In the case where it was not shaken up, the gas layer on top escapes through the opening without any fuss, and you just hear a hiss. If it was shaken up, the top layer escapes, but then the bubbles of gas dispersed through the liquid are also free to expand. As they do so, some liquid will be carried through as long as the bubbles do not immediately collapse. The harder it was shaken, the smaller the dispersed bubbles will be, which leads to a greater amount of foam carried through the opening (surface area/volume ratio).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
