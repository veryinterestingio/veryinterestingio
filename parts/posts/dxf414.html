<p>Honey lasts nearly forever and remains safe to eat. There's no negative survival consequ3nve of having more, but having less has an obvious danger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Beekeeper here.  Bees make honey to help give them food energy through periods when there is not a nectar flow, like during winter and dry times of the summer.  A small hive will not make much honey, a medium hive will make some honey, and a large have will make a lot of honey.  A large hive that is full of honey will likely swarm and make more hives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bees don't actually eat much honey. They usually eat  nectar or something they make called &quot;bee bread&quot; (and some royal jelly for the baby bees). They will eat honey if they need the food of course, but it is not their primary source of food. Honey is mostly for swarming.</p>
<p>When honey bees  are doing well enough, the queen lays eggs, one of which will become the new queen and inherit the hive. Except for a few bees left to care for the new queen, all of the other bees leave to set up a new hive at a pre-scouted location. This is called swarming. </p>
<p>Honey then, is the high calorie travel food of bees. Its like bee trail mix. It basically never spoils, so they save it up for when they swarm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
