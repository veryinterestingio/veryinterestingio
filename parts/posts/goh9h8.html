		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can do real NASA science right now, from your own home. Just join one of NASA's citizen science projects! From projects designed to study our planet's biodiversity, to studying the sun, comets, and finding planets outside of our solar system, our citizen science projects harness the collective strength of the public to analyze data and conduct scientific research. NASA-funded citizen science projects have engaged roughly 1.5 million volunteers and resulted in thousands of scientific discoveries and numerous scientific publications. For information on current our citizen science projects, visit <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/citizenscience" target="_blank">https://science.nasa.gov/citizenscience</a>. Most projects require no prior knowledge, experience, or special tools beyond a computer or cell phone. And don't worry if you didn't study science in school; these projects aim to teach you everything you need to know.</p>
<p>We are here to answer your questions! Ask us about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why NASA needs your help</li>
<li>How you can conduct scientific analysis and discoveries</li>
<li>Which project might be right for you</li>
<li>What you can expect when you become part of NASA's citizen science team</li>
<li>Citizen science successes stories</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll be online from 1-3 p.m. EST (10 am to noon. PST, 17:00-19:00 UTC) to answer all your questions! </p>
