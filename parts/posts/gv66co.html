		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think our feeling of time is well understood at all.</p>
<p>Like we know that some drugs drastically change the subjective passage of time from feeling like time stopped when someone is smoking salvia even though the effects only last for under 5 minutes.</p>
<p>So I reckon that the simply stress put on your body and brain by staying awake too long works in a similar way.</p>
<p>Especially if you are bored as well as disrupting your circadian rhythm.</p>
<p>There's some theories that biological 'pulses' like the heart rate are used by some parts of your brain to determine passage of time, but that doesn't explain everything weird with time perception.</p>
<p>Btw, keeping a depressed person awake for 24 hours drastically reduces the depression in the majority of cases, but those symptoms come back the moment you get a few hours of sleep.</p>
<p>This is also not yet explained, like most stuff in our brains above the basic biochemistry.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If i am honest im not sure that is entirely true. In the military there have been times where I stayed up for 48 hours straight, and over a course of 10 days, slept roughly 20 hours.</p>
<p>At some point you reach a state where hallucinations become so vivid that you no longer know when you are awake or when you are dreaming, and you can blink and without realizing, you were actually asleep for 10 minutes. You become so paranoid that your dreams are indistinguishable from reality and even when you try to sleep its impossible because your heart for some reason beats harder. (probably stress)</p>
<p>Ive noticed time passes much more quickly. It's like you reach this zombie mode where your reality becomes...mushy...kind of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if there's an actual scientific reason, but &quot;broscience&quot; says time slows after staying up for 24 hours for the same reason time slows down whilst you're at work - you're tired and bored.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I was young and would routinely stay up all night doing coke, E’s etc, I’d obviously feel low, depressed, tired and a bit tearful the next day.</p>
<p>As I got older, simply staying up all night (say a very long and uncomfortable flight) left me feeling very similar. I always thought it was the downer of the gear, but simply staying up all night really makes me low and tearful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
