		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Perception of taste and smell work on a ligand-receptor principle (falls under the classic &quot;lock and key&quot; analogy). A compound (sugar) binds to a receptor (taste bud) which then initiates a series of chemical and electrical events resulting in your perception of a sweet taste sensation.</p>
<p>The binding of a compound to a receptor is highly dependent on a particular alignment of the two, in 3-dimension space (among several other factors that I won't bore you with). Polymerization of sugars blocks that 3-dimensional alignment.</p>
<p>Returning to the lock and key analogy, imagine a regular key, versus a key that is welded to other keys on both ends (so including the grooved/toothed end). The former is a monomeric sugar, the latter is a polymer like cellulose which would not be immediately functional for purpose of opening the lock (binding to the receptor).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>u/Suta--Purachina is correct, but I'll add a bit of biochemistry to the answer.</p>
<p>Evolutionarily, it makes sense for monomeric and dimeric sugars to taste &quot;sweet&quot; as we can utilize these for energy. You should want to consume these, and sweetness is the positive feedback for you to consume more. Cellulose, however, cannot really be broken down very well by human enzymes. It is necessary in the diet as fiber to help things move along through the digestive system, but it isn't providing energy to you.</p>
<p>So how does this work from a mechanistic standpoint? Well, basically different receptors exist on your tongue which bind to different types of molecules. The different combinations and degrees of binding to different receptors contribute to the overall taste of a substance. The binding pocket in these receptors to which the sugars attach kind of compliments the structure of the sugar and binds favorably. This gets converted into a signal which eventually reaches your brain as sweetness. Cellulose is WAY too big to fit into these types of pockets and be recognized as sweet. Most other polymers larger than a couple units are similarly not sweet.</p>
<p>That said, we can manufacture sugar alcohols that fit into these receptors even better than natural sugars (think artificial sweeteners like sucralose aka Splenda). At much lower concentrations these can bind these specific sweet receptors even better and come off as sweeter vs. sugar. However, they sometimes have strange aftertastes. As I mentioned a substance's interaction with all receptors and the degrees with which it interacts make up the taste.</p>
<p>Sorry, got a little off track there at the end, but hopefully that answers the question a bit more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure there's some explanation that takes into account how things interact with your taste buds etc, but I'm uneducated in that respect. What I will say is that polymer characteristics are often (almost always) different than monomer characteristics. </p>
<p>Take for example ethylene, which is a gas at room temperature, and compare that to polyethylene in any form you'd like. Let's say some low-density polyethylene that you might use for a plastic bag. First of all, you've lost the double-bond character in the polymerization process, so you shouldn't expect it to be able to participate in similar chemistry--and you would be right in thinking so. Polyethylene is quite inert since it's a massive chain of carbon-carbon bonds. </p>
<p>Likewise you can imagine that the process that polymerizes sugars changes their chemical characteristics enough that the polymer shouldn't be expected to act like the monomer. </p>
<p>It's a matter of scale though, as dimers can sometimes be quite similar to their monomeric units. </p>
<p>Or for instance, there are sugars like sucrose that incorporate two monosaccharides (fructose, glucose) and sucrose is certainly sweet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an addition to the other answers here, your saliva contains an enzyme called amylase that breaks glucose polymers into monomers. Chew up something bland and starchy like a saltine or a bite of potato and hold it in your mouth for a minute or two. You'll start to taste it sweetening as your saliva breaks this down. The reason the same thing doesn't happen with cellulose is that there are two forms of glucose depending on their chirality or &quot;handedness.&quot; Alpha and beta glucose are mirror images of each other with the same chemical formula and energy content, but different interactions with the complex enzymes used in digestion. We can digest alpha glucose (starch monomers), so it tastes sweet to us; we cannot digest beta glucose (cellulose monomers), so your body has evolved to perceive it as bland and unappetizing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our taste buds are a lock. Sugars are the key. </p>
<p>Starch, although a sugar, is like glucose, but bigger. Usually 2 or more glucoses bonded together.</p>
<p>It doesn’t fit this lock until it’s broken. Thus, amylase (an enzyme in saliva) is needed to break starch firstly. </p>
<p>TLDR: If you let starch sit in your mouth long enough, it will taste sweet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
