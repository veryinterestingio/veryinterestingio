		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hypnosis for therapy purposes is mainly a strict breathing and calming exercise.</p>
<p>If you have ever day dreamed or completely zoned out... this is essentially the goal. Get you into a state of relaxation where you are able to take your mind off of the 'now' while talking through tough issues that may normally trigger stress and anxiety.</p>
<p>The whole 'waving a clock back and forth' idea stems from a breathing exercise to get you to control your breath, slow your heart rate, and essentially rest. This is just one example.</p>
<p>While there is no such thing as true 'mind control' hypnosis, there is such thing as extreme relaxation/calming to the point of getting into a 'trance' like state.</p>
<p>Thoughts and realizations when in this condition can do incredible things to the brain and how you perceive current situations. It can also, scientifically, do pretty incredible physical things.</p>
<p>As a side note - this isn't all just a hypnosis for therapy idea. There are other professions out there which rely on the same practices for other purposes. It's essentially the same idea as meditation.</p>
<p>High level athletes such as free divers, hockey players, pro bike racers and more seek this type of treatment and training to help themselves in various situations within their sport.</p>
<p>'Magicians' who do stunts requiring long duration breath holding or controlling heart rates to help control body temperatures also rely on this type of conditioning.</p>
<p>Just as an edit/note: I'm not a medical professional or hypnotist. So I don't have answers to questions. All my 'knowledge' on this comes from a college paper and a childhood friends father who was a therapist and also cognitive hypnotist. I begged the man for years to hypnotise me as a kid and make me do crazy things so we could film it... only to be told time and time again that &quot;it's not what you think it is&quot;.  He's actually the reason i wrote the paper.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>The short answer to this one is that they don't!  This is a funny topic because it's an article of faith among some people (including, apparently, a number of hypnotists) that hypnosis is great for refreshing one's memory---but this is a question that's entirely testable, and studies have shown that hypnosis doesn't make someone's memory more accurate.  But the process of hypnosis (including suggestions to the subject that they will be able to remember something with increased detail/accuracy/what have you) does have an effect: it creates a response bias.  People who are given these sorts of suggestions are more willing to offer up answers and details than the control group.  Their accuracy isn't any better than the control group, but if all you're doing is counting right answers the hypnotized group may be scored better since they give more answers and detail overall.</p>
<p>There are a number of studies indicating the above, but one interesting read for you might be this in depth review and discussion of &quot;Hypnotically Refreshed Testimony&quot; published in 1985:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hypnosis is kind of a convoluted catch-all term. Let's divide it in two. First, stage hypnosis, which tends to rely on peer pressure and theatrics, is mostly used by charlatans who purely want to entertain. Second, hypnotherapy, which is the the use of hypnosis for therapeutic means across diverse contexts. It is important to know that not everyone can be hypnotized and you cannot be hypnotized if you don't want to be. Regarding your questions, hypnosis is a state of extreme relaxation without unconsciousness. Many of the brain waves emitted in hypnosis are identical to those in regular sleep, however there is still often a conscious element in hypnosis not found in sleep (Hypnos was the Greek god of sleep, from which hypnosis gets its name). The issue of memory is complicated, especially from a research perspective, but one theory is that the majority of our memories are subconscious and hypnosis tends to meld the subconscious and conscious parts of the mind together so that memories flow much more easily. Another thought is that the blood in the brain during periods of extreme relaxation flows away from the brain stem and to the prefrontal cortex. Basically, the back of your brain governs extreme fight or flight stuff while the front part is higher thinking, creativity, and personality, which tend to be also closer to your memory. Thus, without any of the stresses of day to day life, it's easier to remember things. If you were at the absolute peak of comfort then it makes sense that you would be at your best in terms of remembering things. It is important to note, though, that memories are subject to human imagination as much as anything else. We are interpreters not recorders.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
