		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello! I am a medical epidemiologist and infectious disease doctor at CDC in the Waterborne Disease Prevention Branch. I work to prevent and stop infections caused by free-living amebas, which are single-celled organisms found in water and soil. Free-living amebas can cause diseases ranging from a type of encephalitis, or brain infection, to serious eye infections.</p>
<p>I support epidemiologic, laboratory, and communication activities related to free-living ameba infections. <em>Acanthamoeba</em> is a free-living ameba that can get on your contact lenses and cause a painful and disruptive infection called <em>Acanthamoeba keratitis</em> (AK). <em>Acanthamoeba keratitis</em> can lead to vision problems, the need for a corneal transplant, or blindness. Luckily, AK and other contact lens-related eye infections are largely preventable.</p>
<p>I also work with the CDC Healthy Contact Lens Program to help people learn about contact lens-related eye infections and the healthy habits that can reduce your chances of getting an eye infection. For more information
about the CDC Healthy Contact Lens Program and our contact lens recommendations, visit our website: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/contactlenses/index.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/contactlenses/index.html" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/contactlenses/index.html</a></a>.</p>
<p>My team conducted new research on the communication between eye care providers and patients on contact health. Read the new MMWR report here: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6832a2.htm" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6832a2.htm" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6832a2.htm</a></a>.</p>
<p>I'll be on from 1-3pm (ET, 17-19 UT), AMA!</p></div></div>

What are the things you want providers to tell their patients, and what kind of training are providers getting to learn about these messages?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
