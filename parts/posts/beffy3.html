		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cannabis contains over 100 cannabinoids, of which some of the most popular and talked about are THC, THCA, and CBD. All the cannabinoids together produce the high you feel when you smoke flower/concentrates, THC and its counterparts like THCA (a lot of flower contains more THCA than THC, hence the term &quot;total THC&quot;) contributing the most.</p>
<p>CBD (cannabidiol) is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid, meaning it doesn't produce an alteration in state of mind, or &quot;high,&quot; that THC produces. CBD is extremely useful for aiding symptoms (pain, anxiety, nausea, can stop shakes in Parkinson's patients even, it really is incredible) without producing a high.</p>
<p>What's commonly referred to as THC is known scientifically as Delta-9 THC. Strains of cannabis (have been specially bred to) exist with very little THC and very high concentrations of CBD. Most flower you get at a dispensary is high THC, low CBD.</p>
<p>CBD and Delta-9 THC can also be derived from hemp, an entirely separate plant from cannabis. Hemp has a long list of uses, but the most useful today in my opinion is that it can be used to make biodegradable plastic. Hemp flower containing less than 0.3% Delta-9 THC is legal in all 50 states, even though it looks and smells just like pot. This is why cops have trouble determining the legality of flower sometimes.</p>
<p>Edit: Found <a href="https://i.imgur.com/pWIugck.png" target="_blank">this</a> distinction between hemp and cannabis plants.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>CBD and THC come from the same plant, but do different things.</p>
<p>You know when you're nervous to play your recorder in front of the group, but then you do and realize you weren't that nervous after all and it all went well? That good feeling is kind of what CBD does for you.  Remember when you fell off the slide and bumped your knee, and how it didn't hurt that much because we put some ice on it? CBD kind of works that way too for bumps and booboos.</p>
<p>Remember when you and Grampa ate all of Gramma's cookies and sat on the couch watching cartoons? and when I came to pick you up you didn't want to move and had a huge grin on your face? THC helps you feel like that way.  Remember when you don't have to go to school on Saturday, can sleep in, let the sun shine on your face and you're comfy in your bed and don't want to get up? THC feels like that too.  It's not all fun and games though.  Remember when you lost your blanket at Gramma's and Grampa's and you were so scared you would never see it again, only to have it be in the one place you didn't look? We found it, but do you remember how scared you were? Sometimes THC can feel that way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>THC gives you more of a &quot;head&quot; high.  </p>
<p>CBD isn't terribly psychoactive. You might get a little head change off of it, but for me the big thing it does is knock down my anxiety LIKE weed would, without giving me the other effects (the head high, the lethargy, etc.)  </p>
<p>I find CBD flower and wax to be a little more work/study friendly than THC for those reasons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
