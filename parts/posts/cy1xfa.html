		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The CPU in a console can read and perform very simple instructions stored as bytes in the program file, so one number might mean &quot;load up the number from a location in memory&quot;, another instruction-number might mean &quot;add two values together&quot;. </p>
<p>In C, you'd type something like</p>
<p>x=y+5;  // Get the number stored as 'y', add 5 to it and set the value named 'x' to the result</p>
<p>The &quot;compiler&quot; is a program which is used to make the real program file from that human-written code. It takes that one line and writes out a whole bunch of the instruction-numbers that the computer understands.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Before having languages like C, the programmer could still write understandable instructions, but they were more on a level with the machine language. So you'd write instructions like this for the above (not a real language). The bits after -- are just my comments and would not be part of the program (although programmers add stuff like that to explain what they're doing in real code too)., </p>
<p><code>load ptr1,4002  -- meaning get ready to use memory address 4002 (where the value of y is) by storing it in a special CPU memory ptr1</code></p>
<p><code>load value1, (ptr1)  -- get the number stored in the memory address that ptr1 is pointing at into a special CPU memory named value1</code></p>
<p><code>load value2, 5  -- get the number we're going to add into the 'value2' CPU store.</code></p>
<p><code>add value1, value2  -- do the addition - this computer can only add its special "value" stores together, we can't just add things directly.</code></p>
<p><code>load ptr1, 4010 -- this number happens to be where we'll store the value named 'x' in the C code so set up ptr1 to point to that. We're done with the 4002 memory address that holds y.</code></p>
<p><code>store value1, (ptr1)  -- store the result of the addition in ptr1, which is now pointing at where we want to store the value 'x'</code>  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The computer still can't understand &quot;add value1, value2&quot; - it only understands some code-number that means that.</p>
<p>So like with C, a program converts the written programs into computer code, except that you'd have to pretty much write the code as a 'human' version of each computer instruction. One line to one machine instruction, instead of one-to-many that you have with C compilers. </p>
<p>So you could still write the program, but everything was more laborious. You had to spell out everything in simple form on the computer's level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
