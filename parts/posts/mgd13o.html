So either one of us sleep walked or someone broke in last night and helped themselves to some snacks. Either way, it’s made me wonder- what causes people to sleep walk?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don’t dream right away during a sleep cycle.  Right before your dreaming period begins, your body releases chemicals that have a paralyzing effect.  So when you dream, your body doesn’t really move much, just your eyes (REM stands for rapid eye movement).  For a typical person, dreaming ends before the paralyzing effect wears off.</p>
<p>In a sleep walker, the dreaming period outlasts the paralyzing effect.  This is usually caused by high serotonin levels (the natural version of melatonin).  Most people’s serotonin levels decrease as they approach puberty which is why most sleepwalkers are children.  High stress can trigger your body to produce more serotonin because your body thinks you need more deep, restful sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a specific chemical released during sleep into the brain which prevents commands going from brain to muscle - specifically so we would not sleep walk or do anything else while dreaming of doing it. If there is some problem with this chemical - it’s either not released or not working properly - people begin sleepwalking. Conversely, if this chemical is not flushed from the brain before waking up, we can sometimes experience sleep paralysis, which is when you are lying awake but unable to move for a few minutes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
