		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Car dealerships are like franchises and part of the rules is that you have to sell an exclusive brand. They don't want a dealership selling competing brands on the same lot.</p>
<p>Dealerships though are often owned by dealership groups which have multiple dealers for different brands owned by the same person. So if you don't like want Honda is selling, realize that the Toyota dealer across the street might be owned by the same person.</p>
<p>The exception is exotic car dealers. While they may be branded with a specific mark, they tend to sell all sorts of exotic cars. The reason being that these cars are such a specialist product that you have to sell more than one brand usually to make money. Also a person set on buying a Ferrari likely won't be convinced to buy a Lotus instead, with exotic cars the brand and image is often more important than the car itself.</p>
<p>Pure Lambo or Ferrari dealerships do exist but you'll only see them in certain place like LA where there's enough customers to warrant it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, in many states there are crazy laws that say new cars must be sold at manufacturer related dealerships.  Tesla is having problems selling direct to consumer because of this in certain states.  And you have to have a franchise dealership. And as other have said, you only sell affiliated brands on same lot.  Ford/Lincoln/Mercury or Chrysler/Dodge/Ram/Jeep</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An auto brand wants you to develop long-term loyalty for the brand across your various life stages, so although you may be looking for a truck today, they want you thinking brand x for when you need a sedan or van for a growing family, a starter car for when the kids start driving, and something sporty for when you have your mid-life crisis. Even at the high end think of BMW or Mercedes with entry level 2-door models, C series when starting your career, E series when in your 30s or 40s, S series when you make VP, and SUVs for grocery runs, taking kids to soccer, and visiting your second home in the mountains. They don’t want to sell you a truck, they want you to be a 50-year revenue stream and they need vehicles for you at every point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Used car dealers could totally do nothing but trucks. We have one of those right down the street. They can't get brand new inventory from the auto manufacturers but they can sell everything else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
