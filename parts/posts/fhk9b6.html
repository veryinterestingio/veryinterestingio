		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s where the banks can get to it, to keep lending money. The problem is if the banks stop lending to mid and small size companies who don’t have vast cash reserves like the Fortune 500 companies. It especially applies to those Regional banks again that don’t have the reserves say of Bank of America. They’re priming the pump to keep confidence high.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Today, for example, is one of those times: “As a part of its $60 billion reserve management purchases for the monthly period beginning March 13, 2020 and continuing through April 13, 2020, the Desk will conduct purchases across a range of maturities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding.”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Federal Reserve buys US treasury bonds. </p>
<p>A US treasury bond is an IOU from the government. When you buy a bond, you are giving the government a loan. When the government buys that bond, they are giving you your money back. </p>
<p>When the Federal Reserve wants to inject cash into the market, they buy bonds from banks. When the banks have more money, they are able to give out more loans to people and businesses. This cash then flows down into the rest of the economy. This action also lowers the interest rates that people have to pay when they take out loans, which increases investment.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the money takes the form of bond purchases.  </p>
<p>The treasury issues bonds, these get bought by people as an investment.  These bonds are often sold to third parties before they mature (can be cashed in).  The Fed becomes that third party, spending cash and buying those bonds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
