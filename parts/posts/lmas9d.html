		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>&quot;Dark Matter&quot;</strong> and <strong>&quot;Dark Energy&quot;</strong> are 2 different, unrelated hypotheses. They only share the &quot;Dark&quot; moniker because neither of them interact with (absorb or emit) light but, more relevantly, we don't know what they are. You could call them &quot;Mysterious Matter&quot; and &quot;Mysterious Energy&quot; instead. Indeed, <em>&quot;Invisible Gravity&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;Invisible Anti-Gravity&quot;</em> are arguably more descriptive, but less prescriptive, names for them. </p>
<p><strong>&quot;Dark Matter&quot;</strong> is a hypothetical form of matter which appears to explain several astronomical observations. Specifically, there doesn't seem to be enough &quot;visible&quot; matter to account for all the gravity, but if &quot;invisible&quot; matter is responsible for the gravity then it must make up most (~85%) of the matter in the universe.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Dark Energy&quot;</strong> is a hypothetical form of energy which could provide an explanation for the increasing expansion of the universe at the largest (astronomical) scales.</p>

<p>Because we don't know yet WHAT they are, we also don't know WHERE to find them, although there are several hypotheses as to how and where we should look for them.</p>
<p>For example, because &quot;Dark Matter&quot; is so difficult to detect, physicists suspect it's probably a particle which only interacts weakly with normal matter.
One such candidate is the Neutrino, while another is a type of WIMP ( <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakly_interacting_massive_particles" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakly_interacting_massive_particles</a> )</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically all we <em>know</em> about dark matter is that it is responsible for binding galaxies together despite their high rate of rotation. If it were just the gravity from visible matter holding galaxies together, they would fly apart at their current rate of rotation. There’s simply not enough stuff. But galaxies don’t fly apart. So <em>something</em> is going on.</p>
<p>There are a number of possibilities. It could be that our theory of gravity is wrong. It just works differently at galactic scales for some reason. It could be that there are a bunch of blackholes whizzing around that we’re missing. It could be that there is a repulsive force out in the void between galaxies pushing things inwards.</p>
<p>The current consensus is that the evidence points to some sort of matter. Probably not blackholes or anything else big. More likely a new undiscovered type particle with a lot of mass that does not interact with normal matter. These hypothetical particles are often called WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles), and are the focus of a lot of dark matter research right now.</p>
<p>Assuming WIMPs are the explanation for dark matter, since they don’t collide with anything they would not settle into a disk like visible matter has. Instead the galaxy would be surrounded by a sphere of WIMPs, whizzing around, not hitting much of anything, but providing enough gravity to hold it all together. The disk of visible matter swims in this sphere, so there may be WIMPs passing through you right now (similar to neutrinos, but neutrinos have much less mass).</p>
<p>Dark <em>energy</em> we know even less about. That appears to be some sort of repulsive force that exists at a very low constant level in all of space. Near a galaxy, gravity is much stronger. The repulsion has no noticeable effect, and it would be difficult or impossible to detect. But <em>between</em> galaxies there is little gravity and dark energy dominates. The result is that galaxies are pushed apart. The further apart they get, the more empty space there is. Since dark energy exists at a constant level in any given volume of space (probably, maybe, who knows), more empty space means more dark energy, means galaxies are pushed apart faster and faster.</p>
<p>So your interpretation that dark energy and dark matter are “all around us” but undetectable is probably more or less correct. With WIMPs, that is probably literally true. Invisible ghostly particles with nothing but gravity. Not sure how many there are expected to be (would depend on what exactly their mass is), but if they are anything like neutrinos, it could be billions and trillions passing through you each second. As for dark energy . . . honestly it’s tough to know how to visualize it. Even if that void-energy idea is correct, what does that even mean? Some infinitesimal force pushing everything around you away from everything else? It’s so far from our every day experience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A hypothetical &quot;dark matter&quot; particle would be one that did not interact with the electromagnetic interaction but did interact with some of the others. </p>
<p>That's really all there is to it. It's not &quot;dark&quot; because it's mysterious or weird, it's dark because the electromagnetic interaction is the source of light to humans and it's also the easiest type of interaction to detect. So it's visibly &quot;dark&quot; to us and &quot;dark&quot; to our measurement equipment. </p>
<p>This also makes it super hard to detect and is the likely main reason we have yet to measure anything material -- the gravitational force is negligible compared to the other three and thus it's useless as well. The weak and strong both have different properties that make them much more difficult to detect, but these our our only avenues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, as far as we understand it, dark matter is all around us.</p>
<p>Our galaxy sits in a giant ball of dark matter (a dark matter 'halo'),  and so our solar system and the earth are swimming around in dark matter. It's probably passing through our bodies right now. </p>
<p>Some experiments to detect dark matter assume that at some times of the year the earth's heading into the dark matter, so more is passing through us, and at other times we're heading away (think: tailwind) so less is passing through us, and you should be able to detect this seasonal difference. No luck yet though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We know matter has gravity and we can see the effects of this on other nearby masses. Also we know mass bends space time, therefore light passing near is bent. We can see all these interactions through a telescope. Dark matter is when we can clearly see these interactions  but there is empty space where the huge mass is supposed to be. We know it’s there, we can see it’s affect on visible matter and light, we can even pinpoint its location, but we just can’t see it. It’s everywhere, we can see it’s affects on whole galaxies.</p>
<p>Dark energy is a theoretical explanation as to why the universe is expanding at an increasing rate. We know the universe is expanding which means it must have originated from a central point. We call this the Big Bang. If something explodes it expands and slows down eventually. Gravity should slow the universe expansion down and eventually pull it back to one single mass, but this is not the case. By measuring light from distance parts of the universe we know that every second the universe is expanding faster and faster. Some force is causing this, we call this dark energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
