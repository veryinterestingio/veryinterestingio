Same with someone like Adele. Why is this?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With regard to English specifically, an accent is mostly about differences in the pronunciation of vowels.  There's only one way to say the consonant &quot;n&quot;, but people from different countries pronounce &quot;o&quot; differently.  When a singer is singing, they tend to pronounce vowels for a longer period of time than in normal speech, so the differences in pronunciation fade away.</p>
<p>This makes me wonder if British people think that American singers sound British when they sing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Classically-trained vocalists are taught similar techniques. Back off on nasals, open your vowels, soften your R's, and so on. The result is a lot of singers have a very similar apparent accent when they sing. I'd guess it's somewhere in the vicinity of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_accent" target="_blank">Mid-Atlantic accent</a>, which isn't too far off from British Received Pronunciation.</p>
<p>But this is not a law of the universe. There are vocalists who sing distinctly in their own accents, or who can sing an imitation of another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most early blues, soul, r&amp;b, rock and pop music originated in the U.S. </p>
<p>European (particularly British) bands who were influenced by American pop music of the 50s and 60s tended to try to mimic the American style of singing, which often meant &quot;losing&quot; their accents.</p>
<p>So we've had several generations of pop music for which an &quot;American accent&quot; has become the default sound for many vocalists.</p>
<p>Conversely, if you listen to traditional folk music from the UK, you'll notice that their accents don't &quot;disappear.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I always thought it was cool how The Beatles would sound British in some songs and American in other songs. Even across each singer they seemed to choose an accent based on how they wanted the song to sound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
