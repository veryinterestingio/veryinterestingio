		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In simple terms, the first vaccine exposes your immune system to the virus (or bacteria, etc) so your body learns to fight. Sometimes to have lasting response your body needs a boost (sometimes said to “challenge the immune system”), which primes the immune system creating a more lasting immune response in the body. </p>
<p>Not all vaccines require boosters; there are a lot of variables involved. When we do research we look at immune titers at several intervals (days, weeks, months) post-dose to see if they drop below the immune response threshold... this tells us if we need to prime the immune system again with a booster.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's also a fascinating phenomenon with vaccinating infants. If the mother has had exposure to the pathogen in the past, or been vaccinated against it herself, she will be carrying antibodies against that pathogen. During pregnancy, some of those antibodies go through the placenta to the baby, so when it is born it has some protection against the pathogen. This is known as passive immunity.</p>
<p>Now, the protection isn't as lasting as that the baby would get from its own immune system, but it's better than nothing (get your pregnancy vaccinations ladies!), and gives some protection while the baby's immune system is still developing.</p>
<p>Because the immune protection is the mum's antibodies, not made by the baby itself, once those antibodies begin to reduce, the baby no longer has any immunity to the disease. But while the antibodies remain, any vaccine delivered is reduced in its likelihood to elicit an effective immune response, as the baby already has antibodies against the vaccine, so the threat is destroyed before the baby's immune system has enough time to process its own response. This is a great thing, because if the baby doesn't have sufficient protection left from the mum to fight off the pathogen, the vaccine will stimulate it to generate it's own response. </p>
<p>A great example is MMR. It's safe and licensed from the age of 6 months, but it's only routinely given from age 12 months, as circulating antibodies from the mother mean that vaccine given before 6 months, will not provide lasting immunity, so the entire course needs to be repeated at 12 months. If you are in an area with a high rate of measles, you can request the vaccine from as young as 6 months, but you still need the full course later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, one would need to understand how vaccines works. In general, vaccines gives your body antigens (e.g. surface proteins of virus/bacteria pathogens) to recognize and remember. This generates a store of circulating antibodies and memory B cells that especially targets these antigens. This is done by the slow but specific adaptive immune system. </p>
<p>Some of the first vaccines are attenuated vaccines. These are essentially a weaker version of the same pathogen that still expresses some of the same antigens, but are too weak to cause serious disease. A good example is using cowpox as smallpox vaccine - literally the first vaccine ever used. The virus multiplies really well in cows, but is kinda slow in humans since its not the primary host. This gives time for the immune system to mount adaptive immune response and acquire antibodies and memory against it, and as luck has it, against the much deadlier smallpox. Nowadays, we can attenuate pathogens by growing and adapting them to a non-human host over many cycles, so that they no longer work as well in humans anymore. But it's less safe as it has the potential to readapt back to humans, causing disease again - particularly in immunocompromised such as the elderly. Attenuated vaccines often don't require boosters as the pathogen can still multiply, albeit really slowly, and consistently provide antigens until your immune system fully mounts adaptive immunity and destroys while remembering it. Another good thing is injection may not be required, you can deliver orally for some attenuated vaccines. </p>
<p>Alternatively, we can just feed the body antigens. Booster shots are often required for safer but kinda weaksauce antigen sources such as inactivated pathogens (killed with heat/chemicals), pure antigens (purified or separately produced), or even DNA alone (get your own cells express these antigens). These are safer since they will not cause disease - at best giving you a slight fever, at worst, an allergic reaction as your immune system responds to them. Because after injection, these antigens gradually run out in the body, a booster shot ensures there is enough antigens to fully activate your adaptive immunity. Many also need adjuvants - extra stuff that further improves or even control the type of immune response so that better adaptive response and memory is generated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neither of the top answers are correct, we administer multiple doses because its all a game of probability. You either get immunity from a vaccine or you don't and there are a multitude of reasons why immunity might not take the first time. So in order to balance safety with maximum likelihood you'll achieve immunity, we administer multiple doses. MMR for instance is two doses for this reason whereas TDaP only needs one but we administer boosters again as a population measure to insure immunity at a population level. Individually, you may not need multiple doses or boosters if your titers are fine. But vaccines are cheaper than antibody tests.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Secondary immune response tends to be far greater than the first and results in a higher quantity of antibodies staying around. Essentially the first is to prep the body so it knows what to do and the second is to test the defences and make more.</p>
<p>Not all vaccines need a booster either because they cause a big enough reaction the first time or something to do with the virus. Viruses are diverse and not all of them function in the same way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
