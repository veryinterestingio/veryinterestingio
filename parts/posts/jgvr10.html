		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All hair is always growing.</p>
<p>Each hair has a ‘clock’ that tells it to stop growing and start on a new one. The original hair falls out and a new one grows in its place. This gives the appearance of the hair being a static length because they arent all fallibg out and starting again at the same time. Sometimes the clock can make a mistake, like one of my eyebrow hairs that grows double length.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m a tissue engineer and it’s been a while since I studied hair, but let me try and explain it to a five-year-old...</p>
<p>All hair is made in a tiny skin “caves” called a follicle.</p>
<p>When you were being made in your mom's belly, the follicle “caves” were put everywhere on the skin.  Some follicle “caves” were given different DNA plans. That’s why Head hair, facial hair, body hair, and private hair are all different.</p>
<p>All hair grows at 1cm per month.  But they didn’t start the hair growing race at the same time, so some hair starts growing every day and some stop growing every day, and some fall out every day. </p>
<p>The hair on your head can grow for 3 years to 7 years.  And the hair on your body can grow for 3-6 months.</p>
<p>When you cut your hair or shave your hair all it does is shorten the long hair.  But they are still growing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
