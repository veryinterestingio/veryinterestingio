		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I'm grieving too. I'm not a scientist, but I can share a little bit of what I know as a mental health professional. </p>
<p>Grief can mess with our mood-related hormones. It can reduce serotonin levels (which help with energy), and increase our cortisol levels (which can zap energy with they're consistently high). </p>
<p>Additionally, the brain sort of &quot;defragments&quot; itself while we sleep, like a computer. It processes, prioritizes, and consolidates information- including our emotions. Some studies suggest that people with high anxiety need more sleep because of this. (I am NOT stating that as a fact, just as a suggestion.) But if it's true, then it makes more sense that grieving would require additional time to &quot;defrag&quot; (i.e. sleep) as well. </p>
<p>Other studies show that we literally <em>phsically hurt</em> when we're in emotional pain. That's taxing on the body, even if it's not a truly physical injury, and addressing that takes additional energy. </p>
<p>I hope you're taking care of yourself, and I hope someone else can give you a more scientific response. HUG.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My grieving, when at it's worst, is usually a bit of screaming/bawling followed by exhausted silence where I just don't feel anything for a few minutes. I just want to fall asleep. That repeats until I can pull myself together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I guess it's because your body is focused more on negative emotions and that's why it feels so draining because all you're thinking and feeling is about your loss. I hope you're doing okay man and get through whatever you're dealing right now with ease.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
