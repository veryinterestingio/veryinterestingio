Because light beyond there hasn't reached us yet, we can't see what's there. This is one of the biggest mysteries in the universe today.</p>
<p>But, since the universe is getting older and new light reaches earth, shouldn't that mean that we see more new things of the universe every day.</p>
<p>When new light arrives at earth, does that mean that the observable universe is getting bigger?</p>
<p>Edit: damn this blew up. Loving the discussions in the comments! Really learning new stuff here!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the observable universe is getting larger every day, meaning the volume of space out to the farthest object we can see is increasing.  However, because the expansion of the universe is accelerating due to dark energy (whatever it may be), there are objects in the sky that we can see today that we will not be able to see in the future.  That is because these objects will be carried away from us faster than light can travel through the expanding space toward us.  In fact, if we observe an object with a redshift of 1.8 or greater (meaning that the wavelength of the light has been stretched by the expanding space so it is 1.8 times longer by the time it reaches us), then we will <em>never</em> see the light it is emitting today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well technically it is, but the issue is that due to Hubble's law, the very fabric of space is expanding, so even if we are able to view more galaxies (which gets harder due to redshift), we will end up seeing less and less extra galaxies as they accelerate to and past the speed of light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other people have answered your question by now, but I wanted to add that what you're basically saying is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olbers%27_paradox" target="_blank">Olbers' paradox</a>: if the universe is infinite, eternal, and static, why is the night sky not entirely bright?</p>
<p>Nowadays we know that the (observable) universe is neither infinite, eternal, nor static.  Furthermore, the expansion of space redshifts light out of the visible spectrum, and means that the amount of light that reaches Earth will actually shrink as time goes on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
