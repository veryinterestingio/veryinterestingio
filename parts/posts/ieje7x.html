		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In pre-internet times, one method was to watch the obituaries. You could find someone who just died, then create a fake version of their ID with your image to use out of town. Any records with things like social security numbers or drivers license numbers will accept yours as valid because the person actually existed, so there isn't an immediate flag to say that its fake. All you had to do was make sure you never interacted with anyone who knew/knew of the real dead person.</p>
<p>These days with everything being digital and available almost instantly, its far harder to fake. </p>
<p>Simple things like photo ID to buy alcohol can be pulled off if you're talented, but you wouldn't have much luck using it anywhere that they would want to verify your ID. Cops who ran the number would know, banks would know, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I like your military idea - it'll give you some life experience and let you see some different parts of the world. </p>
<p>If not, apply for jobs out of state and move away - if you have a friend willing to go - even better.  At 18, you can walk away from your family if you really don't like them.  No need to fake your death or create a new identity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before the modern era it was super easy because there wasn't a whole lot of 'evidence' one way or the other. Simply leaving the area was enough in most instances unless you were infamous for something and immediately recognizable (think cartoonish scar on your face) and as long as you didn't come up with an outlandish backstory no one would really dig.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm John Smith I came here from New York because my parents died and I wanted to start a new life down south. Oh, I used to work at a factory and only speak English&quot; Pre-1935 this would have been all you'd need.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In modern times as others have pointed out it is much harder, at least within the US. Depending on what assets you have available it may be as simple as moving to a poor nation and bribing a few people for documentation (which costs far less than you are expecting, like in Georgia the minimum wage for the entire year is about 350 usd...so you don't exactly have to be wealthy to get things like a work visa...or just decide not to work and just get permission to live in the nation)</p>
<p>And again it really depends on how much someone is actually looking for you. Like if the US government wants to find you and actually commits to the search good luck you would need quite a bit of money to try to stay hidden. But if you are just 'some guy' then they aren't going to really search</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You could join the French Foreign Legion. When you join you can opt for a new identity. There are a few disqualifies. If you are honorable discharged you then become a French citizen under your new ID. Learn to speak French fluently before you join or they will beat the language into you. You will also be joining an international brotherhood that would come to your rescue if ever in need.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
