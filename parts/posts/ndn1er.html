		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nurse here, spent the past 12 months working in Covid ICUs.</p>
<p>The primary mechanism of organ damage is NOT direct viral damage from virus being spread through the blood as you mention in your post, but a lack of oxygen to the organs from a terrible combination of several different things that all cause a lack of oxygen by themselves, and when combined cause a severe enough lack of oxygen to the major organs to damage them beyond repair.</p>
<p>The first and most obvious mechanism is lack of oxygenation from the lungs. What laypeople might not understand is that we don't only put people on ventilators because their lungs are full of fluid, mucus, etc. We often put people on ventilators because their respiratory muscles are literally too tired to keep breathing. The ventilator does the breathing for them, so those muscles can get some rest. Ventilators are pretty effective for this.</p>
<p>With Covid though, you can have a situation where someone is on the ventilator, but their lung tissue is literally too damaged by the virus itself to be working properly. So despite being ventilated, they are still not getting enough oxygen. Clearly, this low oxygen can damage other organs and is a major problem. (We can try to mitigate this problem with things like turning the person over to lay on their stomach, which exposes a great surface area on the backs of the lungs to the oxygen being pumped in by the ventilator or by putting the person on a full heart-lung bypass machine called Extra-Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation or ECMO, but these things come with their own set of complications and are not easy, guaranteed solutions.)</p>
<p>The second thing related to damaged lung tissue is the failure to remove CO2 from the blood. Dissolved CO2 in the blood causes the blood to become acidic (called &quot;respiratory acidosis&quot;). Acidic blood and acidic body tissues do not function very well. Body proteins (enzymes, etc.) don't work in a high-acid environment.</p>
<p>Adding to the acid problem is the fact that in the absence of sufficient oxygen, your body cells resort to an alternative method of producing energy called lactic acid fermentation. Obviously the buildup of lactic acid further exacerbates the problems caused by bad pH levels. This acidosis itself can cause organ damage and organ failure on top of the organ damage from lack of oxygen.</p>
<p>Acidosis can also contribute to low blood pressure, although primarily the cause of the severely low blood pressure that we see in Covid is a medical condition known as sepsis. Sepsis is not quite the same as septicemia as you mentioned in your post. Sepsis is a medical condition of wildly out-of-whack immune responses, the precise mechanisms of which are very complicated and not 100% understood. The results of sepsis are tachycardia, tachypnea, both of which can just tire a person's body, but the real killer in sepsis is profoundly low blood pressure.</p>
<p>Low blood pressure <em>again</em> exacerbates the problem of lack of oxygen to the major organs. Not enough blood flow means that even if the blood had enough oxygen in the first place, that oxygen isn't flowing into the organs like it should, so that oxygen isn't getting to where it's needed.</p>
<p>All of the above mechanisms <em>are not unique to Covid.</em> These processes can occur in any situation where a person's lungs are not working properly (things like Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome or ARDS), although they are much much worse in severe Covid just due to the sheer amount of damage to the lungs. And the sepsis reaction in Covid is profoundly worse than what we see in other infections for reasons we don't understand yet - complete speculation might be because this virus is completely new to our entire species? maybe because Covid has direct effects on the immune system? We don't know for sure yet.</p>
<p>But we do know that if we treat people with immune suppressants (steroids specifically) about a week into a Covid infection, they are less likely to develop the severe kind of sepsis that causes people with Covid to die. It's possible that this immune system dysregulation itself is causing some damage to major organs in ways we don't fully understand yet.</p>
<p>Additionally, ON TOP OF the above problems, Covid also directly causes blood clotting through mechanisms that we don't entirely understand. Kidneys in particular are extraordinarily sensitive to even microscopic blood clots, and this is thought to be one way that Covid causes kidney damage. Again, blood clots block blood flow, which prevents delivery of oxygen to the organs even if there is enough oxygen in the blood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The main component in COVID causing the shutdown of organs is inflammation. The COVID virus itself doesn't hurt the organs as much, rather most of the damage is caused by the immune system trying to get rid of it.</p>
<p>It all starts with the lungs of course, because that's where the virus likes to reproduce, and the inflammation results in what's called Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Lung tissue is being destroyed and the spaces which usually serve for gas exchange are being filled with fluid due to the overwhelming immune response. -</p>
<p>Then due to the lung being injured and as a result not functioning properly, the blood is not oxygenated enough, which is called hypoxemia. This means that other organs are not getting enough oxygen, which causes them to start shutting down. Another major component to MOF (multiple organ failure) is the inflammation itself. The inflammatory compounds that leak into the bloodstream as a result of the infection can cause a severe drop in blood pressure, which means the organs won't get enough blood . The inflammation also contributes to the formation of blood clots, which further damage organs. The damaged organs then release additional inflammatory compounds themselves due to their injury, which feeds into a devastating loop, in addition to causing other problems due to their failure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I haven't looked into current theories for a while (like November of last year) but at the time they thought Sars-Cov2 bound to ACE2 receptors on the endothelium (inner lining) of blood vessels, causing inflammation. This caused blood clots to form which would then break off from their originate point to &quot;embolize&quot; (move to new location) and eventually get caught in another, small vessel elsewhere. </p>
<p>Organs with high perfusion (amount of blood delivered to the tissue) are high risk for emboli to block the blood flow and cause organ damage. Generally the most perfused organs are: the brain (emboli here are called embolic strokes), kidneys, heart (emboli here are called mycardial infarction aka heart attack), and liver. </p>
<p>To answer the question of the person above me, yes blood thinners work and are being used in the management of all Covid patients. In fact, many Covid patients are being put on blood thinners for months</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to say that this happens in any patient with respiratory problems basically, and for reasons that have nothing to do , for the most part , with anything specifically biochemically related to that given virus.</p>
<p>You get a fever, inflammation and lack of oxygen.  Fever denatures proteins, lack of oxygen speaks for itself but the cytokine storm, causes blood vessels to become leaky, lowers Blood pressure.  Lower BP = not enough pressure in the kidney to work properly,and not enough salts  and proteins (osmolatity) and once that happens  you rapidly go out of whack on all sorts of other measures - pH, and other toxins, for example.   </p>
<p>Imagine you ran you car with no oil.  It would seize and if you kept trying to run it like that, you cant fix the problems you cause.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
