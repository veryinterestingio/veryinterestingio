Someone mentioned that sad moments are typically not as sad, but the same goes for happy moments. Why is this? I understand that the science is not fully understood, but is there an explanation as to why I am not experiencing as much joy as I feel I should?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My psychiatrist tried to explain it to me like this, roughly. She said something along the lines of that my perception of everything that happened prior was exaggeratedly bad and good. Everything weighed so much heavier, most of the time things were bad and that made the times where things were good really stand out. </p>
<p>By starting antidepressants, your brain stops registering every kind-of bad thing that happens to you as being horribly, inescapably bad. Over time, this brings your baseline mood higher towards the center. With nothing seeming as bad as it did, the good things don’t have much to cut through and their value slowly diminishes. You do still feel bad when bad things happen and good when things are well but it’s never as extreme on either side and so they, and all of their associated emotions, end up feeling muted in relation to how they were.</p>
<p>It makes sense to me and seems to work as a functional explanation for myself as to why my emotions are less intense. Don’t know if there’s really any scientific truth to it though, would have to research more sometime.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Medicine for mental health has some variables to it. The first two weeks or so are often hellish as your body works to readjust, so anything within the first two weeks - month isn't a good indicator of the medicines true effects.</p>
<p>Similarly, not everyone responds to medicines the same. Some people respond better to asprin over Tylenol, it's the same with mental health meds. Some people respond really well to Zoloft, some don't. That's why there are many different types of medicines.</p>
<p>Medicine really shouldn't turn you into an emotionless zombie. If you're within the first two weeks or so, give it some extra time to work, but if it's been over a month and you're still feeling numb bring it up with your doc. Medicine is supposed to make you feel more like yourself, not less.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our brains use a series of chemicals called neurotransmitters to transmit information between cells.  when people have to much or to little of certain chemicals, it can affect how you think.  One of the potential causes of depression is not enough of a specific neurotransmitter called serotonin.  A lot of anti depressant meds change how our body produces and disposes of serotonin.  However our brains are ridiculously complex and we don't fully understand them.  Going in and messing with stuff can have a bunch of unintended consequences (especially as serotonin does a bunch of stuff).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Antidepressants tend to block your brain's ability to absorb <strong>many</strong> different kinds of chemicals (emotions).  </p>
<p>IIRC many people tend to experience a narrower (or oddly varied) range of emotion while taking said drugs - happiness, sadness, hunger, exhaustion, anger, bliss... Most emotions are 'dulled' because your brain can't properly absorb the chemicals it's making to influence your emotional state.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
