		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When light goes from one medium to another, it experiences what is known as refraction. At the moment it passes from one to the other, it bends at an angle specific to that substance, that angle varies depending on density and what it is made of. This is why if you look at a pool of water, your perception of depth is really odd at shallow angles. </p>
<p>When air is hot, it rises. That rising hot air mixes with cooler air just above it in a chaotic swirling mess. Light passes from hot, light air to cool, denser air over and over and over as it mixes. That makes it shimmer and wave</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Air at different thicknesses bends light different amounts and hot air is thinner than cold air (due to molecular energy making it spread out). A cold room or a hot room both at least look consistent, so we don't really notice the difference in most cases, but when something really hot starts heating up the air in a relatively cooler place, you get to see the differences side by side. Then when the hot air rises, it produces a wiggly effect as it worms its way through the thick cold air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The same reason that water makes stuff wiggly.</p>
<p>Change in refractive index causes light to change path. Heat in the air is changing (semi randomly) the refractive index of the air, so light coming through it wiggles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When particles get hot, they love to dance. When hot particles (in your area) are dancing they can change how light (and sounds) behave. Wiggly air is just hot air dancing around making light move a little weird. </p>
<p>To your eyes, it makes the stuff behind all that dancing air, wave and shake a little, at long distances or particularly hot and flat areas, it can even look like water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light goes faster or slower in different materials, including hotter (goes faster) and colder (goes slower) air. Also, light always takes the quickest path to get someplace. So just like if you were rescuing a drowning person at the beach it would make sense to run on the beach more and then turn toward the person as you entered the water, to get to the person as quickly as possible, light changes directions as it goes from one material to another where its speed changes. As warm air mixes with cool air, the quickest path can rapidly change, causing the shimmering effect you see.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
