So, my question is, is it theoretically possible to synthesize another Alkali metal? Is it theoretically possible to synthesize an entire new line of elements? Also, is it practically possible, as in with our technology now or in the near future will we ever be able to synthesize a new element?

<p>These things are possible in theory.</p>

<p>It's very difficult in practice. We've already produced all of the &quot;easy&quot; ones, and people are working very hard right now just to reach the next few. It's not clear exactly when that will happen, or what it will take to get even further. But it's an active area of research in nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry. We've got some relevant info in our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/physics#wiki_nuclear_and_atomic_physics" target="_blank">Nuclear and Atomic Physics FAQ</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I went to a talk by Professor Oganessian a few weeks ago, the inventor of two major processes used to create the super-heavy elements. A few interesting points came out of it.</p>
<p>Firstly, when you have that many protons in a nucleus (which is indeed the goal with heavy elements), there's a lot of repulsion there, so you need a heckuva lot of neutrons to hold the nucleus together (by the strong force) and stop it from disintegrating immediately. The issue is that the best way to make bigger nuclei is by ramming smaller nuclei together, and smaller nuclei tend to have a lower neutron-to-proton ratio (neutron-rich nuclei tend to decay by beta radiation, which forms protons), and so it's difficult to find the right 'ingredient' nuclei which have enough neutrons to stabilise the new, large nucleus. Oganessian's research made use of Calcium-48, with 28 neutrons and 20 protons: most nuclei up to calcium have about the same number of each, so calcium-48 is ideal. </p>
<p>This is also why the &quot;Island of Stability&quot; is so elusive. On a graph of neutron number against proton number, the Island lies in a region with significantly more neutrons then protons, and since we don't have many smaller 'ingredient' nuclei that have a large enough neutron-to-proton ratio, there's no way to combine smaller nuclei alone to achieve that ratio. So in other words, it is possible, but it's damn hard.</p>
<p>Also a weird thing that happens when you look at the electrons super-heavy elements is that for some reason Einstein shows up and you have to get Special Relativity involved (it's because the electrons are having to travel so quickly around the nucleus that they reach relativistic speeds). The main thing relativity does is cause the mass of the electrons orbiting the nucleus to increase, which leads to the orbitals sort of squashing in closer to the nucleus.
Anyway the main effect of that is that you no longer get the trends and patterns that make the periodic table what it is. The squashing [not a technical term] of the orbitals leads to each new element being much the same as the last.</p>
<p>So in other words, we can indeed extend the periodic table - in theory - but it will lose much of its original purpose. As the patterns and periodicity die out, the next row will simply continue on past the noble gases and just extend off over to the right forever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
