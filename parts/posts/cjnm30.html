		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason we use Planck units is convenience. The scaling of the Planck units is based on a number of universal constants (speed of light, gravitational constant, and others). That means that when using Planck units, those constants actually have the value 1.</p>
<p>And because of that, many equations that feature these constants can be rewritten without them, because multiplying or dividing by one can be ignored. This makes equations simpler and makes it easier to understand the relation between various physical quantities.</p>
<p>And while our regular units, be they meters, miles, grams or pounds, are rooted very much in our own history and are therefore very human-centric, the Planck units are based only on universal constants. A hypothetical alien civilization would derive the same equations based on these units, while they would have no notion of human units like meters, seconds, etc...</p>
<p>The Planck units don't fundamentally alter the physics. If an equation holds in regular units, it'll hold in imperial (US) units and it'll hold in Planck units, after rescaling it correctly. But for many branches of fundamental physics, working with Planck units is more convenient.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Planck time units in one second: ~2×10^43.</p>
<p>Seconds since the beginning of the universe: ~4×10^17.</p>
<p>There are actually <em>50 times</em> more Planck time units in a <em>picosecond</em> (one <em>billionth</em> of a millisecond) than picoseconds elapsed since the beginning of the universe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>The decay of the smallest possible black holes should take about that long (order of magnitude estimate).</p>
<p>While we haven't observed processes that short we do have the need for very short timescales. A Z boson has a lifetime of just 2.6*10^(-25) seconds. That is a measurement result.</p>
<p>These time units are impractical. The particles live so short that they are produced with a significant energy uncertainty: If we measure the mass of many particles their distribution will have some significant width, which is inversely proportional to the lifetime. Instead of the lifetime we use this width (&quot;decay width&quot;).</p>
<p>If the particles live long enough to fly some detectable distance then we sometimes talk about their lifetime multiplied by the speed of light, as that is the experimentally interesting parameter then.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
