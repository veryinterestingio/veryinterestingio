		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's usually a question of: HOW BAD IS BAD?</p>
<p>Once something passes through the stomach down into the intestines (\~6-8hrs after eating) it doesn't come back up.</p>
<p>If the food is Very Bad, i.e. it's already got a few million to billion bacteria on it, your body can recognize that before it exits the stomach, and send it back up. If it's Only Kind of Bad, i.e. a few hundreds to thousands of bacteria on it, it'll usually get past the stomach. If any of those bugs survived the stomach, they can start reproducing again once they're down in your GI tract, and that's when your body sounds the alarm to flush things outâ€”once the number of bacteria gets high enough that your body decides it's Very Bad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Largely, time from when you ate it though <em>both</em> are common. If your system recognizes the poison before it enters your intestine, you get vomiting. After, you get diarrhea. </p>
<p>Vomiting can start within the hour, often 30 minutes to 8 hours. </p>
<p>Diarrhea can start within 12 to 24 hours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It can depend on where the toxins are from the bacteria causing the food poisoning. Bacteria produced these toxins through a variety of normal biological actions such as multiplying. </p>
<p>If the toxins are in the food, your body will most likely pick these up in your stomach and this will cause you to vomit, as this is the quickest route out.</p>
<p>If the bacteria produce toxins in your body, it'll most likely happen in your intestine as this is a preferable environment to your stomach. Here they will produce toxins and your body will try to take the quickest route out, the back door.</p>
<p>And sometimes, just for kicks, your body will decide to empty everything out of both ends, just to be sure!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I ate Chipotle at noon one day. 30 minutes later I started feeling nauseous. Continued feeling worse throughout the day and developed a fever. Next day around noon, I threw up and it was literally only undigested Chipotle. Looked just the way I ate it. Within 30 minutes of throwing up I felt great again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vomit comes from your stomach if your body wants it out very soon after eating. Otherwise, it makes it to your small intestines and colon and if it isn't processed properly you can end up with diarrhea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
