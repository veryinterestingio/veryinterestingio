Like is their breasts getting squish(swimsuit) + bra to make it looks like it's not there or did their breasts disappear because they start developing muscle?</a>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It feeds on itself. High-level athletes often have very low body fat, which means their breasts are smaller, and there are also the effects others have mentioned like sports bras and tight clothing. However, the second part to this is that young girls who may have been promising athletes before puberty often get pushed out of their sport if they start developing large breasts and it’s a sport where that is a disadvantage. Just like why most gymnasts are short- it’s not that doing gymnastics or being an athlete makes them short, but that girls that stay short after puberty are more likely to be able to go on to become professional gymnasts because they have a natural advantage, while a girl that grows to 6 feet tall will no longer be able to beat the smaller girls and end up leaving gymnastics before the professional level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An anecdote: there was a girl two years above me in school who was an avid theatrical dancer. Her mother had very pronounced breasts while still being thin. The girl at my school was so dedicated to dancing that she was on track to be a professional theatrical danser. Towards the end of her freshman year of high school, her breasts started to develop. She began to complain of back issues during some numbers. She did not come back to school for sophomore year. Her family had all moved to Canada. She returned(same city, different school) for her Junior year with significantly smaller breasts than she had freshman year. It eventually came to light that she had a breast reduction in Canada, something harder to do in the USA at that age, so that she would continue to have a dancing career. </p>
<p>She has since performed with several touring shows in lead roles. Nothing on Broadway so far. </p>
<p>As others have mentioned, being an athlete means burning tons of Calories. Those that have naturally large breasts may also resort to reduction if they need it. Some also benefit athletically by very tight fitting clothing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Combo of most of the previous answers (low body fat means lower breast volume, large breasts not helpful for competing - although i think this effect is probably not that big for most events) but I think people are underrating the effect of clothing a lot - I can easily go down several sizes visibly just with a standard sports bra, which is a lot less tight than a lot of the outfits these athletes use. Look at differences in body shape between competition and not. The women who are in events that don't require a lot of upper body conditioning that look like they have super obvious pecs? That's mostly breast.</p>
<p>Edit- also note muscle mass has no real effect on breast mass - you can have heaps of muscles and big breasts, you just won't see this with body builders or most athletes because of low body fat. However if you look at athletes where body fat isn't an issue, you'll see a lot more variation - think athletic throwing events or non weight restricted weightlifting competitions as examples</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was a swimmer in high school. We had to wear suits that are a few sizes too small during meets to reduce friction in the water and improve our times. This squishes the breasts flat. Plus all the exercise of the upper body muscles reduces fat as other commenters have mentioned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
