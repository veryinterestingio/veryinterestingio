		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The popcorn bag has some metallic looking material built into one side of it that absorbs microwaves better. It basically acts as a microwave activated hot plate.</p>
<p>Turning the bag upside down puts this heat source on top which is less effective for its use as a hot plate, and would shield the microwaves from reaching the popcorn directly.</p>
<p>You popcorn will still pop but not as evenly or quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, for two reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>The bag has to unfold as it expands.  If you put it upside down, it will have a harder time unfolding and run out of run.  This could cause the bag to burst, allowing steam to escape and ending the popping process.</li>
<li>The bottom of the bag is reinforced to help the microwave heat the bag.  You can feel it if you touch the bag before and after it's popped.  The microwaves are supposed to hit it, heat the bag, which transfers more heat to the kernels and butter resting on it.  If you turn it upside, that material blocks microwaves and doesn't transfer heat to the kernels, slowing the process.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some caramel or butter flavoured ones have a thin sheet of butter or caramel that is on one side of the bag. When microwaved, it melts and coats the popcorn under it. If it's upside down, it just melts and forms a pool at the bottom of your bag.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Protip: classic brown paper lunch bags can be used to microwave popcorn kernels adequately enough to be convenient and low budget, even though it might not pop as efficient.
I've seen different techniques used before but I kept mine extremely simple because I'm lazy. I can't remember exactly but I used like a half cup of kernels or so and dumped them in, then just folded the top opening of the bag over itself a few times in a thin manner.  I've used scotch tape before and even once used a staple (no it didn't spark, might be too small, at least it didn't react in my microwave)  then I would just nuke on high for a few minutes and monitor like a normal bag of popcorn. The benefit is you get no added ingredients, chemicals etc and then you can just add what you want.
I've even stuck a pat of butter in the bag before to try get it flavored but it just ended up being a mess so adding stuff after just makes more sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
