		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The IUPAC has decided that the <a href="https://iupac.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pac20180918_v20181112.pdf" target="_blank">criterion for discovering a new element</a> is the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Discovery of a chemical element is the experimental demonstration, beyond reasonable doubt, of the existence of a nuclide with an atomic number Z not identified before, existing for at least 10^(−14) s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the physical explanation for 10^(-14) seconds is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note 1. This lifetime is chosen as a reasonable estimate of the time it takes for a nucleus to acquire its outer electrons. It is not considered self-evident that talking about an ‘element’ makes sense if no outer electrons, bearers of the chemical properties, are present.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It represents the minimal timescale over which the electron cloud can form, and therefore the absolute minimum timescale that it has to exist in order to participate in chemistry. If there are no isotopes which have half-lives greater than 10^(-14) seconds, then chemists don't consider it an element.</p>
