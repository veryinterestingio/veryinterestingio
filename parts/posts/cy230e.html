		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I heard the reason for this was that it was harder to modify or change the number after it was written by hand in a check or a ledger. For example if you wrote 10.50$ someone could add a 9 to the front and make it 910.50$. </p>
<p>Although that doesn't explain to me why literally every other country doesn't do this.</p>
<p>Edit: stop saying you can add numbers to the back, you can't because every dollar value is written like this: $$,cc. So if it's an even number it would still be written like this: $10,00. Since everyone expects there to be only two decimals after the , you can't add anything to the back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because before decimal money, British pounds were commonly written as 1, 2 or 3 numbers separated by a slash eg 6/3/1 for Pound(£) /Shilling<del>(d)</del> (s)/Pence<del>(p)</del> (d) . </p>
<p>Edit:shillings/pence my bad. Blame me being kiwi and half remembering what Nan said she called money</p>
<p>For 3 numbers, it's obvious that it means £/d/p</p>
<p>For 2 numbers, something like 7/4 could be £/d or d/p. For simplicity and legibility (remember, this was handwritten info), commonly the £symbol was the only extra info added at the start of the amount. Therefore, no £ meant d/p</p>
<p>For 1number, £ at the start for consistency with the other times its written, d and p at the end because whatever.</p>
<p>Tradition and continuation of established practices just put the $ where the £ originally lived</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about the dollar sign, but the percent sign is because it's actually a symbolic abbreviation for a phrase.  The original phrase was X per centum, literally meaning X (number) per hundred.  So it's written as it's read.</p>
<p>I'm still reading the other commenters about the $ sign thing, tho.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Convention would be the obvious explanation but putting it in the place of the decimal point actually would have one advantage.  In electronics, a 4.7 ohm resistor is often written as 4R7, a 1.2 megohm resistor is 1M2.
No chance of missing the decimal point.</p>
<p>So you could write 10 dollars and one cent as $10.01 or 10$01</p>
<p>But seeing it actually written down I hate it so lets not do it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
