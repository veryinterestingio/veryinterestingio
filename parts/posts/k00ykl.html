		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s a survival instinct. Back when humans were still Hunter gatherers, there was a lot of danger in sleeping since you leave yourself extremely vulnerable. So when you feel threatened at night you become more aware of your surroundings even as you sleep, and this leads to you automatically waking up early in the morning in preparation of danger. You anticipate danger so your body wakes up automatically. Now days we aren’t in danger when we sleep but the instincts still exist. So when you are anxious or expect something it triggers those same instincts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of our mind (the subconscious) keeps working over problems as we sleep, trying to make sense of our experiences. This is where a lot of dreams come from.</p>
<p>I used to be a computer programmer, and there were times that I reached a point in my work where I wasn't sure what the next step should be. I would intentionally go to bed while my brain was still thinking about the problem, and quite often when I would wake up in the morning, the solution would be very obvious to me - since my brain had spent the night sorting it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What puts you to sleep is the same thing that wakes you up: hormones. What wakes you are specific stress hormones, whose levels rise as you rest, until you wake up. Those levels rise faster when you have something out of the ordinary that adds stress.
