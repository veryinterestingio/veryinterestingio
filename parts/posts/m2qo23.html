		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is there a connection between what you eat and how you feel? A large body of research has demonstrated a strong association between the gut microbiome and mental health. Microbes have been associated with neurological disorders ranging from degenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS and dementia) to mental health disorders (like depression and anxiety) that are becoming all-too-prevalent in today's society. However, there is still much that we don't understand about how these relationships are established or maintained.</p>
<p>Join us today at 2 PM ET (19 UT) for a discussion with experts on what is being called the &quot;psychobiome&quot;, organized by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM). We'll discuss what we know about the relationships between microbes and hosts, how these relationships impact our behavior, moods and mental capacity, and what each of us can do to strengthen the health of our microbiomes, and, ultimately, improve our mental health.</p>

<p>Slight tangent from that, is there a particular regional or cultural diet you've found that has a better overall impact on these two? Would be interesting to see if a particular area of the world happened to naturally &quot;win&quot; in this regard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
