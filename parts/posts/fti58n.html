		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My question isn’t whether it’s hypothetically possible there was a small group of people back then, since we had our first confirmed case late January. </p>
<p>I’m asking if it’s possible that it had already started to spread in large scale that far back. </p>
<p>I live in Los Angeles and late January my entire office started to get sick. Not everyone, but a good percentage of people on my floor. We had around 20 people in the office. 5+ people got sick within 2 weeks. Some mild, some a little more severe. </p>
<p>I remember I got the “flu” and the fever lasted 3 days. I had a dry cough (which I never get. I’m a smoker and occasionally get bronchitis). I also didn’t heal for over a week. I kept feeling sick and eventually got a mouth infection as my cough persisted.</p>
<p>At the same time I was sick, the Human Resources assistant was out sick, and when she returned she had a sore throat and cough, mild fever, and red eyes. She was taking cough medicine. </p>
<p>Here’s the kicker. The HR director, was violently ill. She was out of office for over 2 weeks. Hospitalized after a few days of being sick. And it turned into pneumonia. She didn’t return until over 2 weeks after her symptoms had started, and from my knowledge, they didn’t know what was wrong with her. She was hospitalized a couple of days prior to January 20th if I’m not mistaken. </p>
<p>Now the main question here is, is it possible she had corona and they didn’t know or discover it even after she was hospitalized? Or would they have been able to conclude that since we at least knew about the corona during this time (but no active cases in the USA). </p>
<p>I’d love to know a statistic on whether or not there was an abnormal surge in pneumonia cases in the country starting back then. </p>
<p>I’m no conspiracy theorist, and would love a scientific opinion based on the details I provided. </p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As of even last week, before testing started ramping up, some ~85% of tests were still coming back negative. That is, even under the super restrictive testing regime where we were only testing people that we were super duper confident exhibited every single symptom of COVID 19 and we had tried to rule out every single other possible explanation, most of them actually didn't have the virus.</p>
<p>The problem with COVID 19 is the symptoms are so non-specific. There's so many other things that look exactly like it that aren't it. Most people will never have the worst flu of their lives in any given year, but that also means tens of millions of people will. Any other year, they would have just dismissed it as the worst flu of their lives and learnt something new about the flu. But now, you have millions of people who &quot;swore they got COVID 2, 3, 4 months ago&quot;. </p>
<p>If there's a lesson to be learnt from all of this, it's that the flu is bad, folks. It doesn't affect most people most years so many of us remain in blissful ignorance but the people it does affect seriously are still in the millions per year and deaths are in the 10s - 100s of thousands.</p>
<p>Get your yearly flu vaccine!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Influenza B was very prevalent just before SARS 2.0 took off in the US. I think that is why many are confused. There are a lot of respiratory diseases that we deal with on an annual basis, and they can't be distinguished based on clinical presentations. Diagnostic tests are needed. Most of the respiratory infections between Nov-Feb were influenza.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
