		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So to summarize a few good answers:</p>
<ol>
<li>indoor air is drier in winter, so sweat evaporates faster, cooling your skin;</li>
<li>there may be drafts and pockets of colder air near the floor;</li>
<li>the walls are colder and don't emit the usual amount of infrared radiation, so you lose heat due to your body emitting more IR than it receives;</li>
<li>you may spend more time indoors and hence have less physical activity, so your body generates less heat.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s all about energy (heat) balance.</p>
<p>First, we need to remember that Heat is  simple energy transferred by three different methods: conduction, convection, and radiation. Our bodies “feel” those methods of heat in different proportions.</p>
<p>It feels heat roughly thru 25% conduction, 25% convection, and 50% infra-red radiation.</p>
<p>Think about how you can stand in the sun on a freezing day and feel warm, and yet be freezing in the shade around the corner. The air hasn’t changed.</p>
<p>But what’s at play, are the surfaces (notably windows) around you - they get cooler (or warmer) as the seasonal temperatures change, and the balance of IR energy shifts (the emit less when they are cold, and more when they are warm).</p>
<p>There are optimal points where you feel comfortable - with warm surfaces, the air around you can actually be kept a few degrees cooler and you’ll feel fine. Likewise, if the surfaces around you are cooler, you’ll need to crank the air temperature up to compensate.</p>
<p>It’s also why in the summer, your house can feel suffocatingly hot at night, because all the inside surfaces have built up energy over the day and are releasing it, despite the air temperature being cool.</p>
<p>Humidity does play a small role, but only because water droplets can hold more heat energy than air, and give off a bit more IR.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humidity plays a big part in temp perception.  In the winter, outside colder air cannot hold the same amount of humidity as hotter summer air, so typically your house, while the same temp, has less humidity.  Even if you have a humidifier, it's tough to match the potentional summer air humidity.  That difference eventually makes it into your house.</p>
<p>The lower the humidity, the more moisture evaporates on your skin, making you feel cooler despite the temp at the thermostat saying the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE MISSED A KEY PART OF THE ANSWER.</p>
<p>Even the current top answer has missed the answer. It's not all attributed to humidity. Far from it. Humidity can be controlled but you will still feel colder.</p>
<p>The other key ingredient is radiation.</p>
<p>In cold weather, the walls and windows of the room will be colder, and so you will experience more radiative heat loss, even though the air is at the same temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason is that the walls of your house are colder in winter than they are in the summer. They are cooler than the room (air) temperature because the walls are touching the cold outside. Your body is constantly emitting infra-red radiation (heat) to the things around you and they are doing the same to you. In winter the walls do not emit as much radiation but you lose the same or more so you feel colder.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
