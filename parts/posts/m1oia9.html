		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wrote a whole report on this last semester. The short answer: yes. A lot. Salt is really bad for vegetation on the roadside, and any animals in water nearby. And some cities don't really care about how much salt they spread. But other places are looking into alternative deicers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Germany it is illegal for private home-owners to use salt on the streets (in <em>most</em> communes, I should add) and the cities only use it for specific locations (like, main roads) or even on highways only - exactly because it is extremely bad for the environment and in particular to roadside plants and trees, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Salt is substantially worse for the environment than sand. Sand was originally replaced with salt because you can <em>see</em> sediment being added to rivers and other water bodies as runoff. However, it turns out that sand is easy to remove from runoff, since you just need to slow down the water enough to settle it out. Salt, on the other hand, is extremely difficult to remove (think ion exchange or reverse osmosis).</p>
<p>Marine animals (and plants) thrive in different levels of salt in the water. That's one reason ocean species are different from freshwater ones. One impact is that species that cannot tolerate a large change in salt concentration in the water die. I'm interested to learn about other environmental impacts as well, that's just what I know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's horrible for the environment. If you study sustainability, there are multiple examples of societies being ruined by the irrigation of fields with slightly salty water. Over time the salt builds up until eventually nothing will grow.</p>
<p>While a small amount of salt isn't toxic or poisonous, it's the fact that it builds up that's bad. In the city, where many people here put salt on the sidewalk, it builds up in the culverts and drainage ditches and changes what can grow and live (some species can tolerate more salt). Over decades it can make it impossible for some land to grow anything. It can also be washed downstream and build up on farmlands and fields, affecting how crops grow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I used to live in upstate NY, they started salting the roads right before the 1984 Olympics and have every winter since. They ecological damage to the sides of the roads have been immense. </p>
