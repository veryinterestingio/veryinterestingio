		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a capitalist economy the means of production (The places and tools that make things. Factories, mills, shops, etc) are owned by &quot;Capitalists&quot; who are private individuals. Laborers sell their labor to capitalists in exchange for a wage.</p>
<p>In a socialist economy the means of production are owned by the people, either as small groups (worker-owned shops) or as the state (government owned business). Laborers still work for a wage, but also maintain an ownership share in the business.</p>
<p>Socialist economies can also be planned economies, which means that a central organization plans economic output.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Socialism is often confused with social programs, leading some people to say that we need an economy that is a mix of the two or that we already live in an economy that incorporates elements of socialism. This is political ignorance and doesn’t make sense in the context of world history at all. The United States and the European nations are not socialist, they are capitalist. They are not working with strict laissez-faire capitalism, but they are capitalist. </p>
<p>The difference between socialism and capitalism is who owns “the means of production.” The MoP are workplaces where goods and services are offered. You most likely spend 40 hours a week at one. </p>
<p>In capitalism, capitalists own the MoP. Property rights are set up in such a way that the individual who makes the initial purchase retains control over the business, even if it grows to need thousands of people to run it.</p>
<p>In socialism, the MoP are run by the workers. For example, the workers at the local steel mill would democratically decide on the price of their product, who to hire and fire, et cetera. The workers run the workplace in the socialist ideal. This is what Marx meant by the “abolition of property.” That phrase scares a lot of people into thinking that socialists believe that nobody can have personal belongings, but socialists differentiate between private property (the MoP in the current economic system) and personal property (your individual belongings). </p>
<p>So the key difference is lateral vs vertical organization of industry. This is a broad strokes explanation but if you want me to delve into the details lmk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These things have very complicated and debatable definitions. Here are some general guidelines, but keep in mind that people use these terms very casually and imprecisely, often just meaning &quot;stuff I like&quot; and &quot;stuff I don't like,&quot; switched back and forth depending on one's political sentiments.</p>
<ol>
<li>The central question is who owns the &quot;means of production,&quot; aka &quot;capital&quot; -- i.e. the physical stuff that is necessary to create the physical goods that are traded throughout the economy. Traditionally this means things like factories, mines, workshops, farmland, etc. It can also theoretically mean infrastructure like powerlines/powerplants, roads, vehicles, even housing. It could also mean service industry assets, such as hospitals, schools, fire/safety/police services, etc.</li>
<li>&quot;Socialist&quot; control of these &quot;means of production&quot; means that they are owned collectively by the entire population of society. Typically, this means that they are owned by the government -- whether by the central government of an entire country, or by a more local governmental entity.</li>
<li>&quot;Capitalist&quot; control means instead that they are owned privately by particular people. This can be individual owners, or groups of owners joined together, such as in a corporation. Generally speaking, private owners are able to buy and sell their capital to others.</li>
<li>You may notice that in nearly every country in the real world, there is a mix of &quot;socialist&quot; and &quot;capitalist&quot; ownership of these various capital types. For example, in the USA, we have socialist ownership of fire departments, public schools, public libraries, roads, and many other things, while having &quot;capitalist&quot; ownership of lots of other parts of the economy, like banking, most industrial production, mining,  We even have areas where we have a government-owned &quot;socialist&quot; entity, that competes with &quot;capitalist&quot; private companies -- like public and private schooling, mail and package delivery, etc. Likewise, even in highly socialist countries like Cuba, or the former Soviet Union, there is still a lot of private economic activity in areas such as food production, hospitality, entertainment, etc. (as well as often a thriving black market of illegal trading in goods that the government tries to control).</li>
<li>So when we speak of &quot;a socialist economy&quot; vs. &quot;a capitalist economy,&quot; we're talking about the general trend and orientation of an economy, not a 100% description of every economic activity in that county.</li>
<li>So, a &quot;socialist economy&quot; is designed to maximize the amount of the economy that is controlled by socialist means, on the theory that socialist control is better and more just. And a &quot;capitalist economy&quot; is designed to maximize how much of the economy is privately controlled, on the theory that private ownership is more just and more free.</li>
<li>There are definitely weird cases that complicate this whole picture in the real-world. For example, the People's Republic of China is theoretically a socialist country, but transitioned into a mostly capitalist private-ownership model over the past 40 years. But the PRC government and the Chinese Communist Party still retain very close relationships of control over major Chinese corporations. So is China &quot;socialist&quot; or &quot;capitalist&quot;? Likewise, the U.S. military contractor system -- which Eisenhower called the &quot;military industrial complex&quot; --  is a weird combination of private companies coordinating with the government. Is that socialism?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Socialism, in the classical, Marxist sense, is state ownership of industry. Instead of being employed by wealthy investors, workers are employed by the state. So, instead of Google being managed by an organization structure comprised of agreements made between private citizens, it's owned by the state, and managed by a group of political appointees and bureaucrats.</p>
<p>It's important to note that these are concepts with no accurate mirrors in reality. A purely capitalist society would have privately owned roads and highways, paid for by tolls, private, subscription-based police forces, and private schools. Likewise, it's impossible to subject every aspect of life to government supervision and control, which is why black markets thrive in the most oppressive, autocratic socialist regimes, better than they do in capitalist societies.</p>
<p>The principal difference between Capitalism and Socialism is the price of failure. A privately-owned business will go bankrupt when it fails. A government run business can continue to operate at a loss, supporting waste and inefficiency so long as the entire government remains functional. However, when that happens, the collapse of your government goes society-wide. For a recent example, check out Venezuela.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
