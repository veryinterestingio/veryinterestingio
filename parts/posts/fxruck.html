		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your adrenal gland produces adrenaline in response to <del>hormonal</del> nerve triggers(1) when your fight or flight response is activated.</p>
<p>In short, adrenaline is <del>produced</del> released(2) when you need it. If it was just floating around inside of <del>you</del> your bloodstream then you would constantly be in a state of fight or flight. Being in that state all the time would be highly taxing on the body.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adrenaline is stored in a gland located at top of kidneys. It is a hormone(a body fluid) which directly releases into blood much like when we spray perfume not like in centralized ac pipes so that we get fast reaction.  Since blood is flowing to each part of our body it reacts accordingly</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it a bit like a tap - you see something your body interprets as scary/threatening (quick note: this is part of what leads to the symptoms of anxiety attacks - happy to expand on it if you want). This automatically sends a signal to your adrenal glands (these are little pyramid shaped structures on top of your kidneys). As soon as they get the signal the adrenaline &quot;tap&quot; turns on and releases some adrenaline straight into your bloodstream which carries it all around your body. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now it's in your blood, the effect comes about because throughout your body you have molecules on cells that can recognise the adrenaline molecule and cause their cells to respond appropriately. As a mechanism fight or flight was made for what it says on the tin - namely movement, so it's a similar response to what you'll get if you exercise with a few extra things thrown on top:</p>
<p>- Heart rate and amount of blood output with each pump increases</p>
<p>- Breathing rate and amount of air breathed in and out increases</p>
<p>- Blood vessels to your brain and muscles get wider to allow more blood flow </p>
<p>- Extra things - pupils dilate (lets in more light), hairs stand on end (best theory I've heard is this is similar to cats and wolves where making their hairs stand on end makes them look bigger and more scary)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Once this has happened, even if the thing that stimulated this response initially has disappeared, the effects hang around for a bit longer because hormones like adrenaline take a while to get broken down and removed from your blood in comparison to a nerve impulse that's super quick and more on/off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Synapse_diag1.svg/800px-Synapse_diag1.svg.png" target="_blank">Synapse of a neuron</a> - note <strong>vesicle.</strong> This is where neurotransmitter is stored for future release. Before release the vesicle melts to the wall and opens up this way, letting the neurotransmitters out. Since synapse (a space) between two neurons is very small, the released neurotransmitter bumps into receptors on the surface on nearby neuron. Receptor is formed in a way where the neurotransmitter it needs is 'attracted' like a magnet to the receptor and knows exactly which way the receptor is and fits right in. This way it transfers the signal to the next neuron.</p>
<p>Receptors on the surface of the nearby neuron are activated by the released neurotransmitters from the vesicle and increases the overall voltage / 'charge' of that neuron. If enough neurotransmitters fit all the receptors <em>(they instantly detach, they stay in the receptor for 0.2-0.5 of a second before detaching)</em> the voltage charge increases enough to 'fire' and shoots an electrical impulse from one end to the other end , where again a vesicle is 'told' to release neurotransmitters, which activate receptors on nearby neuron's surface identical to the first one and this way the signal travels from neuron to neuron  delivering a 'message' this way.</p>
<p>Immediately after a neurotransmitter bumps into receptor, does its job and detaches, a 'transporter' immediately collects the floating around neurotransmitters and picks them up and  then repackes them back into the neuron's vesicle for again future use.</p>
<p>TL'DR: There's a vesicle (a bag/'backpack') inside the insides of a neuron,where neurotransmitter molecules (<em>dopamine/serotonin and alike)</em> are stored for future use.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>While its in the vesicle its INACTIVE. You have to understand a neurotransmitter 'acts' only once its released and attaches to a receptor, this way activating it. Without activating it the neurotransmitter just floats around in the synapse doing nothing. After a while its picked up by the 'transporter' or just destroyed because its useless. </p>
<p>This is how beta blockers work, they attach on the receptor without activating it, just staying there. So when adrenaline is released, it floats around and has no available receptor to attach to and activate, because the betablocker occupies the receptor. Since the adrenaline molecule floats around and cant activate the receptor, nothing happens, the adrenaline just gets picked up back to the vesicle. This way the adrenaline molecule couldnt transfter the message, and the signal ends right there, and doesnt travel to where it should, where it would do its job (increasing heart rate, anxiety, perspiration, etc)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
