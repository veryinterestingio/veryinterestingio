		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's based on your Bluetooth. You can turn it on/off in the settings, and it explicitly states, &quot;Allow car view to automatically turn on when Spotify connects to your car's bluetooth.&quot; So if you were a passenger, and you connected it to the Bluetooth of the car you were in, car view would come on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're using Bluetooth then that could be a way it knows. iPhones know to turn on DND while driving when you connect to a car stereo. I'd imagine it's similar to that</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Root (insurance company) also claims that their app can determine when you’re driving versus when you’re a passenger, because your phone moves differently when you’re a passenger. I assume that to mean either the phone is used a lot more often or that the application is using the phone sensors to detect any small movement that syncs up when, say, you turn the steering wheel or hit the brakes (which could be picked up if it’s in your pocket, in theory). If it detects a quick movement due to your leg moving and then the car slows down, it could pretty accurately guess you’re the one controlling it. I’ve got no idea if this is legitimately happening though. </p>
<p>Mostly posting because I’m curious if anyone here knows what’s really going on as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
