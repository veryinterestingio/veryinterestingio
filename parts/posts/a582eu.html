Every once in a while, people will have phone issues and as I talk to them, even though they can hear me and I can hear them, I will hear the almost immediate feedback of my voice saying everything I just said.  At least for me, it makes it very confusing and difficult for me to keep the conversation going coherently because I have to really think about what I'm saying and there tends to be a lot of pauses as I speak.  Is this a common phenomenon, and why does it happen?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Speech utilizes a feedback loop. You don't just think of a sentence and your mouth automatically says it from vocal memory. Your brain is constantly monitoring the sound of your voice in real time to keep it sounding like you want it to. Sort of like walking across a tightrope. You don't have a memorized sequence of movements needed to cross. Your mind is constantly analyzing your balance and correcting itself. This is why deaf people have difficulty speaking clearly. When you have your voice played back with a delay, your brain confuses what you're actually saying and what is being played back so that it &quot;corrects&quot; itself based off the delayed sound which then causes the strange sounding speech. So it's kind of like if you are walking the tightrope but your sense of balance is one second behind. You're gonna fall off because you need real time feedback.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a tool that's basically a unidirectional mic and directed speaker. It will echo audio with a slight delay but only in a very specific place so the target hears the echo but nobody else does.</p>
<p>It shuts people up immediately and can be used from across the room.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a similar vein, I used to work in satellite communications, with most of that supporting military public affairs. Basically or system allowed deployed units to run live interviews with tv stations and networks stateside. One of the things I had to cover in the training was the roughly half second round trip delay that you get over satellite.</p>
<p>The challenge is that when these soldiers/Marines/etc... had gone to the DINFOS school, all the &quot;umms&quot; and &quot;ahhs&quot; had been trained out of them. I basically had to tell them to forget all of that because when dealing with the satellite link, they had to keep talking until they were done, filling in the empty spots so the other side wouldn't step on them.</p>
<p>The best example of why this was important happened one time when President Obama ran a press briefing from Afghanistan... Both he and the media kept trying over each other due to the delay.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
