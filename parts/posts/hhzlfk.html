<ol>
<li>
<p>The disease is fully contained and erradicated through quarantine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conditions change such that the pathogen is less infectuous (mutation/environmental changes). It then either dies out or becomes part of a seasonal disease cycle.</p>
</li>
<li>Herd immunity is established either through a vaccine or natural immunity.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Diseases survive by being passed between viable hosts. Your immune system, given the opportunity, will try to fight the virus, and will hopefully eradicate it from your body. Or you might die. If the disease spreads to everyone, and all we have left are people who survived, the pandemic will largely end.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if we prevent the disease from spreading, it can also end because the virus is eradicated in the few people infected without infecting new hosts. This one is hard to achieve when you have a large number of infected, and lots of opportunity to spread.</p>
<p>The vaccine will make the disease harder to spread because the <del>vaccine</del> <em>virus</em> will have difficulty finding a susceptible host, but there are other options if we employ them universally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vaccines and quarantine are the most effective way to prevent a virus from spreading. </p>
<p>Other than that, a contagious disease will continue to spread until the majority of the population gets it. We then develop herd immunity. This can be illustrated as follows:</p>
<p>When a virus first begins to spread, everyone can catch it, so one case may spread to several others that were in contact with the infected. However, as more people have contracted the virus and develop immunity, the rate of spread decreases as these members of the population no longer contract the virus. Once most people have had it (~70% for covid), the rate of spread slows to the point that the virus begins to die out, as there aren’t enough hosts to keep the virus spreading.</p>
<p>However, this all assumes the virus doesn’t evolve quickly. Some viruses like influenza mutate so quickly that we can’t develop long-term immunity. Coronavirus may fall under this seasonal category, in which case we will need a covid shot along with our flu shot every year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pandemics end when the disease either becomes endemic to the population or is eradicated. The first happens naturally when the population has built up enough immunity (either through vaccination or infection) to stem the reproduction or the disease. Eradication is when the disease dies out, either through mutation (and subsequently a new pandemic phase if the new mutation is different enough to bypass immunity) or die off due to lack or reproductive capability.</p>
<p>COVID-19, as a virus, needs a host to reproduce. Either we get enough people with immunity to eradicate the virus (don't know the specific A value, but around 50-75% herd immunity) or we eventually become endemic and as people lose their immunity over time, get reinfected and we see peaks and valleys of infection rate until we can eradicate it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Take a hint from Portugal (where I live). Record low numbers during forced quarantine.</p>
<p>As soon as normal life resumed, even with imposed restrictions, it started to spread like wildfire.</p>
<p>It's severe enough that many countries closed the air bridge to us.</p>
<p>It's not possible to contain this virus without HEAVY restrictions, and thorough enforcement. Not without a vaccine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
