		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After the general election on November 3rd, the Electoral college votes in their home states on December 14th.  Then their votes are actually counted in the Senate on January 6th, and <em>that</em>'s when the election results become official, then the inauguration is on the 20th.  So there's technically only a 2-week period between the election and inauguration day.</p>
<p>The system is very much designed around people having to travel a couple thousand miles on horseback.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whilst this is a great eli5 question,  OP, it is worth reflecting that our AUS upper house can have longer time frames between election and result as they are appointed for 6 years, but elections can be held whenever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it's also worth noting that Australia has a parliamentary government, unlike the US.   However, other presidential systems don't necessarily have the same delay the US does.  South Korea's current president assumed office the same day the election results were certified.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simply put... we have a pretty diverse geography that made travel in the past more difficult. </p>
<p>Inauguration used to be March 4th (that's like four months from election day!) to make sure the incoming president had a chance to move and get settled in. The earlier Congress also did an analysis of the calendar and determined that March 4th was less likely to fall on a Sunday than other dates (didn't want to do official business on a Sunday!!).</p>
<p>Then they decided that that was <em>too</em> long of a wait and transportation had improved so they moved it up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of the issue for the present day as to why it doesn't get changed now that we have modern transportation, is the thousands of people that the new administration has to hire and the over 1000 they have to get through Senate confirmation.</p>
<p>Those people have to be briefed and get staff in place...it's a lot of work to get done over the holiday season.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
