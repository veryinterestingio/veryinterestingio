Does this mean that at some point in the distant future we will actually be able to see it with the naked eye, and what would this look like? (Assuming of course we survive that long as a species)</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Redshift&quot; means that the wavelengths get longer, and microwaves are already longer wavelength than visible light, so no, it won't ever become visible (barring a Big Crunch scenario, but that is pretty much excluded by cosmological data). </p>
<p>The CMB radiation currently peaks at about a wavelength of 1 mm (10^-3 meters), while the longest-wavelength light that our eyes can see is around 750 nm (7.5 x 10^-7 meters). </p>
<p>When the CMB was emitted, the universe was at a temperature of 3000 K, which is a little hotter than your typical incandescent light bulb, so the emitted light was mostly in the visible and near-infrared, and would look like a warm yellowish glow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Adding on a little bit to the excellent answer by /u/Das_Mime, it should be noted that the in the pictures of what the current CMB &quot;looks like&quot;, the high contrast colors are exaggerating the temperature differences.  For example, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background#/media/File:WMAP_2010.png" target="_blank">this picture</a> the difference between the red and blue represents only 0.0002 degrees difference.  To the eye, back when it was visible, it would have appeared completely uniform.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Note that there is actually a way to make the CMB visible: by travelling fast enough that it is heavily blueshifted. <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/156318/could-i-see-the-cosmic-microwave-background-if-it-were-doppler-shifted-enough" target="_blank">This kind person</a> has calculated that the CMB would be visible and quite bright when travelling at 0.99999835c - and would appear as a completely uniform white light. This is conveniently quite close to the top speed of particles in the SPS particle accelerator (~0.999998c).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
