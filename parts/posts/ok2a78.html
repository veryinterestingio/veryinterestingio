		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whenever you pour something into a mold to solidify, you have to worry about getting it out again, and that's much easier when the walls are at an angle like \___/. That's also why molds for cakes or ice cubes are often shaped that way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s to do with the shape of the mould an ease of getting the metal out. Needing the curved sides to release for the mould easier, theres more chance of the metal being stuck in a mould that’s cube shaped. Also, the metal cools better in this shape, cools a lot more evenly resulting in a smaller chance of cracks etc forming.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you pack wet sand into a bucket and turn it upside down on your castle, the sand comes out in one piece as the shape of your bucket.<br />
If you pack sand into a coffee cup and turn it upside down, likely only the first inch would come out and the rest would be stuck in the bottom of the cup.<br />
As others have said, the angle of the walls helps the bar be removed more easily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
