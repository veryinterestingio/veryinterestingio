		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because brick roads were uneven and people had a lower standard.</p>
<p>Ancient roads accomodated foot traffic and relatively light vehicles. They needed only to not be dirt, so the surface of the road doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Modern roads carry much heavier loads and the surface must be smooth. An uneven road quickly destroys heavy vehicles movung quickly.</p>
<p>Modern roads are much more durable than brick and stone roads. They are just also used significantly more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Those old stone roads weren’t dealing with 18 wheelers driving over them. They weren’t even dealing with cars weighing thousands of pounds each driving all over them all day long 24/7. The amount of wear on “Ye Olde Stoney Roade” was trivial compared to modern roads.</p>
</li>
<li>Those ancient brick and stone roads that still exist are most definitely maintained. The wear. They crack. Water gets in and freezes. They wear a lot really. Just where they still exist they’re normally in quieter areas. None of them are highways taking tens of thousands of vehicles a day or they’d be rubble within a week.</li>
</ol>
<p>Modern concrete and asphalt roads are very high performance, just we have enormous demands of them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>That idea suffers from a load of data sampling errors.</p>
<p>Yes, I can take you to a Roman [180AD] pool in Tunisia still holding water.</p>
<p>Yes, I can show you crumbling concrete culverts from 1956.</p>
<p>There are millions of tons of modern concrete/asphalt infrastructure holding up very well and nobody's photographing it. </p>
<p>Most of Rome's concrete is at the bottom of the Tyrennian Sea...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The last thing you want to do is drive a motorized vehicle at highway speeds over brick. Initially it would be OK, but bricks will dip and rise over time making it dangerous to drive on at any high rate of speed. The best solution is to install concrete in chunks (like the autobahn) so you get all the benefits of concrete - resistance to cratering in the sun, water channels help keep water off the tires, rough concrete is safer to brake on, concrete roads can last an awful long time. The problem is cracking, especially in colder climates where you will get water expanding and contracting seasonally. Solution, put them down like huge bricks, that way when one cracks it won't spread, and it is a fairly simple task to replace the section.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Asphalt roads have a noise damping and cushioning effect, and are inexpensive to repair and source materials for.</p>
<p>Ancient roads use very expensive materials that are costly to transport and require large amounts of skilled labor. I'm not aware of any types of durable ancient roads that are smooth and friendly toward rubber tires and hydraulic suspension systems either. They're all fairly rough in texture.</p>
<p>Also, &quot;solid&quot; roads don't handle repeated freezing and exposure to deicing materials any better than modern roads do, and this is the cause of most road damage. In my state they have several concrete interstate highways and they are not any better than asphalt highways because not only are they maddening to drive on (clack, clack, clack, clack) but they have to be regularly shaved to even out frost heaving or they develop stress cracks and get potholes the same as asphalt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
