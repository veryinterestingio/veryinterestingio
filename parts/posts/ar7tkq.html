		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Civil engineer here, been on asphalt inspection for the past few years. There’s a few reasons as to what could cause a failure. The first layers of dirt, referred to as sub grade, if not compacted and graded properly could cause slippage. If any layer is not compacted properly in a certain spot, that could also cause issues. </p>
<p>The most common reason for potholes I’ve experienced is issues with tack. Tack is the black stuff sprayed between asphalt layers to help them adhere to each other. If one small spot gets either A) not enough tack B) dirt, dust, water, or anything intrusive that gets tacked and then paved over, it can cause slippage. Slippage is when the layers aren’t compacted, or aren’t up to density and they slide and break apart. </p>
<p>As other people have mentioned, water expansion could be a factor, however I’ve never noticed it really being the main cause in my state at least (NC). The base layers of asphalt have larger aggregate which cause more gaps to actually allow water to move through, expand, and breathe. As you get to the surface layers the aggregate is much smaller and the mix gets finer which does not allow water to permeate. There is so much focus when a road is built around where water goes and making sure it goes to the right place that the issue of water freezing and expanding isn’t as common, at least in my experience. Hope this helps! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are caused by the expansion and contraction of ground water after the water has entered into the ground under the pavement. When water freezes, it expands. Think of when ice cubes are made. A tray full of water is put into the freezer, and when you remove the tray from the freezer, you will notice the water has expanded. This same effect happens when water gets into the ground under the pavement. If it has a chance to freeze, it will take up more space under the pavement, and the pavement will expand, bend, and crack, which weakens the material pavement. Then when ice melts, the pavement contracts and leaves gaps or voids in the surface under the pavement, where water can get in and be trapped. If the water freezes and thaws over and over, the pavement will weaken and continue cracking.</p>
<p>As the weight of cars and trucks pass over the weak spot in the road, pieces of the roadway material weaken, which will cause the material to be displaced or broken down from the weight, creating the pothole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve always wondered how the pothole actually gets “dug out.”  Like, what creates the upward force necessary to push the broken materials up out of the hole?  I find that when I drive by brand new potholes, it’s as if someone came by with a shovel and dug out a hole. Seems odd when the only forces acting are the large downward forces from tires. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is mostly a form of frost heave.  Water expands when it turns into ice.  The shape that results in the hole depends a lot on the nature of the bed (gravel and/or packed sand) and plucking of the asphalt surface (especially by plows), but the general idea is that there is a center of volume expansion, which tends toward producing a roundish raised area, and eventually a roundish hole.  In addition, there is the role of change in packing when the ice melts (undergrade, the bed, can settle unevenly).  This is why potholes tend to be worst in the spring.  Lots of freeze-melt cycles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a person who used to do land surveying... I myself have cut holes in asphalt with hand tools that would look exactly how you describe it. We put the chunk we take out back but nothing keeping it in.</p>
<p>The reason being contractors paving over pins or elevation benchmarks. Depending on the job we’d need to physically “recover” a pin that was set at a property corner. We’d need to be able to see it and metal detect it and the. Take a measurement of where it is.</p>
<p>Usually pins would be dead center in roads like in an intersection. So yes I’d be in the middle of an intersection cutting a hole in the road to find a metal pin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
