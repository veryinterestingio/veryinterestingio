		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The javelin doesn't always land point-first and stick in the ground. When it doesn't, it kind of slides along the ground, but the meet official needs to mark it where it first touched the ground. To complicate matters, if it lands flat they're supposed to measure from where the grip hits the ground. If it lands tail-first, they measure from the tail. All of that is difficult to do when you're far away. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They could stand further away, but they'd still need to pay close attention, both to be able to see that the javelin struck the ground in the right way, and because they still in front of the thrower and could still get hit. And if they are paying close attention, they can move out of the way easily, so there's no extra risk from standing in the middle of the field.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I use to actually judge javelin for my schools home meets and was the one out on the field. The main reason is that it is easier to see where it lands the closer you are. Also you will be doing a lot of jogging around over the course of the day so saving just that little distance can add up a lot. If I had a runner for the javelin I would also just throw it to the side to save on even more unneeded running.</p>
<p>On a side note it is also fun watching the freshmen sweat when you are standing only 60 feet away or so. And over the course of watching literally thousands of throws I have never been hit once. I will even purposely wait to dodge till the last second to watch them sweat even more. ðŸ˜ˆ</p>
<p>You can also very easily tell a good javelin thrower from a newbie pretty easily. So it is easy while their doing their line up to just back step so that you aren't 60 feet out for a 150 feet thrower.</p>
<p>Edit: used wrong unit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
