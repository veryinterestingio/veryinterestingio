		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human skin does not have a lot of green in it. In fact it is almost the exact opposite color. And green is not a very usual color of items either. And on a more technical note most lenses are calibrated so that they work best with green colors as this is a wavelength in the middle of the spectrum. If you calibrate the lense for blue colors then the red will be out of focus and if you calibrate it for red then the blue will be out of focus. But if you calibrate the lense for green color then the red and blue will both only be slightly out of focus. This also means that the green color is usually the sharpest in the image.</p>
<p>As for other colors blue is also very common. It used to be more common before when the chromakey effect was done purely chemically and optically in labratories as it was easier to use. However as the effect is now mostly digital we can use any color we like and therefore tends to select green. But you do occationally see blue being used for various reasons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because humans dont have green in their natural color. But it realy does not need to be green, a blue screen is common too. The background just needs to be a color that does not appear in the foreground you film, and that is mostly a human.</p>
<p>Green and blue work so good because they are rare in humans(only the eyes can be ether)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I recommend it.</p>
<p>TL;DW: humans aren't green (usually) and more pixels are set to gather green in digital cameras (due to the Bayer filter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer\_filter" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer\_filter</a></a>).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Green and blue are used because they’re not present in normal skin tones. This makes rotoscoping (cutting out) people much easier since the edges are much sharper and well-defined.</p>
<p>Any color could be used, but it depends a lot on the colors of the things being filmed. Because of the skin tone issue though, blue and green have become the industry standards just because there’a virtually no need for more than two color options.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modern digital cameras have twice the number of green receptors in their sensors than blue or red (laid out as RGBG repeated over and over - the Bayer filter). So using green can help with the definition and,most importantly, it means much less noise in the green channel of an image (see below).</p>
<p>In addition, green is not the color of skin or a lot of other usual items we use in sets. If we used a red screen then separating the red from human skin tone would be very difficult.</p>
<p>That said, Blue Screen is actually more desired by vfk artists in some situations, particularly because it actually interacts even less with human skin - green light contains yellow which is present in skin and removing green can cause more noise than removing blue. But it has more digital noise than green light does so it has typically been avoided. Modern cameras are better though (and we use different lights now) so Blue has made a big comeback.</p>
<p>Blue is also quite useful for outside shoots when you have organic environments, because organics are usually green. Green screen with trees is not fun.</p>
<p>Blue is also generally prefered for emulsion film, because the blue channel in that film is less noisey. This is why you'll see blue screens on older films like Jurassic Park.</p>
<p>Speaking of Noise, it's the little grains of colour variation in an image, and it can make the removal of a green or blue screen difficult, particularly when the color of the screens spill onto the skin of people - and our skin is reflective so that's not an uncommon problem. We actually refer to this phenomena as Spill and its something we try to avoid while lighting green/blue screens. But when it is present it can be a challenge to remove.</p>
<p>On a side note, Red Screens have also been used in the past, specifically on miniature shoots where there is no human element.</p>
