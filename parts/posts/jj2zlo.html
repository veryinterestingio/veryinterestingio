		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Firstly, I wanna make it clear: I am *not* trying to exotify or mock Black names or Black culture. I am *fully* in support of Black parents being able to name their kids what they want. I think that coming up with non-slave-names is a powerful reclamation of what was stolen from them. Mocking these names (or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CG0QZM7jTLn/" target="_blank">refusing to pronounce them</a>) is straight-up racist.</p>
<p>What I'm curious about: why were *those* names chosen in particular?</p>
<p>I know the trend of Black name reclamation started in the 60s, and it rose with the Black Power Movement. I know that a lot of Black people took Muslim names, or names from SubSaharan cultures. But the names I'm talking about (LaKeisha, Devonte, Shanice, D'Andre, etc) don't seem to have roots in SubSaharan or North African cultures.</p>
<p>EDIT: to clarify: I'm wondering where the name &quot;Devonte&quot; came from. Or names that start with La or D', etc. These unique names aren't completely random. There are trends amongst them, trends that were picked up by Black families nationwide. This implies they have shared roots and/or influences. So what are those roots/influences?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_names" target="_blank">Wikipedia says</a> the names have French origins, starting in New Orleans. I can see the French influence for sure (La, D', etc)... but most Black people in this country don't come from New Orleans. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Great_Migration_(African_American)" target="_blank">They may have origins in the South</a>, but most don't come from New Orleans or even French Louisiana. So why did Black families nationwide begin adopting French-inspired naming conventions, starting in the same decade?</p>
<p>Hope this question makes sense. Thanks for your response!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an interesting question and all the replies so far are slightly missing the point. The fact that these names appear very quickly across all the US and to a lesser extent UK and Canada implies there must be some common inspiration or celebrity or fictional character that people heard and used. Maybe it was just organic word of mouth but it seems very quick for that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The gist of it is that there have always been distinctly “black” names in the US and the names do t necessarily have a distinct old world cultural tie to, say, Africa.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some thoughts that might make looking for information more straightforward:</p>
<p>1)Are those names a remnant of the slave names or are they a counterpoint against them; were they used mostly after the abolishion or also before?</p>
<p>2)Who named the salves and what were common names? Were they completely different?</p>
<p>3)The names often sound French-ish. Is there a connection to french-english rivalry (e.g. They chose names in a sense of rebellion again the English &quot;masters&quot;) </p>
<p>Also owners might have wanted to differentiate between their employees/friends/family and the slaves they owned which would easy be accomplished by a different naming convention </p>
<p>Also: It's possible French sounding names sound exotic and noble, which then would go back to the point of &quot;giving the kids powerful names&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
