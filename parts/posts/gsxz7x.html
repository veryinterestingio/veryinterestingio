		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It induces stress. Animals don't always hate eye contact, though. Although looking an unfamiliar dog in the eye will prompt aggression, when a dog makes eye contact with their owner, they get a release of oxytocin and dopamine in the brain. </p>
<p>Most mammals have a facial recognition process that at least resembles our own. When they see a face they recognize, the brain says &quot;friend,&quot; and they feel safe. When they see a face they don't recognize, the brain says &quot;stranger,&quot; and they feel threatened. The longer you hold their gaze, the more stressed they get, and the only way they can resolve that stress is fighting or fleeing. </p>
<p>In addition, the more social a species is, the less likely they are to take eye contact as a sign of aggression. Take as an example our two closest evolutionary cousins: chimpanzees and bonobos. Chimps form strong social bonds within their immediate family, and weak ones with the wider tribal structure. Family members usually enjoy, or at least tolerate, eye contact, but if two chimps aren't closely bonded, eye contact will upset them to the point of extreme violence. Bonobos are much more sociable, forming tight bonds with one another constantly and practically at random. Their eye contact is more enjoyable, and even when it induces stress, most bonobo societies dispel that stress through sexual activity, rather than ripping eachother to pieces.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s a dominance thing. If you lock eyes, it is taken as a challenge/threat. Dogs often avoid it because they recognize in some way, we are their owner. That’s also, why you AREN’T supposed to stare down a gorilla, because then they try to punch your face in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read a book that puts it really simply. We’re often looking at what we want. If a predator is looking at you, it might not be guaranteed that it wants to hunt you but you won’t die simply by betting that it does.</p>
<p>What I also found interesting is another author hypothesized this is why we’re so keen on symmetry. The most common thing in nature that is symmetric is a face that is looking at you. So symmetry has grown to pique our interest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're staring at an animal, not only are you signalling that he is of interest to you, and you may want to do things to him that he would not like, but you are also sizing him up, checking him out for limps, cuts, weaknesses, anything he knows you could exploit. The longer you look, the more info about him you get, helping you to decide if you want to make a move. Quick looks at an animal don't have the same effect, they don't think you're looking at them in a threatening way. You can't be: you cannot get the same information when not staring at him. If you keep looking though, it stresses them, eventually triggering a reaction. It's like a challenge to them. Yep, kind of a dominance thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
