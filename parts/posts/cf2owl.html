		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain's sleep time works in cycles, it cycles between stages 1 and 3, with REM cycles.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Stage 1 isn't exactly sleep, it's the process of your body falling asleep or waking up. Stage 2 is when your body is actively asleep, and stage 3 is &quot;deep sleep&quot;, when the brain does most of the work it needs to during sleep. REM sleep happens between the stages of 2 and 3 usually, although it can happen during stage 1 as well. Most of these stages are differentiated by the number of delta waves produced, stage 3 producing a lot of delta waves, and brain activity is massively slowed down. The deeper into sleep the brain is, the more delta waves are produced.  REM is different, as the brain enters a period of activity that produces dreams. The cycle between stage 2, REM, and stage 3 repeats a few times during the night.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you wake up during stage 3, the brain was in a deeper state of its cycle and was actually &quot;slowed down&quot;, and thus will actually feel more tired than it should. If you wake up during stage 2(or ideally stage 1 as your body is naturally waking up) you will feel far less groggy.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>8 hours is an asinine myth, and is actually quite toxic to those that require more or less. Some people will need more, and some less. It all depends on what your brain needs to do during this period.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know it's not so much about the amount of time we sleep, but when we wake up. I would reccomend reading on REM (rapid eye movement) cycles. There is a certain stage in our slumber in which we feel most alert when waking, that's it, that's all I got for ya.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on when in your REM cycle you wake up, there are some smart alarms you can look into that measure how much you are moving and will wake you up in a 30 min window when you will be in the slightest sleep</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the comments so far is not true. It has not been proven to be important to wake up at specific sleep stages. However, some people conclude that, thats how it works cuz of useless apps like sleep cycle, which claim that they can monitor your sleep stages.. they cant...
To know which state you are in, takes highly advanced equipment usually found in a University.
Search for Shona Halson she is one of the leading scientists in the field, and she even question what is most important, when we wake Up Vs. Sleep duration.</p>
<p>Most people need 7-9 hours of quality sleep a night. So if you feel tired with 8 hours, there can be many reasons. Like quality (not hitting later sleep stages like REM). Or maybe you are used to 5-6 hours and need to get used to 8, which then in the Long run Will benefit you massicely according to alot of studies. Oooor maybe you are one of the outliers which needs less or more than the recommended, but dont count on it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I look at the time, think about what time I want to wake up, I do this 3 times before falling asleep ....I will say..it's 2am and I want to be up by 6.  I would say, 85% of the time it works.  Even on short naps, unless I'm overtired then I will wake up late feeling mildly alarmed.  But considering I didn't set a secondary alarm makes me question my commitment to waking up at the set time I think about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
