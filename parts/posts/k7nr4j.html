		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR: Eclipses, trigonometry and clever reasoning.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to know is how big the Earth is. <a href="https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200606/history.cfm" target="_blank">Eratosthenes of Cyrene</a> around 240 BC or so heard that on the summer solstice light in wells in Aswan Egypt pointed straight down but cast a shadow at a certain angle where he was a bit farther north in Alexandria. He realized that the simplest answer was that the earth was a sphere so he measured the distance between the two cities (paid some guy to walk in between them and keep track of the distance as best he could), measured the heights of some shadows, did some trigonometry and came up with the (actually fairly accurate) circumference of the Earth.</p>
<p>Once you know how big the Earth is, and if you assume that the Moon and the Sun are spheres as well then you can calculate how far away the moon is by watching a lunar eclipse (the one where the Earth casts a shadow on the moon.) <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/91120/do-it-yourself-guide-to-measuring-the-moons-distance/" target="_blank">Aristarchus</a> did this in 270 BC. He watched a lunar eclipse, timed how long it took, did some mathematics and determined that the distance had to be about 60 Earth radii. (He didn't know how big the Earth was because Eratosthenes hadn't figured it out yet.)</p>
<p>It was relatively easy to calculate the <em>proportional</em> distance that all the planets are to the sun although it took them awhile to figure out how to find the <em>absolute</em> distance. <a href="http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/about-us/41-our-solar-system/the-earth/orbit/87-how-do-you-measure-the-distance-between-earth-and-the-sun-intermediate" target="_blank">Here's an explanation</a> of how to figure out what fraction of Earth's orbit the orbit of Venus is. (It's about 0.7 times as far from the sun as Earth.) </p>
<p>Eventually someone realized that you could figure out the absolute distance by using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_of_Venus" target="_blank">Transit of Venus</a>. Basically every few centuries Venus &quot;eclipses&quot; the sun for a few hours and then does it again a few years later. If you're watching it from earth with an accurate clock then it'll happen at a slightly different time in, say, Moscow then it would in London (after correcting for time zones and such) due to parallax. (Parallax is when three of you can be standing around a tree and one of you-call him Adam-can stand in a position so that Bert can still see him but Charlie on the opposite side can't. Imagine Moscow being able to see the eclipse at 3pm but London has to wait for the Earth to turn into position-rotate around its axis-because in London Venus still isn't in the way.) You have to know all sorts of things here to find the answer you're looking for: how fast does the Earth turn? How big is it? What position in orbit is each planet? and so on.</p>
<p>One thing I'll add is that the speed of light was originally calculated using the known positions of the planets. An astronomer named <a href="https://www.amnh.org/learn-teach/curriculum-collections/cosmic-horizons-book/ole-roemer-speed-of-light" target="_blank">Ole Roemer</a> was looking at the orbits of Jupiter's moons in 1676. (They were trying to make an almanac to help ships navigate, ship clocks being rudimentary at the time.) During a year of observations he noticed that his time measurements kept adding seconds to the time until they stopped. Then they started subtracting seconds for six months-until they stopped. Then they started adding them back again. He realized that the different times were due to Earth's 93 million mile orbit around the sun and the light taking extra time to travel the extra 180 million miles. He was the first guy to prove that light's speed was finite. Nowadays we can measure the speed of light so accurately on Earth that we use <em>that</em> value to help us find how far away everything in space is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The earliest methods for determining distances were all based on measuring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax#Astronomy" target="_blank">parallax</a>, which is the apparent movement of objects in the sky based on where they're observed from. </p>
<p>The Moon was the first body whose distance was accurately measured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipparchus#Distance,_parallax,_size_of_the_Moon_and_the_Sun" target="_blank">around 190 BC by Hipparchus</a>. His exact work has been lost, but it is reported on by later scholars (Ptolemy). If you can accurately determine the angle between the Earth and the Moon at different places simultaneously then you can do some geometry and work out the distance. He did so during a solar eclipse, and then heard that while his location had a total solar eclipse a nearby city only had a 4/5ths solar eclipse. Using this he worked out the angles in the triangle formed by his city, the nearby city, and the Moon, and from there did geometry to calculate the distance to the moon. His value is 7% off of the modern value.</p>
<p>The sun's distance was figured out in 1761 with another parallax observation. Around 50 years earlier Sir Edmund Halley (of Halley's Comet fame) devised a distance measuring method by observing how long it took <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_of_Venus#1761_and_1769" target="_blank">Venus to transit</a> the sun.  (In this case, a transit is when the sun, Earth, and Venus all align so that Venus looks like a black dot moving across the face of the sun.) This observation had to be done simultaneously at many points across the globe, so how it was actually organized in the middle 1700's is quite a story on its own. </p>
<p>In this case, <a href="https://www.exploratorium.edu/venus/question4.html" target="_blank">the parallax is in the observed location of Venus</a>. To an observer at a higher latitude the location of Venus will appear lower on the Sun. An observer at a lower latitude will see Venus at a higher location on the Sun. Using the latitude on Earth compared with the apparent height of Venus' track on the Sun you can work out the angle between the tracks. Then, by timing how long the transit lasts at each location you can work out the length of a base of a triangle defined by each Venus track. If you know the length of one side of that triangle and the angle between the Earth and the Venus track you can then make a right triangle and use simple trigonometry to solve for the long side (distance to the Sun). The result was a value that is within 3% of the modern value.</p>
<p>Once the Sun-Earth distance was accurately calculated, this actually gives us the distances to every other planet for &quot;free.&quot; Johannes Kepler realized in 1619 (before the Venus observation from above) <a href="https://www.e-education.psu.edu/astro801/content/l2_p5.html" target="_blank">that the orbital distance of each planet was proportional to its orbital period</a> (scroll down to the third law). This doesn't tell you how far a planet is from the sun, but it does tell you (for example) that if the Earth has a period of 1 and Mars has a period of 1.9 then the Sun-Mars distance is 1.5 times the Sun-Earth distance.</p>
<p>These orbital periods were already known, so Halley's accurate determination of the Sun-Earth distance gave us the other distances at that time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Accurate deduction regarding proportional parameters was performed by Kepler with the use of immaculate data by Tycho Brahe. See: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion" target="_blank">Kepler's Laws</a></p>
<p>The orbit of every planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(geometry)" target="_blank">foci</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>r = p/(1+ Œµ cos Œò )</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>r</em></strong> = radial distance</p>
<p><strong><em>p</em></strong> =  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-latus_rectum" target="_blank">semi-latus rectum</a></p>
<p><strong><em>Œµ</em></strong> = eccentricity</p>
<p><strong><em>Œò</em></strong> = angle to the planet's current position from its closest approach, as seen from the Sun.</p>
<p>(<strong><em>r</em></strong>, <strong><em>Œ∏</em></strong>) are polar coordinates.</p>
<p>Kepler's discoveries allowed him to figure out how much closer or farther all the planets are to the Sun than Earth is, even though he could not figure out the actual distances.</p>
<p>One of the first people to make a good measurement of the distance to a planet was the great astronomer Gian Domenico Cassini. In 1672, Cassini used a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_parallax" target="_blank">stellar parallax</a> to measure the distance to Mars.</p>
<p>Distance measurement by parallax is a special case of the principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation" target="_blank">triangulation</a>, which states that one can solve for all the sides and angles in a network of triangles if, in addition to all the angles in the network, the length of at least one side has been measured. Thus, the careful measurement of the length of one baseline can fix the scale of an entire triangulation network. In parallax, the triangle is extremely long and narrow, and by measuring both its shortest side (the motion of the observer) and the small top angle (always less than 1 arcsecond leaving the other two close to 90¬†degrees), the length of the long sides (in practice considered to be equal) can be determined. </p>
<p>You can understand parallax by holding your thumb up at arm's length and looking at it first with one eye, and then your other. Notice how your thumb seems to shift back and forth against the objects that are farther away. Because your two eyes are separated by a few inches, each views your thumb from a different position. The amount that your thumb appears to move is its parallax. When astronomers measure the parallax of an object and know the separation between the two positions from which it is observed, they can calculate the distance to the object. Using observations on Earth separated by thousands of miles -- like looking through two eyes that are very far apart -- parallax measurements can reveal the great distances to planets.</p>
<p>Although he didn't get quite the right answers, Cassini's results were very close to the correct values. The Sun is about 93 million miles from Earth. As Earth and Mars move in their separate orbits, they never come closer than 35 million miles to each other. Saturn, the most distant planet known when Cassini was alive, is around 900 million miles away.</p>
<p>Astronomers can use parallax to find distances to objects much farther even than planets. To calculate the distance to a star, astronomers observe it from different places along Earth's orbit around the Sun. If they measure the object's position several months apart, their &quot;two eyes&quot; will have a separation of well over 100 million miles.</p>
<p>Now astronomers have technologies to measure distances to other planets more directly. When we have a spacecraft at another planet, we know the time it takes a radio signal to travel between Earth and the spacecraft. We can also send a powerful radar signal toward a planet and time how long it takes for the echo to return. Astronomers know how fast these signals travel (the speed of light), so measuring how long they take makes it easy to calculate the distance very accurately.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not that any of the responses seem wrong or anything, but there is a great video on YouTube called ‚ÄúThe Cosmic Distance Ladder‚Äù, where a mathematician called Terry Tao (genuinely a contender for smartest person on earth and fascinating man) gives a lecture all about how people started to work out larger and larger distances. It‚Äôs a nice watch!</p>
