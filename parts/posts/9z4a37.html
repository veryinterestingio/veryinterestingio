		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Excerpts from a July 2008 article in <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/15570/colonizing-venus-with-floating-cities/" target="_blank">Universe Today</a> discussing the possibility:</p>
<p><em>Landis knows Venus’ surface itself is pretty much out of the question for human habitation. But up about 50 kilometers above the surface, Landis says the atmosphere of Venus is the most Earth-like environment, other than Earth itself, in the solar system. What Landis proposes is creating floating cities on Venus where people could live and work, as well as study the planet below.</em></p>
<p><em>50 km above the surface, Venus has air pressure of approximately 1 bar and temperatures in the 0°C-50°C range, a quite comfortable environment for hmans. Humans wouldn’t require pressurized suits when outside, but it wouldn’t quite be a shirtsleeves environment. We’d need air to breathe and protection from the sulfuric acid in the atmosphere.</em></p>
<p>Note: Geoffrey Landis is a scientist at NASA’s Glenn Research Center who writes science fiction in his spare time</p>
<p>edit:  As initially pointed out by u/candygram4mongo, and also discussed in the  linked article,  an N₂/O₂ mixture such as that which constitututes Earth's atmosphere  could function as a lifting gas in the desired levels of Venus'  heavier CO₂ atmosphere, while also providing the atmosphere for the floating habitat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is an altitude where it's possible, but you'd need a hazard protection suit to stand in open air, because the atmosphere contains harmful chemicals.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of solid Venus replies in here already so I thought I would add something at the other end of the scale: Titan.</p>
<p>Titan gravity is pretty low, a bit lower than the Moon... But Titan has an atmosphere with a density that humans can tolerate.</p>
<p>So basically on Titan you just need to stay warm &amp; have an o2 mask. </p>
<p>The suit that keeps you warm should probably also have some kind of cosmic shielding to keep you from winning a darwin award though since Titan doesn't have much of a magnetic field to protect you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I bet you could do thermal power there pretty easily.  Just rig up a loop that goes down to the hot part of the atmosphere and have a turbine up at the cool top part.  Free Venusian energy.  They do that in Iceland but they actually have to drill.  On venus I'd think you'd just drop a tube.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
