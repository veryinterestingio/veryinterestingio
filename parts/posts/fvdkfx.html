		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For some fans the amount of power required to get the blades spinning is higher than the amount provided by the lowest setting. The lowest is enough to keep the blades spinning but not overcome the inertia at the start. Edit: as others have pointed out the fan will typically start but it is hard on the motor</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electric motors need a magnet to generate the pushing force.  The magnet in electric fans is an electric magnet and only helps create a pushing force when electricity is running through the fan.</p>
<p>At low power, there is enough magnetism to keep the fan moving at a slow speed, but not enough to easily start the fan.  So it is always started at highest power, which gives the biggest push for starting.</p>
<p>You could unplug the fan, turn it to low speed, plug back in, and see what happens. The blade will start turning but it will take visible effort.</p>
<p>IIRC</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This might be more technical than desired, but in addition to the &quot;inertia&quot; reason given (starting the motor takes more energy so trying to start it on low is harder) there are also design reasons why it doesn't logically make sense to, for example, turn a knob from &quot;Off&quot; to &quot;low&quot; to &quot;medium&quot; to &quot;high.&quot;</p>
<p>In an electrical circuit, like inside a fan, &quot;off&quot; means the circuit is &quot;open;&quot; no electricity can run through the circuit to power the fan. Turning the knob from &quot;OFF&quot; to &quot;ON&quot; closes the circuit. A circuit has some current and voltage, which we can use to determine the power, and some resistance. The basic way to make a motor turn more slowly is to increase the resistance in the circuit, which reduces the amount of current that runs through it, thereby reducing the power.</p>
<p>So if we want to go from &quot;OFF&quot; to &quot;ON&quot; we need to actually close a switch. If we want to reduce the power we need to close more switches to add more resistors to the circuit, and to go back to &quot;high&quot; we need to open those switches again (removing the resistors from the circuit). So it actually makes more sense (for the designers) to design a control knob that performs the same basic function as we turn it in the same direction. It is actually a little bit harder (not impossible, but harder) to design a control knob which starts by closing one switch, then as you continue turning it, opens other switches. </p>
<p>I hope this makes sense for the ELI5 sub!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
