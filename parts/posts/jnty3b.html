<p>Also there is a lot at stake way more than anything else we do with (home) computers.

<p>In short, it's still way too susceptible to hacking/interference, and if you bring in online voting from home (as opposed to an electronic voting machine) you could have issues with phishing and other security vulnerabilities that many people could fall for. It's also pretty hard to authenticate votes and &quot;prove&quot; they were recorded correctly without identifying who people voted for, and with electronic voting you can't go back and recount with surety like you can with paper (ie if the computer records it wrong, then there's no way to work that out) Paper ballots are still the best option, even for remote voting and early voting</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There's a lot of great discussion here but most many folks seem to be grouping together what I would argue are two separate (but related!) problems. The key distinction to make is the difference between &quot;electronic voting&quot; which I will define as the process for recording and also potentially counting votes &quot;electronically&quot;. There's not a really clear line here as to what exactly counts as &quot;electronic&quot; but I'll get into that more in a minute. The second category is what OP asked about in their original question, and I'll call it &quot;online voting&quot;. The definition I'll use here is that not only is the vote recorded &amp; counted electronically, but the physical &quot;machine&quot; or interface that's used to cast the vote is a personal device and voting can be done from the convenience of ones own home. This imposes an entirely different set of challenges. Let's dive into both of these methods a little more and discuss the pros and cons.</p>
<h2>Electronic voting</h2>
<p>The definition of what exactly constitutes &quot;electronic&quot; voting is debatable to begin with. At their core, many voting machines you already use have some &quot;electronic&quot; components. I've gone into a lot of depth about the differences in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/iame7g/us_postal_service_files_patent_for_a/g1s1r8q/" target="_blank">different older post</a> but I'll summarize here. Basically there's three common voting machines used today. Scantrons, hole punches, and direct electronic voting machines (with or without a paper backup). For the purposes of this discussion let's focus on direct electronic with no paper backup because that is the most relevant to the next part about &quot;online voting&quot;. Remember that the distinction between &quot;online&quot; is that in the &quot;electronic&quot; case, you go to a physical voting machine at a specified location.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very fast counting by computers</li>
<li>Can't lose ballots</li>
<li>Can't make mistakes while counting</li>
<li>No subjectivity in the count (see: <a href="https://www.history.com/news/2000-election-bush-gore-votes-supreme-court" target="_blank">hanging chads</a> in the 2000 US election)</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>No paper trail so verification that your vote was counted is more difficult (but not impossible, we'll get to this)</li>
<li>Hacking is a legitimate concern. If someone obtains system access they can easily alter many votes not just a few.</li>
<li>Less trust from the public, the counting process is less transparent because you can't &quot;see&quot; it. Many people don't trust technology.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Online Voting</h2>
<p>This form of voting is exactly the same as how we defined electronic voting above (direct electronic counting with <em>no</em> paper backup) except that in this case you don't go to a physical voting machine and instead can vote on your own personal computing device (cell phone, tablet, laptop etc.) As such the pros and cons are mostly the same, but with some notable additions.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Convenience of not having to travel to vote, potentially increasing voter turnout</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>User verification becomes more difficult, physical polling locations have a variety of methods to verify your identity not all of which can be easily replicated online and like other users have mentioned, coeresion becomes an issue. You can't verify who is using the device</li>
<li>Physical device security is an issue. Not everyone has the best cybersecurity hygine on their personal device and as such every new device has the potential of both being tampered with individually as well as being an entry point into the network.</li>
<li>Networking is more difficult as it needs to be able to deal with people using any manner of connection type (for example public wifi which could be more susceptible to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack" target="_blank">man in the middle attacks</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h1>Potential solutions</h1>
<p>Again I've gone super in depth into these concepts in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/iame7g/us_postal_service_files_patent_for_a/g1s1tah/" target="_blank">previous post</a> but I will summarize here. Many people in this thread have already brought up blockchain as a potential solution. Frankly those people are wrong. Let's talk about why. First of all what is blockchain?</p>
<p>Blockchain is a distributed database where data is added in a sequence and all new data is dependent on all prior data. As such you can't alter data without breakng the chain and thus revealing an inconsistency. This property combined with the theoretical untamperability of the bitcoin network are what cause most people to believe that blockchains are unhackable. For details on what makes bitcoin untamperable please see the original <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" target="_blank">bitcoin whitepaper</a> or read my laymans explanation in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/iame7g/us_postal_service_files_patent_for_a/g1s1tah/" target="_blank">linked comment</a>.</p>
<p>So what's the relation between &quot;blockchains&quot; and counting votes. Well aside from the fact that theoretically a blockchain database could be used to store votes (though this probably wouldn't be a great idea for a variety of reasons) the real connection is the field of mathematics and computer science called cryptography. Again I'll summarize from my other post. Cryptography allows for messages to be obfuscated such that they can only be decrypted by someone with the correct &quot;password&quot; or &quot;key&quot;. There also exists an inverse concept where a key can be used to &quot;sign&quot; a message so that you can ensure that the person writing it is who you expected it to be.</p>
<p>This concept of cryptography, combined with a (relatively) new breakthrough called <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/1987/01/thesis.pdf" target="_blank">homomorphic encryption</a> which allows encrypted values to be added &amp; subtracted without revealing their contents, could allow for <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/09/24/electionguard-available-today-to-enable-secure-verifiable-voting/" target="_blank">secure verifiable electronic voting</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately these methods are only dealing with the issues for electronic voting, when combined with paper backups, homomorphic encryption could allow for anonymous, verifiable (via a reciept) computer counted voting. However it relies on the physical and network security offered by a dedicated voting machine, along with the machine to create paper backups in case an issue is discovered. Given that even this technology is not yet fully ready, fully online voting (which is a far more difficult problem) remains out of reach.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
