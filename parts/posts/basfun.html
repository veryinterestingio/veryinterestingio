		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The three hearts aren't equal.</p>
<p>It's got one main heart like other animals (the systemic heart), and two other minor hearts (branchial hearts), each pumping blood through one gill. If the main one stops it would have the same effect as if your heart stopped*. <em>Maybe</em> it could live with one gill though (provided the stopped gill-heart didn't disrupt the circulatory system too much and it could survive on half the oxygen - but most animals can survive on one lung/gill until they get eaten)</p>
<p>*Apparently the systemic heart stops when it swims, hence they don't swim fast unless they have to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it would depend on which hearts fail because if the two bronchial hearts fail the octopus will likely die because the bronchial hearts control the gills, which are obviously very important to the octopuses survival. The third heart, the systematic one is less vital to the octopuses survival as it is inactive while the octopus is swimming (swimming for octopi is very energy consuming)but active while the octopus is crawling. So in conclusion survival without the two bronchial hearts is near impossible but survival without the systematic heart would be extremely tiring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
