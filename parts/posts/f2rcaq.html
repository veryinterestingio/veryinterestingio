<p>The standard maps are inaccurate because the world is round, and maps are flat. There's no way to project a spherical map on a flat surface without stretching or tearing parts of the map. In the former case you get maps like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection" target="_blank">Mercator projection</a> which makes areas closer to the poles huge, and in the latter case you get odd things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goode_homolosine_projection" target="_blank">this</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Remove an orange peel all in one piece and lay it flat. Points on the surface of the peel are the same size and distance from each other as when they were on the sphere. But then stretch out the peel to make it rectangle (like a map). To do that, you have to stretch the peel. Points get farther from each other. Imagine doing that the surface of the Earth. Realize that where you choose to do the stretching has an impact on things' relative size and relationship to each other.</p>
<p>Or do it in reverse. Take a sheet of paper draw a map on it, try to wrap it around a sphere-like object. Notice all the ways it doesn't quite fit. Those are inaccuracies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The globe is <em>technically</em> inaccurate, because the earth is a slight ellipsoid rather than a sphere, and chances are the globe doesn’t take that into account, but the error is trivial for anything a regular globe is used for - also far far less than the inaccuracies of that result from measuring tolerances.</p>
<p>The flat maps are inaccurate as you cannot project a curved surface onto a flat one without losing integrity in some combination of size, shape, direction or distance, with the errors becoming more significant the bigger the area shown on the map. For anything in the range &lt;50 miles square the errors are trivial outside of extremely high precision applications, and if you’re doing those you know all about this issue. There are a lot of different projection methods that each preserve some of these qualities better than others, basically you have to trade off the properties you don’t care about as much for those that you do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure why they would say a globe is inaccurate, but normal two dimensional maps become more inaccurate the further away from the equator you look because it's taking an area much smaller than the equator and stretching it out to be as wide on the paper as the equator itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
