		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So this question popped in my mind when I was building my computer and I saw what an intel i7 CPU looked like. When it arrived in the mail my first reaction was the fear of having been scammed, because I imagined that a CPU would be much bigger than that.</p>
<p>According to what I understand about computers, the CPU is the main component of a computer. My question isn't HOW do the tech companies make such small CPUs but why? From my understanding, these companies invest millions to constantly miniaturize the components of computers... Why not make CPU bigger, since they take such little space in a computer?</p>
<p>I have a few ideas of why that would be but I am curious!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The CPU size is generaly limited due to data transfer speeds. If the CPU is bigger the data has to travel farther, which takes more time. Chips have been getting faster due to increased transistor density, not over all size.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cost and speeds are a major factor.</p>
<p>The defect rate in manufacturing is roughly proportional to the area of the chip (the die inside the CPU). Most defects cause the chip to fail and therefore be wasted. So large chips have larger chances of defects and therefore cause more loss during manufacturing. </p>
<p>Speeds are another factor - the switching speed of the transistor is inversely proportional to its size - the smaller the faster. Also there are a LOT of signals moving through a CPU at any time and the system (to a rough factor) can only work as fast as the SLOWEST signals moving inside the chip. To increase speed - size (and therefore signal path lengths) have to decrease.</p>
<p>Heat is probably also a factor but several things work for and against it. Clearly faster speed implies more heat. Shorter signal paths incur fewer losses and therefore lower heat. Smaller transistors require less charge/energy to switch. But larger chips are easier to move heat out of. So newer smaller CPUs require pretty sophisticated cooling in order to function (or they will pretty much meltdown) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I didn't see power here. Bigger chips need more power to push electrons around and more power to flip bits. Some of that power gets turned into heat, which accumulates, and above a certain threshold starts changing the material of the chip so that the components don't work properly.</p>
<p>Smaller chips and transistors means less power and less heat for the same amount of work. So less cost to operate, and more work in the same footprint before you hit the thermal threshold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No Joke: The speed of light.</p>
<p>Electrons move pretty fast inside a cpu, but they can't move faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>If you have a CPU with clockspeed of 4 GHz this means it does its thing 4 billion times a second or about once ever 0.25 nanoseconds.</p>
<p>How far can light travel in a quarter of a nanosecond?</p>
<p>About 7.5 cm or 3 inch.</p>
<p>That is as far as an electronics signal could travel (roundtrip) in the CPU in during one cycle under the best of circumstances. (Obviously the circumstances aren't the best.)</p>
<p>You could build a CPU  much bigger, but it would be slower.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Related to this is the (mostly science-fictiony) idea of &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computronium" target="_blank">computronium</a>&quot; - &quot;a theoretical arrangement of matter that is the best possible form of computing device for that amount of matter&quot;. A CPU is basically just a block of super small, cleverly arranged transistors.  In theory, if you could make those transistors out of individual atoms you could reach a sort of platonic ideal of computational efficiency. A block of computronium the size of a present day CPU would probably be several orders of magnitude more powerful than all the CPUs in the world today.  We have quite a way to go before we get there... see also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limits_of_computation" target="_blank">this</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
