		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a normal working system, our brain sends signals to our muscles. The tongue is a muscle that has to go through a range of motions and positions to articulate speech. An impairment on the system, such as being tired or drunk, etc. impedes the signal going to the tongue. Another possible reason for slurred or stumbled words could be indicative of a neurological issue or a misfire of that signal to the tongue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically it’s because your brain falls asleep from front to back. In the same way, the front gets the most tired first, working backwards the more tired you become. Your frontal lobe and motor cortex are at the front of the brain, the frontal lobe which controls broader thought / decision making and the motor which actually executes movement and actions. So technically those start to “wear out” first to conserve energy to keep the rest of the brain awake and functioning. When you’re drunk, it affects your brain similarly - it’s focused in the frontal lobe which reduces your ability for decision making and having cohesive movements and actions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apart from fatigue, one cause is due to melatonin. It inhibits nerves, resulting in less signal to and from periphery nerves, as well as weaker signals in your brain. It helps keep you asleep and prevents you from harming yourself while dreaming</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not positive but i think it's linked to a lack of concentration. Focusing on something takes mental energy and when we're tied, we just don't have the energy to concentrate on our speech. There might be an element of impairment of brain function but I'm no expert on that. When you are drunk, the alcohol actually impairs fine motor skills and at higher levels of intoxication even gross motor skills because it affects those parts of the brain that control your movement. It actually makes those parts of the brain not work properly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
