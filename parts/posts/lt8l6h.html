		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What makes those two special is they have 4 electrons in the outer shell. Those 4 electrons enable four separate potential “connection points” that allow them to form the backbone for the long complicated molecules that constitute life. Proteins, DNA, and other critical compounds need something like this to form. Most other elements can only form one or maybe two separate chemical bonds. This limits the number of ways to make big fancy molecules.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Carbon is an amazing atom that has <strong>far</strong> more interesting chemistry than any other atom.  It extremely flexible in what it can do and over a wide range of temperatures.  If can form long chains, that fold into uncounted shapes, many of which are interesting chemically.  Many forms dissolve in water, other forms are extremely resistant to water.  It also has a convenient gas-phase in CO2.</p>
<p>This means it’s easy to <em>cycle</em> carbon through an ecosystem.  This is critical because life requires energy.  Excepting very limited life near volcanic vents, the best form of energy is sunlight, but that is still inefficient.  </p>
<p>On earth, plants evolved to collect sunlight, but the price they pay is they are slow moving, having little energy to spare.  This opened a niche for higher level life (animals) evolve to consume the plants as a “cheat” to gain energy much faster.  Of course that opened a new niche for other animals to consume the plant eating animals, etc, etc.</p>
<p>It’s almost unthinkable that evolution would not find similar solutions in alien life.  If all that stored energy is sitting there in these alien plant-like things, any life that evolved to pirate that energy away would do quite well.</p>
<p>Life could most certainly be based on other chemistries, but if we were to catalog 1,000 different planets, each with their own independently evolved life forms, we would expect that most (not necessarily all) of them would be based on carbon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe the belief in silicon-based lifeform existing has diminished over the last decades due to the thermodynamically much weaker tendency of silicon to form double bond and triple bond with itself (quite crucial for flexibility of lifes we observe today), among many other factors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Life may potentially be possible based on some other elements, but it's unlikely that they would be complex life forms if they existed at all. Carbon and silicon are the peak of expected function when it comes to life, and silicon's potential is debatable - silicon possesses some similarities to carbon, but it struggles to form double bonds (integral to carbon-based biochemistry) and it reacts with a much smaller array of other elements compared to carbon. The probability of silicon-based life existing is quite low, and if any does it's almost certainly not complex. Sulphur has also been proposed, since it has the ability to form long chain molecules, but that idea has been explored much less than silicon. </p>
<p>There's a pretty good chance that the only life that is capable of existing at all is carbon-based life, unless there's some incredible secret silicon holds that has not yet been discovered.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ability to form huge numbers of different, complex long-chain molecules, basically. It's the sheer number and variety of such possible molecules that make life as we're familiar with it work. Other elements simply don't come with the same options. And of the two, carbon wins out hands down; silicon runs a very poor second (it looks at first glance like it ought to be able to do the same things as carbon, but in practice many of the silicon equivalents of carbon-based molecules just don't work - too unstable, for instance).</p>
<p>It's no coincidence that, everywhere we look in the universe, we see evidence of complex carbon-based long-chain molecules.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
