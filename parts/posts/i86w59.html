		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people think that the garbage patch is just a giant centralized pile of garbage floating in the ocean. While there certainly is large debris, the majority of the garbage is very fine particles of plastic that range from the size of <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/great-pacific-garbage-patch/" target="_blank">sand to even smaller microscopic particles</a> - these form when plastics degrade in the direct sunlight. These particles form a sort of suspension in the water and so it becomes incredibly difficult to effectively remove them. Despite what you see in photos (which often pictures the large debris), there are huge portions of the patch that you wouldn't even think was polluted because of how fine these particles are. </p>
<p>Additionally, you need to consider the size of the patch. It really depends on what source you look at but estimates put it anywhere between the size of Texas and North America. Even if you assume Texas to be most accurate, that's a massive amount of area to cover. Couple that with the distance from land, and the resources needed to get there and back, it becomes very difficult to clean the patch. </p>
<p>That said, there are plenty of initiatives currently trying to tackle this problem. Check out &quot;the ocean cleanup&quot;. They've been in the press quite a lot over the last few years for various advancements they've made.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are currently at least three projects working to clean it up.  But this is 1.6 million square kilometres (surface) of micro plastics, and they extend deep into the water column.</p>
<p>So it’s sort of like saying “why doesn’t someone take the ice cap off Greenland and move it to the Sahara Desert for drinking water?”</p>
<p>The existing projects are cleaning up tons of garbage per day now.  But the Pacific Rim is populated by humans who continue to dump plastics into their waterways, and as it breaks down, it all eventually makes it to the same vortex in the Pacific.</p>
<p>The good? News is that some microorganisms have evolved to consume the micro plastics and break them back down into carbon that sinks to the ocean floor.  But this happens really slowly too — combined with the existing clean up projects it’s still slower than the rate at which the plastic is accumulating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://theoceancleanup.com/" target="_blank">Some heroic people are trying</a>, but the amount of effort it takes has not been collectively mounted because</p>
<ol>
<li>Pollution is an externalized cost. It costs nothing to pollute, but it costs a lot to clean up. To most polluters, it's always someone else's problem.</li>
<li>However fast you try to scoop up the waste, more is being produced, mostly in dense Asian cities near rivers, where people throw trash straight into the river. The <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/mismanaged-plastic-waste-by-region-2010" target="_blank">overwhelming bulk of ocean plastic trash comes from East Asia.</a> All that trash ends up washing out to sea. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/mismanaged-waste-global-total?tab=chart" target="_blank">China is the largest culprit by far</a>, but most of the south-east Asian nations contribute a disproportionate amount of this trash simply because so much of their waste gets dumped into rivers or into the ocean.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> It may interest you that there are methods for stopping storm drain and river-borne trash from making it out to sea. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21ppnNHxaaM" target="_blank"><strong>Mr. and Mrs. Trash Wheel and their Trash Wheel offspring</strong></a> are one example. <a href="https://stormwatersystems.com/stormx-netting-trash-trap/" target="_blank"><strong>Storm drain socks / net bags</strong></a> are another.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT #2</strong>: Not Mr. and Mrs. Trash Wheel and their offspring, apparently. They have exalted titles now— they're Mr., Professor, and Captain Trash Wheel.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT #3</strong>: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkQbcrzyAeE" target="_blank">a better video intro</a> to Mr. Trash Wheel</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not a solid mass. It breaks up with weather and if objects approach it. Not only that, but that mass of garbage is a hazard to navigation so boats can't really get near.</p>
<p>But the biggest reason is this... MONEY. As in whose money should pay for it? The garbage is in the ocean. What country should pay for it? How do you force a country to pay for it if they don't want to? How do you prove that the garbage is the fault of that country?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't know either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
