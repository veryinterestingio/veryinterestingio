		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My scientific curiosity about this comes from the fact that I just traveled from the telescopes in the mountains of Chile all the way back to the US and I wasn't able to sleep a wink on any of the flights, perhaps maybe a 30-minute dose-off every now and then. I sit here, having to teach tomorrow, wondering if I should nap now, or just ride it out and get a healthy night's sleep tonight. I'm worried that sleeping now will screw me into not being able to fall asleep tonight.</p>
<p>I did some of my own research on it, but I couldn't find much consensus other than &quot;you'll be worse at doing stuff.&quot; I don't care if I'm tired throughout today, I'll be fine---I just want to know if missing a single night is actually detrimental to your long-term health. </p>
<p>Edit: wow this blew up, thank you all for the great responses! Apologies if I can't respond to everyone, as I've been... well... sleeping. Ha.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Notes taken from a Brandon Marcello, Ph.D. seminar: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Not getting enough sleep leads to increased risk of injury and reduced pain threshold; greater susceptibility to sickness; reduced physical and psychological performance; reduced motivation, learning ability, and memory; increased anxiety, irritability, and mistakes; increase in body fat percentage; reverting to old habits; poor justment of distance, speed, and/or time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of the Rapid Eye Movement (REM) cycle occurs in the final 2-3 hours of a night's rest. Missing ~25% of your total sleep one night may have a larger than 25% negative impact on your mind and body. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Getting enough sleep improves motivation; recovery of muscle strength; sprint speeds; muscle glycogen (stored energy in muscle); cortisol (stress) regulation; motor skill development; memory consolidation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sleep debt simplified: if you need 8 hours and get 7 hours, that means you accrue 1 hour of sleep debt. Need to get 9 hours to repay that 1 hour of debt. Sleep debt can build up over time to <em>(30 hours? I failed to write this down)</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After extending time in bed to 10 hours per night for several weeks, collegiate swimmers showed improvements of +8% 15meter sprint speed; +20% reaction time off the block; +10% turn time efficiency; +19% kickstrokes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During sleep, the brain will get rid of waste products and clean out toxic proteins which can impair healthy aging of the brain and cause brain related diseases such as Alzheimer's and other neurological disorders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sleep Myths: you can get too much sleep; naps are bad; 8 hours of sleep is ideal <em>(everyone is biologically wired to require different amounts of sleep)</em>; older people don't need as much sleep <em>(they need more because they usually awaken more frequently)</em>; storing up sleep for the week ahead; alcohol helps you sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sleep/Nutrition Interaction: sleep deprivation alters the ability of the body to metabolize and store carbohydrates for recovery, as well as use for a later time; reduces glycogen levels.</p>
</li>
<li>Ask yourself: what is detracting from your sleep quality? Noise? Light? Pain? Temperature? Priorities? Stress? Alcohol/Drugs/Food?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During sleep, the brain clears away toxic waste products which accumulate during the day. One of these products is beta-amyloid, the protein involved in Alzheimer's disease. It's been found that a single night of sleep deprivation greatly increases beta-amyloid (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/4483" target="_blank">source</a>). In the long run, it could potentially increase Alzheimer's risk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's going to be difficult to tell you the exact consequences because we just don't know. Everyone is different, but there have been studies done about sleep debt and the adverse effects it has on our health. The negative effects of sleep deprivation are <em>not</em> simply cognitive. I think your argument is solely about not messing up your circadian rhythm, which can be a valid concern. But basically skipping an entire night of sleep is not good for you and you should avoid doing it whenever possible. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
