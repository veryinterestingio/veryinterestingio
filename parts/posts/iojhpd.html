<p>That’s a big part of it.  If you’re investigating a house fire and you can see that the end of the house where the garage is has been almost completely burned away but the bedroom end is intact, there’s a very good chance that the fire didn’t start in the bedroom.  So then you can start investigating what’s left of the garage for an ignition source.  </p>
<p>Same thing with brush fires.  If you’ve got a huge field that burned, absent any wind or changes in fuel density, the origin point will be near the middle of the burned area.  If there is wind, you can guess where the origin is based on wind speed and direction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fire investigators are required to have a vast array of knowledge on fire dynamics, including how specific objects and fuels burn and what pattern a fire would likely take in a specific environment given the fuel.</p>
<p>Using that information, an investigator can usually determine whether a fire burned in a way it shouldn't have been able to (perhaps indicating a fuel or accelerant like gasoline had been used) or whether the fire originated in a location with no obvious ignition sources.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They aren't always good at it.  We owned a rental property when I was a kid.  The fire marshal claimed it was opened paint cans that somehow started the fire.  It was latex paint.  No way for it to auto-ignite.  He insisted that was the cause.</p>
<p>We ended up doing the research ourselves for the insurance.  It was a defective hair curler that was related to a class action because a recall was never issued..  It had no temperature shutoff and would overheat hot enough to set wood on fire if you forgot to turn it off.  That's what started the fire.  The cans of paint were open because they burst from the heat.  The fire guy was a douche bag.</p>
<p>We found the source of ignition because the wood desk that the daughter used was complete ash with the fire spreading from there.  Then we figured out that was where she curled her hair.  No other possible ignition source.  Nothing else plugged in there.  She didn't smoke and didn't use candles.  We got the claim.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
