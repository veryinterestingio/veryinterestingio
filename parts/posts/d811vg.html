		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When something gets stuck in your esophagus it's still being forced down by muscular contraction, so with the friction that keeps it in place it's creating scratches and irritation.</p>
<p>So even after the pill's down the feeling you have associated with it being there (said feelings of scratching and irritation) are still there and there aren't enough specific nerve endings to distinguish that from the pressure of an object lodged there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Your esophagus is very durable, so long as it's being used properly, and is very easily hurt otherwise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
