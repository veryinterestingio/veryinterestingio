		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our legs move in a fairly consistent manner, pretty much just bending one direction at the knee. A kneecap increases the leverage available, and helps aim the leg and knee in the proper direction, helping with this movement. These simply aren't issues with the elbow. Elbows don't need to deal with anywhere near as much force, and benefit from a wider range of motion. Arms need to twist and turn, not just swing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The knee has more weight and force going through it and and only in one plane if movement (your knee swings forwards and backwards (extension and flexion)), therefore <a href="https://imgur.com/a/hvgfZId" target="_blank">the kneecap helps the joint efficiently transfer those forces</a>. </p>
<p>Your elbow also has extension and flexion, but also supinates and pronates. A sesamoid bone in there would really mess that up. The elbowâ€™s motion and activities are due to those of the hand which require a wider range of flexibility than the foot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of tetrapods have kneecaps and almost all tetrapod species walk on four legs. The kneecap may have evolved as long as 400 million years ago. About 65 million years ago mammals were little shrews avoiding dinosaurs at night.</p>
<p>So, why do shrews have kneecaps but not elbow caps?</p>
<p>Edit: Extra info verified by me: Spider monkeys and horses have kneecaps but no elbow caps</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our (and any other animal that follows this trend) hind limbs are larger than our forelimbs. Nearly all animals that have kneecaps but not elbowcaps follow this trend. Because they are larger, forces to articulate that leg are much higher. There is a tendon that runs over the corner of the elbow and the top of the kneecap. The kneecap does two things, it prevents wear of that tendon over the relatively sharp edge of the bone, and it provides a bit more leverage so the muscle can move the leg with a bit less force. </p>
<p>As for why we don't have them on our elbows? Well we don't need them. Our arms have much smaller muscles and the forces required to move the lower bit of the arm is much lower than the forces required to move our legs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not convinced by the force/range of motion arguments. The elbow has in fact a more substantial bone structure than the knee. In place of the patella the elbow has the olecranon process rigidly affixed to ulna, which provides the force transfer and joint protection, while not preventing rotation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
