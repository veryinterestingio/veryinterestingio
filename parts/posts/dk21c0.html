			<a href="/posts/dk21c0" onclick="return false">The Younger Dryas climate change event occurred around 12,000 years ago and was more rapid (change of about 5 degrees in a few decades) than the climate change happening today. How does it compare to modern climate change? Was there significant extinction and damage to the environment?</a>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an ice core scientist/paleoclimatologist I can assure you that there are MANY studies comparing  today’s climate to the YD period as well as the whole sequence of rapid climate events during the most recent deglaciation from the OD/bolling -&gt; allerod -&gt; YD -&gt; preboreal.  this is the most recent time (other than today) that the climate has fluctuated very rapidly on decadal timescales so it is of utmost importance to understanding contemporary anthropogenic climate change</p>
<p>/u/Gastronomicus is absolutely correct about the currently understood mechanism of NADW shutdown as a result of the melting of large NH ice aheets.  There is not enough ice available to initiate such a strong negative feedback mechanism today. <strong>EDIT:</strong> That last statement isn't necessarily true, NADW shutdown is really complex and still not very well understood - see /u/Chlorophilia's response below for a better summary</p>
<p>All that said, the 5C temperature drop you cite comes from ice core  18O measurements - so Greenland and antarctica.  we know that the poles warm and cool much faster than the global average (today the arctic has already warmed by 2-3C since preindustrial compared to the global average of \~1C).  this means <strong>global</strong> temperature change during the YD was also more like 2-3 degrees, not 5.</p>
<p>While the wikipedia article gives a good background on the YD event, i think it fails to describe all of the effects and observations in the context of the background warming occuring during the overall deglaciation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From the link you posted:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas#Causes" target="_blank">&quot;The current theory is that the Younger Dryas was caused by <strong>significant reduction or shutdown of the North Atlantic &quot;Conveyor&quot;, which circulates warm tropical waters northward, in response to a sudden influx of fresh water from Lake Agassiz and deglaciation in North America.</strong> Geological evidence for such an event is not fully secure,[93] but recent work has identified a pathway along the Mackenzie River that would have spilled fresh water into the Arctic and thence into the Atlantic.[94][95] The global climate would then have become locked into the new state until freezing removed the fresh water &quot;lid&quot; from the North Atlantic. An alternative theory suggests instead that the jet stream shifted northward in response to the changing topographic forcing of the melting North American ice sheet, which brought more rain to the North Atlantic, which freshened the ocean surface enough to slow the thermohaline circulation.[96]</a></p>
<p>Effectively, the melting response from existing the last major glaciation led to a massive shift in ocean currents which are fundamental to global climate. There is no modern basis for comparison, because this process is not currently occurring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're interested in the climate effects, consider this - in the modern era, there are a wide number of activities that are leading to environmental pressure, and the rest of the ecosystem is having trouble coping.</p>
<p>Take for instance, the burning of the Amazon.  12,000 years ago, a great number of animals could migrate out of regions of stress and find regions that would still likely support some kind of existence.  Today, orangutans cannot move to Sao Paolo.  The animals effected have essentially nowhere to go, retreating into areas already under stress.</p>
<p>Human terraforming happens through more than carbon release.  Massive chemical changes from all kinds of chemicals introduced to the environment are having cascading effects on habitability.  The most concerning are the oceans, as too much change in oceanic chemistry is combining with relentlessly destructive fishing practices and over-harvesting which is leading to massive loss of higher organisms in the chain, and microbe monocultural die-offs and de-oxigenated zones where life can't live and won't live in for centuries if not longer.  That is all happening <em>at that same time</em> as the temperature changes, and effects are in some cases amplified.</p>
<p>Imagine how much shit from buffalo fertilized the Great Plains of America 10,000 years ago.  Now imagine how much food was scattered across the ocean floors in the form of whale falls, dead whales sinking to the bottom and becoming miniature ecosystems.  The entire ecosystem has been changed in fundamental ways.</p>
<p>It's more than the carbon, it's more than the water temperature - in the modern picture.</p>
<p>As far as the Younger Dryas, there is evidence that it may have helped finish off the Clovis culture, though the extinction of the Mega-fauna about a thousand years earlier is probably what really impacted their way of life.  In the forests and fields of wild cereals in the Levant, it led to drier conditions that impacted the Natufian culture and they became less sedentary in their Late Period.  Some speculate this led to the introduction of early agriculture, and the area does show some of the earliest, if not <em>the</em> earliest example of agriculture - but the link is somewhat speculative at this point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>/u/Gastronomicus is correct in that there is no modern basis for comparison. However climate change, specifically rapid climate change, is never good for life.</p>
<p>more sources if you're interested, these might be a good starting place for further research:
<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/110/32/12917" target="_blank">Study claiming evidence from a platinum anomaly shows the YD was a result of bolide impact</a></p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1202183109" target="_blank">Study showing the temperatures derived from ice cores may be an artifact and the YD was actually warmer (based on a 500ppm increased atmospheric CO2 level) </a></p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2012.08.557" target="_blank">Study linking extinction of 35 mammal species and 19 bird genera to the rapid cooling in the YD</a></p>
<p>even</p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/grl.50492" target="_blank">Study showing approximately 100m rise in the dead sea pointing to a 'wet period' during the YD</a></p>
<p>in short it had major effects which were felt all around the world just like any major climate shift is.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a 'comparable' event (but not really) maybe look into the cause of the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, a 'hot-house' earth climate. Which may have been a result of the eruption of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province causing extreme greenhouse conditions such as <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031018211003063" target="_blank">doubled atmospheric CO2 from 1000ppm to 2000-2500ppm</a> (for reference we have ~400ppm today).</p>
<p>any and all climate change is usually disasterous.</p>
<p>The way we're going (over population, unchecked consumerism, over population, wanton resource wastage, over fishing, <em>over population</em> etc.etc.etc.) we will see vastly enhanced impacts of the (relatively) minor quantities of co2 we're pumping into the atmosphere. If we can reduce our impact on the climate, and that's a big if, we should have started yesterday. But today works too!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
