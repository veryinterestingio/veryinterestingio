<p>If anyone cares.  </p>
<p>Researchers do not know for sure what causes hypnic jerks, but they have a few theories. Hypnic jerks and other types of myoclonus start in the same part of your brain that controls your startle response. When you fall asleep, researchers suspect that a misfire sometimes occurs between nerves in the reticular brainstem, creating a reaction that leads to a hypnic jerk.<br />
For example, it may be that when your muscles relax completely, even though that’s a normal part of falling asleep, your brain mistakenly assumes you are really falling and reacts by twitching your muscles. It’s also possible that hypnic jerks are a physical reaction to the dream-like imagery that accompanies them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've heard it's the body falling asleep before the brain shuts off. The sensation of all the control leaving your muscles causes your brain to perceive that you're falling (as you would if you lost all muscle control) and yells at your body to flail so to prevent catastrophic injury.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
