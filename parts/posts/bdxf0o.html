		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Any member of the genus <em>homo</em> is considered human as &quot;homo&quot; is literally Latin for &quot;human.&quot; Neanderthals are a species of human, specifically: <em>Homo neanderthalensis.</em></p>
<p>But, different species can interbreed and this is not a hard barrier between species. Organisms of different (but closely related) species can and do breed and in some cases even produce fertile offspring (e.g. Ligers)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Iirc there are no neanderthal genes on the y chromosome. So that might mean that a male neanderthal either didn't pass on their genes to humans or only female offspring of male neanderthal  survived and could reproduce. </p>
<p>So they were definitely on the way to being completely speciated. </p>
<p>Even though male mules are completely infertile there have been 60 cases of female mules being able to reproduce. So I imagine that it was a similar circumstance for humans and neanderthal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Homo Neanderthalis - (short, strong spear carrier ambush hunters ) descended from Homo Erectus and could most probably interbreed with them.</p>
<p>we (Homo Sapiens) (taller, better runners, and used long range casting weapons) also descended from Homo Erectus. we could interbreed with our direct ancestor - Homo Erectus, and as the DNA shows we could also interbreed with the Neanderthals, and also the Denisovans who descended most probably from Homo Erectus as well, and were very big. (Seven footers were common in the bone analysis.) I personally wonder if the Denisovans were in some way the basis of a multitude of 'fight against the giants' legends and stories from deep antiquity.</p>
<p>So several species descended from a common one way far back in time like half a million years or more. Not homo sapiens descending directly from homo neanderthal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
