<p>Basically the fleshy part in your nose swells up and creates the stuffy feeling.</p>
<p>edit: after getting up your bloodpressure gets distributed more into other regions of your body for functionality since they are not 'idling' anymore.</p>
<p>tldr: nose boner</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As previously described, sinuses are lined with erectile tissue.</p>
<p>However, they also respond by swelling and inflammation to allergens, especially in the very early morning hours.</p>
<p>Antihistamines, the 24 hour kind, taken before bed will help. A good air cleaner with a HEPA filter will also help.</p>
<p>Sinuses will usually clog on the side you are laying on. A drop or 2 of saline solution in each eye will help to clear them quickly, otherwise you're in for a couple of hours of discomfort while laying on the side that isn't clogged.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your sinuses actually expand and contract every 40 to 80 mins or so.<br />
So one nostril will seem blocked while the other is clear( they switch to stop the parts of the sinuses that recognise scents to be overloaded).  </p>
<p>I've issues with my sinuses which makes things like this a bit more pronounced (Think of it like having a cold 24/7, 365 days a year!!) . This causes fluid build up in my sinus tissues and I get what you describe a lot. (Some times it's so bad I can feel the fluid draining from the sinus tissues)  </p>
<p>also SNOT...<br />
Yup you swallow a lot more than you realise, it can pool in your sinuses when laying down blocking your nose, then when you stand up it drains away...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I get this too, but only on the right side.</p>
<p>I see a doctor every six months or so because the tonsils and adenoids they took out when I was fifteen, have grown back again and are causing me problems. He told me the problem with the nose is caused when lying down was one of the adenoids flopping down and obstructing my breathing. </p>
<p>If you have this problem on both sides you might want to get it checked out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't the standard answer, this is much rarer than other answers.</p>
<p>If you find tilting your head causes the same feeling as laying down, you might have a misshapen septum, the area between nostrils. This can cause all kinds of interesting issues and breathing quirks. It's easily diagnosed by an ENT</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
