		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neurotransmitter receptors are protein made of smaller blocks called amino acids. Different amino acids have different properties, some might be more positive, some more negative, some neutral. This is called charge. Specific combination of these amino acids causes not only overall shape of the receptor, but also a different charge. Now, different neurotransmitters have also different charges. Since opposites attract, the neurotransmitters preferentially bind to these receptors and this is why they also stay bounded. When it comes to why the neurotransmitters dont just float away there are multiple reasons. 1. The releasing neuron is very very close to the next neuron at synapse. 2. A lot more neurotransmitters are released than needed. In the end some neurotransmitters would float away and bind to receptors on neighbouring neurons, but propagating a signal requires a pretty strong stimulation, so the floating  neurotransmitters won’t likely do much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They often do float away, it's called the &quot;spillover&quot; and it contributes to the phenomenon of neuronal plasticity : the neurotransmitters secreted activate another synapses and thus reinforce another neural pathway that wouldn't be reinforced. It happens everywhere in the brain but I think it happens a lot in the cerebellum.</p>
<p>Quantitatively, it's a high concentration of neurotransmitters that is released from synapses to synapses so even if some spillover do happen, you still have contacts with receptors due to the thin synapse and the receptors affinity.</p>
<p>I'll edit my post to link an image with this spillover, I saw a very good one months ago.</p>
<p>EDIT : One article about it <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn0607-675?foxtrotcallback=true" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/nn0607-675?foxtrotcallback=true</a></p>

<p>So the synapse is actually incredibly small - - the gap between the pre and post-synaptic neuron is a few nm apart in distance at a maximum. When exocytosis of the quanta (aka set amount of NT per vesicle &quot;bubble&quot;) of neurotrabmitter occurs from the presynaptic neuron, it will simply diffuse across the synaptic cleft to the postsyanptic cell. </p>
<p>Diffusion is random, and so you might have the occasional NT diffuse away and not towards the receptors. However, this is rare because of how short the distance is between the pre- and post-synaptic neurons (diffusion is great over short distances but really sucks over long distances - - diffusion over space is related to the distance as a square. So if it takes 1 second to go 1 unit, it would take 16 seconds to go 4 units.) When a NT does diffuse out of the synapse, it will typically be picked up by support cells (like astrocytes) where they can then be enzymaticly degraded. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one has commented this so I’ll add, in the brain, it’s estimated that for every 1 neuronal cell, there are about 10-50 glial cells. In simple terms these glial cells are “support cells”. These include cells like microglia, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. Astrocytes carry out many roles, one of which is to reabsorb, recycle, and redistribute the spilled over neurotransmitters to the appropriate neurons.</p>
<p>Even before some of the neurotransmitters diffuse out and away, “synaptic clefts” (the space between the pre-synaptic neuron and the post-synaptic neuron) have a very very small distance between them so it’s very likely for the neurotransmitters to diffuse to the target neuron first. The gap in the diagram  you linked is disproportionately large. The gaps IRL are about 30 nanometers.</p>
<p>Just FYI, “pre-synaptic neurons” (before the synaptic cleft) are the neurons that release the neurotransmitter. “Post-synaptic neurons” (which really means after the synaptic cleft) receive the neurotransmitter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They move from areas of high concentration to low concentration to reach an equilibrium, so from the pre synaptic membrane (high concentration) to the post synaptic receptors (low concentration), allowing the neurotransmitters to then bind to the receptors. The bigger the difference in concentration, the faster the neurotransmitters will diffuse to areas of lower concentration.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
