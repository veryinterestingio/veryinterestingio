		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Agree with most comments, except would note film is not pure analog, rather it does have grain. Grain is based on the photochemistry of the molecules imbedded in the gel, or film.</p>
<p>Highly sensitive color film has larger grain (fewer “pixels”) than lower ISO film. Black and white film has the least grain, or smallest grains, most pixels.</p>
<p>Sharpness of black and white film photos is governed more by camera shake, lack of focus, lense imperfections etc.</p>
<p>My impression is a high quality 35mm color film photo, is similar to approximately a 20 MPix digital photo. </p>
<p>Black and white perhaps 4x that in terms of grey scale, though obviously loses color dimension.</p>
<p>Though these differences are indistinguishable online, large format prints, or extreme cropping, make them relevant.</p>
<p>Small grain of B&amp;W film, speaks to “colorized“ black and white photos as being very aesthetically pleasing...and historic...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The clarity of an image comes from the quantity of information it contains. Now, “information” is a fascinating and subtle topic, but for our purposes we can think of the amount of information in a photograph as the number of pixels—in a black and white photo this is especially simple, in that we can divide the picture up into a grid of black or white dots. Each dot is a pixel, and the total number of these dots is the resolution of the image, and resolution (or “definition”) is another term for the quantity of information. Higher resolution is more clear. HD is High Definition.</p>
<p>If you’re thinking “Wait, old cameras has film, they don’t have pixels!” you’re right, but it turns out that light sensitive chemical photography does have “grain”, which is the smallest bit of information that the film can record, and for our purposes, we can basically treat electronic pixels and chemical grain as the same idea: a measure of information. </p>
<p>So why do older photos seem to be more clear? They contain more information! The reason is that the chemical film could pack way more light sensitive grains into the same area than digital electronic sensors. As technology proceeds, the number of electronic pixels has increased. Only relatively recently has digital caught up. </p>
<p>And even then, there is also the question of how big your <em>first</em> image is. Every picture you see on a screen or printed out is a copy of that first one, and will never have more information than the first one, which was made from light striking a photosensitive area, whether electronic or chemical. So the size of that area, and the size of each pixel determines the quantity of information: small pixel, big area gives you the most information. Older pictures are often made with cameras that give the best of both worlds. They used chemical film (or plates) that both fit more pixels into an area, and were much larger than any commercially available electronic sensors. A professional sensor now might actually be 35mm, which was basically the smallest film size. I have several cameras which use 120mm, and one that makes a first image in 4x5in. That’s just so much more information! That’s not even the largest commonly used format in the history of photography. </p>
<p>Film captures a lot of information for cheap, so old film photos are the original HD</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another reason is that some of those pics might have been taken by a medium format camera, where the negative is very large. Most handheld film cameras are/were 35mm sized negatives. Medium format is much larger and can be 'zoomed in' much more, giving a crisper photo when taken carefully. </p>
<p>And if you own a medium format camera, you are more than likely to be taking your photos carefully. It's all very expensive at this point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
