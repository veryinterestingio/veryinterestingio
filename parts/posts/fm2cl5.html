		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Herd immunity is the upper bound.</p>
<p>For measles, polio, and other prolific viruses its around 80%. This is what people with suppressed immune systems (who cant recieved vaccinations) depend on to prevent getting those viruses.</p>
<p>Here's an article: <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/herd-immunity%3famp=true" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/herd-immunity%3famp=true</a></p>
<p>Basically, it's the worst case scenario. 100% of the population wont get infected because eventually the amount of uninfected people are vastly outnumbered by those who have recovered already (and are thus immune due to developed antibodies). You cant infect somebody who was already infected.</p>
<p>If it gets bad enough that we rely on herd immunity, it's bad news. Hopefully social distancing is more effective.</p>
<p>I work for a catastrophe modeler, and unfortunately if we hit herd immunity, we are looking at over 2 million deaths in the US alone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A simplified explanation is that each person infects roughly 3 more persons. This is called the basic reproduction number(R0) and estimates vary. Therefore, when at least 2/3rds of the population are immune, each person will statistically only infect one person or less, thus stopping the spread.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>one factor is that, once people are infected, they become (im simplifying) either dead or immune.</p>
<p>this means that, once this number goes over a certain critical percentage of the population, the disease cant really spread much further because you dont encounter other suceptible individuals that can catch it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every virus has a property called &quot;The Basic Reproduction Number&quot; commonly abbreviated &quot;R0&quot; and pronounced &quot;R Naught.&quot; In simplest terms the value of R0 describes how contagious something is. A high R0 value indicates how rapidly it can spread throughout a new host, and the faster it can spread through a host the more easily it can then be transferred to more hosts. Using that value, it's then a probability game based on the density of a population. In a high density population, people experience more interactions, and every interaction has the risk of transferring the virus. Density alone doesn't paint a full picture though, if it did then a 100% infection rate would be inevitable for every virus over a long enough time span, and we know that's not the case. There's also models for how social networks form; within a larger population several sub-groups tend to form which have limited interactions between each other despite all living within the same area meaning the virus could die out within one sub-group and never transfer to a neighboring group. There's not a hard number for that last part though, so some assumptions have to be made about how &quot;communal&quot; a population is which produces a wide variety of possible outcomes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
