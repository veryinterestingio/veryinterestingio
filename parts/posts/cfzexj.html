		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I cant speak for butterflies but many species of moth fly in an erratic pattern to evade and confuse flying predators that generally attack in a straight line, for example bats. A bat uses sonar to detect flying insects and then dive bombs toward that vector. So a moth is zigging and zagging like someone in a field trying not to get shot. Many moths even possess a mechanism that makes them drop altitude instantly when they detect sonar vibrations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's safe to say that yes, butterflies do in fact have pretty good control over their flight paths.  A lot of the research I came across on this topic is more about aerodynamics than biology, and is consequently over my head, but I think the overall picture is reasonably clear: there's a lot more going on than random flailing around.  Butterflies exploit a variety of complicated mechanisms to generate lift and rapidly change orientation; to quote from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature01223" target="_blank">Srygley and Thomas 2002</a>, these include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;...wake capture, two different types of leading-edge vortex, active and inactive upstrokes, in addition to the use of rotational mechanisms and the Weis–Fogh ‘clap-and-fling’ mechanism.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And yes, it does seem like butterflies are able to control their wings to a pretty impressive degree.  For example, butterfly wings are not rigid, but can be deformed in various ways during flight, and at least some of these actions appear to be actively controlled (e.g., see <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0053060" target="_blank">Zheng et al. 2013</a> for an examination of wing twisting).  Another study I found, <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.93.033124" target="_blank">Fei and Yang 2016</a>, describes the surprisingly important role of body posture in flight, and how adjusting it can result in faster changes in orientation than just relying on wing beats would allow.</p>
<p>Many people have speculated as to <em>why</em> butterflies fly the way they do, and the answer to this is less easy to pin down.  There have been various attempts to look into how flight patterns might be used as mechanisms to avoid predation (e.g., <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2462312?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank">Chai and Srygley 1990</a>), but this may not be the complete answer.  Butterflies of course stand out among insects in that they display a wide range of colour patterns on their wings, with functions ranging from <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5d/f1/d8/5df1d8fc0b9416719d6a24cef1ffb187.jpg" target="_blank">camouflage</a>, to <a href="http://dyckarboretum.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/LateSummerFlowers-2008_-048.jpg" target="_blank">warnings</a>, and of course <a href="https://butterfly-conservation.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2018-07/24092428821-adonis-blue.jpg" target="_blank">sexual display</a>.  I don't think it's unreasonable to speculate that there are trade-offs between certain flight characteristics (e.g., speed) and having large wings for display purposes, and so this high degree of manoeuvrability may be a form of compensation in the absence of being able to escape predators by simply outrunning them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question has a pretty complicated answer, but here is a simplified answer. Flight pathing has a lot to do with which sensory system certain insects use for flight control. Many insects such as dragonflies have sufficient eyesight and visual processing to direct their flight visually. Other insects such as moths actually use antennae to orient themselves during flight. So while visually it may seem some insects have very erratic flight paths, their flight paths are just controlled with a different mechanism. If you could “see” what their antennae are picking up it would seem a lot less erratic. Imagine trying to find a fresh pie with your eyes closed and only using your nose, your path probably wouldn’t be a straight line.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something that hasn't been mentioned yet is optimal searching strategy for a lot of insects (only sort of relates, but interesting). Unfortunately, I cannot remember the scientific term because I haven't taken undergrad level bio in many years. But... Many insects depend on patchy resources randomly distributed throughout the environment (relative to the area they are able to forage). Evolution has led to many insects that forage for patchy resources to have &quot;local&quot; random walks searching for resources (flowers in the case of pollinators such as butterflies/bees/etc., other insects in the case of predators such as wasps/etc.) interspersed with long range linear &quot;jumps&quot;. I cannot cite a source on the math/probability involved, but many different distributions of random, patchy resources are best found using the random local walks interspersed with long-distance jumps. This relates a bit to movement that we perceive as somewhat haphazard circling, aimless-seeming flight patterns that eventually just lead to them flying off. It's a search strategy for resources.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
