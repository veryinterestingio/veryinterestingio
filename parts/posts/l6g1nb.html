		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Entropy is a measure of &quot;how many microstates lead to the same macrostate&quot; (there is also a natural log in there, but not important for this conversation). This probably doesn't clear up much, but lets do an example, with a piece of iron. </p>
<p>If you just hold a piece of iron that you mined from the Earth, it will have no, or at least very little, magnetic field. If you take a magnet, and rub it on the piece of iron many times, the iron itself will become magnetic. What is happening? Well, iron is made up of many tiny magnetic dipoles. When iron is just sitting there, most of the time, the little dipoles all face in random, arbitrary directions. You add up all of these tiny little magnetic dipoles and if they are just random, they will, on average, sum to zero. So, no overall magnetic field. </p>
<p>But when you rub a magnet over the piece of iron, now the little dipoles all become aligned, facing the same direction. Now, when you add all of the individual dipoles together, you don't get zero, you get some number, pointing in the direction the dipoles have aligned. </p>
<p>So, tying this back into entropy- the non-magnetized iron has high entropy. Why? Well, each of those individual dipoles are one &quot;microstate&quot;, and there are many, many options of how to arrange the individual dipoles to get to the &quot;macrostate&quot; of &quot;no magnetic field.&quot; For example, think of 4 atoms arranged in a square. To get the macrostate of &quot;no magnetic field&quot; you could have the one in the upper right pointing &quot;up&quot; the one in upper left pointing &quot;right&quot; the bottom right pointing down an the bottom left pointing left. That would sum to zero. But also, you could switch upper left and upper right's directions, and still get zero, switch upper left and lower left, etc. In fact, doing the simplified model where the dipoles can only face 4 directions, there are still 12 options for 4 little dipoles to add to zero. </p>
<p>But, what if instead the magnetic field was 2 to the right (2 what? 2 &quot;mini dipole's worth&quot; for this). What do we know? We know there are three pointing right, and one pointing left, so they sum to 2. Now how many options are there? Only 4. And if the magnetic field was 4 to the right, now there is only one arrangement that works- all pointing to the right. </p>
<p>So, the &quot;non magnetized&quot; is the highest entropy (12 possible microstates that lead to the 0 macrostate), the &quot;a little magnetized&quot; has the &quot;medium&quot; entropy (4 microstates) and the &quot;very magnetized&quot; has the lowest (1 microstate). </p>
<p>The second law of thermodynamics says &quot;things will tend towards higher entropy unless you put energy into the system.&quot; That's true with this piece of Iron. The longer it sits there, the less magnetized it will become. Why? Well, small collisions or random magnetic fluctuations will make the mini dipoles turn a random direction. As they turn randomly, it is less likely that they will all &quot;line up&quot; so the entropy goes up, and the magnetism goes down. And it takes energy (rubbing the magnet over the iron) to decrease the entropy- aligning the dipoles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of these answers dance around it but some sort of miss the mark. I’ve found that one of the best simple explanations is that entropy is a measure of the unavailability of energy in a system. Saying things like “disorder” used to be popular but are kind of misleading and many educators are moving away from that term.</p>
<p>I actually wrote a paper for the American Society of Engineering Education about more effective ways to teach the concept of entropy. There’s a lot of examples that can help you wrap your mind around it</p>
<p>[I removed this link for privacy, pm me if you want the paper]</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This blog helped me understand entropy much more, eve after studying entropy in thermodynamics: Understanding Entropy with Sheep <a href="https://aatishb.com/entropy/" target="_blank">https://aatishb.com/entropy/</a>  </p>
<p>To answer your question, entropy is the mathematical log of the number of states a system can take. Imagine a vessel with gas molecules, and the state of the system being the position of each molecule. As we increase heat (which also increases entropy), the molecules have more energy and therefore, the states that the system can take increase - there would be a lot more randomness, lots more collisions, etc. If we lower temperature, possible states reduce, and we reduce entropy. While measuring exact number of states that can exist is not precisely measurable, through experimentation, scientists have managed to understand/infer the relation this quantity (number of states) has with other physical characteristics (temperature, pressure, volume, etc.) In some situations, this helps us better represent thermodynamic principles such as the TS cycle graph for the (ideal) Carnot cycle, where in the expansion phase, a gas expands without losing heat energy or temperature (thus keeping entropy constant).  </p>
<p>Entropy always troubles me as it is an abstract concept that is directly difficult to measure (we can't physically count the number of possible states) - I had the same problem in understanding, for example, heat energy. Temperature is a derived concept, but is easily measurable, whereas the physical quantity is heat energy, which cannot be measured.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
