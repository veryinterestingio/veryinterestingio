		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh man, I am so happy you asked this because there's a very minor stirrup in the chess community <a href="https://en.chessbase.com/post/carlsen-and-giri-campaign-for-racial-equality" target="_blank">right now.</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The history of chess is actually really interesting. As other Redditors have pointed out, variations of the game go way back. Chess is a very old game. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_chess#Origin" target="_blank">Ancient, in fact.</a> Tracing chess history back far enough results in a sort of &quot;Ship of Theseus&quot; type situation-- at what point are we looking at a game that we can no longer consider &quot;chess&quot;?</p>
<p>But let's say for the purposes of answering your question that we're mostly interested in chess as we understand people in the 1100s to have played it-- checkered board, with distinct pieces with distinct movements. How did that game's rules change into the game we know today?</p>
<p>It essentially goes down like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have a monochrome board (no alternating squares) and roughly 6 or so distinct pieces on each side with distinct movements. One of these, the Bishop, only moves one space diagonally. There's no set rule on who moves first, so everyone flips a coin. Stalemates (all pieces taken except the King) are considered victories. The pieces are red and black, because those are the most common inks available right now.</li>
<li>Over time (a hundred years or so) it becomes very trendy to start using checkered boards. Someone notices the aforementioned Bishop never leaves its colored square. Someone suggests that the Bishop should move two spaces instead of one. Many people like this variation, and it catches on. The Queen, which previously could move two spaces, is now demoted to moving only one space, to make her distinct from the Bishop.</li>
<li>Games take too long. A few other changes are proposed among the very busy nobility to make the game go a little faster. Pawns now move two spaces on their first move and Bishops can move any number of spaces so long as they stay on their original colored square. In the same spirit, the Queen is now allowed to move any number of spaces in any direction. This was actually really popular in Spain in the 1300s, and people called it &quot;Mad Chess&quot; because of how dramatically different it made the game.</li>
<li>Shortly after this, people start writing books on how complex the game is. On how strategically valuable it is. There is a minor scandal with a Pope for playing the game, as it was considered a type of gambling. This brings more attention to the game, and as it becomes more widely known and written about, the rules become more solidified.</li>
<li>Timers are added to the game to make it go by faster. It had become trendy in the 1700s or so to play for days on end as a kind of intellectual flex. And nobody really liked that. Early timers are hourglasses, which are super inaccurate, and are eventually replaced with clocks.</li>
<li>Because books have been written about the game detailing its theories and strategies for hundreds of years, the rules are largely stable now. Especially since reading is common, and books are easy to obtain. In the 1800s, people stop flipping coins for who goes first and decide it will be the Red pieces. Eventually, Red becomes White by convention, as it draws a sharper contrast to the Black pieces.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>TL;DR:</p>
<p>So the shortest explanation is the game came from somewhere else (almost certainly India), people liked it, started playing by house rules, and as the popularity of the game spread there was a period (1400s) of rapid rule changes based on how the Nobility played their games. Then people started writing about it, and the rules remained relatively stable after that with only minor tweaks and changes.</p>
<p>Bonus fact:</p>
<p>In 1851, two chess masters played a particularly exciting game during the first ever organized world tournament. Adolf Anderssen (German) and Lionel Kieseritzky (Russian) were both big names, and Anderssen made several very exciting and counterintuitive moves that ultimately won him an unexpected victory. It's still highly studied to this day and is known as &quot;The Immortal Game.&quot;</p>
<p>The relevance of this game to your question is that in this game, Black (Anderssen) moved first. Though it's often annotated and studied as though Anderssen played White in order to stay in line with modern conventions of the game.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because people can accept things without some organization or &quot;governing body&quot; telling them to accept it. They use their reasoning capabilities to evaluate it themselves and make an individual choice. Usually, if enough people independently agree on a rule change, and it reaches a tipping point, people who don't accept the change will be forced into a position where they either accept it begrudgingly or find themselves with no one else to play with.</p>
<p>In many, many, cases, there usually isn't a consensus and you end up with two different games or at least a game with lots of different variations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like any sport or game, there were local &quot;house rules&quot; played in various locations at different times.</p>
<p>You can trace the specific lineage of the game that we play today, but that's not the only permutation that existed.  It's just the one that ultimately became the most popular.</p>
<p>For an extreme example, consider that all the various permutations of rugby/football/soccer share a single root sport.  The local rulesets all developed unperturbed in the far corners of the British empire to eventually create multiple distinctive sports.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most games have a way of playing that is more enjoyable and efficient to the majority of players and this becomes the most common way the game is played. </p>
<p>A very strange anomaly to this concept is the game Monopoly.
In almost any home you play Monopoly, the “house rule“ is that if you land on a property and choose not to buy it, the property remains with the bank and the next player takes their turn.
However, according to Monopoly's official rules, when you land on a property space and you choose not to buy it, the property must be auctioned off by the banker, and the other players can bid on it. It's a simple rule that changes everything. First, it speeds up the game, saving players a ton of time. Second, the game becomes much more dynamic than just the luck  of a die roll and landing on a space.  Strangely, the rule set that makes the game more about luck and much longer ( and thus less enjoyable since one of the critiques of monopoly is how long the game takes to play from a losing position) is the rule set that most people have adopted. </p>
