		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, you get too relaxed, to fast. Your body interprets the sudden drop in blood pressure when falling asleep as you dying, so it starts pulling all the levers to keep you alive. A sudden &quot;Jolt&quot; of vertigo to wake you up, a surge of adrenaline to get you alert and mobile, and feeling of shortness of breath to get you breathing deep to supply your body with oxygen. The basic checklist for things the body can do quickly to improve odds of survival in a life or death situation. </p>
<p>Then, you are fully awake and able to evaluate if you're in danger. To your stupid monkey brain, this is the best case scenario. After all, who needs sleep? Not vital to survival.</p>
<p>Though that does raise the question, when would this even be helpful?</p>
<p>&quot;Boy, I'm having a heart attack! So glad my brain woke me up so I can be conscious as I die in silent agony.&quot;/s</p>
<p>TLDR it's basically you subconscious' version of anxiety.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably not the same thing but I suffer from exploding head syndrome once in a while. It happens when you are close to falling asleep/waking up and is one of the weirdest sensations imaginable. It’s like a bomb exploding next to you but it’s all in your head.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Besides the hypnic jerk (the jerk we do that feels like falling when our blood pressure drops to very low levels more quickly than expected), there's also central sleep apnea where you'll just suddenly stop automatically breathing just as you start entering sleep; often times people wake up suddenly gasping for air since their oxygen levels dropped too low and their gasp reflex kicks in.</p>
<p>Basically, either your brain doesn't send the signal or something stops/blocks the signal from your brain, through your nerves, to your diaphragm/respiratory system to automatically have your body breathe (something you desperately need while sleeping). This is a very common occurrence in heart failure, strokes, or even sleeping at high altitudes. I recently had it happen to me one night for no discernable reason, and let me tell you: absolutely horrifying to continually wake up gasping for air immediately after trying to fall asleep time and time again. Plus, your heart rate ramps up and that triggers my anxiety, which personally makes me extremely afraid to try sleeping again. Good news is you're almost guaranteed to not die from it since you'll wake up to gasp for air as soon as your oxygen levels are too low!</p>
<p>This is also different from obstructive sleep apnea which is where something physical (such as your soft palate) blocks your airway while you're in deep sleep; this is the more common one and the one that can cause loud snoring that abruptly ends as their airway gets blocked</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
