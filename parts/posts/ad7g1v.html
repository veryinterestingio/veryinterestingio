		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both are calculated and are used depending on the context. </p>
<p>For example, income / population could be used to depict quality of life, whereas income / working population depicts the average income contribution per worker.</p>
<p>They're just two different measures with different uses. Often when people are looking at average income they are using it to gain some measure of quality of life for the overall population</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They’re two different questions with two different answers. Most of the time, “average income” is still not answered with gdp/pop, because a median number is more useful. The most commonly cited number I see is median income per household, since households tend to be a useful cluster of shared expenses. </p>
<p>For the US, at least, the Bureau of Labor Statistics provides fairly detailed breakdown of income by employment type and level, level of education, etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned, both are used, as they provide different information. We often see GDP/Population used when discussing the economic situation in a country because it includes factors such as a low work force. </p>
<p>For a simple example, you could have a country where the typical home is 1 person earning 55,000 a year, and they have a non-working spouse and 3.5 kids. Looking at the income/worker looks good at 55,000, but once you factor in their dependents, income drops to 10,000 per person. Then compare this to a country where a typical household is 2 workers earning 35,000 each and 2.5 kids.</p>
<p>We would use GDP/worker to analyze the market efficiency, position of the labor market, and other market specific measures, while GDP/population is more useful for determining things like quality of life in a country.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I view this as a data &amp; presentation question than an economics question. The question is around “on average how much does each person contribute”</p>
<p>Other examples of this are 100 people walked into my store. 40 people bought something and I had revenues of $5000 for the day. Was the average revenue per customer $50 or was it $125. Should I assess my business as revenue per visitor or revenue per paying customer? </p>
<p>At a top level the first answer of $50 is a simple metric around expectations on a per visitor basis.     It also takes into account the fact that some people pay 0, as not everyone will buy something, regardless of the circumstance. </p>
<p>Drilling down to the second number of $125 is more nuanced and looks at a conversion rate along with a top level traffic number. It helps provide answers on why revenue might be increasing-is it more customers coming in or is the conversion rate increasing. </p>
<p>Both are helpful and useful but one is a bit simpler and easier to use. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people are going to give you a lot of economic-theory based answers, and they aren't wrong, but the simplest answer is this: Total Population is widely available for many countries over a very long time span. The more descriptors you add, the fewer data points you will have to study and compare.</p>
<p>As a quick-and-dirty example, the UNSD dataset on Total Population has ~370,000 records, while the set on Labor Force Participation Rate has ~65,000 records.</p>
<p>Sometimes, availability trumps appropriateness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
