		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This specifically is called &quot;sudden-onset ringing tinnitus&quot; and is caused by a temporary misadjustment in the way our inner ear amplifies quiet sounds.  A high frequency is briefly set to over-amplify, but it takes a little while for the setting to be turned back down.  This &quot;turn it down&quot; response accounts for the &quot;cotton in my ears&quot; feeling one sometimes gets when the ringing ends.</p>
<p>This is a common occurrence, unrelated to age or injury.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mine is preceded by a sudden deafness in one ear that can almost put me off balance. Like a giant void has suddenly opened up on one side, (no reflected sound). To be quickly replaced by ringing that slowly subsides to normal in a few minutes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>High blood pressure is one possible cause of tinnitus, or it can make existing tinnitus more pronounced.</p>
<p>Stress, caffeine, lack of sleep, and other issues can make your blood pressure increase even if you don't have chronic hypertension.</p>
<p>When it happens, try sitting down and relaxing, doing some breathing exercises. If it makes a difference, that could be your issue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
