Nowadays the &quot;west&quot; is Europe and places that were settled by Europeans (North and South America, Australia...)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone seems to be missing one crucial point: the old world was all people knew at one point in history. America hasn't been discovered. So if the map is mostly one land continent (Eurasia), and people hadn't gone around the world through the ocean to the other side, it makes sense to call things East and West. Just like if you're looking at a map of just the USA, you'd call California west and Massachusetts east. Because it's not super intuitive to say it the other way around just because you can technically get to either by going east or west around the world.</p>
<p>In ancient times, you had to go west from China to get to Europe, and vice versa.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The original split was the Roman Empire. It was split into a Western half, based in Rome, and an Eastern half, based in Constantinople. This lead to everything European being West, and everything from Asia being East.</p>
<p>Later on the Greenwich meridian was chosen to be the official International East/West divide, since it put the date late mostly through the ocean. People don't really use that for the West/East country designation though, since that would make most of Europe &quot;East&quot; and they consider themselves &quot;West&quot; since the Roman empire days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something to remember is that language you ask the question is important too. English will give you answers from “western” perspective. If you asked in Chinese, you may find the answers will be slightly different because of culture and historic reasons.</p>
<p>I think many people have given you wonderful answers already.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just my two cents. Some of the earliest written history we have is by Herodotus, a greek historian. The major civilizations at that time were the Greeks and the Persians. The Persians were to the east of the Greeks, therefore East and West.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
