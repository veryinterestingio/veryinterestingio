		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You nails grow on kind of a track that keeps them attached to your nail bed. The end of the track is your finger tip and it allows the end to just run off. </p>
<p>Now if you were to rip your nail off it would hurt a lot because those track hold your nail firmly down so it grows in the correct direction.</p>
<p>If you have any damage to your nail bed, or the nail matrix (the white moon at the bottom) you have a deformity in the nail and/or have issues with it attaching the the nail bed firmly. Leaving you at higher risk for fungal or bacterial infections under the nail, high risk of it breaking and causing further damage, and just not having as pretty a nail to look at. </p>
<p>If you ever lose a nail, protect that nail bed at all costs. I have accidentally levered of two or three of my nails over the years... You can't tell because I babied the. It also hurts a lot to use you hands sans a nail. It provides support and protection to your otherwise very sensitive finger tip.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>whenifeellikeit:
The nail matrix is what's under the base portion your fingernail, where the cuticle is. The cells in the nail matrix manufacture a protein called keratin, which is what makes up your nails. As the proteins build up on top of the matrix, new ones push the older ones forward and out, which is what causes the nail to grow. The forward portion of skin under the nail is the nail bed. This part doesn't grow new nail, only the matrix, which is farther back. The nail on the nail bed is attached to the epidermis (outermost layer of skin), which is only a few cells thick. The epidermis is carried along with the nail as it grows. That's right, while most of your nail is made of keratin proteins, the underside is made of skin cells.</p>
<p>Reply
What stops it coming detached as it slips out? Why is the nail bed stuck to the nail for the duration?
Why does it suddenly stop at the end of the finger, and not cause the finger under the nail to be carried forward too?</p>
<p>Whenifeellikeit:
Keratin proteins that make up the nail are pretty tightly attached to each other, and also to the matrix cells at the base of the nail, under the cuticle. Epidermal cells and their junctions vary pretty widely throughout the body. The epidermal cells that make up skin are thicker and more tightly bound together than the ones under the nail.
I wish I could answer your question more thoroughly, but I'm still studying physiology. All I can think of is that nails are an adaptive trait that makes human hands more useful and durable. Carrying the fingers forward under the nail as it grows doesn't seem to be conducive to survival and reproduction. The skin cells of the nail bed are specialized tissue that has a very thin epidermal layer that is only loosely attached to the dermis underneath. Also, the cells have a relatively short life span, and as they are grown out under the nail, they desiccate and die.</p>
<p>(Sorry for the ugly formatting, I'm on mobile)</p>
<p>What I want to know now is what goes wrong when your nail does hurt at the end there? I don't bite my nails or anything, but the edge of my one nail drives me nuts. It's not pain, it's a weird like spiderweb feeling right at the end of the nail. Like there's something under the edge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
