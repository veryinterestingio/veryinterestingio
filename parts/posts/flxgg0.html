		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know the history of academia and how it came to be how it is, so I cannot tell you how it developed this way. But there are a few points that may help clarify why universities do most of the research:</p>
<p>The single most important point is that a researcher is a scientist. To become a scientist, you need training. Only a small part of this training is actual theoretical textbook knowledge and practical skills (experimental techniques), the biggest part of this training is actually the way of thinking. It sounds so simple right? Think critically and act logically. But it isn't. You hear about critical thinking everywhere, and everyone thinks they mastered it. It's so much more than that, it's not just about being skeptical about what you hear/read. It's skepticism about even what you see/observe. It is thinking about deep layers of how a study may or may not have made logical conclusions, how strong their data really is, how applicable their model is, do the stats make sense? Are there any biases in the experimenters, the method, the readout, the publishing, blah blah? When do you stop doubting at all with zero uncertainty and start believing? Until you learn that the answer is never, you haven't really become a scientist. And this sort of mentality can only develop in a structured environment stripped away from as much conflict of interest as possible. How do you get such an environment? You make an institution where profit is not the goal or the consequence. And you make the faculty or teaching body completely independent of being influenced or swayed from their pursuit of truth (tenure). Of course... Universities are veerry far from being this ideal, and many things bias students and professors alike, such as power, prestige, politics, publishing etc. But... At least it's not money per se (in most cases) unlike companies. So to conclude, research is widespread in universities because that is where researchers are trained, and where the majority of unbiased science comes from. Think of a paper from a cosmetics company saying they found a lotion that stops skin aging completely. Would you believe it right Away? They have far too much reason to claim something that isn't true, because it sells and they gain.</p>
<p>Another big reason is money. You need obscene amounts of money to test even the simplest of hypotheses. You can get this money from investors for example. But investors only give the money for an idea they think would end up in product as quick as possible. And so this limits how many ideas you can explore and puts chains on the progression of science. If the money however was coming from the government, or taxpayers money, and a whole institution of unbiased individuals are sitting behind their offices reviewing how rational a study is, how ethical, how much it could benefit humanity, etc, you would have a much better system for advancing science without unnecessary restraint. Of course... There is bias too, but it's relatively negligible compared to that of a board of investors in a company. So that's another reason.</p>
<p>There are many more, but I don't want to make this a giant comment. I think I gave the two major ones, and I'd be happy if others add onto them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A great deal of research actually does take place at private companies. That's where the vast majority of PhDs (in the hard sciences at least) end up. You just tend not to hear about that research because it focuses on very practical problems like how to make this shampoo produce 10% more bubbles, etc. </p>
<p>Research universities tend to attract the brightest minds to do &quot;basic research&quot; because that's the research with the highest variance in output. Some very smart people will spend their entire careers working hard to expand our knowledge of some subfield that ends up having little practical benefit to anyone. They couldn't have known that going in, but that's just the way it went. Other equally smart people will work equally hard to make groundbreaking discoveries that fundamentally change human civilization. That's the research you hear about, so that's why you associate research with universities. </p>
<p>Ultimately, private companies (that just want to make money) aren't willing to pay someone millions of dollars over their career for the tiny chance they might discover something really cool. Universities ARE willing to do that. They are very long-lived institutions with a mission of expanding knowledge rather than just making money. They collect lots of money from giving students access to their smart people, and they also collect donations from private donors and governments that share their mission.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
