		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Protons in the nucleus naturally repel each other, because they are all positively charged. They have some attraction because of the strong nuclear force, but neutrons are required to supply extra attractive strong force to hold the protons together. You can see on <a href="http://www.passmyexams.co.uk/GCSE/physics/images/atom-stability-graph.jpg" target="_blank">this graph</a> - you generally need slightly more neutrons to hold the protons together, and at some point the protons repel so much it is simply impossible for them to be stable.</p>
<p>Besides that, floating or not floating is much more dependent on large-scale structure. Either molecules or macroscopic structures need to be less dense than water. Solid beryllium sinks, even though it's the fourth element in the periodic table. On the other hand, all the noble gases would float right out of the water, despite having high atomic weights.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 2 ideas to consider</p>
<p>1) Atoms cannot arbitrarily have fewer neutrons. The quantity must be a stable configuration or it will likely break apart. So it isn't theoretically or practically possible to &quot;remove&quot; any number of neutrons and still leave the atom. </p>
<p>2) The concept of density and atomic mass are different. Each individual atom might be heavier or lighter but the density (mass per unit volume) depends on the &quot;tightness&quot; of the arrangement. It is entirely possible that a loosely packed structure of heavy atoms will be less dense than a tightly packed structure of atoms (consider the molecular mass of a gas like hydrogen sulphide compared to water - hydrogen dioxide. Although H2S is heavier per molecule compared to H2O, it is less dense at room temperature because one happens to be a gas and the other a liquid)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Important note here that hasn't been mentioned:</p>
<p>Most of the matter around us is in the form that it is due to the chemical bonds it makes, not the isotope (how many neturons) it is. The electrons form the bonds with other atoms around it, and the nucleus is largely uninvolved with this process (beyond tellung us what element we have from the number of Protons in the nucleus.</p>
<p>For example; Oxygen-16, Oxygen-17 and Oxygen-18 all chemically act the same way, so the change in isotope doesn't affect the matter we see and feel that matter. The only real exception to this is Hydrogen Isotopes, which do start to act a bit different depending on how many Neutrons are present. This is due to the fact that there is such a small number of protons and neturons in the nucleus, that adding or removing any neutrons significantly impacts the weight of the atom: Hydrogren-2 (Dueterium) has about double the mass of Hydrogen-1 (Protium), but has the same nuclear charge.</p>
<p>In your example, if we took a samle of Gold (Fun fact, only occurs naturally as one stable isotope: Gold-197) that is entirely Gold-190, it would still look and feel like normal Gold does, because chemically its behaving in the same way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
