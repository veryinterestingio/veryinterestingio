		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Animals and plants have evolved alongside each other and have always been eating each other. For most things, it's just the way it's been.</p>
<p>Humans didn't pop out one day and had to figure everything out.</p>
<p>For other stuff, it's like other have said. Watching animals eat it. Or having to eat it out of desperation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don't have to die to know if something is safe/unsafe.  Although there is that risk.</p>
<p>There would be a certain amount of risk involved, but if you eat a very small amount of something and it doesn't make you sick, then you can try eating a slightly larger amount of it, etc.  It's basically trial by error.  A lot of things would make you ill if you ate them in decent quantities, but in small amounts would just make you feel not great.  It's relatively few things that would kill you even in small amounts (e.g. hemlock and monkshood).</p>
<p>Then the information gets passed down via oral tradition.</p>
<p>The greater question is how did people discover that SOME parts are edible whilst others aren't?!  That's just a testamant to the tenacity/stupidity/curiosity of humans.  Rhubard stalks are edible, but the leaves will poison you.  Asparagus stalks are delicious, but the berries are poisonous. Mayapple fruit is edible in small amounts but the rest of the plant is poisonous.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hunger makes people desperate. A lot of it is trial and error. When you're facing starvation, you start to become open to trying to figure out if a certain kind of mushroom still makes you violently sick if you just boil it enough.</p>
<p>Similarly, cheese is essentially spoiled milk, but if you're really short on food you're probably willing to give it a try if nothing else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a post about this a while back in another thread.. can't remember where (if anyone knows maybe they can provide a link)</p>
<p>Basically it went along the lines of..</p>
<ol>
<li>Rub a tiny amount of the thing on your skin. If you get a rash, don't risk consuming it.</li>
<li>Rub a tiny amount of the thing on your gums. Rash or inflammation, don't eat.</li>
<li>Eat a tiny amount of it. Any nausea, sickness, rash, etc, don't eat any more.</li>
<li>Eat a slightly larger amount. Etc</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course this methodology could also be combined with the other answers (get someone else in the tribe to do this, do it to an animal, etc. Although animal testing might not be ideal for humans as we have different digestive tracts..)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The proper ELI5 is that early people used to starve. A lot.   </p>
<p>People tried to eat anything they could. It explains every one of these &quot;who was the first person to think of eating this weird food?&quot; questions. It's always &quot;Someone really hungry&quot;.   </p>
<p>If the alternative is starvation, trying to eat something is not going to make you any deader.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
