		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Previously the kilograms was based on the mass of an arbitrary piece of metal in France, and companion pieces of metal were made of the same mass and given to other countries as well. It has been discovered that all of these pieces are not as precisely the same as you would like, as well as the fact that radioactive decay is making them slightly less massive all the time. Also with only I think 5 of these in the world, it's very hard to get access to them for tests if needed. </p>
<p>To combat these things and make sure that the mass of a kilogram stays the same forever, they are changing the definition to be a multiplier of a universal constant. The constant they selected was pretty well known but scientists were off by about 4 digits on its value, so they spent recent years running different experiments to get their value perfect. Now that it is we can change the kilogram value, and other base units that are derived from the kilogram. And since this universal constant is well.... universal, you no longer need access to a specific piece of metal to run tests. So anyone anywhere will now be able to get the exact value of a kilogram.</p>
<p>But the mass of a kilogram isn't actually changing, just the definition that derives that mass. So instead of &quot;a kilogram is how ever much this thing weighs.&quot; It will be &quot;a kilogram is this universal constant times 12538.34&quot;</p>
<p>Some base units that are based on the kilogram, like the mole will actually change VERY slightly because of this new definition but not enough to impact most applications. And even with the change we know that it's value will never change again. </p>
<p>Edit : Fixed a typo and change weight to mass because apparently 5 year olds understand that better then weight.......</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5: The way we &quot;define&quot; the measurement has changed, but otherwise everything is exactly the same. It's kinda like saying &quot;We used to use the ford focus as the standard &quot;car&quot;. Now we're saying the standard &quot;car&quot; is a vehicle with 4 wheels and is shorter than x meters, etc etc. We went from a physical &quot;standard&quot; to a &quot;virtual&quot; one. </p>
<p>ELI'm Older: The values are the same, only the &quot;thing&quot; we consider the &quot;official&quot; kilogram has changed.</p>
<p>Back in the day, we used to standardize everything by making a really really good and accurate &quot;thing&quot;. For example, the meter used to be defined by a literal bar of metal that was exactly 1 meter long. This was considered to be &quot;THE&quot; meter, the most accuratest meter ever. Same with the kilogram. The kilogram has always been defined by a few different 1 kilogram weights that were given to a bunch of different countries. These weights weighed EXACTLY 1.000000 kilogram (as accurate as we could make it.) (This isn't exactly true but I'm not going to get into it.)</p>
<p>So we used to define the kilogram by an accurate &quot;weight&quot; but those are bad because they degrade and they change depending on temp and humidity etc. But now we're saying that the &quot;kilogram&quot; is exactly how much &quot;weight&quot; can be held up by a certain amount of energy using electromagnets. The energy is defined using &quot;Planck's constant&quot; which is a universal constant. The device used to measure this is called a &quot;Watt&quot; (or Kibble) balance.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibble_balance" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibble_balance</a></p>
<p>So basically we went from a physical block of metal as the &quot;kilogram&quot; but now we're defining it as &quot;X amount of energy will lift exactly 1 kilogram&quot;</p>
<p>This is good because instead of needing this really expensive physical object, anybody can replicate the &quot;kilogram&quot; provided they build a sufficiently accurate machine because Planck's constant is... well... a constant and everyone knows it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Instead of defining the kilogram based on a physical object by which constants are derived, they are coming to an agreement on those constants and defining the value of the Kg from these new 'uncertain' values. </p>
<p>Here is a rather informative video by Veritasium which explains the problem and process rather well</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the past, the Kilogram was defined as the weight of a particular hunk of metal in France.<br />
Countries would bring their own hunk of metal, and make it so that it weighed the same as the original hunk, and then calibrate their own weights.<br />
This had problems, because the scale might not be exactly accurate, and things like dust would add or remove tiny amounts of weight.<br />
Also if someone accidentally scrapped of a bit of that metal, the kilogram would change.</p>
<p>They changed it to a physics definition.<br />
Now instead of going to France to weigh your piece of metal, you do a physics experiment at home and then compare with that experiment.  </p>
<p>The difference is tiny, so unless you are doing some seriously hardcore physics, you won't notice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The actual value of it hasnâ€™t been changed, just how that value is determined. Originally there were actual physical kilogram weights that set the standard value of the kilogram, but for obvious reasons there are issues with this, so they changed it to base the value off of universal physical constants.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
