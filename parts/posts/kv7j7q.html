		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you're confusing two separate concepts. One is land ownership, the other is sovereign territory. Land has both an owner and a country. In the case of the Louisiana Purchase, the land transferred ownership from the French government to the US government, and the sovereignty transferred from France to the US.</p>
<p>Normally when you buy land, the sovereignty remains with the same country. If I buy a plot of land in Canada or wherever, then that land is still part of the country of Canada. However, the ownership of that land is now transferred to me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ul>
<li>In the US, when you buy property, you own it, not the government.</li>
<li>The land is still considered part of the territory of the the United States and also the state in which is lies but the government doesn't &quot;own&quot; it.</li>
<li>There is a process by which the government can take the land back but they technically pay you for it and so force you to sell it to them.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you have more guns &amp; troops than the folks nearby, you ALWAYS have the option to take a bit of land and sell it to someone else; this is still true in 2021. The Louisiana purchase was between one empire with many guns, the French, and another, the new empire of the US which was busy expanding east to west across North America. The land originally belonged to other peoples but famously they weren't given much say in much.</p>
<p>Modern states depend on old thefts and if the land you bought for your house wasn't part of the state anymore, the state would eventually cease to exist! States are very committed to continuing existing.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Transactions like the Louisiana Purchase are not really a &quot;purchase.&quot;</p>
<p>For $15million, what the United States got was simply the nation state of France ceasing to claim the area in question. Over the course of the next 75 years numerous occupying Native American cultures quite adamantly disputed the U.S. ownership of various parts of the Louisiana Purchase.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The private ownership of the land continued on through, the residents just changed nationalities.  &quot;Spanish Land Grants&quot;, for example, carried through despite the USA taking over Mexican/Spanish lands.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
