		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding info to other good comments.  The x-rays themselves would be very similar and generated in the same way as medical x-rays.  However, they would be much lower energy so that differences could be seen from such a thin subject (the painting surface).  The higher the x-ray energy, the more penetration.  If trying to see very subtle differences in thickness and material, a lower energy would be blocked differentially by such small details and provide useful contrast.  The x-ray detectors that form the images would be more sensitive or (in the case of phase-contrast imaging) count/process the image data in a different way.  Besides just thickness differences created by different layers of paint, some paint pigments are mineral-based and the effective atomic number of different pigment molecule types can generate appreciable contrast, especially at low x-ray energies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What is missing from the previous answers thus far is that many old masters tinted colors with lead white. The lead is what shows up in X-rays. So a painter like Rembrandt, working in the 17th century, would often lay in strokes of white as a base texture and highlight for certain areas, after an initial sketch or dead color stage in a darker color. He would then scumble over the white texture with other layers on top. The x-rays penetrate the top layer and show the lead white that reveals structure and texture that may not be entirely evident on the surface. If you google Rembrandtâ€™s Kenwood Self-Portrait (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Portrait_with_Two_Circles#/media/File%3ARembrandt_Self-portrait_(Kenwood).jpg" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Portrait_with_Two_Circles#/media/File%3ARembrandt_Self-portrait_(Kenwood).jpg</a> ) and his Self-Portrait in the Mauritshuis (<a href="https://www.mauritshuis.nl/en/explore/the-collection/artworks/selfportrait-840/" target="_blank">https://www.mauritshuis.nl/en/explore/the-collection/artworks/selfportrait-840/</a>), the main difference in the turbans is that Rembrandt stopped at an earlier stage in the Kenwood painting, without adding any additional color or pattern. But also under the turban in the Mauritshuis, Rembrandt laid down a similar structure with thick strokes of lead white. </p>
<p>Another type of radiography, infrared reflectography, is useful in penetrating paint layers to reveal under drawings (initial sketches in dark paint like umber or even chalk or charcoal) if the ground preparation of the panel or canvas is in a light color. This is especially useful with early Netherlandish painting of the 15th and 16th century. </p>
<p>The newest technique is XRF, X-ray fluorescence. This bombards the surface in small areas at a time and returns elemental signatures from the region exposed. Knowing the combination of elements present, it is often possible to determine what kinds of paint pigments are present. So you might see a red on the surface but the XRF might tell you that a red and a blue are there, indicating that a change was made. This could sometimes be determined in the past with a small pin prick core sample viewed under a microscope. XRF enables you to scan the entire painting bit by bit, putting together a composite on the computer, without physically damaging the painting in any way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Industrial radiographer here. I haven't x-rayed paintings before, but I've done everything from &lt;1mm thick rubber gloves to 18&quot; thick steel castings.</p>
<p>Xrays are a form of electromagnetic energy which travels in waves. One of the primary features of an xray tube is the kV (kilovolt) setting. This determines the highest energy generated for a given exposure. Higher energy xrays have shorter wavelengths, which are able to more easily penetrate a given material and expose the film/imaging plate/detector being used to capture an image. The xrays produced are inclusive of all wavelengths up to the peak kV.</p>
<p>Radiographs are able to be formed because some of the energy passing through the part is absorbed or scattered, while some energy passes through the part to expose the film/IP/detector. The areas of the part which are denser or thicker will block more of the radiation from passing through, creating a contrasting exposure and showing the shape of the denser area on the resulting image.</p>
<p>Something like a painting would be extremely easy for xray energy to penetrate. However, there would still be changes in density between given areas from the slight differences in paint thickness in any given area. And especially if there were a second image painted underneath the first; there would be an additional layer of paint to block the radiation.</p>
<p>You would likely want to use a very low energy xray to shoot something like a painting, otherwise a large percentage of the radiation would simply pass through the part and cause overexposure which just burns the image out. You need to use a low enough energy that enough radiation is absorbed by the part to create that contrasting exposure which allows you to see detail.</p>
<p>For example, the rubber gloves that I've imaged used the lowest setting I had available, which was 60kV. In contrast to that, I regularly use a 6mEv (megaelectronvolt) linear accelerator which can penetrate up to 18-20&quot; of steel to xray large castings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
