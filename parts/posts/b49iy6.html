		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have been to a wildlife park in the UK where they have different breed of antelope and some of them are albino. The ranger explained that in the wild, the rest of the herd would expel the albino from the group because they stick out like a sore thumb and are therefore a danger to the rest of the herd. Obviously in this park there are no predators so they’re allowed to chill with the gang. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It will depend on what kind of associations the animals have developed in response to this kind of stimuli. </p>
<p>I recall a study done on birds where researchers painted white spots above the male’s beaks. They repeated this study each breeding season. In the first year, the white-faces males were largely unsuccessful in finding breeding partners. However, in the following year, the white-faced males were strongly preferred over the natural colour! </p>
<p>This is an example of sexual selection, and it occurs naturally in the wild all the time as the result of normal mutations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>one of the best books I ever read was &quot; the painted bird &quot; it mentions something like in passing. people would catch crows and things and paint them white..the white one would try to join the others, and they would drive it off. eventually they would wind up killing it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have observed, first hand on a small game reserve in South Africa.</p>
<p>We have a small herd of blesbok, normally a blue brown colour. We added 5 white blesbok (not sure if they are true albino
or a white mutation). </p>
<p>The white animals seemed to immediately recognise the normal coloured animals as being the same. That may have been because that had mixed with normal colour animals before we got them.</p>
<p>The normal colour animals initially ran away from the white animals, but within a week or so they had completely adjusted to the white ones being part of the herd.</p>
<p>I guess shape, smell, movements and behaviour are sufficient for them to make the connection.</p>
<p>Edit for context: These animals are wild, no human interaction. Also, no predators on our reserve.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have absolutely no authority on this subject but...if we can see through several generations that albino animals make it to adult hood then wouldn’t it mean that the majority of animals are <em>not</em> abandoning/rejecting albinos amongst their own herds /nests?</p>
<p>Edit: not gonna lie, I’m pretty disappointed in this subreddit down voting my comment when it was a sincere idea. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
