		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mucus. Vagina is covered by mucous membrane like mouth, the inside of nostrils etc. Mucous membranes are covered by a layer of mucus that enables their function (keeps the right ph balance, right micro biome, and because it has no layer of dead epidermis it protects it from drying out). In vaginas it also serves to flush out foreign bodies like bacteria that can cause infections. In case of infections that develop discharge can increase, change in texture, smell or colour because it contains other things like dead antibodies etc</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The discharge women get most of the time is a mix of cervical fluid (a mucus) and water. It keeps the vagina clean by flushing out bacteria. Over the course of a woman’s menstrual cycle, the amount of cervical fluid can fluctuate. </p>
<p>Before and after a woman gets her period, discharge is usually more watery. Around the time of ovulation, however, the discharge has more cervical mucus and gets thicker and “stretchier.” This is because, in addition to keeping the vagina clean, discharge actually helps a woman get pregnant. During ovulation, stretchy mucus makes it easier for sperm to get to the opening of the cervix so that they have a better chance of finding and fertilizing the egg.</p>
<p>Finally, a woman can also secrete <em>transudate</em> (a thin, slippery vaginal lubricant), particularly during periods of physical arousal. This makes sexual penetration easier and more enjoyable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a fluid (also called mucus) that comes from the vagina. Its purpose is to keep the vagina moist and clean,  it also protects from and fights against infections. </p>
<p>There is more information on health websites, like the NHS or even kids health.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
