		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know someone more qualified will eventually answer but my quick two cents is this.</p>
<p>When you exercise a muscle to complete exertion (the pump/intense burn) you damage and leave microtears in the fibre of your muscle tissue.</p>
<p>While carb and protein rich foods supply the nutrients when you are awake and eating to replenish your glycogen storage and send repair cells to the already torn tissue, the process is minimal while one is still active and using energy for other things in your daily routine.</p>
<p>When one falls asleep the body properly prioritizes recovery since your brain is no longer telling your body to be actively awake.</p>
<p>You go through 5 cycles in a full sleep which each vary to some degree the rate of recovery for your muscles. If I can recall correctly, NREM which is the 2nd last cycle of sleep is the most productive cycle that encourages HGH (Human Growth Hormone) to bolster the nutrients from food to come repair the torn tissue fibres.</p>
<p>EDITED: for clarifications</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The body repairs itself when it sleeps. This is due to the release of HGH (human growth hormone) in REM sleep. Also, your body knows that it won't need the energy for the next few hours so it directs more nutrients and energy to repairing itself. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is not something that can be explained by hormones and other bodybuilding pseudoscience.</p>
<p>We have many different chemical pathways, some of them take the form of cycles. Two distinct cycles at play here are the cell cycle, that regulates growth and repair, and the circadian clock, which is intimately linked to the cell cycle.</p>
<p>The circadian clock is our body clock, it tells us when to sleep and wake, and it tunes itself though UV light hitting our retina. When you sleep it upregulates growth and repair through the cell cycle. It has done this for billions of years, cyanobacteria, 2 billion+ years ago, had a basic form of this clock so they could replicate their DNA during the night time in the absense of harmful UV radiation.</p>
<p>It is the circadian clock that directs the body to grow, if at all, overnight.</p>
<p>Since I am on mobile I am not going to put any citations right now, however, if you save my comment or reply I will provide interesting and relevant journal article references tomorrow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
