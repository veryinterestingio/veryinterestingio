		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I once asked someone I was comfortable enough with to call attention to it (a mid-30's coworker who was not 'proud', but 'comfortable' with admitting he has no teeth due to drug use, usually accompanied by &quot;don't do hard drugs, they're not worth it&quot;) why he does this, and he said &quot;my gums feel weird I guess. They bug me a bit if I don't, so I subconsciously just sorta... Do that.&quot; I assume it's kinda like how your tongue instinctively kinda shifts around a bit? I don't know if that's for everyone or just him, but that was the explanation I've been rolling with.  </p>
<p>Or, for a joke answer, &quot;because they have chewing gums.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your jaw has a comfortable resting spot. When you lose your teeth your jaw no longer has a comfortable resting spot. That chewing is the jaw trying to find a resting spot that isn't there anymore.   </p>
<p>I wish I could remember the name of it.</p>
