		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While probably not the oldest technique, the use of splints for nonoperative treatment of fractures has remained largely unchanged.  There is direct evidence that the ancient Egyptians used splints as they have been found in mummies and hieroglyphics.  In fact they used quite intricate lower extremity splints made of bark or wood covered in a softer material and soft upper arm splints utilizing gravity as a form of traction which is similar to how they are used today. </p>

Trepanning has been regularly done over wide areas of the planet for at least 7000 years so may be in the running. Though its probably not done for the same reasons today, its still an ongoing procedure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

(approximately 400 BC) One example is his technique for realigning shoulder dislocations or draining ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdomen)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
