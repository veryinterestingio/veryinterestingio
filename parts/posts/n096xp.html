		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It takes very little time to absorb water.   You absorb it right from the time it hits your stomach, unlike a lot of food which has to pass through to the small intestine before you can start to absorb it.  It’s also very easy to absorb it.   You have special holes in your stomach and small intestine for water to just mosey through, unlike most things which need to be frog-marched through by an escort.   This makes water absorption very, very fast. </p>
<p>As soon as you start absorbing water, your blood volume increases because that is where water goes.  Increasing your blood volume increases your blood pressure.  Increasing your blood pressure tells special sensors in your blood vessels that you are no longer dehydrated.  This message gets sent to your brain neurologically, and your brain stops releasing the “you are thirsty” hormone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you can take in a lot of water fast, and because it is dangerous to drink too much water (you dilute your blood too much), our body's detection of thirst is quietened by the sensation of water in your mouth. The body also releases reserves of water, say, from muscles or the digestive system, knowing that those reserves will soon be refilled.</p>
<p>If it didn't do this, a thirsty person who reaches water would drink several litres quickly, well before the level of hydration caught up, then there'd be a huge whack of water to come. That would be deadly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain is always predicting the future.  (See: *Seven and a Half Lessons About the Brain by Lisa Feldman Barrett). Its experience is that when you drink water your thirst will go away, so it anticipates that and makes your thirst go away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>It's a hard wired pavlovian response. Our entire existence has programmed that switch to our lips rather than anywhere else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are receptors in our mouths/throats that sense the water you're drinking. That instantly shuts down the thirst feeling in the brain (hypothalamus) for the ~ten minutes it takes for the water to actually hydrate your body.</p>
<p>Then if you aren't properly hydrated it kicks in again and you drink some more. Repeat until you're actually hydrated.</p>
