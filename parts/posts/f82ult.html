		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The current scientific research on sexual attraction suggests that the same hormone that causes you to &quot;fall in love&quot; is just the general excitation hormone dopamine being interpreted as attraction and not fear or general excitement. However, when something &quot;scares&quot; you, and you get the same hormonal response as if you were falling in love, some people then interpret the hormonal signal as &quot;attraction&quot; and not &quot;fear&quot;. From a purely physical perspective there is no difference between the two, but from a psychological perspective, how your conscious mind interprets your bodies response to stimulus is what emotion is and not the unconscious response that generally happens in the hippocampus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as the psychological aspect goes, it's partly to do with our attraction to the taboo, and can also be about power imbalance.</p>
<p>Something many people notice as they get deeper into the porn wormhole is that they get numb to the tamer stuff the longer they are exposed to it. Even people who are just in a long term relationship know that the more routine something feels, the less sexually exciting it is. We tend to seek out new experiences, and since sex is already somewhat of a taboo subject depending on your surroundings, to find new sexual experiences, we end up having to venture into even more forbidden territory.</p>
<p>The more &quot;wrong&quot; the sex, the newer and more exciting it feels to someone who is already numb. Monsters are one of these categories, where people for whom regular porn just doesn't do it anymore find something exotic enough to be erotic.</p>
<p>There also tends to be an element of power imbalance at play. Often, the monsters in question dominate their subject. Power exchange is something you can find in most sexual content, and that's because people are attracted to it. Sometimes it's because you get some catharsis out of being in control, in the case of someone who fantasizes playing the role of a dom. Other times it's because you crave the security and (ironic) freedom that being under the control of someone else provides.</p>
<p>Keep in mind these are just the broad strokes in regards to strange attractions. These topics have been very thoroughly covered by psychologists over the years, and you can find loads more detail on Google if you're looking for it. There's no way I could cover all of the weird offshoots of attraction that have been researched over the years, but suffice it to say that the short answer is attraction to the forbidden, and power exchange.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I know of literary theory, most popular monsters are supposed to be a reflection of humanity with some aspect that we fear amplified. For many of the most popularly sexualized monsters like vampires and werewolves, they're a reflection of human sexuality, namely seduction and overpowering sexual drive. Boom, sexy monsters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
