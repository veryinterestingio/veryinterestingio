		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sorry if this is a stupid question, I feel a bit dopey for asking! I read that the human body replenishes all of its cells as it grows (the Trigger's Broom thing) and that, on average, humans have a new set of skin cells every seven years. If this is true, how is it the case that tattoos stay intact when the skin cell is replaced? Obviously the ink isn't built into the cell itself, so how do they stay on the skin when the cells are brand new?</p>
<p>Apologies if I'm off-base on anything I've written :)</p></div></div>

<p>Tattoos fade over time not because of skin cell regeneration, but because the body knows the ink molecules are foreign objects and your white blood cells will be chipping away at it for the rest of your life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Your body isn't made up entirely of cells. Most of you has some structure to it that comes from proteins that collectively form the ExtraCellular Matrix, or ECM. This structure is what holds your skin cells in place, along with everything else that is considered part of you, and it actually outnumbers your cells by volume in many cases.</p>
<p>When you get a tattoo, this is where the dye goes. With the relatively big tattoo needle, a cell that gets hit by it isn't going to so much &quot;get ink in it&quot; as &quot;go splat.&quot; So all the ink winds up in the ECM, around the cells.</p>
<p>It gets recognized by your immune system as foreign, not supposed to be inside you. The smaller bits get carted off by immune cells, but the larger ones are intentionally too big. So instead, your immune system builds more ECM around them to keep the dye away from the rest of the body. The dye has to be chosen to be non-toxic and not dissolve in or react with water, or it could leach out anyway and start really messing up your body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The body does grow new skin cells and disposes of the old (if I'm not mistaken, old skin is one of the main 'ingredients' of dust in your room - though I would have to double check), but some corrections: the 7-10 year span would concern all your cells (basically 'rebuilding' your entire body in that span), not just skin cells, and even that number is a myth; the cells are dying off and being replaced all the time in our body, making a X-year cycle nonsensical.</p>
<p>To your question, though: the ink goes deeper into a layer called <em>dermis</em> - it lies under the outern skin layer (called <em>epidermis</em>). The skin that you envision as 'dead skin' is the most outer layer of the epidermis layer, called <em>stratum corneum</em> and it is this layer that regenerates most frequently. The dermis layer does not regenerate nearly as frequently, because it is protected by these outer layers.</p>
<p>Aside from that, a tattoo is also permanent because of your immune system. A short read here:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So when you get a tattoo your body responds in a number of ways. First, you have a standard inflammation response, this is key because it explains why a tattoo doesn't just fade immediately. An absolutely massive part of this response is your body attempting to isolate the site of an injury, and guess what, that needle jabbing you over and over again sets off all sorts of injury alarms.  Macrophages move in to start phagocytosis, essentially they're going to eat up as much of that colorant as possible because they don't think it belongs in the body. What the macrophages dont eat ends up in fibroblasts.</p>
<p>So on to your question, why doesn't the tattoo get shed off?</p>
<p>Well the answer is part of it does and part of it doesnt. In the process of getting the tattoo colorant is deposited in the epidermis and dermis. The stuff in the epidermis only lasts about 2 weeks before it's shed away. Now getting back to the dermis and the inflammatory response. After macrophages eat up as much colorant as they can one of two things happens to them Some of them get transported away in the lymph system, tatoo ink is routinely found in lymph nodes, but some of them also remain at the site of the injury(tatoo) and these macrophages and fibroblasts sort of just hang out there. But dont they die? Yes they absolutely do die, but the ink in them remains and in the process of cleaning up these dead cells new cells consume the ink and the process just repeats it's self over and over again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
