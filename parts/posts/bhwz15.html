		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s two problems with most sites:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They are given bad advice from their teams. Most people have not read any of the legislation, they don’t actually know what they can and cannot do, so they implement it poorly.</p>
</li>
<li>Most sites that rely on advertising for revenue <em>want</em> to make it confusing and annoying so you just press ‘Yes to all.’</li>
</ol>
<p>A lot of sites implement GDPR and related cookies. They should not be adding any cookies that require permission until they have permission. Some do and some don’t.</p>
<p>There’s three types of cookies.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The first is transactional cookies. You don’t need permission or need to even mention it, for example, when you sign into a site a cookie can be used to remember that you’re signed in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second is non-tracking but not required cookies. For example for using analytics or ‘previously viewed’. You just need to let the user know that these are happening.</p>
</li>
<li>The third is tracking, where the cookies follow you around to other sites. These you have to wait for permission from the user before you can add the cookie.</li>
</ol>
<p>So when a cookie banner pops up, they could already be using the first two but not the third. However, some sites implement it badly and do this incorrectly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
