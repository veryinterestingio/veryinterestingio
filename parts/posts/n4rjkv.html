<p>The water is resting on the front surface of the glass. The reflection (the actual mirror surface) is on the back surface. The &quot;gap&quot; is the thickness of the glass in between.</p>
<p>A mirror that's silvered on the front surface, like a big telescope mirror, won't do this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most mirrors are designed to have a reflective surface on the back side of glass. This helps protect that reflective surface so it doesn't chip and break apart. So when an object is on the surface of the glass, it's actually a few millimeters or so away from the reflective backing. Therefore you see the stain on the surface of the glass <em>and</em> in the reflection of the reflective back surface.  </p>
<p>If you had a mirror that had the reflective surface at the front, you wouldn't see this &quot;double image&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
