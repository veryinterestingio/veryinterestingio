		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Asphalt (bitumen) is actually the black gooey substance within asphalt concrete roads. The other component in asphalt concrete is aggregate which consists of small smashed up rocks.</p>
<p>When first paved, the asphalt concrete retains its black color from the asphalt. However, asphalt is softer than rock so it wears off the surface faster, exposing the harder gray aggregate. This turns the road from black to gray over time. Furthermore, weathering and exposure to the sun will also lighten the asphalt with time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh here we go this is my jam, I'm a civil engineer technologist who designs asphalt.</p>
<p>So as somebody else said asphalt cement is oil, I live in Canada and that oil sands in Northern Alberta is a very good source of asphalt oil. To make asphalt concrete you mix together aggregate(rock), manufactured fines or MF(finely crushed rock), a blending sand which is just sand, and asphalt cement. This mixture together is asphalt concrete which is usually done through either a Marshall Mix Design or SuperPave Design (SUerior PERforming asphalt PAVEment). Basically you're designing to have the right amount of air in the mix and these two design methods both do that, SuperPave is probably more similar to real world applications but marshall designs are the most common, at least where I am.</p>
<p>So to get to why the road turns grey, it is constantly under stress and strains that are weathering the surface. If you think of the forces being applied to road there's the weight of the vehicle pushing down, the acceleration moving it forward and the normal force pushing up on the road. Every time a vehicle moves over the road it's helping degrade some of the aggregate and stripping some of the oil from the rocks on the surface on a very tiny scale. Combined with weather like freeze and thawing or rain over time this changes how to road looks and performs, think of ruts that appear from cars constantly driving in the same spot.</p>
<p>Another thing we do to make design is reuse old roads that are milled up, this is called RAP(recycled asphalt product). The rap is always a lot more finely graded material due to the weathering of the aggregates from being driven over. It also has a lower oil content than what it would have been originally paved at.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;black&quot; is a bituminous coating, which wears off due to trafficking, weather and oxidisation.</p>
<p>This is part of the design life of the road surface, as this wearing action exposes the rough surface of the aggregate (crushed rock), and as such provides skid resistance (stopping power) to the tyres.</p>
<p>The exposed aggregate maybe grey, or red, depending on which quarry the stone comes from.</p>
<p>If you are interested further, bitumen can be distilled from crude oil but more interestingly also occurs naturally, in lakes...</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also skid marks and acceleration marks (burn outs) are from the tire heating the tar in the asphalt and pulling it to the surface and not from the tire rubber.  Which is why tire marks are rarely seen or extremely faint on Portland cement concrete.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
