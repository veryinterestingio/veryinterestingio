		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cost: plastic is extremely cheap to produce (also to recycle), currently nothing as cheap exists so companies will keep using what makes them the most money. </p>
<p>Properties: there actually aren't many materials with similar properties: </p>
<ul>
<li>recycled/compostable plastics aren't as maleable and mess up the recycling of normal plastics. </li>
<li>paper, well just see the outrage of paper straws </li>
<li>metal costs too much and is heavy </li>
<li>the cutting edge &quot;plastic killers&quot; don't currently work on large scale due to lack of technology/knowledge in how to scale (eg. Nanostructures)</li>
</ul>
<p>In actuality plastics are probably the most important, useful and revolutionary material technology in history. It would also be the most environmentally friendly material if we would be able to close the loop and recycle most of it. Problems only arise when it ends up in nature, which I personally believe to just be due to severe incompetence on parts of government, companies and to some extent people.</p>
<p>AFAIK &quot;fact&quot; to take forward: Producing paper straws rather than plastic ones is often a net loss in terms of GHG emissions, habitat loss and chemical intensity. </p>
<p>Use this to always think about the whole life-cycle of products and on the many different ways the environment can be hurt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plastics are incredible. There isn't one single material capable of having the wide range of material properties plastics can have. They can be cheap, durable, lend themselves well to manufacturing methods such as blow moulding, rotation moulding, injection moulding etc. In the case of thermoplastic elastomers they can be reused (in some capacity anyway). There are food grade plastics, plastics capable of withstanding pretty impressive temperatures (the inner side of many cooking pans are coated with a thin layer of PTFE, better known as Teflon, for non-sticking purposes). They have favourable mechanical properties in that some can act as living hinges in many products (think the lid of a tictac box), meaning no bearings and with that no additional manufacturing processes are required. Sure there are materials with similar properties to <em>some</em> plastic types but you'll be hard pressed to find one which can mimic most let alone all plastic types.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Plastics&quot; is not a single thing, it is a group of things defined by properties. Specifically the ability to be easily molded into various shapes while being durable.</p>
<p>If you find something that has the properties of plastic, it's plastic. </p>
<p>Fwiw, we already do have plastics that will biodegrade. Made from corn. Not economically practical and cannot replace everything we use plastic for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two parts to this question: first plastics are largely defined by their properties and composition. If something had all the same propertied then it likely is another plastic.</p>
<p>Secondly for different individual properties (malleable, non biodegradable, non reactive to most things, etc.) there are plenty of alternatives.</p>
<p>None are as cheap.</p>
<p>There are also minor issues like paper products breakdown faster, metal things are heavier, etc. that add up to issues over time but the big simple one is that plastic is very very cheap. Its a considerable investment in both short and long term to switch to something else (certainly one worth making but people donâ€™t like to spend money).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not (in a lot of instances). The plastic revolution happened not because of new things that could be done with plastics, but because plastic could replicate the properties of existing materials at a fraction of the cost. Because that continues to be the case (plastic is much cheaper to create than ivory, glass, stone, metal, etc.) nobody has a commercial incentive to go back to the alternatives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
