<p>Imagine a rabbit getting hunted who would stop mid-chase to eat: his genes would not go very far.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Being scared is basically your brain thinking that a thing might hurt you. You don't want to get hurt, so your brain is reminding you &quot;Hey, this might hurt you, try not to let this hurt you.&quot; If you forgot about the thing, you'd be more likely to get hurt by it.</p>
<p>This applies in terms of evolution too; everyone who didn't obsess over what they were scared of got eaten by it. Your many times great grandparents lived because they were aware of what might kill them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ol>
<li>
<p>Better safe than sorry — running away when you think it’s dangerous means you survive. Giving priority to the scary stuff (say a tiger) over thinking about the beautiful trees, butterflies, and sunrise increases your chances of surviving </p>
</li>
<li>Genes — Those who don’t give much thought  to the scary stuff or pay more attention to trees, butterflies, sun, etc rather than the tiger don’t tend to survive.
So they don’t pass their genes on — or rather we have the genes of those who think more about the scary things</li>
