		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m not sure on the android side of things, but iPhones have a coprocessor (dubbed M9, M10, M11, and M12) that handle this task <em>specifically</em>, which allows for lower drain. It’s basically a chip with one or two tasks.</p>
<p>Here’s a good article that describes it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do not feed any neural network in order to listen for those cues, is the answer. The personal assistants, phones, etc. with “wake words“ have small dedicated processors that are only capable of listening for very specific combinations of syllables. Usually the word, like “Alexa,“ is a word with very different and distinct syllables that do not typically appear in that order elsewhere in the language, meaning the chip has an easier time of it than normal speech processing software. It would be too computationally expensive for these processors to run actual software, so the wake words are usually hardcoded in hardware or very low level firmware, which is why they cannot be configured to wake on any word the user wants.</p>
<p>As an industry, we still don’t really have the capability of listening to and interpreting speech context well on a small device, without uploading it to the cloud for processing. But if we were uploading everything the mic heard, not only would it be incredibly obvious and impossible to hide from any user network or router software, but we would also blow through your data caps in a matter of days and the secret would immediately be out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the same reason why you can hear someone say your name in a crowd. It's easier to listen for one word than to every word. </p>
<p>There's a part of your brain that's always listening for your name, even when you're not paying attention to a conversation. Similarly, devices have a part of their &quot;brain&quot; (processor) that's listening for their &quot;name&quot; (wake word). That's why each device can only have one or two wake words: they're built into the machine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a much bigger task, computationally, to understand speech rather than to detect a specific word or phrase.  On all of these devices, a small, low power processor is all that is needed to detect the keyword/phrase to start streaming audio to the servers that actually do the computations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in MEMS microphones. In more advanced designs the ASIC chip in the microphone will hold the operating voltage at a “low power mode” until the vocal command is heard and then it will switch the device to a “high power mode”. This usually means better SNR and a wider bandwidth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
