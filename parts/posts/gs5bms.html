		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An example is probably the easiest to show this with.</p>
<p>The Collatz conjecture is a really simple to understand unproven problem, it goes like this.</p>
<p>Take any number.</p>
<p>If it is even, divide it by 2. </p>
<p>If it is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. </p>
<p>If you keep repeating this process starting out with any number, do you eventually reach 1?</p>
<p>Lets try with the number 7.</p>
<p>7 -&gt; 22 -&gt; 11 -&gt; 34 -&gt; 17 -&gt; 52 -&gt; 26 -&gt; 13 -&gt; 40 -&gt; 20 -&gt; 10 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 16 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1</p>
<p>So, 7 does get to 1. </p>
<p>It is currently unproven that all numbers behave this way, that is if you repeat this, we don't know if it always goes to 1, it could just blow up to a huge number. For all the numbers we have tried it goes to 1.</p>
<p>Mathematicians try to prove problems like these, use logic to see if they can somehow make a statement that is true for all numbers.</p>
<p>Or alternatively, disprove it. Disproving this just involves finding a number that doesn't go to 1, and goes somewhere else.</p>
<p>This problem was posed in 1937. The best minds have worked on it since, no one has been able to figure it out.</p>
<p>This problem is just a bit of a fun trick brain teaser but there are many that are very useful if proven. For instance the Riemann hypothesis is a bit of a complicated unsolved problem but if solved, the implications are huge for the field of math. Some have very useful real world applications, like the recently solved sphere packing problem.</p>
<p>A common misconception is that math has to do with numbers. Math goes well beyond numbers in many cases, math is just the study of proving statements to be true or false with a set of rules. Games like chess for instance has an entire branch of math devoted to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the Futurama episode &quot;Prisoner of Benda&quot; The Professor creates a mind switching device that lets any two people switch minds (or bodies depending on your perspective) with each other. But The Professor forgot to account for the cerebral immune response, which means once two people have switched, they can never switch back. Cue hilarity and various hijinx and everyone is eventually in different bodies. The writers of the episode (whom have PHDs in mathematics) had to actually figure out if it was mathematically possible to get the crazy cast of characters back into their normal bodies by the end of the episode. They worked out a theory and provided a proof for it which can be seen briefly at the end of the episode delivered by the razzle dazz of The Globetrotters. In real life, they created an unsolved mathematical problem, solved it, wrapped it up nicely in an entertaining episode, and delivered it to us; their many fans. I believe that episode won some kind of an award as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why are there unsolved math problems? Because we don't know things. Let's look at examples without numbers.</p>
<p>In the 16th century, Sir Walter Raleigh wanted to know what the best way to pack cannonballs is. A very practical problem back in the day. It might not look it, but it's a math problem.</p>
<p>How do you solve them?</p>
<p>A recent example is with floor tiling with pentagons. We know that some pentagons can tile a floor (meaning no overlaps or gaps), but some can't. But how many pentagons can do that, and what do they look like? The answer was found in 2017. Here's a really nice news article about it:  <a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/math/pentagonal-tile-mathematics-29092017/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/math/pentagonal-tile-mathematics-29092017/" target="_blank">https://www.zmescience.com/science/math/pentagonal-tile-mathematics-29092017/</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am an undergraduate mathematician pursuing degrees in both mathematics and physics.</p>
<p>Mathematics, broadly, is the study of patterns, quantities, structure, space, and change.</p>
<p>Now, the calculus sequence and below generally represents mathematics to the general population. Even when we provide examples of how mathematics helps our world, we usually need go no further than a very basic example using differentiation or integration. However, for mathematicians, this is mathematics in its most elementary and, often, most uninteresting form.</p>
<p>When you say <em>math problem</em> you, like most of the world, probably think of questions like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the value of x given x + 4 = -3 - x</li>
<li>What is the maximum of the given function: f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3</li>
<li>What is the derivative of f(x) = (3x)/(x^2 )?</li>
</ul>
<p>Or something along those lines. Mathematicians are rarely involved in solving these sorts of problems - relying instead on undergraduates and/or computers to check mundane work of this sort when necessary. Actually - a funny anecdote I enjoy sharing at this sort of opportunity - when I was studying calculus I, I needed someone to check a solution I had arrived at for a simple derivative. I asked a professor in our mathematics department and he admitted to me that he no longer remembered how to perform such a function! To be fair, it only took him about a minute of staring at it to recall the algorithm and proceed to the correct answer.</p>
<p>So, then, what <em>do</em> mathematicians do all day? Well, we do math problems! But, you see, the math problems we work on do not necessarily have an algorithm we can we rely on to solve and they tend to be considerably more involved.</p>
<p>Consider that I ask you to solve 276 / 3. First you might begin drawing a little shelf with a support on the left side. The 3 goes on the outside to the left of the support and the 276 goes under the shelf to the right of the support. You then proceed to ask &quot;What number can I multiply by 3 to get 2?&quot; and finding that there is not one, you move onto the next digit and ask &quot;What number can I multiply by 3 to get 27?&quot; and, finding one, you place it above the seven and then write &quot;27&quot; under the 276 and subtract, then drop down the 6 to repeat this: &quot;What number can I multiply 3 by to get 6?&quot; and you arrive at 2 and place that behind the 9 on top of the shelf and then write 6 under the remaining six and subtract again to find no remainder. That is the division algorithm.</p>
<p>But what about a problem that can't be solved that way? Let us look at a common question for students entering a logic and proofs course.</p>
<p>Consider: &quot;Is the square root of 2 irrational?&quot;</p>
<p>Well now. This is actually quite a thinker. For someone who has only been through the calculus sequence and has only a rude and informal introduction to proofs, this seems like it might be impossible to answer. To a mathematician it is really quite simple, but it requires logic.</p>
<p>The definition of a rational number is that it can be expressed as a ratio of two integers of the form p/q. The number 1/2 is a rational number. The number 3 is also rational because we can express it as 3/1. The number -25/4 is rational because the integers include the negative numbers.</p>
<p>So is sqrt(2) rational? Well, let us consider that it is. It then makes sense that I can express it in the following way:</p>
<p>sqrt(2) = p/q</p>
<p>And we can then assume that p and q have no common factors (like 3/3) because we would just cancel them out (3/3 = 1). The expression p/q is understood to be in simplest form.</p>
<p>If we square both sides, we can eliminate the square root because they are inverse functions and inverse functions cancel each other out.</p>
<p>[sqrt(2)]^2 = p^2 / q^2</p>
<p>2 = p^2 / q^2</p>
<p>Now we can multiply both sides by q^2 to get closer to the value of p, a value which will reveal how we can make sqrt(2) rational.</p>
<p>2q^2 = p^2</p>
<p>But wait! Do you see it? There's a logical inconsistency (which we call a fallacy) here! This statement implies that p^2 is even because it is equal to an expression that is being multiplied by 2 and we know that when we multiply anything by two we make it even (the proof of this is elementary and is left as an exercise to the reader). The only way that p^2 can be even is if p itself is even; multiplying an odd number by an odd number gives you an odd number.</p>
<p>2q^2 = p^2</p>
<p>Let p = 2a so</p>
<p>2q^2 = (2a)^2</p>
<p>2q^2 = 4a^2</p>
<p>q^2 = 2a^2</p>
<p>This implies q is even as well! But both p and q cannot be even, because earlier we assumed that any common factors were removed from p/q and even numbers always have at least one common factor: 2. This means the original assumption - that the square root of 2 is rational - is invalid and, thus, that the square root of 2 is irrational.</p>
<p>However, mathematicians do more than concern themselves with the solving of problems. They also work as computer programmers, teaching computer to understand and process mathematics the same way we do. In fact, computers present a challenging problem for mathematicians because they can solve problems we cannot. Though, initially, it seems like that might put us out of a job, it actually creates an interesting new employment opportunity: verification. Many mathematicians are also employed in verifying the results machines compute.</p>
<p>But if mathematicians cannot solve a problem a computer can, how do they verify that the solution is correct? This has opened up an entirely new field of mathematics in which proofs are creatively employed to work around our limitations to certify that, even if the solution is unverifiable, it is at least &quot;safe&quot;.</p>
<p>Mathematicians go off into other areas as well, such as actuarial science (a mathematician was involved in calculating your insurance rates), grocery store logistics (mathematicians helped determine how to keep your local shelves stocked with food you like, though people are constantly emptying them), traffic (a mathematician helped civil engineers determine the fastest way to get you home), and many others besides.</p>
<p>Mathematics is a broad study, as I hinted at above. However, the more we work at it the more we realize that we're not making it smaller, we're making it bigger. In other words, there is not a finite number of problems in the universe - or, if there are finite - there are significantly more than we anticipated.</p>
<p>We proved that the square root of 2 is irrational, but does that mean there are other irrational numbers? How do we find them? How do they behave differently than rational numbers, which seem so much more natural?</p>
<p>Mathematics is always like this: as soon as we solve a problem we realize that there are many, many more that suddenly arose from that problem. The calculus was invented to solve a problem, but ended up opening many more pathways of exploration that led to many, many more problems. For example, every continuous function has a derivative (<strong>except for the infinite amount of Weierstrass functions</strong>, thanks u/eric_he). However, the inverse function of differentiation, integration, does not behave the same way. Not every function has an integral and of the world of integrals that exist, only an incredibly small number are discoverable without the assistance of a computer. Why is that?</p>
<p>As long as there have been humans there have been mathematicians. One could make the argument that it is our species' first field of study and one could argue that it will be the last thing our species is curious about when the lights finally go out.</p>
<p>Edit: Fixed the line: &quot;every continuous function has a derivative&quot;. In an attempt to keep this as ELI5 as possible I spoke too generally and u/eric_he - correctly - pointed out a counter example of this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A &quot;math problem&quot; isn't just a bunch of numbers with operation between them and finding what the result is (2+2, 3-1, 4x6+2 etc). Those seems weird that there is &quot;unsolved&quot; one, we know how number work, it just a matter of &quot;doing the math&quot;. </p>
<p>But a math problem can be a logical statement too like &quot;is there a  number with more than 2 digit where if you multiply all its digit give itself&quot;. For example 55 is 5*5=25 so no. But you can't try every number to check, as there is an infinity of it. So mathematician will try to express that in different term, find another way to write the problem and either  show its impossible (the case in our example) or find an example where it work proving it.</p>
<p>And that's what an &quot;unsolved math problem&quot; is : mathematician still haven't found the right way to rewrite the question so they can prove it work for all case or not for one case.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
