		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, it evolved as a signal to other animals that something that we initially believed was dangerous is, in fact, harmless. As the brain got more social, laughter got more abstract, so we laugh when something defies expectation, much as a thing that was thought to be dangerous but is actually harmless defies our expectation. Have you noticed that all jokes kind of work the same way? You establish an expectation with a setup, then subvert that expectation with the punchline. This idea is also supported by the fact that people laugh with relief after a tense situation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you're hearing or seeing something, your brain is carefully trying to predict what's going to come next. Doing that builds a long chain of connections of what your brain thinks should happen next, and builds up a lot of anticipation &quot;energy&quot; . This happens in the &quot;setup&quot; of a joke, you're told info that makes sense and your brain anticipates what is going to happen next. When the opposite happens in the punchline, your brain wasn't really expecting that to happen and all of that energy in the chain has to go somewhere, so it's dumped into your system and results in a burst of energy that your brain/body turns into a laugh.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humor is &quot;disarmed&quot; danger.</p>
<p>It allows us to play. How do you know if the friend who just pushed you is not trying to kill you? Well, he's laughing.</p>
<p>Laugh is important because it's involuntary (very hard to fake it) and it causes spasms of the core muscles. Those muscles are crucial for body stability and make it impossible to exert any meaningful force. Meaning the person disarms themselves when laughing.</p>
<p>Smile, similarly, is a huge vulnerability for our defenses. Even a light punch on the jaw is enough to incapacitate a person. That's why a &quot;fighting face&quot; is all muscles tight, teeth clenched and protecting the vulnerable parts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
