		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Typically Because it activates fewer muscles.</p>
<p>Sitting on a “comfortable” position is comfy because you don’t have to use your muscles to hold yourself up.</p>
<p>While sitting with proper posture, you have to activate a lot more muscles in your back.</p>
<p>This means that sitting with bad posture is easier, because you don’t have to use as many muscles, but then when you go to use those muscles or have to use them, they’re weaker, and therefore get more sore/strained.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something I have not seen mentioned yet. &quot;Bad&quot; posture isn't actually associated with pain. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31773477/" target="_blank">Several</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002192901930524X" target="_blank">systematic reviews</a> and other <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26752695/" target="_blank">research studies</a> have refuted this, and it's sort of a lazy catch-all for rehab professionals to give someone a problem that needs to be fixed, when there might not be anything wrong with that person's posture. Ironically, this language of fear-mongering patients into believing there is a bio-anatomical explanation for their symptoms likely contributes heavily to fear avoidance behaviours which can actually make their pain worse. The biopsychosocial model of pain science explores this topic and is a fascinating rabbit hole to go down. Lorimer Moseley has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nifGFIuVkUk" target="_blank">few</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjes9CuN6Ko" target="_blank">fantastic</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCF1_Fs00nM" target="_blank">videos</a> that go into detail about this topic.</p>
<p>The top answer mentioning activating fewer muscles is fairly accurate, it does expend less energy to be sitting/resting in comfortable positions. That does not mean these positions are inherently bad for our spine. That being said, can certain postures irritate pain receptors for certain people? Of course. But everyone is unique and has a different pain experience so just saying that someone who has &quot;bad posture&quot; will one day experience tremendous pain as a result of that posture is wildly oversimplistic. We're trying to move away from telling people &quot;you have bad posture, sit up straight&quot; to &quot;your next posture is your best posture&quot; to encourage people to move more, which has way better health benefits than remaining sedentary but merely sitting up straighter.</p>
<p>Source: see above links. I am also a physiotherapist who spends a large portion of his day trying to unwind people from some of the damaging language they've been told about their posture.</p>
<p>ELI5 Version:</p>
<p>If you have playdough, you can build a little person out of your playdough. Now if you were to bend the playdough person forward and keep him there for a few minutes, you would be able to easily pull the playdough person out of that position with no problem. But if you leave your playdough person in the same position overnight (whether they  are held in a straight posture or that bent forward posture), when you go to play with them the next morning they will be pretty stiff and hard to move out of that position. If you want your playdough person to be &quot;healthy&quot; and mobile you should try to keep them moving lots and not hang out in any one position for hours on end, no matter how &quot;good&quot; that position looks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
