<p>Edit 2: I'm not buying the whole &quot;the gap is there so your junk doesn't touch the seat&quot; explanation. I have a large endowment downstairs, and it's not a problem for me really.
Looks more like saving money on material is the more reasonable answer.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's actually a materials science thing.</p>
<p>See, circular-shaped objects have rigidity based on their form. This means they resist deformation when force is applied (your ass sitting on toilet seat). This can be a good thing: Toilet seat feels structurally sound when sitting on it. </p>
<p>The problem is that the rigidity is not infinite. There is a snap point, and since the form is not able to bend, when the snap point is hit, it usually fails <em>VERY BADLY</em>. In our case, this often means replacing the toilet seat ($$$).</p>
<p>By taking a very small wedge out of an otherwise full circle, it changes the whole dynamic of the form. All of a sudden we have a U shape instead of an O. Now, both &quot;legs&quot; of the U are able to (mostly) independently move. This raises the &quot;snap point&quot; as the materials are now able to bend effectively and more thoroughly distribute load.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the shape choice of a toilet seat is about it's reliability. In normal usage, U shaped seats are <strong>MUCH</strong> less likely to break over the long term than O shaped seats.</p>
<p>And at the end of the week, reliability is really about money. How long will thing X last given normal use conditions? When will I have to replace it? What are the costs associated with wear and tear? This makes sense in the context of businesses/governments (who usually own the public toilets in question here).</p>
<p>The reason that they are different at home is because at home you also (usually) have aesthetic requirements that automatically trump any cost related requirements. This is due to a combination of (a) people liking to surround themselves with things that are pretty, and (b) home toilet seats get very light use compared to public toilet seats and therefore are (by default) much less likely to fail at any given point in time.</p>
<p>Note: Engineer here. <em>NOT</em> a materials science engineer though, so terminology is likely off, but concepts should be valid for the most part.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Taken from Wikipedia :</p>
<p>The International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials' Uniform Plumbing Code, section 409.2.2, requires that &quot;all water closet seats, except those within dwelling units or for private use, shall be of the open front type&quot;. There is an exception for toilets with an automatic toilet-seat cover dispenser. The code has no legal force, but because it is followed by many public authorities, many public toilets feature open front toilet seats (also called &quot;split seats&quot;).[4]</p>
<p>The purpose for this seat design is to allow women to wipe the perineal area after using the toilet without contacting the seat. It also omits an area of the seat that could be contaminated with urine, and avoids contact between the seat and the user's genitals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I always figured it was because a certain percentage of guys would not bother to lift the seat, so there is a gap where they can go without hitting it, while standing. And the same seat was used for women, just for standardization. Builders were not going to mess with two different seats.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
