		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One element which hasn't been addressed is the fact that, in essence, humans have &quot;traded&quot; muscularity for fine motor control; instead of being built like a gorilla, humans have an exceptionally refined control over their bodies.</p>
<p>While some animals are dexterous, humans are unparalleled for their skill in manipulating themselves and especially tools.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even if a human eats an <em>all-meat</em> diet, we will still not develop huge muscles like gorillas. We humans can <em>only</em> develop big muscles with a diet that is conducive to muscle building, <strong>and work out</strong>, whereas gorillas build muscle without having to exercise.</p>
<p>Even sedentary gorillas are 5+ times stronger than Olympic-level human weightlifters! This is not from our different diets or digestive enzymes. There’s no diet, workout plan, and/or PED regimen a human can follow that will make any of us even a third as strong as an average female gorilla.</p>
<p>The reason gorillas grow huge muscles without working out is primarily due to their lower levels of myostatin inhibition. Myostatin is a hormone that downregulates muscle hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Whether you’re building muscle, maintaining it, or losing it, your body is constantly building and destroying muscle. Humans produce much more myostatin compared to gorillas, and this severely limits our muscle growth. It makes it so that - unlike many other animals - we have to use our muscles heavily to build them up. Whereas a gorilla becomes ridiculously strong (by human standards) without exercising.</p>
<p>The reason humans evolved in this way may have to do with starvation. Being able to reduce your muscle mass when it’s not needed reduces your overall calorie usage, and helps you to avoid starvation. (In the modern era, it makes us tend to get fat.)</p>
<p>Gorillas, on the other hand, evolved in settings with more plentiful food, so starvation was less of a threat. Accordingly, there was no evolutionary pressure for them not to become hulking muscle monsters, so they evolved to have less myostatin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is it has more to do with genetics and less to do with diet.</p>
<p>Humans have myostatin which limits muscle growth, and I believe gorillas don't have functioning myostatin. If you genetically engineer an animal without myostatin, <a href="https://www.popsci.com/muscular-animals-babies-myostatin/" target="_blank">you get crazy muscle development</a>.</p>
<p>So whether gorillas eat vegan or McDonald's, their muscular development is mostly because of genetic differences. If you inhibit myostatin in humans, you'd likely get the same result.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;I semi-frequently see people ask how bulls or gorillas can be so jacked while eating few (or no) protein-rich foods.</p>
<p>For bulls, they get their protein from the bacteria in one of their stomachs that ferment cellulose. They swallow grass, and the bacteria get to work on it and multiply, producing amino acids from the grass in the process. The bulls regurgitate the grass, bacteria, and amino acids, swallow the mixture into the stomach that connects to their digestive system, and digest some of the bacteria in the process – most of their protein comes either from the amino acids the bacteria make, or from directly digesting the bacteria that break down the cellulose.</p>
<p>For gorillas, it's primarily a matter of volume. They eat ~18kg (~40lbs) of food per day, so they can eat mostly protein-poor food and still wind up consuming a ton of protein. For example, if their diet consisted solely of fruit (which is incredibly protein-poor), they'd still be eating around 200g of protein per day. Add in some leaves, bugs, and some meat (all of which are more protein-rich than fruit) and a gorilla can easily consume more than 400g of protein per day.</p>
<p>And, of course, bull/gorilla physiology ≠ human physiology.</p>
<p>In other words, if you're not a ruminant, and you're not eating 40lbs of food per day, you probably shouldn't look to gorillas or bulls for dietary inspiration to get jacked.&quot;</p>

<p>TL;DR: Gorillas eat a ton.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
