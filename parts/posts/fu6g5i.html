		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Just for example HPV and Herpes strains can be carried and transmitted for many years while someone is showing no symptoms, and that’s just STIs. Nearly every virus has examples of carriers who don’t know they get it and may further transmit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not just viruses, but bacteria, too.  There is the legendary case of <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/620785/typhoid-mary-history" target="_blank">Typhoid Mary</a>, who was a household cook who was infected with the bacteria that causes typhoid fever but never showed any symptoms. She kept infecting the families she worked for and refused to acknowledge that she was making other people sick, since she herself felt fine. She wound up getting arrested and placed in quarantine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hundreds of viruses are inapparent infections! Most of them we don't even know about. How do you test for something you don't even know exists?</p>
<p>Others have well answered your quetion, so I'm going to talk about endegenous retroviruses. These are segments of retroviral genetic material which makes up around 5-10% of your entire genome. They serve regulatory purposes as a transposon, bits of mobile DNA which can be shuffled around.</p>
<p>They originated as retroviruses, but a mutation made the virus untransmissible and it stuck around, doing no harm. These retroviral segments can even be incorporated into the main genome, not as a transposon, for example many of the genes which help the development of a placenta are highly derived from retroviral origins.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The flu is a great example of this. Many people don’t get their flu shot because they ‘never get sick’, but it’s important to get it regardless to prevent yourself from asymptomatically transmitting it to others around you. ESPECIALLY if you visit/work with people who are at a higher risk!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

My dad had MRSA 13 times in one year, he’s immunocompromised, yet the rest of the family never had an issue with it. I’m pretty sure MRSA was all over our house and the rest of us since he got reinfected so many times.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
