		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is it's more tiring to play defense than it is to play offense (and this is probably largely true of most sports). The reasons behind that (i.e. the long answer) are that, as others have mentioned, the offense knows where the play is going and the defense doesn't. So take an outside receiver for instance. He's got the speed to beat a defender deep, so the defender has to be prepared for him to take off at full tilt down the sideline. But the receiver knows he's just doing a quick slant, so he doesn't have to exert himself as much as the CB does who needs to protect the deep ball, then react up to the slant very quickly, then initiate contact to make the tackle. Another thing is that essentially offenses play forward and defenses play backwards. What I mean by that is RBs and WRs are always going to be running forwards down the field while defenders are often backpedaling, or trying to rove from side to side. Again, not knowing where the play is going forces them to spend more energy getting from A to B that it does for the offense. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another point is pursuit. It is common practice for defenders to pursue the ball carrier regardless of where they are on the field. Why? Because you never know what will happen. Maybe they break your teammates tackles. Maybe they fumble. A defender must pursue the ball carrier at all costs, where as on offense, If you're the receiver on the right and you run a curl and the ball goes to the receiver on the left running a go route, your reason for catching up to the ball carrier is unnecessary in most cases.   </p>
<p>When I used to play, we had to do pursuit drills where we start on the right side of the field and a receiver on the left. You only passed the drill by sprinting to the receiver, who was running toward the other endzone, and crossing his face.   </p>
<p>But to summarize, I believe pursuit is the main reason for defenses getting tired. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what everyone has said, offensive skill position players (WR, RB and TE) substitute a lot more than most defensive players except for linemen. It’s not unusual for a WR to run a deep route and then come off for a breather, while the DB who covered him stays on the field. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like the defenders just have to be engaged at all times. Offence can walk back at times, they shouldn’t but they do. You can get away with more slacking on offence. Really if you think about subs, it’s rare a defender comes out they’re beasts we just expect more. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
