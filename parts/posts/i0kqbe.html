You do it because it's a indicator to the person listening that you're not done speaking, but trying to come up with the next words to speak. without the ums or uhs, there would just be silence and the listener would be confused thinking you were done talking in the middle of a sentence. It's a learned behavior, and is regionally specific to your native language. For example, in Japan they use the sounds &quot;etto&quot; and &quot;ano&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Think about it like this; what would it be like if, instead of saying ummm or uhhh, people just dropped silent when they had to think of what to say next? The listener wouldn't know that you stopped to think, they'd just know that you stopped talking mid-sentence. They might interject, but they'd definitely be confused. It'd break the flow of the conversation. They wouldn't be waiting to hear what you had to say next, they'd be wondering why you suddenly stopped talking. Or, more simply, they'd think you were done talking.</p>
<p>We don't really think about it, but silence carries a lot of meaning in conversation. Ummm and ehhh allows you to pause without sending the messages that silence carries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Google is actually using this to their advantage for their extremely realistic artificial voice software, the AI says “Uhhh...” when it has to load mid-sentence. It’s pretty neat</p>
