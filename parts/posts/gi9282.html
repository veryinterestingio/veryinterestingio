		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a planetary scientist at the SETI Institute and director of the NASA Haughton-Mars Project (HMP) at NASA Ames Research Center. I also co-founded and now chair the Mars Institute. I have an ME in geology and geophysics from the University of Paris, and a PhD in astronomy and space sciences from Cornell University. I was privileged to be Joe Veverka's last graduate student, and Carl Sagan's last T.A..</p>
<p>My research focuses on the history of water on Mars, ice and caves on the Moon and Mars, the origin of Mars' moons, and the future human exploration of the Moon and Mars. I do fieldwork at Moon and Mars analog sites, mostly on Devon Island in the Arctic where we go every summer for the HMP (<a href="https://www.marsinstitute.no/hmp" target="_blank">https://www.marsinstitute.no/hmp</a>), but also in Antarctica where I once wintered over for 402-days. I'm still thawing from that.</p>
<p>I also work on surface exploration systems for future Moon and Mars exploration: drones, hoppers, rovers, spacesuits, and habitats. I was lucky to serve as scientist-pilot for NASA's first field test of the LER (Lunar Exploration Rover) SPR (small pressurized rover) concept. I also led the Northwest Passage Drive Expedition, a record-setting vehicular traverse on sea-ice along the fabled Northwest Passage - now that was a bad idea - and the subject of the documentary film Passage To Mars (2016). I currently lead the HMP's Astronaut Smart Glove project and JPL's GlobeTrotter planetary hopper concept study.</p>
<p>I am also interested in SETI - the actual Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence. I've argued that there are likely very few advanced civilizations per galaxy, and we might be the only one in ours at this time. As you might imagine, it's not the most popular view at the SETI Institute.</p>
<p>In my free time, I enjoy being walked by my 1-year old Australian cattle dog, Apollo. I also love to fly and paint, although not at the same time. I am an FAA-certified helicopter commercial pilot and flight instructor, and an artist member of the IAAA (International Association of Astronomical Artists). I post some of my drawings and paintings on Instagram @spacetimeartist. I also wrote a children's book: Mission: Mars, published by Scholastic: <a href="https://shop.scholastic.com/parent-ecommerce/books/mission-mars-9780545565325.html" target="_blank">link</a></p>
<p>If you have nothing better to do, follow me on Facebook (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/PascalLeeOfficial/" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/PascalLeeOfficial/</a>) or Twitter @pascalleetweets. I do post some interesting stuff, I have to say.</p>
<p>AMA. Looking forward to chatting at 10am (PT, 1 PM ET, 17 UT).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a few questions:  </p>
<ol>
<li>is terraforming a realistical goal?</li>
<li>If yes what would be the main issue? The magnetic field?</li>
<li>how do you feel about the impact of economy and economical decisions on the progress of space research?</li>
<li>I've wondered (and written) on how to terraformâ€¦ i want to know: practically what would be the steps? (for me they were first robots and mines to terraform, then basic life, then complex life, then colonization)</li>
<li>If terraforming is not an option then the best thing to do is find already ready planets or adapt to what there is trough habitats?</li>
