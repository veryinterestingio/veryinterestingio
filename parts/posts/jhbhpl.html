		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because these figures aren't showing a few important things, so simply subtracting one from the other won't give you the right answer.</p>
<p>The budget of the movie was $200M. When that's listed, it usually does not include Prints and Advertising (essentially, marketing costs) . For a movie like Tenet, that's usually around 50% of the budget--so that's another $100M. So let's say the total costs of actually making and distributing the film are $300M.</p>
<p>Now, the box office was $300M. However, that's box office gross, the total amount of ticket sales. This does not include the theater or distributor's cut. In the US, you'll get about 50% of box office gross back. Internationally, it's more like 40%. So, from the box office, Tenet actually made back something like $120M to $150M.</p>
<p>Now we see: $150M of net revenue from the box office, less around $300M in costs will get you to -$150M.</p>
<p>That's not necessarily the end of the story. For blockbuster films, the theatrical window is usually only about 30% of its total revenue. The other 70% comes from selling to streaming services, airlines, rentals, digital sales, etc. So, Tenet still will see a decent stream of revenue over the next few years from these windows.</p>
<p>However, the Hollywood rule of thumb is, you want to at least make back the cost of your budget from the theatrical window. In this case, Tenet made $150M net from box office, and cost $200M to make (not including marketing). So, it's tracking behind where it should be for a major blockbuster film.</p>
<p>If you want to read more about this, data on hollywood, and the film business in general, I'm a big fan of this guy and his blog: <a href="https://stephenfollows.com/how-movies-make-money-hollywood-blockbusters/" target="_blank"><a href="https://stephenfollows.com/how-movies-make-money-hollywood-blockbusters/" target="_blank">https://stephenfollows.com/how-movies-make-money-hollywood-blockbusters/</a></a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The budget to make the movie is only one of the costs involved. You also have to consider the money spent on marketing and distribution. A studio will determine profit after deducting the costs of printing all those posters, paying someone to cut select scenes into a trailer, paying for that trailer to be played on TV, print ads in magazines or newspapers, etc. There's also distribution - the cost to get the film to the theaters to play. With digital players, that cost is reducing, but the media campaign to promote a movie can cost just as much, if not more, than making the movie itself and will continue to hit the bottom line long after the movie has left theaters.</p>
<p>The best example of this is a comment made by David Prowse. He's the guy that was inside the Darth Vader costume for the original Star Wars movies including Return of the Jedi. In 2009, he said that he gets occasional letters from the movie studio regretfully informing him that the movie had not yet made enough money to be profitable so there were no residuals to be paid (his share of the NET profit). At that point, Return of the Jedi had been out for 26 years and had made over $572 million globally on a production budget of just $32.5 million. Movie accounting is amazing stuff...</p>
<p>Edit: Well RIP my Inbox. Had to work so stepped away from Reddit a bit and now I'm so far behind that I can't reply to everyone. For those saying the budget includes marketing and distribution, I say &quot;sort of&quot;. Remember that the movie studio tells the public a &quot;budget&quot; number that they spent to make the movie. They're not telling us their full budget numbers. And, as others have pointed out, the &quot;revenue&quot; number we see in the media is gross ticket sales, not the movie studio cut. If you take everything into account, it's not hard to imagine a movie studio wanting ticket revenue to be 4x production costs before they might consider a movie a success.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Studios are part of public corporations, who set earning expectations each quarter.  Meeting or missing those earnings benchmarks has a direct impact on the price of their stock.  Those expectations are based on what they hope these movies make.  It is very possible a move “makes money” but is a disappointment.  Usually they aren’t called flops, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because theatres dont show films for free. They take about half of the ticket price, so if a film grossed 300m in ticket sales (which is how the industry reports) then the studio only saw about 150m come to them.<br />
Then the stated budgets are production budgets. The cost to make the film. Not the cost to market the film. A big budget film can spend as much on marketing as production. So a 200m production budget might get 100-200m marketing budget (obviously it varies a lot and usually isnt disclosed, but its a ballpark figure).</p>
<p>Then increasingly we see big names in a film (director, lead actor, exec producer etc) get a % of the GROSS revenue.</p>
<p>So a 200m film might actually cost them 300-400m once you factor in marketing. Then that 300m revenue gets cut to 150m because of theatres, and then might lose another 50m in contract incentives.</p>
<p>Tenet lost WB hundreds of millions (at least as it stands right now). In a normal world the film might have made double or even triple what it has made this year, which is what they would have expected when they agreed on budgets and contracts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what was said, you also have to consider opportunity costs.</p>
<p>Here's a hypothetical:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marvel could release a movie about Hawkeye and make 10 million dollars of profit.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>OR</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Marvel could release a new Avengers movie and make <em>two billion dollars profit</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Just because option one is technically profitable doesn't mean it's a box office success, since it's taking time and effort away from other projects that could have made a lot more profit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
