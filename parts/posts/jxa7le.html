		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Central banks, more or less, have control over how much money is in circulation and also have a fairly good idea of the amount of stuff produced and services provided. As such, modest inflation, and thus increasing prices, is a policy choice.</p>
<p>The reason why is that it incentivizes investment (why hold cash instead of spending it or lending it to someone with a productive use for it if it will decline in value over time?) and helps avoid deflation (decreasing prices), which creates a feedback look sapping investment and spending (why spend your money now when it will be worth more later?).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The price of everything doesn't really go up. The value of money goes down.
The value of money goes down because the government and banks create new money through loans and printing more money. The reason they do this is that if they did not, people would hold onto all their money waiting for the value to go up, instead of spending it. And if this happened then there would be no money available for anyone to spend.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Short-term to mid-term, in general: Because the total amount of available money keeps increasing. This is called inflation.  </p>
<p>Long-term, in general: Over time most goods and services become <em>more</em> affordable, as they can be manufactured more easily and cheaply.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A LITTLE bit of inflation is good for the economy, so central banks will work to maintain this (deflation is bad, and run-away inflation is bad).</p>
<p>However, another factor that drives up prices is ricing salaries - everything is priced in a bidding process, whether implicit, or explicit.  The more money's that out there, the more prices go up, since people have more money to &quot;bid&quot;.  It doesn't matter if that money is unevenly distributed, because no one cares about the people who can't afford to buy stuff, the process only considers the people who have the money to &quot;bid&quot; (you gotta pay to play).  So, as salaries go up, cost of living goes up.  And if you aren't one of the lucky ones whose salary didn't go up, you'll slowly fall into poverty, even though your salary didn't go down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every year, the amount of money in the world is going up. It goes up just a little bit faster than people are going up. So every year, we have a little too much money. When there's too much money, everything costs a little bit more.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I tried for a true ELI5 explanation here, and in doing so I trampled over some very important details.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
