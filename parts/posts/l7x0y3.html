		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Things like Badminton rackets, Tennis rackets, golf clubs, softball bats and hockey sticks. I know its light and all but what are the other reasons why is it used as a stick to hit objects? Can someone give me a detailed answer?</p>
<p>Edit: Is tensile strength an important factor to making these sticks if so why?</p>
<p>Edit: Since this post booming might I ask are there any other benefits to Carbon Fiber in sports equipment that most of us don't know? Explain why does the certain sport play or know is enhanced when you use carbon equipments. (What are some weird sports that have carbon fiber equipments and why) </p>
<p>Edit: I should make a video with all this information. Would benefit me if I could get some Carbon Fiber facts that are not found on google. Like other than the advantages of carbon fiber I'm pretty sure there are disadvantages carbon fiber in certain sports applications and applications in general we should know.</p>
<p>Edit: Why isn't Carbon fiber used in every sports? What are some sports that Carbon Fiber isn't suited for and why?</p>
<p>Edit: Would like to know more about stiffness and strength, corrosion resistance,  X-ray transparency, Low CTE (Coefficient of Thermal Expansion), Chemical resistivity, Thermal and electrical conductivity and its effects on the sports you play or know about.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Carbon fiber is light, but strong.  If your Hitting Thingy is heavy, then you'll get tired much more quickly from swinging it around.  If your Hitting Thingy is weak, then it'll break from you hitting things with it.  Carbon fiber solves both of those problems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Carbon Fiber also has some great energy transfer properties.  In the skating world, the amount of energy your foot can transfer to the ice greatly differs by the materials between your actual feet and the actual ice.  So using full one piece carbon skates (relatively new to hockey and figure skating, but been around for over 20 years in speed skating) has led to much higher levels of efficiency.  I can elaborate more on this if anyone is interested since this is my field of work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer your edit that you asked again multiple times in the replies, tensile strength is important in that you don't want your stick to break. Specifically, you don't want it to break when flexed, and more strength means more force can be applied before breaking.</p>
<p>It's not the tensile strength they're really after with the carbon fiber though, it's the stiffness. Stiffness in materials science refers to a material's resistance to bending. If I have to put a lot of force to get a little bending, my material is stiff. This is really important for stuff like golf clubs and hockey sticks, because if my stick is really stiff, a little bit of flex absorbs a lot of force. When the flex is released (ie: when the ball or puck is hit), that force is transferred to the object, making it fly faster and further.</p>
<p>You can see how important that bending is in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz_4i1e6ppM" target="_blank">videos like this</a>. Carbon fiber is among the stiffest materials in the world (along with being lightweight and strong).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One important aspect of carbon fiber (its actually colloqiual shorthand for something like &quot;carbon fiber reinforced polymer&quot;) I haven't seen mentioned yet is the fact that it is a composite material.</p>
<p>Composites can combine some of the properties of its constituents and can be tuned more than homogeneous materials. Carbon fibers are woven together in strands/sheets and encased in a polymer of some kind (epoxy etc). The fibers can provide rigidity in specific directions while the polymer keeps the fibers from buckling. Different weaves of fibers and polymers can be chosen, combined in different ratios, patterns, directions, shapes etc. etc. to create materials with a large range of properties. Parts of the overall product can be finely-tuned in this way: head of a raquet vs the handle, seatstays vs chainstays on a bicycle etc. All of this contributes to weight savings as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>dont discount that CF looks cool and has great public opinion.</p>
<p>Yes, it has plenty of positive physical properties, but in some cases, its used in all the wrong ways on cheap products just because its tantamount to painting a sports car red.</p>
<p>In some cases, its just a fake film applied over another cheaper material to look like Carbon fiber.</p>
<p>At this point, even if you had a superior material to use, you might forgo it because the market would likely not value it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
