		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A coma is a state of unconsciousness which someone can not be roused - this is what differentiates it from something like sleep for example. During sleep, we are unconscious, but with the right stimulus (shouting, poking etc) we will wake. </p>
<p>Coma is different and caused by loads of reasons:
Some are intentional - my job as an anaesthetist means I intentionally induce a coma using drugs. This means people are unconscious, cannot feel pain and crucially, cannot be woken until I decide they can  This is very useful for having an operation (!) but also what is typically referred to in the news as a ‘medically induced coma’ - we are anaesthetising a patient to allow recovery, usually in an intensive care environment. </p>
<p>People can be in a coma because of abnormal levels of toxins in the blood - byproducts such as urea (a product of normal physiology which increases if the kidneys don’t work), ammonia (again, normal in very low amounts but increased if the liver doesn’t work) or medications (intentional overdoses of medicine such as benzodiazepines or opioids). These people in comas may improve once the body clears the problem as they are reversible. The problem lies with the increased amounts of the drug or toxin affecting normal function of the brain. Most commonly this is alcohol. </p>
<p>More concerning are comas due to issues with the brain itself. This might be due to a bleed, such as seen in trauma, a stroke where the brain doesn’t get enough oxygen and dies and an increase in pressure inside the skull which reduces blood supply and means the brain doesn’t get enough oxygen. In these cases, coma may be irreversible unless the brain is delivered oxygen in minutes. This can be seen in people who have had a cardiac arrest - their brain has been starved of oxygen so it cannot function normally even if a heart beat returns, but the most basic functions of the brain still persist. The person is alive in the sense of having a heartbeat and breathing, but in a coma because the areas responsible for consciousness have been irreversibly damaged, and no stimulus will promote wakefulness. </p>
<p>Hopefully that helps! Often it’s not the body itself that decides when to ‘wake up’, more the resolution if possible of whatever is causing it in the first place, and hoping no long lasting damage occurred in the mean time</p>
<p>Edit - if people find this useful, I am happy to expand, but that probably takes it slightly out of the ELI5 zone!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Definition of coma is a “state of unconsciousness from which one cannot be roused”. </p>
<p>Compare this to sleep where you are unconscious, but a loud enough noise will wake you.</p>
<p>The coma resolves when the cause resolves. During an anaesthetic or while ventilated in ICU it is when the sedative drugs are stopped and wear off. In severe brain injury there needs to be restoration of blood flow to functioning brain cells. In an overdose or metabolic illness it’s when the drugs wear off or toxins are gone. There are many other examples but you get the gist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The vast majority of comas are medically induced. This means that the patient is given medications to keep them asleep (basically the same as keeping someone under anesthesia for surgery). This is done to protect the patient for various reasons like needing a ventilator to breath for them or to allow the body to heal. The rare instance of a coma that isn’t medically induced is the result of some kind of trauma to the brain. The kind that people wake up from are due to things like severe concussions or when brain swelling is involved. And even in those patients, they are still usually sedated by those same medications, it’s just that when they start to wean the medications off, the patient doesn’t become responsive. Many times, the comas that aren’t medically induced are patients with such severe brain damage that they are essentially dead but the life support machines are keeping the body alive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A coma is a deep state of unconsciousness where the body shuts down virtually all activity in an attempt to repair seriously damaged systems. Once the repair is complete or substantially completed the body can revive from a coma. <a href="https://youtu.be/S4GsqFOrYKc" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/S4GsqFOrYKc</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A group of nuclei in the brain called the reticular formation are responsible for maintaining consciousness. Another region is the frontal lobe, which is typically concerned with what makes you, you. A coma can be caused by many things, but often it results in the severing of the connection between these two important players.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
