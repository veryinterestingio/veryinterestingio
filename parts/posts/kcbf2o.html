<p>How do you do that at home and keep it from getting blurry? I mean, the earth (in this case the sky) moves, how do you keep that at a steade pace in the exact right angle over 10 hours so that the picture doesn't blur? I can easily see how a professional telescope can do this, but all the amateurs posting all the time?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A ten-hour single exposure is difficult, requiring good equipment and experience. These days you can “stack” a series of shorter exposures in software to reach the same total exposure time. This has the advantage of being able to throw away bad exposures so a single adverse event doesn’t ruin everything. The software can also align all the shots, effectively correcting for any long-term drift in the tracking system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Equatorial mounts and good counter weights</p>
<p>The most important thing for a non-blurry photo is a stable platform so they use heavy tripods with some added weight on them to keep things from wobbling in the breeze.  Even a tiny bit of wobble results in a lot of blur when you're looking at something far away</p>
<p>Next up is using an Equatorial mount rather than an Azimuthal mount.  Azimuthal mounts are the simplest to understand, its got two axis that can point the telescope up/down and left/right, unfortunately objects in the sky move in a curve so you need to carefully adjust both the X and Y at different rates throughout the night to stay on target.</p>
<p>Equatorial mounts are designed with this curved movement in mind.  You align it north/south and set one axis which defines how high above/below the equator what you're looking at is, and then the telescope rotates around a curve to line up with the object you want to see.  A single little motor scoots the telescope around this curve at a fixed rate(always the same!) keeping the object in the center of view.</p>
<p>A good quality camera with lenses can be hundreds of dollars, a good equatorial mount and a telescope is going to be around the same.  Its an expensive hobby, but not thousands of dollars required expensive</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Software. </p>
<p>You can use something like the free software &quot;SharpCap&quot; to take the long exposure (which is thousands of images taken at 30 images per second, which is saved in one big .avi file).</p>
<p>Then you use the free software &quot;autostakkert&quot; to stack the images so they're all aligned perfectly. This then finds the least blurry images out of the image set, and blends them to form one very-clear image. </p>
<p>Lastly you can do &quot;regiStax 6&quot; to do post adjustments. </p>
<p>It's all free and basically automated. Then you just hook a webcam up to your telescope, and away you go!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don't need a lot of fancy gear to do this.  A decent telescope starts around $150, and the motor drive is around $40 or so.  The only real challenge is getting your telescope mount properly aligned.  Once that is done all you need to do is line up what you want to take a picture of and turn on the motor drive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well mostly when picking a location and a time for astrophotography you need to consider how many clouds are there, how dark your surroundings are and how strong the wind is.
There’s no much of a “secret” here but set a manual focus and exposure to your liking with low ISO and relatively high shutter speed.
Other than that - nobody will post a bad photo on purpose, right? You can never know how many tries, locations and shots were before achieving the final cut.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
