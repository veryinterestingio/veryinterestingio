		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A condition called Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM).</p>
<p>Basically, your heart works and pumps blood powered by electrical signals running through the muscles in its walls in <strong>regular rhythms</strong>. This depends on healthy size of the heart. In HCM, the walls of the heart - particularly between chambers called 'ventricles' - thicken. This obstructs filling of the heart and can later cause other bad changes such as increasing pressure in the heart. </p>
<p>Many people with HCM live normally, but in rare cases, the thickening and damaging changes to the heart can result in sudden death because the heart is working too hard and the thickened muscle and changes disrupt the electrical signals. This causes a very dangerous rhythm called 'ventricular tachycardia' and loss of heart function.</p>
<p>Anytime you hear of a young athlete (think college or high school) dying during a game, HCM is a common cause. </p>
<p>As for what causes it, 50-60% of HCM patients have an inherited mutation in a heart structural protein, other causes include high blood pressure and simply unknown causes. </p>
<p>Young people (40s or younger) who get heart attacks also might have inherited disorders that cause very high cholesterol levels. They usually wont appear healthy though and have symptoms like yellow spots on their skin from cholesterol depositing there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human: I am very sorry for you loss. This question will not help with closure, but you are right to still ask.</p>
<p>ELI5: there are people who have a chance of developing blocked blood flow at a young age, even if they look healthy. That blocked flow hurts the heart and can cause the heart to stop.</p>
<p>Upper-level: there is a genetic diseased called Familial Hypercholesterolemia, which results in significantly higher cholesterol levels in the blood. Most 25y/o do not get a full lipid panel done, particularly one that looks at several key markers, such as APO-b, APO-a, specific cholesterol, and density specific markers in LDL, VLDL, IDL, and HDL. The result is that you can have a young guy come in, look overall healthy, have slightly elevated triglycerides with elevated total cholesterol, and that can be chalked up to diet. The crucial part here is 'why so young?' Cholesterol needs to go somewhere, so it's repacked into lipoproteins, such as LDL (low density lipoprotein) and HDL (high density lipoprotein). Often called 'bad' and 'good' respectively, but that's completely wrong, so do away with that thinking. These lipoproteins, specifically LDL, can carry a protein on it called APO-a. That protein, if it gets caught in the endothelial wall (the lining of blood vessels), it will cause an massive inflammatory response, potentially bringing about a plaque formation. For people with FH, this happens very early in life, possibly as early as 12 months old. While a small plaque isn't a threat, it is the foundation for further development of a larger and worse situation. People with low APO-b have a difficult time removing plaques*, which isn't uncommon in people with FH.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this likely started when he was very young. It does for all of us. No one could have known because we aren't to a place where looking is yet common.</p>
<p>*Lipidology is extremely complex. Thomas Dayspring, MD, is the leader in the field. He and Peter Attia did a 5+ hour podcast on it. It's rough. I likely got a point or two wrong. <a href="https://peterattiamd.com/tomdayspring1/" target="_blank">Here's a link to the show notes.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
