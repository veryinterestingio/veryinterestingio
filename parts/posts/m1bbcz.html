		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Materials absorb light by quantum interaction between the photons (light) and the electrons in the material. If the wavelength of light matches up to an electron properly, the electron can absorb the photon and jump up to a higher energy level. Materials have many electrons in many different configurations with many different energy levels so they can absorb a wide range of possible wavelengths. </p>
<p>It's not just the interaction of the electron with it's atom, it's also the electron bonds between atoms...that's why different chemical compounds can have different colours even if they involve the same atoms.</p>
<p>There's a limit to light absorption in the sense that the energy has to go somewhere, and it's typically going to show up as heat in the material. Eventually you get hot enough to cause the molecules to break down or change state (solid to liquid to gas to plasma)...either will change the electron configuration and energy and the absorption will change.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a very crude sense: Imagine material, as a room of well behaved five years old kids, with kids being the electron, and each of these kids likes a different chocolate. Now suppose that you, a beam of light, carrying a basket full of different chocolates i.e. different wavelengths, enters the room. Now, the kids will take whichever chocolate they like (wavelengths absorbed) and you will come out of the room with fewer chocolates (wavelengths reflected).
Now, those kids are having a sugar rush and have gone from well behaved to jumping up and down in the room i.e. material has absorbed energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, if there are electrons in a material that are at a certain energy level, and a photon of light comes by that is at the right frequency and energy level, it can hit the electron, be absorbed by it, and make the electron go up to a higher energy level. That electron wants to go back to its lower energy level, so it emits a photon of the right frequency and energy equal to what the electron needs to get rid of to go back down. That light is what you see as the color of an object.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
