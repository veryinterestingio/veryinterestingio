		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Reddit! Let me introduce myself. I'm a chemistry professor, science entertainer, and author that uses a theatrical and hands-on approach to teaching, all while trying to inspire students across the world to fall in love with science. You may have seen me in a blue lab coat and red-bottomed heels on <em>The Today Show</em>, <em>The Kelly Clarkson Show</em>, <em>NBC Nightly News</em>, the <em>Wendy Williams Show</em>, the <em>Rachael Ray Show</em>, or <em>Late Night with Stephen Colbert</em>, where I try to make each explosion bigger than the last one. I travel the country collecting science advocates to be part of my STEM army, and we're working together to break down the image of the stereotypical scientist. Here's where 70 female scientists broke the record for the most thunderclouds at one time: <a href="https://thedailytexan.com/2020/02/10/kate-the-chemist-cbs-mission-unstoppable-show-taping/" target="_blank">https://thedailytexan.com/2020/02/10/kate-the-chemist-cbs-mission-unstoppable-show-taping/</a>.</p>
<p>I've published seven children's books, including the bestseller <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kate-Chemist-Big-Book-Experiments/dp/059311616X" target="_blank">The Big Book of Experiments</a>, and I cannot wait to hit the road next week to promote my new book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Its-Elemental-Hidden-Chemistry-Everything/dp/0778389421" target="_blank">It's Elemental: The Hidden Chemistry in Everything</a>. In the book, I highlight the ways we experience chemistry in our everyday lives; starting with breakfast and an early morning workout, to going to the beach and then happy hour, and finally ending the day by analyzing the science in the bedroom. It's my first nonfiction book for adults, and I'm so excited to share it with you all!</p>

I graduated from UT with a chemistry degree but I didn't find out how cool you were until near the end of my time there, since I had a friend or two who might have served as your TA at the time or worked with you in some capacity and would have nothing but praise for you. Then, I started seeing more articles and various media about your accomplishments and realized UT was an awesome place to be. Keep up the great work \m/</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
