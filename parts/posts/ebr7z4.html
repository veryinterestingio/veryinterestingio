		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OK so these are 2 different questions </p>
<p>The small hole is called a bleed hole. Airplane windows have 2 or more panes, the inner pane is designed as a insulating barrier, aka not let the cold air freeze your ass off, while the outer pane is the one that actually handles the structural load, aka higher pressure from the cabin pushing against the lower pressure of the outside. The bleed hole allows pressure to equalize and makes sure that pressure is only applied to the outer pane.</p>
<p>Opening the shutters is to allow your eyes to be accustomed to the light level for the outside environment, such that when you get to the emergency exit you don't suddenly get blinded by the change in light level, this is also why they dim the lights during nighttime takeoffs. Keeping the shutters open also allows the cabin crew to easily look out the window to see if there are any evacuation hazards(e.g. Fire) on that side of the aircraft in case of an emergency</p>
<p>Edit: evacuation hazards
Edit 2: to whoever gave the gold, thanks so much, I really appreciate it!!!:D</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I asked the stewardess once why they keep the shutters open for take off and landing.</p>
<p>She said, highest chance of malfunction is during take off and landing, the shutters are kept open so we have extra eyes on the wings etc for fire or damage since the pilots don't have clear visual</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main reason why they ask you to open the shutters on take off and landing is that if something were to go wrong, theres a high chance of a passenger seeing it, freaking out and letting the stewards know. It's essentially creating an indicating system using the passengers as audible alarms. And the reason why its only during takeoff and landing is that's when theres a higher chance of things going pair shape as the aircraft isnt in its prime flying conditions (slow airspeed, engines running at a higher rpm trying to gain lift etc).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
