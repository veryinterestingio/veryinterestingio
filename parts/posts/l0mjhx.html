<p>I follow a gem stone sub on reddit who often post various gems and more often than not the colour isn’t what you’d traditionally expect from the type of stone, e.g. green garnets and pink sapphires. So, given that colour is not a feature that facilitates categorisation, what does?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll answer this more generally for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral" target="_blank">minerals</a>, of which gems are just specific kinds of minerals to which we have assigned some value. Your question can be interpreted in two different ways, (1) On what basis to we catalog/classify minerals? and (2) How do we identify minerals? We'll touch briefly on both.</p>
<p>In terms of classifying minerals, ultimately it comes down to their chemistry, but in practical terms we use a system similar in many ways to how we classify organisms, e.g., a series of distinctions which become increasingly more restrictive, i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral#Modern_classification" target="_blank">group, series, species, and variety</a>. It's a little confusing because many of these all get called a mineral depending on the level of specificity. Garnet is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_group" target="_blank">group</a> of minerals which all have the basic formula X3Y2(SiO4)3 where X and Y can be a variety of elements. Within that there are essentially smaller groups (e.g. Pyralspite or Ugrandite) which contain individual species (e.g. Almandine or Pyrope). It would still be correct to call any of these a garnet, but you can also be more specific if you can identify the particular species of garnet. Generally for a mineral to be a particular mineral group it will have a shared portion of a chemical formula (like the (SiO4)3 part of the garnet), which is typically the part that makes up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_structure" target="_blank">crystal lattice</a>, with then some variation in other cations that are within particular sites within the lattice.</p>
<p>In terms of identification, this is usually done on a suite of physical (or optical) properties. The common properties that are suitable for examining a hand sample are <a href="https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/users/menke/solidearth/Labs/lab03/RockMineralIntro.pdf" target="_blank">color, streak, luster, hardness, and how it breaks (cleavage vs fracture)</a>. If we take the garnet example, the different cations will produce differences in some of the physical properties (e.g. color), but others, which are more reflective of the lattice structure of the mineral, like the presence or absence and/or number of cleavage planes, will be the same between all garnets. Some of the more suitable identifications require the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_section" target="_blank">petrographic thin sections</a> as the physical properties in hand sample may be ambiguous for multiple species, but will have distinct optical properties (again driven by the chemical differences). In some cases, to truly identify which mineral you have (e.g. which of the multitudes of garnet), you may need to do a chemical analysis using something like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductively_coupled_plasma_mass_spectrometry" target="_blank">ICP-MS</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microprobe" target="_blank">electron microprobe</a>. For minerals like garnet (and when the details matter), these small scale chemical analyses can be the only way to identify which garnet(s) are present because a single crystal may actually be the intergrowth of different kinds of garnet reflecting different chemical, temperature, and pressure environments present during the crystallization of that particular garnet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mineralogy is the branch of geology that deals with the chemical makeup, and crystal habit of minerals. Certain minerals, or more specifically, varieties of minerals are considered gemstones based on completely arbitrary traits that we find attractive. Gemology is the branch of mineralogy that concentrated on gemstones in the jewelry world. </p>
<p>Gemstones are further categorized by whether they can be cut into faceted gemstones, or cabochons. Cabochons are generally opaque and get cut and polished into cushion shapes, where transparent gemstones get faceted (flat geometric faces arranged to reflect light within the stone). A Lapidary is the person who usually cuts and polished the stones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
