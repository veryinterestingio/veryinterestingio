In this book, I take you on a tour of the weird, wonderful, and occasionally terrifying world of sleep disorders - conditions like insomnia, sleepwalking, acting out dreams, narcolepsy, restless legs syndrome or mis-timed circadian clocks. Some of these conditions are incredibly rare, others extremely common, but all of these disorders tell us something about ourselves - how our brains regulate our sleep, what sleep does for the brain, and why we all to some extent experience unusual phenomena in sleep.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have always had bad sleep — taking hours to fall asleep, waking up and staying up in the middle of the night, being exhausted during the day but unable to nap or sleep later. I don’t take caffeine and am very aware of proper sleep hygiene. </p>
<p>My biggest question is what exactly is happening when I am super tired all day, so excited to go to sleep, then I get in bed and start to feel myself relaxing into sleep only to end up being awake for another 3 hours? Should I be going to bed very early (typically between 8:45-9:15)? Or something else? It is something that happens once I am in bed, not sure that it’s routine related, and it really sucks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
