		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Beer contain Carbon Dioxide, a gas. This gas is either dissolved into your beer or is trapped into bubbles.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxides are fines with being dissolved but what they like even more is getting into bubbles, make them grow so they can float and escape to the surface. Unfortunately there's not enough bubbles for everyone and they have to wait their turn to get a ride so it's a slow process.</p>
<p>Now come the tapping, by striking the glass you're sending waves of vibrations across the beer, bubbles don't have a good time, it makes them shrink and eventually explode into a lot more tiny bubbles.</p>
<p>More tiny bubbles means more rides to the surface for Carbon dioxides, they all rush inside, make all those new bubbles grow and they all rise to the surface at the same time. Even worse, as the bubbles are rising they pick even more passengers on the way to the surface, making them grow even faster and eventually making a big exploding foam.</p>
<p>Edit : u/Shioclas linked a nice video deeper in the comment to see the process without tapping</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/XimPiliA74I" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/XimPiliA74I</a></p>
<p>They send ultrasonic waves, disturbing existing bubbles and making a lot more tiny bubbles. Leading to the foam explosion, this is basically what the tapping does but with expensive lab tools.</p>
<p>There's also a gif to visualize the process on the bubble scale</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you agitate a carbonated fluid. It releases the dissolved co2 as small bubbles.   </p>
<p>When you strike the top of a glass bottle hard enough with anything (doesn't have to be another bottle) the bottom of the bottle moves downward faster than the beer can. This creates small &quot;cavitations&quot;, or a vacuum, between the bottom of the beer in the bottle and the glass bottom of the bottle.    </p>
<p>Imagine holding a container filled with small marbles. If you tug the container down towards the ground faster than the marbles can fall, you've created a space between the bottom of the container and the marbles. This is basically what happens when you strike the bottle, the beer isn't attached to the bottle so it can't keep up with the movement of the bottle. </p>
<p>The beer then catches up and slams into the bottom of the bottle, collapsing the cavitation bubbles and causing a huge amount of agitation. This ofcourse releases alot of co2, so it's much like agitation from shaking, but in a much smaller more potent scale. Cavitations</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a word, cavitation.</p>
<p>Carbon Dioxide is a gas that's squished into the beer until it dissolves, this is what makes fizzy things fizz and as we know when fizzy things are shaken about or disturbed this dissolved gas rapidly bubbles away. Another word for fizzing is <em>effervescence.</em></p>
<p>When the bottle is tapped from the top by another bottle it rapidly jerks downwards, this creates a 'bubble' of sorts at the bottom of the bottle. The difference is this bubble doesn't contain much of anything, it's more of a void, this is called <em>cavitation.</em>  </p>
<p>This void collapses in on itself with the full force of all the liquid in the bottle all at once in a very small space, that's quite a bit of energy and more so the fuller the bottle is.<br />
This rapid and aggressive void collapse causes pretty much all of the beer to effervesce to some degree, since there's not much space in the bottle and it narrows towards the neck, you get a lotta foam coming out of a very small space very quickly.  </p>
<p>Cavitation is a fascinating mechanism, it can shred propellers to pieces, destroy bullets and there are even rocket powered supercavitating torpedos that travel inside the void bubble to reach over 200mph underwater.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The physical process is actually interesting. Do this trick with a beer bottle sitting on a table, and then hold another bottle in the air and try it with that one. The held bottle will have a much more pronounced effect. Why?</p>
<p>Others have mentioned with great accuracy that it has to do with bubbles and CO2 rising from the solution. But where do the bubbles come from? This is the wild part.</p>
<p>When you clank that bottle against the top, the bottle moves down before the solution does, which creates a tiny localized area of vacuum at the bottom of the bottle where the solution is trying to adhere to the glass but is doing a bad job (on a small scale). </p>
<p>We know that when the pressure goes down on a liquid then it can boil and as it turns out, that is exactly what is happening in the bottom of the bottle!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
