		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the last 10 years, the poles have been warming four times faster than the rest of the globe. This has led to permafrost thawing, which has big implications since permafrost currently covers 24% of the earth's landmass. Many of these permafrost layers contain ancient microbes that haven't seen warm air in hundreds or even thousands of years. This leads scientists to wonder what microbes will &quot;wake up&quot;? And what will happen when they do?</p>
<p>I'm Dr. Kimberley Miner and I study how the changing climate impacts the most extreme environments in the world. My research explores the risks of climate change from more fires to hurricanes to flooding. But I also research microbes, which is an important area of climate change risk we rarely discuss. I co-authored this recent piece in Scientific American called, &quot;Deep Frozen Microbes are Waking Up.&quot;</p>
<p>Ask me anything about deep-frozen microbes that are thawing, other climate risks, or about what it's like to travel to the most extreme parts of the earth for science! I'll be here to answer questions starting at 12 noon ET.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fellow microbiologist here and I have so many questions but I'll try to keep it simple!
Have you been able to do any comparative genomics between &quot;newly awakened&quot; bugs and their contemporary counterparts? If so, have you seen any genes lost or gained? What is the risk of reawakening pathogens that haven't been seen in hundreds or thousands of years?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so:</p>
<p>1) What do we know about the microbes that have already thawed? Are there viruses, bacteria and fungi?</p>
<p>2) There's of course a lot of concern about theoretical dangers... but what are some of the theoretical advantages they could bring? What can we learn from them?</p>
<p>3) Back to that danger issue: have you found anything yet that makes you worried?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
