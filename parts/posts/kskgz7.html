		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So back in the 50s, AT&amp;T swapped from rotary to touch tone phones and they needed a pattern for the new keys. So they ran a study and tested 15 different layouts. Oddly enough, people preferred the telephone layout over the calculator layout. So that's what they went with.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Warning: slightly off topic.</p>
<p>I was watching several YouTube videos about mechanical calculator and adders (such as Comptometer), so don't treat me as an expert in this field. </p>
<p>Anyway, those devices have a common layout that was somehow forced by the design principles that they were using. There are separate sets of keys 1 to 9 for units, tenths, hundreds etc., but the common pattern of arranging keys was bottom-up (1s are closest to the user). </p>
<p>Early models with single set of digits (0 to 9) used a layout that we're familiar with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™ve been curious about this forever! In my job I have to use 10 key pretty regularly and dial phone numbers on occasion. When we switched to an internet dial system and had to type in phone numbers on 10 key in the phone program, it broke my brain. Copy and paste has been my friend.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
