		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>White noise is good at camouflaging low frequency sounds like talking, and traffic noise, and things being transmitted from other rooms because white noise which is just a mish mash of nonsense low frequency static, essentially. But sharp high frequency noises cut through the white noise pretty well because it stands out distinctly, and is obviously not part of the white noise. But high frequency noise like that doesn't transmit through walls or between rooms very well so it's less of a concern as long as you can close your doors or windows.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
