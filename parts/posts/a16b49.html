		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to more sound being absorbed, it might actually be quieter, especially if you live in a city and somewhere that it does not snow often. Fewer people will make journeys, less road noise, fewer people out on the street.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All of the roads, sidewalks, rooftops, and other hard surfaces that normally reflect sound are now covered in soft, fluffy snow that absorbs and muffles sound. </p>
<p>The effect is basically equivalent to putting sound-deadening foam on the walls of a recording studio. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the sound deadening effects correctly described by many posters -  if it's snowed and then there's an ice storm, or a sunny winter day followed by a freezing night, all that snow can get a very hard coating of ice on it - low frequencies can pass through that and into the snow beneath, higher frequencies bounce off of it, making the overall soundscape sound &quot;brittle&quot;, with higher frequencies bouncing all around. Post-ice storm sound has its own unique signature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It not only &quot;seems&quot; quiet, it IS quiet.  </p>
<p>Allow me to explain:  When sound moves between materials, it deposits some of it's energy into that material. Each snowflake takes up a little bit of the energy of sound. So while it's snowing, the sky is sucking up all the sound.   </p>
<p>Now while it's snowing, there is often a reduction in the amount of stuff going on outside.  Fewer cars, fewer people.  So there's less sound to reach you in the first place.    </p>
<p>This effect also happens in fog and rain.  I was at a concert a few years ago... Foo Fighters, if you wanna know.  And a rainstorm came in.  The rain, wasn't loud, but completely stopped the sound of the concert from reaching the end of the field I was enjoying the show from.    </p>
<p>NASA also uses water as a sound suppression system for rockets.  :-)  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
