		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your question seems to address not just what is popular but when fine art became supplanted by conceptual art in galleries. </p>
<p>Western painting has followed a historicized evolution. By the time photography became popular the role of painting as capturing reality changed, and became more conceptual in its representation. A great person to study is Marcel Duchamp as he seems to be the first one to say: well what if I just put an object here and call it art? (‚Äúreadymade‚Äù) I feel like grasping what Duchamp‚Äôs intentions were helps understand why there is often less premium placed on craftsmanship and more on concept sometimes.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A skeptic would say that it‚Äôs all hocus-pocus. </p>
<p>There are art dealers in New York and London and Paris who make a lot of money off of selling art. And the way they make money is by driving up the prices of certain artists that they are selling in the galleries. </p>
<p>Once these artists become famous in the galleries, then eventually the museums want their art. </p>
<p>So the skeptic would say that there‚Äôs no inherent virtue in certain artistic pieces .... it‚Äôs just the art gallery owners and art collectors who start a buzz, and keep the buzz going in order to profit themselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
