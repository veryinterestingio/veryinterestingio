		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a bit of biochemistry background and kind of understand the idea, but I‚Äôm not entirely sure. I do remember reading they made a supplement that ‚Äúuncoupled‚Äù some metabolic functions to actually help lose weight but it was taken off the market. Thought it‚Äôd be cool to relearn and gain a little insight. Thanks again</p>
<p>EDIT: Wow! This is a lot to read, I really really appreciate y‚Äôall taking the time for your insight, I‚Äôll be reading this post probs for the next month or so. It‚Äôs what I‚Äôm currently interested in as I‚Äôm continuing through my weight loss journey.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see someone else already commented about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,4-Dinitrophenol" target="_blank">2,4-DNP</a>. That's off the market because it can easily kill you. But if you can figure out how to make it safe, you'll probably get a Nobel prize for it, OP. Because someone already gave the fun answer, I'll follow with my more boring one: </p>
<p>Part of the main difficulty in losing weight is curbing appetite. Weight loss is a simple equation: calories in, calories out. While you'll never be able to outrun the fork, exercising or moving more technically isn't even necessary as long as you're eating less calories than you'd naturally burn in a day. Likewise, as the viral &quot;Twinkie Diet&quot; experiment proves, what you eat isn't as important as how much you eat as far as strictly shedding weight goes. Of course, eating all junk food can cause malnutrition and other problems, but strictly losing weight while eating nothing but junk food has been and can be done.   </p>
<p>There have been drugs that can curb appetite, but they're usually reserved as prescription only, as a last resort for the most critically obese patients. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved these prescription appetite suppressants:   </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Liraglutide (<strong>Saxenda</strong>¬Æ).  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Naltrexone-bupropion (<strong>Contrave</strong>¬Æ).  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phendimetrazine (Prelu-2¬Æ).  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Phentermine</strong> (Pro-Fast¬Æ).  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Phentermine</strong>/<strong>topiramate</strong> (<strong>Qsymia</strong>¬Æ).  </p>
</li>
<li><strong>Diethylpropion</strong> (Tenuate dospan¬Æ).</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem with these drugs is that they directly affect your brain chemistry. They control how your body and brain produces and processes hunger signals, and altering that natural process is pretty dangerous. There is no one size fits all approach, so dosages must be monitored by a professional. Typically, these drugs are prescribed as an attempted corrective measure more than anything. Patients that are morbidly obese have already altered their natural production of Ghrelin, or hunger inducing hormone, to extreme levels, and so prescribing an appetite suppressant is a last ditch effort to block the brain from processing those hunger inducing signals, and bring Grhelin production back down to normal levels. They are not guaranteed to work long-term, as there are many ways they can easily fail. The patient can build up a tolerance to the drug, eat out of habit, social construct, or boredom, eat oversized portions when they do feel hungry, or any number of other reasons that would ultimately cause the drug to be ineffective as far as inducing or maintaining weight loss goes. If that happens, going off the drug can actually make the initial problem worse, because the brain will no longer be shielded from the overload of extra Ghrelin that the patient is now producing to counteract the effects of the drug.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did my PhD thesis on appetite regulation. There are multiple targets in the regulation of appetite hormones, but because of the annoying/beautiful complexity of the whole system, there is often compensation when one specific thing is targeted. Or, like some drugs that have been tested, your gut transit is slowed too much and you projectile vomit. Which is one way to lose weight, I guess üòÜ</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The lab I used to work in is doing research on how to convert white adipocytes into brown adipocytes, which would ultimately increase the rate at which your body metabolizes glucose and fatty acids. We found that brown adipose tissue actually metabolizes glucose faster than any other tissue in the body, which is pretty neat. Conversion of white adipose to brown adipose, a process called ‚Äúbeigeing,‚Äù occurs in our bodies in response to beta-adrenergic stimulation following prolonged cold exposure (and a few other ways too), and we‚Äôve identified several receptors responsible for the conversion. If this could be harnessed into pill form it could be a powerful therapy for DM2, NAFLD, and other metabolic diseases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
