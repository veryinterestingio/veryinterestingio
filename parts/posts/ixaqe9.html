This doesn't mean that IF there is life in the atmosphere that it couldn't have originated from Earth via an impact event but all probes we have sent have been too recent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you already got lots of answers as to why it couldn't have been due to a contaminated probe. As for panspermia, one possible method is by asteroids grazing Earth's atmosphere then later impacting Venus. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09512" target="_blank">A rough calculation</a> estimates 600,000 such instances have already happened, and the same for asteroids grazing Venus then hitting Earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is the notion of panspermia where life spreads from one to world to another through natural process. Bacterial spores floating high in Earth's atmosphere have been detected in space immediately surrounding the Earth, blown out there by solar winds. Large surface explosions such as volcanos or meteor impacts can also knock tons of material into space at escape velocities (meaning it will not fall back to the ground). Significantly, bacterial and fungal spores left openly exposed to space for years have been recovered and revived. Hypothetically such spores could spread to other planets and moons within the solar system and beyond.</p>
<p>Potentially this means that bodies within the Solar system could have been swapping life for billions of years. Taken this idea to extremes could mean that life-bearing worlds through the galaxy are leaving a biological slick in their wake as their systems orbit the galactic axis. Interstellar space could be filled with in-tact biological material.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The first man-made object to even achieve earth orbit was Sputnik in 1957. The first flyby of Venus was 1962 (Mariner 2), and nothing man-made entered the atmosphere of Venus until later in the 60's.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a follow up question. I'm pretty niave in this field, so apologies. If we do somehow get a sample of the potential life form, what are we going to be looking for? If it has DNA similar to ours? Is it carbon based? If it has DNA similar to ours is that 100% evidence that it came from earth? If it is a separately evolved organism, what will that tell us?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
