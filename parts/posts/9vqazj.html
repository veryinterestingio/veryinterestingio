<p>Edit: Wow didn't know this would blow up. Was just super curious of the super scary &quot;flesh eating bacteria&quot; and why people get amputated because of it. Thanks for all the answers, I really appreciate it! </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of the reason it's such a big issue is because of the toxins that the bacteria produce. Like several others have said, Stretococcus is one of the most common bacteria to cause the infection but there are several others too. We do use antibiotics to treat it, but many times they aren't enough. We use surgery to clean the wound and get out as much of the bad stuff as possible and add antibiotics on top of that. Many times, it takes multiple surgeries to get the infection under control. </p>

<p>The most common species of bacteria that cause 'flesh eating disease' are bugs that normally hang around on our bodies on a regular basis, the most common being streptococcus pyogenes (group A strep). For some reason, be it a weakened immune system, bad luck, or a particularly bad strain of the bacteria, it can invade our bodies and cause an overwhelming infection that rapidly kills muscle and soft tissue. The reason we &quot;can't fight it&quot; is for the above reasons, so it requires rapid diagnosis and surgery to remove all the infected and dead tissue before it spreads to the point that we can't save you. </p>
<p>It sounds scary, but it's still quite rare. The key things to look out for are having an excruciatingly painful skin/soft tissue infection, especially when it's much more painful than what you think it should be just looking at it from the surface. You would also probably have a high fever, and be profoundly weak and sick. The last case I saw was a woman who was shoveling snow and had severe chest pain under her armpit, and thought she had just pulled a muscle, but eventually then developed diarrhea and became so weak she couldn't stand up anymore, so her family called 911.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What people normally refer to as flesh-eating bacteria are organisms like Streptococcus pyogenes (Strep A) that cause necrotizing fasciitis. Vibrio vulnificus is another example of an organism that has been implicated, though I only saw one case in the whole time I worked in microbiology at a larger hospital. Our bodies can fight skin infections and that's why not every skin infection leads to something so aggressive. Antibiotics are administered when someone presents with the symptoms, though that doesn't mean that no amputations or tissue removal are needed. There comes a point when a limbs/tissues can't be saved.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Read through the whole thread and surprised no one has mentioned <em>Clostridium perfringens</em></p>
<p>Causes a surgical emergency known as <strong>gas gangrene</strong> that frequently requires amputation. C.perfringens releases an exotoxin that causes breakdown of muscle and surrounding tissues at a VERY rapid rate. I’ve seen it once in my career and my goodness, you could actually see it progressing up the leg in real time. Hard to treat as it’s so rapid, and required surgical debridement and subsequent amputation.  Untreated it WILL lead to systemic sepsis and death. Horrid condition from a simple soil borne bacterium.</p>
<p>Also if anyone is interested check out <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2585703/" target="_blank">Fourniers gangrene</a> which I’ve seen on a couple of occasions. It’ll make you cross your legs and obligatory NSFW  </p>
