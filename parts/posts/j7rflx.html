		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blood pressure takes two readings, the first is the blood pressure in your arteries when the heart is beating, and the second is the pressure in arteries when the heart is resting. Both are measured in terms of millimeters of mercury, which is an old measurement defined as the pressure necessary to cause mercury to rise 1mm in a tube. It’s a bit outdated, but that’s what they use for whatever reason. These numbers will combine to give a reading such as 120/80, which means that your blood pressure is 120mmHg during a heartbeat and 80mmHG between beats. This is a healthy blood pressure; anything much higher is an indication of a problem, whether it is a physical blockage of your blood vessels or a chemical imbalance causing your heart to strain itself by pumping harder than necessary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you could connect a hose into your heart and the hose was squirting blood into the air. The first number is how high it squirts each time your heart beats, and the second number is how high it’s squirting between heart beats. If you have high blood pressure the blood would be squirting real high.</p>
<p>Because it’s impractical to do this, they use this balloon thing on your arm, where your blood pressure pushes mercury up a tube, and they measure that instead. Nowadays the modern machines don’t even have mercury, because it’s dangerous, but they still call it mm of mercury, because that’s the measurement everyone understands.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
