<p>A hypnic jerk occurs when your brain, which is still in &quot;awake mode&quot;, senses a sudden relaxation of too many muscles as your body enters &quot;sleep mode&quot;, similar to what happens when falling, your muscles suddenly aren't supporting you while in free fall. Sometimes we'll even have a dream that we trip or something as a way of our brain providing an explanation for it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These are called &quot;Hypnic Jerks.&quot; They occur when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have <strong>anxiety</strong>. As your body falls asleep, your brain remains awake. Your body may send out an alert, because it thinks it's falling.</li>
<li>You've taken <strong>stimulants</strong>, like coffee. Your brain is falling asleep, and this chemical wakes you back up abruptly.</li>
<li>You've <strong>exercised</strong> too recently. Your body is still in go-mode!</li>
<li>Your tree-dwelling <strong>ancestors</strong> may have received these jerks to keep them readjusting as they sleep high up in trees!</li>
