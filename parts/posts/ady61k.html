		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The lapse rate.  As warm moist air rises it will cool.  In this case once the air parcel hits a certain height where the temperature is equal to the dew point the water vapor will condense.   Where you have an expansive flat bottom cloud you have a somewhat flat layer where the dew point is somewhat all at the same height.  </p>
<p>A smaller cloud may be advected in or in the process of evaporating.</p>
<p>In moister warmer areas you will see this Lower condensation level lower where as in a more arid environment it will be higher.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>IIRC it’s called the lifting condensation level- the point at which water vapor in the air mass turns to liquid on its ascension upwards in the thermal convection cycle. Air masses don’t like mixing very much, different pressures and humidity content and temperature air pockets like to stay clumped with themselves and slide over/under other layers, which is why there is often a hard line under some larger clouds. This sliding over/under each other is why you also see the anvil shaped clouds with their hard edged under side- the layers are very different and Don’t want to mix. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Like I thought I thought I was going to help with an answer, but only was left with questions about the very condition of my education and how outdated it could become so quickly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, pilot here. Just to make a quick correction, just because a cloud is large does not always mean that is has a smooth bottom. There are rare cloud formations called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammatus_cloud" target="_blank">Mammatus clouds</a> that have a very &quot;bumpy&quot; bottom to them as they are associated with thunderstorms which means they are formed in unstable, rising air.</p>
<p>In another interesting note, there are also small &quot;cap clouds&quot; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenticular_cloud" target="_blank">Lenticular clouds</a>) that are mostly associated with terrain deformation where due to the rising terrain (though not exclusively) form a lens or &quot;cap&quot; to mountains as they are compressed against the more stable higher atmosphere.</p>
<p>As a side note, here's a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2sa8mc/sunset_photo_of_mount_rainier_with_two_cap_clouds/" target="_blank">cool Lenticular cloud over Mt. Rainier</a> in WA state.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The flat-bottomed clouds are just as irregular-shaped as irregular-looking clouds; you just can't see the bottom &quot;half&quot; of the flat-bottomed clouds.  The flat bottom that you see is a dividing line between an altitude that causes condensation (i.e. visible water droplets) and an altitude that causes evaporation (i.e. invisible water vapor).  The air mass above and below the cloud-bottom is the same air, it's just that you can see the water droplets (the visible cloud) above that line and you can't see the water vapor below it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
