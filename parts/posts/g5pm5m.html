		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>REM sleep cycles are a special thing but if you're just getting up whenever, chances are that's not actually the problem. </p>
<p>Sleep causes waves of cerebrospinal fluid. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Data from the lab of Laura Lewis, Boston University, suggest that during stretches of slow-wave, non-REM sleep, periodic waves of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) wash through the brain. Interestingly, the timing of these waves corresponds with the slow neuronal oscillations that define this stage of sleep, and with accompanying fluctuations in blood-oxygen level. The results suggest that electrophysiological waves drive slow pulses of CSF, and that this coupling is mediated by changes in blood volume.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m not an expert, I only recently learned this in a psych class but the sleep cycle goes: Stages 1 (light sleep), 2, 3, 4 (deep sleep), 3, 2, 1, REM and then repeats for however long you sleep. Each stage takes roughly 1.5 hours and depending on what stage of sleep you’re in when you wake up will affect how tired you feel. For example, waking up during stage 4 sleep will make you feel very groggy and tired but waking up during stage 1 will have you feeling nice and refreshed so long as you’ve gotten through the sleep cycle once. </p>
<p>Off topic but if you’re sleep deprived for whatever reason your body will, instead of going through the normal cycle, try to skip to stage 4 and/or REM sleep so it can catch up so to speak.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
