		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a species of lizard that has no males.</p>
<p>The females still often simulate mating but the offspring are all clones (not really clones please read the wiki) of the mother.</p>
<p>It seems the species started as a hybrid which then diverged from the original stock.</p>
<p>In mammals they would have all died out, but reptiles don't understand biology so they just do their own thing.</p>
<p>Edit for more info on awesome lady lizards.</p>

<p>I also heard a story once (not 100% sure if true) about a turtle conservation effort, where they  took sea turtle eggs, hatched them and carefully returned them to the sea, to reduce hatchling predation and increase sea turtle population. It took several years (YEARS!) for them to realize that they were only releasing male turtles (no genetic difference between males and females, so hard to check), and that this wasn't actually helping the wild sea turtle population reproduce independently. Whoops.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's lots of great examples in insects, a lot of which actually have a common cause. Bacteria of the genus Wolbachia are a common parasite of insect species, and are spread by latching onto arthropod eggs. Since only female insects can spread Wolbachia, insect populations infected by these bacteria tend to have a rather dramatic female skew, since Wolbachia (by not-that-well-characterized means) kills male eggs, causes them to develop as infertile pseudofemales, prevents uninfected males from reproducing with infected females, or enables parthenogenesis where females can reproduce without males. The end result being that Wolbachia-infected insect populations wind up very female-dominant. Wolbachia is pretty common, too- to the point where some insect populations actually die out if they *don't* have Wolbachia infections!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
