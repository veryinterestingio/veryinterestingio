		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was recently thinking about the likelihood of a meteorite impact where I live. Then, it got me thinking: on a geological time scale, are these impacts more likely to happen at the equator (given most of the stuff in our local region is orbiting the sun around the same plane that the earth and its equator is), or at the poles?</p>
<p>I realize that the effect of precession and the tilt of the poles into and out of the vector of the Earth as it travels around the sun does increase the chances of seasonal meteor showers in certain parts of the world. Also, I'm aware that the time of day also changes the likelihood of meteorite impacts, again because of the Earth's direction of travel around the sun in the early morning.</p>
<p>However, I now wonder if it is more likely for a massive, life-ending impact to occur around the equator than, say, at the North Pole.</p>
<p>Anyone have any insights? I already looked for this question on Google, and I only got some parts of the answer.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a paper that asked that question... </p>
<blockquote>
<p>We calculate the current spatial distribution of projectile delivery to the Earth and Moon using numerical orbital dynamics simulations of candidate impactors drawn from a debiased Near-Earth Object (NEO) model. We examine the latitude distribution of impactor sites and find that for both the Earth and Moon there is a small deficiency of time-averaged impact rates at the poles. The ratio between deliveries within 30° of the pole to that of a 30° band centered on the equator is small for Earth (&lt;5% (0.958±0.001) and somewhat greater for the Moon (∼10%) (0.903±0.005). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the Earth's poles receive slightly less meteorites and impacts than the equator, and the effect is slightly more pronounced on the Moon.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Looking at a <a href="https://s22380.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/USGS-Lunar-Map-visual-Mercator.jpg" target="_blank">map of the Moon</a> may help us find an answer as it's surface contains the record of every impact over it's 4.5 BY life. The central part of the map is the part of the moon facing us and so has relatively few impacts where the edges is facing away and has took the brunt of impacts. Keep in mind that this map exaggerates the polar regions, but higher latitude impacts appear to be more common, or at least higher energy. This could be due to the Earth's gravity deflecting the paths of nearby asteroids or possibly due to the orbital inclines of asteroids during the late bombardment phase of the solar system when most of these impacts were made. If the former is the bigger factor, then we could assume that the Moon would have a similar but smaller effect on asteroids impacting Earth and high latitude impacts should be somewhat more common. If it is the latter then the current likelihood could be different because the typical asteroid orbit now is probably very different from what it was 4 billion years ago. </p>
<p>TLDR; Depends on how the Moon's gravity deflects asteroids and the orbital inclination distribution of asteroids in our solar system, but it appears that high latitude impacts may be more common.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, impact is more likely at equator than poles.  Assuming uniform distribution of incoming asteroids, if the earth were sitting still, the likelihood of impact would be uniform.  However, since the earth is whizzing around the sun at 67,000 MPH with the equator acting as the earth's windshield (plus or minus 30 degrees), it is much more likely to be impacted, kind of like a baseball hitting a bird:</p>
