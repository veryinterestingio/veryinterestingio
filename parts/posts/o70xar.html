Thus, to a certain extent the lid and bottle where they meet will deform slightly under the pressure of the lid screw to form a seal together. </p>
<p>The metal halves of a hose or pipe fitting are stiffer and the seal between the two parts will depend a lot on machining/manufacturing tolerances and fit. Meanwhile, put a highly crushable and deformable rubber 0-ring in between and it will fill in all the uneven gaps in the seal between the two metal fittings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Plastics are solid materials, but quite soft compared to others like metals. To create a tight seal you want to fill every bit of space, something that can be squished into these spaces is good - such as softer O-rings around your metal tap. When you have something that is already a little bit squishy (plastics) being used with another slightly squishy (another plastic) thing, no O-ring is necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Bit more complicated</strong></p>
<p>An O-ring is a deformable polymer, typically a rubber material but other plastics can be used too. They are used as metals and ceramics cannot deform in the same way that plastics do. Plastics are rigid, but much softer than, metals and ceramics - hence O-rings are used to compress into all available spaces within a seal of some kind (such as around your water tap).</p>
<p>With a plastic bottle it is two plastics, usually PET/HDPE/PP, these are able to compress to some extent into one another creating a tight enough seal to stop leakage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
