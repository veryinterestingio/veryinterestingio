		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>CPA Here.  I make a good living advising my clients how to pay the least amount of taxes that they have to.  This could be a very long post but I'm going to keep it short.</p>
<p>When you say that the richest pay less taxes than lower income people, you are really saying that the percentage of their income that they pay in taxes is less than the average person on the street.  Bill Gates, Warren Buffet and Jeff Bezos pay a LOT of taxes on their personal incomes.</p>
<p>At least in the US, our tax laws are written to favor certain types of income, namely corporate dividends and long-term capital gains (assets held for at least a year which are sold for more than they were bought for).  For your ultra-rich person this income is taxed at a maximum rate of 23.8%.  Also, interest from state and local bonds is not taxed at all.  Say your local school district floats bonds to buy a new school and you buy one.  The interest that they pay you isn't subject to income tax.</p>
<p>Hence with a very wealthy person you'll see that their portfolio is usually full of dividend-paying stocks and municipal bonds.  When you divide the tax that they pay by their total income, many times it's less than 20%.</p>
<p>You're average Joe Six-Pack wage earner is typically subject to income tax at a rate of around 20%, but could be as high as 37% if they're earning $500k or more.  On top of that you have payroll taxes of 7% on the first $130K of wages and if you add those in your total taxes as a percentage of your income are more than the 20% or so that the rich pay.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This will never be a popular fact on “fleece the rich” Reddit, but the narrative that the wealthy don’t pay taxes is just completely false.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/06/opinion/income-tax-rate-wealthy.html" target="_blank">average person pays a higher percentage of their taxable income</a> in taxes than the rich because the rules are written to allow them to do so. Here are some of the reasons:</p>
<p>FICA taxes 6.2% of wages (12.4% for the self employed) are only taken out of the <a href="https://www.zenefits.com/workest/what-the-fica-the-social-security-payroll-tax-cap-for-2019/" target="_blank">first $132,000 in income</a> (2019). </p>
<p>The rich save a larger percentage of their income than the average person, so as a percentage of their income sales and excise taxes are lower. The same is true for real estate taxes.</p>
<p>The rich take a lot larger share of their income in capital gains and dividends, income which is taxed at a lower rate than &quot;ordinary income.&quot;</p>
<p>There are a variety of loopholes. The carried interest loophole is one of the most egregious. It allow hedge fund managers to shift income from the higher ordinary income rates to capital gains rates. &quot;Like kind exchanges&quot; and depreciation rules allow real estate investors to avoid taxes extremely effectively even when making money.</p>
<p>Finally, the problem is much worse than it appears. If you look at what the rich pay as a percentage of their income, you're almost always looking at what they are paying as a percentage of their taxable income. However, the rich are very adept at creating income that is not taxable. Look, for example, at Mitt Romney who released tax returns so I can see that he paid a lower percentage of his taxable income in taxes than I did for several years. His financial disclosure also shows a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/09/whats-really-going-on-with-mitt-romneys-102-million-ira/261500/" target="_blank">Cayman Island IRA with $25 - $102 million</a> in assets. Those assets were never taxable income, so his real tax rates were far lower then the rates he paid on his taxable income.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Payroll taxes are high.</p>
<p>The rich don't get a paycheck, they have investments.  Those are usually only taxed at 10%</p>
<p>Why does the government allow this?</p>
<p>Because it encourages the rich to invest in America rather than other countries that tax at a lot higher rates.</p>
<p>Also note that a 10% tax on $100 million ($10 million) is way more than you'll ever see in your lifetime</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
