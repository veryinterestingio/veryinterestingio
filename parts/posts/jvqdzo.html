		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know this! Im a scientist at a pharmaceutical company and im responsible for formulating and pilot batch manufacturing of tablets. The reason is due to the allowable errors in tablet weight and size;</p>
<p>It all comes down to the equipment used, mainly the tablet punch (like a mould) that compresses powders into a tablet. The industry standard is usually an oblong shape with a break-line down the middle, and the thickness can be controlled to give the required tablet weight, usually 1 gram.  The weight is the important bit, as we can control the weight to a certain extent as powder flow and particle size can differ from batch to batch. Some tablets may be a tiny bit heavier or a bit lighter than the one before it as it is ejected from the tablet pressing machine.</p>
<p>While it would seem cheaper to use smaller tablets and cut down on filling material, it would be a lot harder to control the tablet weight. Usually the average tablet weight is not allowed to deviate by more than 5% of the labelled amount (as per FDA guidelines). This means that for a 1g tablet we are allowed to have tablets differing in weight by 50mg (5% of 1 gram). A standard tablet press is able to meet these standards and create tablets that stay within the 50mg weight limit.</p>
<p>Now, if we had a tiny tablet, say 0.1 grams (baby aspirin springs to mind), then we would have to control the weight to the nearest 5mg (5% of 0.1 grams), which is tiny and almost impossible to meet. In this case we would have to use super expensive tablet punches on a very expensive and well calibrated tablet press.</p>
<p>Its cheaper to just use a larger tablet and make the rest up with filler material. A previous user said we use chalk, thats not true. Usually we use a form of cellulose (micro-crystalline cellulose) that comes from the cell walls of plant material. Its totally organic, cheap, and low in sugar and carbohydrates.</p>
<p>TLDR; Its easier to meet quality control standards when a tablet is big and the equipment used is cheaper. So a big tablet is always favoured regardless of if it could be made smaller.</p>
<p>Edit: I re-read the post and this doesnt even answer OP's question! multivitamins almost always come in larger 1g tablets, so im not sure about small multivitamin tablets?</p>
<p>Edit 2: just because supplements like vitamins aren’t fully regulated doesn’t mean companies slack off. Most reputable supplement/pharma companies will still apply the FDA guidelines to their products wether it’s necessary or not. It ensures quality and lowers risk to the end user (I.e. expensive lawsuits or product recalls). Our internal QC is standardised to meet FDA approval regardless of the product.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked in a pharmacy at one point and a lady wanted a list of the ingredients for her pill. It was like a 50mg tablet of something I forget. I listed off everything from our database and she started asking what each ingredient was. After maybe the fifth one I said &quot;a lot of these are fillers to make the pill bigger&quot;. She said &quot;they shouldn't add fillers, why do they do that?&quot;. Ma'am...do you know how small 50mg of something is? You'd have trouble handling it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, in the U.S., multivitamins and individual supplements <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/buy-store-serve-safe-food/what-you-need-know-about-dietary-supplements" target="_blank">are not entirely regulated</a>. The FDA will review ingredients for safety, but not for efficacy.</p>
<p>As such, multivitamins can be <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/all-about-vitamin-supplements" target="_blank">manufactured in different ways</a> and can be composed of concentrated synthetics. These synthetics may have the same chemical formulas as natural forms, yet have different structures and aren't even usable by the body.</p>
<p>As InspiringMalice stated, some vitamins may only have their size/shape for aesthetics, but others have their shape as a result of the manufacturing process, in order to contain stabilizers or other related compounds, or to include other substances or coatings that try regulate the timing and/or rate of absorption.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Much of those tablets are fillers and tabletting agents, like chalk, even in multivitamins. We're used to the size they are though, so its pretty much just catering to our expectations, so we dont feel ripped off by getting tiny tablets instead of normal sized ones.</p>
<p>Also, as a side to that, the size they are does make them easier to take as a quick &quot;oh yeah, the tablets&quot;, anything smaller would just be fiddly. Plus, some stuff you take in pill form needs to be released slowly as it could cause issues if it was given in one pure instant dose, so there's that too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the vast majority of a tablet is excipient - inactive substances that serve purposes like helping the tablet stay in one piece, keeping microbial growth out, and containing disintegrants which help the tablet break up in the gut, or providing a secondary function like in delayed/modified release tablets. Depending on the medicine in question, the active component can be as little as several micrograms (several millionths of a gram) per tablet up to about half a gram (acetaminophen/paracetamol/Tylenol).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
