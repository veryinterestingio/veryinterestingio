		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dams (whether they are hydroelectric or serve another purpose) fundamentally alter a lot of the underlying characteristics of a river and thus have very large impacts on a variety of life, mostly downstream of the dam, but also in the area immediately upstream that is inundated. In terms of the dam being a physical barrier and/or a direct cause of death for fish when interacting with turbines, in many respects this is one of the more easily addressed issues. Structures like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_ladder" target="_blank">fish ladders</a> or other mechanisms of transporting migratory and economically valuable fish (e.g. salmon) past dams are regularly implemented, e.g. <a href="https://www.nwcouncil.org/reports/columbia-river-history/fishpassage" target="_blank">more examples described here</a>. </p>
<p>However, simply making sure the fish can get where they are going ignores the fact that the presence of the dam often changes the river environment to the point where it may no longer be conducive to those particular fish species (and other plant and animal species). Some important examples:</p>
<p><strong>Temperature:</strong> Dams change the temperature of the water, as the impounded reservoir will often stratify with abnormally warm water on the top and abnormally cold water on the bottom. Release of these cold bottom waters will then reduce the temperature of the water downstream of the dam, which can have negative impacts on fish populations, <a href="http://www.riversimulator.org/Resources/GCMRC/Aquatic/clarkson2000.pdf" target="_blank">e.g. Clarkson &amp; Childs, 2000</a>. This is the most common example, but generally dams wreak havoc on the natural diurnal and seasonal temperature structure of rivers, which is problematic for species adapted to particular temperature ranges.</p>
<p><strong>Sediment:</strong> The dam also doesn't just impound water, it traps sediment. Starvation of sediment downstream of the dam will often cause incision, bank erosion, lack of floodplain inundation (depriving the floodplain of nutrients, etc), abandonment of channels, etc , <a href="https://www.osti.gov/biblio/41822-downstream-ecological-effects-dams-geomorphic-perspective" target="_blank">e.g. Ligon et al, 1995</a>. With specific reference to the sediment and fish, sediment on the bed of rivers is often important in the spawning cycle of various fish, so removal of the upstream sediment source can impact the ability of these fish to reproduce. </p>
<p><strong>Hydrology:</strong> Finally (and maybe most obviously), dams dramatically change the hydrology of rivers downstream of dams, e.g. <a href="https://scholarcommons.sc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1052&amp;context=geog_facpub" target="_blank">Graf, 1999</a> or <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169555X06002571" target="_blank">Graf, 2006</a>. This means that there may be extremely low flows at times (when water is being preferentially retained in the reservoir) or extremely high flows at times, but regardless, the flow in the river will be very different than the normal flow in that river. This will impact the amount of water in the river, but will also change how sediment moves, etc (which feeds back to some of the changes in the river environment described in the sediment paragraph above).</p>
<p>These are just a few of the big ones and ignores changes in the chemistry of the water, accumulation of material upstream of the dam, etc. If you're interested in this topic, there are lots of books (in addition to journal articles) written on the effect of dams on river habitat / ecology / geomorphology.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> There are strategies/structures employed at dams that can reduce the direct interaction of fish with the dam and make sure they can move around it, but the fundamental changes that a dam imposes on a variety of river characteristics (sediment transport, temperature, etc) can still make them incredibly destructive with respect to all sort of animal and plant species that live in or near the river.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two types of hydro power in rivers. Traditional hydro uses dams and forces the water through a turbine. Depending on the scale of the turbine and the size of the fish, it may or may not be harmful to fish passing down. It does block them from going up unless a fish ladder has been designed in. Dams have a tremendous negative effect on the evironment, from the destruction of habitat when the resivoir forms, to the nearly complete severing of fish populations from the dam itself.</p>
<p>The other type is Hydrokinetic, which functions much more like a wind turbine, but in the river. These types of devices do not require a dam, and thus are not nearly as impactful on the evironment. There have been numerous fish kill studies done with hydrokinetic equipment, and in all cases the fish are able to easily swim around the blades. There is even evidence of fish hanging out in very close proximity to the rotating components, perhaps using them as shelter. These devices can also be used in areas with high tidal flows and represent a clean, safe form of renewable energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer above refers to dams, so usually relatively high structures, equipped typically with Francis or Pelton turbines.</p>
<p>However, there is also run-of-river hydropower, which utilizes a weir and therefore has much less head. Oftentimes, Kaplan turbines are used in this type of hydropower plant.</p>
<p>Due to their larger diameter and less blades (think of it like a impeller in a pipe), they can be quite fish friendly, especially the slow turning ones. Fish-friendly in this case means that less fish is shredded to death when passing from upstream to downstream through the turbine. For the other direction, a fish ladder is usually installed (in the EU, the installation of a fish ladder is essentially mandatory due to the water framework directive). Manufacturers actually work on getting the turbines more fish friendly. <a href="http://www.mrcmekong.org/assets/Publications/technical/tech-No57-review-fish-friendly-turbines.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi-95z01pLnAhXD2qQKHXwVCzIQFjAAegQIAhAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw2M0p6lHQamheN4nMFO3OUQ" target="_blank">Here is a review of fish-friendlyness of turbines.
