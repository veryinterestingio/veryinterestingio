		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>More or less. Inflation is a measure of the average price of goods in an economy, so assuming your spending is relatively average with regards to category (food, rent, transportation) then your cost of living increases with inflation. </p>
<p>As such, a raise of roughly the rate of inflation is just keeping you at the same level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  And also note that a 10% raise is pretty normal when switching companies (and was also normal annually WITHIN companies, back in the 60s, before companies started screwing over loyal employees). </p>
<p>i.e., it doesn't pay you to be loyal to a company any more. Move every three or four years, at least.  And if you're not getting ANY raises at a company, don't stay at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Typically, companies are  give you a COL adjustment to your wages (around 2.5% minimum) to offset inflation.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Any raise above that could increase the standard of living you asked about.  Though, tour question about SOL is more subjective, since people may have different &quot;standards&quot; depending on where they live/work/life style they lead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
