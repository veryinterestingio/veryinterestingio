		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The fastest CPU* clock cycle ever registered, according to wikipedia, was around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_rate" target="_blank">8.723 GHz</a>. Let's be generous and round that up to 10 GHz.</p>
<p>How long would it take to count up to a googol (10^100 - lets estimate this before we move on to a googolplex, which is a number so unbelievably large that the answer to any question relating to it that starts with the words 'is it possible' is 'Definitely not').</p>
<p>At a speed of 10 GHz, or 10^10 cycles per second, it would take 10^90 seconds. This is about 10^82 years.</p>
<p>By comparison, current age of the universe is about 10^10 years, the total amount of time between the big bang and the end of star formation is expected to be about 10^14 years, and the amount of time left until there's nothing left but black holes in the universe is expected to be between 10^40 and 10^100 years.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_of_an_expanding_universe" target="_blank">Citations here for age of the universe</a></p>
<p>So in the time that it would take for the fastest computer we have to count to a googol, an entire universe would have time to appear and die off.</p>
<p>So, is it possible for a computer to count to 1 googolplex? Definitely not.</p>
<p>*Although here I mainly talk about CPUs, if all you cared about is counting, it is possible to build a specialized device that counts faster than a general-purpose CPU, maybe somewhere on the order of 100 GHz instead of 10 GHz. This would technically not be a computer, though, and a 10x increase in speed doesn't meaningfully change the answer to your question anyways.</p>
<p>edit: To address some points that are being made:</p>
<p>1) Yes, processors can do more than one instruction per cycle. Let's call it 10, which brings us down to 10^81 years.</p>
<p>2) What about parallelism? This will depend on your personal semantics, but in my mind, counting was a serial activity that needed to be done one at a time. But looking at google, it seems that there's a supercomputer in china with 10 million (10^7 ) cores. This brings us down to 10^76 years.</p>
<p>3) What about quantum computing? Unfortunately, counting is a purely classical exercise that will not benefit from quantum computing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another way to answer this is to look at cryptography, specifically the calculations for practicality of brute-force attacks where you enumerate every possible key. Here, rather than look at the minimum time required, let's look at the minimum energy requirements.</p>
<p>First, <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/1160" target="_blank">here is a quote of a snippet from Bruce Schneier's Applied Cryptography</a>. Full details at the link, but I'll try to summarise.</p>
<p>It looks at the absolute minimum energy required to make a single bit state change in an ideal computer - not something that practically exists. We can approximately assume that each change increments our counter by one (technically, you'd need multiple bit changes for carries, but we can ignore that since the numbers are absurdly large anyway).</p>
<p>The conclusion is that all the energy released by a supernova (minus neutrinos) would be enough to count 2^219 values. That is approximately 10^85 values.</p>
<p>Therefore, you would need the energy of approximately 10^15 or a quadrillion supernovae to count to 10^100, or a googol, at an absolute minimum with a theoretical ideal computer.</p>
<p>We can consider that completely impossible within any known or even most assumed possible computers.</p>
<p>And all those are just for a googol. A googolplex is 10^(10^100) (10\^(10\^100) if it's not rendering correctly), so much higher than 10^100 I'm not sure how to express the difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In CS, “counting” has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_problem_%28complexity%29" target="_blank">special meaning</a>.</p>
<p>Why would we want a computer that can count? Why would a human count? It’s usually because we want to know “how many” there is of something. In computing, we usually are interested in “how many answers to an arbitrary question.” A deeper insight (which relates to the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church–Turing_thesis" target="_blank">Church Turing Thesis</a> ) is that <em>every</em> counting problem can be phrased in terms of # of answers to some computable question. For example “how many apples are on the table” =&gt; take a picture of the scene and ask the computer “does picture X contain Y apples?” which is computable.</p>
<p>So in terms of computation complexity, “is it possible to count to 1 googol” can be framed as “can a computer correctly identify (in polynomial time with high probability) that there are &gt;= 1 googol answers to a problem (for any possible problem)?” The answer is yes, it is because we can make up an arbitrary problem designed for computers to solve with &gt;= 1 googol answers. (A trivial problem would be “how many numbers are there”, answer: infinity &gt; 1 googol). This approach is how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_supremacy" target="_blank">quantum supremacy</a> is proved.</p>
<p>Now you might object “that’s not what I’m actually asking. the answer is degenerate!” So let’s rephrase the question again into something more useful to think about and might cut into the crux of what you want to ask. “For any <em>computable</em> function/program/task, are there &lt; 1 googol unique outputs/results for <em>any</em> possible input?” A concrete example of a question that fits this structure might be “given an picture containing apples, can you compute if there are &lt; 1 googol apples in the picture or &gt;= 1 googol” if the computer can return the correct result then we can say this computer “can count to 1 googol” wouldn’t you agree?</p>
<p>Turns out this is a profoundly difficult question to think about. If you replace “1 googol” with “any integer”. The class of all problems of this form is in a complexity <em>class</em> called <strong><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp-P" target="_blank">#P</a></strong>. That “P” in “#P” is the same “P” in the infamous “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem" target="_blank">P vs NP</a>” question which is the most fundamental unsolved question in computational complexity. Turns out the class NP can be reformulated as “for any computable function, are there &lt; 1 result for any input or &gt;= 1 result”. Note that this is just our question with “1 googol” replaced with a “1”. We can actually <em>reduce</em> our class of questions to the definition of NP by pushing around some definitions (exercise left for the reader).</p>
<p>“Can a computer count to 1 googol” is just as difficult as “can a computer count to 1”. Again we all know that enumerating digits is trivial but when we count, we have to count <em>something</em> and counting some things are easy for humans but not computers (apples in a picture) and some things are easy for computers but not humans (number of prime numbers below 1 million). But can a computer count <em>anything</em>? That is the single most difficult question we have conceptualized since computers were invented.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
