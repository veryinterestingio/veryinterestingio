		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, I don't think any telescope could come close.</p>
<p>For instance, Hubble has an angular resolution of about 1/10 of an arcsecond. It is approximately 384,000km from the moon. 1/10 arcsecond is 1/36000 of a degree, and a circle is 360 degrees. </p>
<p>1/10 arcsecond on a circle with radius 384000 km is:</p>
<p>2 <em> 384000 </em> pi / 360 / 36000 = 0.18617</p>
<p>So the resolution of Hubble would be 186m, much too large to make out a single human. To achieve the sub-1m resolution needed to discern a person on the moon, a telescope would need a resolution over 100 times better, which does not exist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Definitely not from Earth or LEO. The resolution required to view astronauts on the moon's surface would be absolutely insane. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter which is - as its name suggests - in Lunar Orbit would be able to discern landed crafts and maybe astronauts. It was already used to image the Apollo landing sites.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm an astrophysicist, and I believe the answer is: <del>yes</del> maybe.</p>
<p>First we need to calculate the angular size of a \~2 meter astronaut on the moon. We can do this easily on <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28%282+meters%29+%2F+%28distance+to+the+moon%29%29+radians+to+milliarcseconds" target="_blank">Wolfram Alpha</a>: we find that the astronaut is about 1.04 milliarcseconds.</p>
<p>As other users have pointed out, no single telescope is large enough to have this kind of angular resolution. Hubble is about a 100x too small. Typically, to resolve an object, you need the resolution to be at most half of the object's size. So you'd need a resolution of &lt; 0.5 milliarcseconds.</p>
<p>But you don't need a telescope 100x bigger than Hubble to have 100x Hubble's resolution. An interferometer is an array of telescopes that have the light-gathering power of their total mirror areas, but the effective angular resolution is determined by their most-separated elements.</p>
<p>The most powerful optical interferometer in the world is the <a href="http://www.chara.gsu.edu/public/instrumentation/31-the-chara-array" target="_blank">CHARA array</a>, located on Mt. Wilson. It's a series of six, 1-meter telescopes that are about 330 meters apart (at longest separation). This means it has the resolution of a 330 meter telescope! CHARA has an angular resolution of 0.2 milliarcseconds, which should be plenty to detect our astronauts.</p>
<p>UPDATE (7 hours later): Someone asked a question that led me to think of an obvious concern: while the astronaut be bright enough to be visible by a small telescope array like CHARA?</p>
<p>The moon reflects <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/19981/moon-albedo/" target="_blank">\~12% of the light</a> that hits it. Let's assume an astronaut is wearing a classic white spacesuit. That reflects <a href="https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/29901/why-were-eva-suits-never-silver" target="_blank">\~80% of the light</a> that hits it. Let's say then, that for equal angular sizes, astronauts are 6x brighter than the moon's surface. The moon has a surface brightness of <a href="https://www.ee.ryerson.ca/~phiscock/astronomy/light-pollution/moon-brightness.pdf" target="_blank">\~4</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude" target="_blank">mag</a>/arcsecond^(2). If an astronaut has an angular size of \~1 mas, then let's say they have a solid angle of \~1 mas^(2). Then they are <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=6+*+%281+square+milliarcsecond+%2F+1+square+arcsecond%29+" target="_blank">6 x 1 mas^(2) / 1 arcsecond^(2) = 6E-6</a> times fainter than a square arcsecond of the moon. Which means their apparent magnitude is \~<a href="https://www.vcalc.com/wiki/sspickle/Difference+in+magnitudes+from+Flux+Ratio" target="_blank">13</a>+4 = 17.</p>
<p>What sort of exposure time is needed to see a 17th mag object? Well, on the <a href="https://www.noao.edu/gateway/ccdtime/" target="_blank">Kitt Peak National Observatory 0.9 m telescope</a>, it looks like to get a signal-to-noise ratio of 10, we need a an exposure time of 0.7 seconds. But CHARA has 6 telescopes that are a bit bigger at 1.0 meters, so lets call this (0.7/6) * (1.0/0.9)\^2 = \~0.1 seconds. But I'm going to assume that optical interferometry is more lossy than a simple imager, like in the KPNO example. So let's just arbitrarily bump this up to 0.2 seconds.</p>
<p>I'm not certain what sort of exposure time is necessary for a ground-based telescope like CHARA to work well is. But their <a href="http://chara.gsu.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=chara:pavo_user_manual&amp;s[]=exposure" target="_blank">user's manual has an example</a> where they use an exposure time of 8 ms. Now, is this fast exposure time needed in order to be smaller than the timescale of atmospheric variations? If so, then it's hopeless for our astronaut project.</p>
<p>But, if it's instead the case that CHARA had a rapid exposure time in this example because their target is very bright, then we may still be in business. CHARA might be observing bright targets because they are <strong>big</strong> (because they are close, which is also why they are bright), rather than because they can only see bright things. In this case, CHARA could afford to take slightly longer exposure times of \~0.2 seconds for our astronaut, even if that's a bit slower than the atmospheric coherence timescale (which is usually taken to be 0.01 to 0.1 seconds or so, depending on lots of stuff).</p>
<p>So, because I don't know CHARA's upper limit for exposure time (if there is one), I must offer an unsatisfying conclusion of &quot;Maybe.&quot;</p>
<p>EDIT: had the wrong link for CHARA initially. Fixed now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is no, <a href="http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/physics/45-our-solar-system/the-moon/the-moon-landings/122-are-there-telescopes-that-can-see-the-flag-and-lunar-rover-on-the-moon-beginner" target="_blank">there is no telescope on Earth that can resolve detail that small</a>.  In order to resolve something the size of the lunar rover, you would need a telescope that us roughly 75 meters in diameter.</p>
<p>The Hubble telescope is not large enough either, so it would not be able to resolve it.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter</a> might be able to resolve just enough detail to see some evidence of us being there, but it still isn't powerful enough to resolve people walking around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of people saying it's not possible with a telescope that exists today, and this is true. BUT, using MULTIPLE of the largest telescopes on earth as an interferometers in sync may be able to, just like they did with the black hole images.  The event horizon telescope is able to get the angular resolution required as it had a resolution of 25 microarcseconds, but it was in radio frequencies.  You could do it in optical domain too, but it's a lot harder and they are just starting to implement this technique in optical regimes instead of radio. </p>
<p>It is also not exactly a traditional image, but an interferogram, but still produces a image. The moon may be bright enough as well in the daytime to have short enough exposures to support a movie too.</p>
<p>But this is very very hard! More elegant solution is to put a telescope in low lunar orbit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
