		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Exercise is a controlled form of stress on the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems when done correctly. This, plus appropriate recovery time and nutrition, allows the body to strengthen itself over time via natural repair/adaptation mechanisms. Manual labor is not necessarily so controlled, and demands on the body may exceed its ability to adapt when repeated without appropriate recovery time -- which is not atypical for many of these jobs. Add workplace injuries into the mix and you can do quite a bit of damage over a career, whereas a reasonable exercise regimen under controlled circumstances should have a net positive result for strength, endurance, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you work out, you’re supposed to give yourself periods of rest and recovery. It’s actually important for proper muscle development, if I’m not mistaken. Manual labor jobs however, are done for long periods of time, and without proper breaks. Depending on what the job is, you may be doing something, or doing it in a way that would not normally be considered “correct”. So over time, you end up doing damage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unless you're a professional athlete, chances are even if you consider yourself a &quot;gym rat,&quot; you're spending no more than 2-3 hours in the gym, and not going every single day.  Even if you don't have a trainer telling you what to do, while you're in the gym, the common exercises you end up doing have evolved over decades by people finding out for themselves what ends up injuring them and what doesn't.  You're doing a variety of different exercises that work a variety of different parts of your body.  Despite chatting with friends or checking out the cardio girls, you're primarily concentrating on working out, so you're less likely to make mistakes.  Also, if something starts to feel funny while you're on the gym floor, you can simply call it a day, let it recover and come back.  </p>
<p>Let's compare this to a typical manual labor job.  You're working 8+ hour days, and even if you aren't actually exerting yourself for all of that, you're still going to exceed the 2-3 hours most serious gym-goers are going to top out at.  This means that your body has less time to recover, meaning that damage can compound from day to day.  You are going to be doing mostly the same thing all day.  Whether it's shoveling, hammering, stacking boxes, or anything else, you're mostly going to be using the same joints and the same muscles, further hampering your body's ability to recover from damage.   Making all this worse, while you're on the job, you've probably got a lot more on your mind than simply the physical activity you're performing.  If you're moving boxes, you aren't thinking about lifting each box as well as you can.  You're thinking about how your boss only gave you one day for a two day job, how annoying the clients are, or any number of other little things that will be on anybody's mind at work.  If your back starts to feel funny, you don't want to tell your boss, because he might see it as a sign of weakness and start giving you fewer hours when you need money.  </p>
<p>So, it's a combination of duration, variety, and concentration that make the difference between a manual labor job and hitting the gym.  Also it's important to note that if you do enough of anything, even if you do it &quot;right,&quot; you can damage your body.  Professional athletes still get injuries related to repeated strain even with the world's leading experts on sports medicine trying to prevent it.  There's a reason why pitchers don't usually pitch an entire game, and why even roided-up no test bodybuilders still usually take at least some rest days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Believe me, you can cause permanent damage in the long term at the gym. Im no specialist, just used to be a dumbass on machines, and now I am super careful to do everything with form, because any repeated stress to something that shouldn't be receiving stress in that way is bad. Doesn't matter if ur at work or the gym. As people said, work is often less controlled and ur focus is not taking care of ur body, but getting the task done.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
