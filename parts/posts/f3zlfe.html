<p>Green felt is frequently used simply because it was the preferred color for various applications, like billiards and other table games.  Some people say it's because green evokes feelings of calmness, and maybe there's something to that. </p>
<p>It's also really easy on the eyes, and when you are staring at a table for hours on end playing poker, it's nice to have a color that is easy on the eyes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Green is just a colour. Some places play on red, some on black, just depends on the place. Remember that most cards are Red or Blue, and most chips are White/Red/Black, so theres a distinct colour clash with a green table.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The green surface that covers these game tables is called <em>baize</em> and its color is purely traditional.</p>
<p>Games that use a cue, such as pool or billiards, evolved from 15th-century outdoor lawn sports (which also fathered croquet.) Because of this, baize is dyed green to resemble a lawn.</p>
<p>While the properties of baize vary with the sport - a rougher baize is preferred for snooker, and a smoother one for pool or cards - the color has been kept fairly consistent, presumably because it's iconic and instantly recognizable. However, there are some venues that use other colors for whatever reason - the second-most popular color I've seen is a pale blue (around Bleu de France or so.)</p>
<p>The coincidental association with the color of US money, and the supposed psychological color theory of green being relaxing, are coincidental things identified long after the fact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Why is it green?:   It doesn't have to be.  Plenty of colors are used in plenty of different casinos.  Green was probably the most traditional color because it's easy on the eyes, though I know of no definitive answer to this question.  It could be due to ease of access similar to the&quot;why is bubblegum pink&quot; origin.</p>
<p>Why that particular type of surface?:  To be brief, the surface leads to easier shuffling, easier pitching (The act of delivering cards out to players with a flick of the fingers), less damage to cards, and a softer place to rest your hands.  In general, the cloth (It is not made from felt, though you often hear the word felt used commonly to describe this cloth in the same way people call pool table cloth felt - that's also not felt.) is stretched out over the table on top of a type of spongy type of material.  This combination of cloth over spongy material on top of the hard table leads to the combination of properties for easy card handling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>FYI, the surface of a modern poker table is usually either baize (a type of felt), or fabric coated in Teflon; this allows cards to slide along the surface of the table more easily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
