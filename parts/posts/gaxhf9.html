		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two barriers to this idea. Firstly, doing science is hard at the moment. Getting into labs is a non-starter for many, conducting experiments is difficult, many people are having to deal with childcare and other issues.</p>
<p>Secondly I think you overestimate the pace of scientific research. Unless your research is into something related to the pandemic you are not going to be able to get funding rushed through. Designing experiments takes time, teamwork and resources.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From an Earth Science perspective, I would say a little bit yes, mostly an overwhelming no. There have been a few well publicized changes that allow some interesting work to be done (e.g. the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00965-x" target="_blank">reduction in seismic noise</a>), but nothing that I've seen is a once in a life-time opportunity (the seismic noise example is a good one, it's increased the accuracy of certain measurements, but none of these make a huge difference, all things considered). There may be more things down the road, e.g. this <a href="https://lcluc.umd.edu/announcements/covid-19-call-proposal-use-nasa-satellite-data-address-environmental-economic-andor" target="_blank">funding proposal call</a> for analysis of remote sensing data during this period, but it's not clear at this moment what will be learned from these types of observations.</p>
<p>Things like the above are more the exception than the rule though, as with most every aspect of life, the pandemic has been incredibly disruptive to the scientific enterprise. At my university, and basically every university with which I have colleagues, labs are shut down, field work is cancelled, support for remote facilities is problematic, universities are bracing for economic collapses so spending is frozen, etc. This has a wide range of impacts, just not being able to collect data that has become standard threatens major impacts to continuous records which are incredibly important to a variety of Earth/Climate science questions, e.g. <a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/wmo-concerned-about-impact-of-covid-19-observing-system" target="_blank">potential major gaps in instrumental records</a>. For the majority of us in the Earth Sciences (and really every branch of science that is not directly researching the disease and requires more than paper and pencil to do their work), this has put each and everyone of our research programs back years (e.g. as a small anecdotal example, field work I had planned for the fall which had been in the planning stages for 1.5 years prior is cancelled, and all of the subsequent work dependent on the samples to be collected etc will be pushed back until we actually get to the field, which even if we started planning / applying for permits right now, would take another 1+ years to set up). </p>
<p>EDIT: Here's <a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-04-29/coronavirus-forces-science-to-stop-cold" target="_blank">an article</a> with a wider science perspective highlighting just how damaging this has been to all sorts of scientific research.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/covid-19-could-help-solve-climate-riddles1/" target="_blank">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/covid-19-could-help-solve-climate-riddles1/</a></p>
<p>One of the biggest remaining questions about future climate change is the importance of aerosols, which are small particles or droplets that cause a haze in the atmosphere.  These can either warm or cool climate depending on whether they're light colored (liquid droplets) or dark (black soot) and are emitted by factories and vehicles along with the CO2.  Their effect is tough to calculate, and so they're the leading source of uncertainty when we match the warming we see against the factors that cause it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.realclimate.org/images/ipcc_rad_forc_ar5.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.realclimate.org/images/ipcc_rad_forc_ar5.jpg</a></p>
<p>(By the way, that comparison of global warming observations to theory definitely works, it's just that the margin of error is bigger than we'd like, and aerosols are the main reason for that.)</p>
<p>But aerosols don't last long in the atmosphere (days to weeks) while CO2 sticks around for centuries.  So as global quarantine hits, the skies are clearing of haze but the CO2 stays about the same, allowing us to get a better estimate of the role aerosols play in the climate system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a PhD student in engineering. The pandemic has put an abrupt stop to the research I've been doing, since I am not allowed access to the lab. So, my research currently revolves around an investigation into IMDB movie ratings, PS4 game reviews, and optimal orientation of bedroom furniture for maximum comfort. Prior to the pandemic, I can say 100% that this research would've been impossible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The US government (and other institutions) have thrown a lot of money at COVID-19 health and medical research, either for new studies or to adapt existing studies to focus on COVID instead. This has certainly caused a lot of labs that work in that space to quickly generate proposals to get their slice of that money. Those proposals will eventually turn into good research, but you aren't going to see significant publications of well designed trials for at least months.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of scientific publishing of studies that frankly would have a hard time getting published in other environments, but there's so little known about COVID that even poorly designed or hastily implemented things are getting published just to get some information out there.</p>
<p>Non-COVID medical research is definitely taking a huge hit. You can't bring volunteers to the hospital to do testing, people with non-COVID conditions that might otherwise be getting recruited to research studies are avoiding the hospital as much as possible, staff that typically work on specialized equipment are asked to stay at home, etc. Many universities have hiring freezes on new faculty and staff. Early career folks are being hit especially hard because they only have a small window to establish themselves, and unless they happen to be infectious disease researchers interested in viruses like SARS-CoV-2, it's going to be tough.</p>
<p>Frankly, the impact on medical research is going to be significant and lasting. Even in good times it's often difficult to recruit patients to studies and it's hard to imaging that people are going to want to do anything to increase their interactions with healthcare systems while there is still fear of hospitals and clinics as hotspots.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
