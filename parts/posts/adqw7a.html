		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To put it in very simple terms: the things that you think of and emotions that you feel can have physical effects on your body. Its just like how your hands might shake when you get scared or angry and how your cheeks may turn red when you’re embarrassed. When you think of somebody you’re fond of you may get anxious or excited. When you have these different emotions your brain will release chemicals that are related to these emotions which will cause other parts of your brain to respond, like the area that’s responsible for heart rate. The part of your brain that control your heart rate and other basic functions isn’t able to reason out WHY you’re feeling excited or anxious because it’s one the most basic parts of your brain and it doesn’t do very much “thinking” at all. It just receives the message that you are excited and so your heart rate will rapidly increase. In fact, your body’s “built in” control mechanisms are constantly adjusting things like heart rate and breathing for a large variety of things you may not even be conscious of. The reason your body reacts the way it does to these certain emotions can be instinctual or learned. Another example: Your heart races when you’re scared because your brain is basically telling your body “get ready to run or fight!!!” Even though you may just be sitting on the couch watching a horror movie. It’s just the same. The heart rate part of the brain doesn’t know you’re watching a movie. All it knows is that you’re scared so it adjusts accordingly. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how when you just finished a really tough run, you can really feel your heart beating in your chest without even putting your hand on it?</p>
<p>Well that’s because when you exercise or are put into a situation of stress, your heart is stimulated to pump faster and harder so enough blood is pumped around to supply your body. This means that you can feel your heart beat in your chest, and this is called “palpitations”.</p>
<p>We don’t really understand why it is, but love and attraction and this fight or flight response are very linked - in fact it is a firing of this nervous signal (the sympathetic system) that causes ejaculation in men. </p>
<p>Hence when you think about someone you love a large amount of sensory stimulus is processed by your brain, stimulus that may make you nervous, excited or getting your heart rate up in preparation for vigorous exercise you may be doing with this person.</p>
<p>It’s the same reason why if you’re lying in bed at night, and suddenly you think of that insanely creepy movie you watched months ago your heart rate rises and you become much more alert. Even just thinking of something can cause part of your body’s reaction to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
