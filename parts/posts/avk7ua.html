		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have mentioned the proximity to the door. The only thing their answers don't explain is why cars with front bench seats (which are rare these days, but used to be common) don't have the driver in the middle. This is because of a couple of reasons. First, the steering column. This is a relatively straight piece of metal connecting the steering wheel to the steering rack (or in older vehicles, the steering box). This box needs to be on one side, because the engine is in the middle. The other reason is that older cars were predominantly rear wheel drive, which means the transmission sits between the driver's and passenger's feet. This means that if the driver was in the middle, log room would be minimal, and there would be no room for pedals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main reason is so you are closer to the centre of the road, you can see the oncoming traffic easier easier. Also as other people have said, it's easier to get into a seat next to a door rather than in the middle and makes better use of space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Visibility. If you've ever driven a left or right handed drive in a country that predominantly uses the other system, you'll learn real fast why the seat is where it is. It's annoying to see anything ahead of you safely when you're on the wrong side.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
