		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Insider Trading is the illegal part. Basically, it's illegal to use information not available to the public when selling stocks, because it's unfair to the people buying your stocks. If you work for a company, let's say Apple, and you know that the new iPhone 50 is buggy and going to be released anyways, you may want to sell your Apple stock to a bunch of people who think that the new iPhone 50 is going to be a huge hit and earn tons of money for Apple. They don't know that the new iPhone is going to be bad, so they're going to spend a lot of money on buying that stock from you, and then that stock will very quickly become worthless.   </p>
<p>It's like if you had a car, that you knew had engine problems, but sold it to someone without telling them about it. It wouldn't be fair. It's like fraud.   </p>
<p>So, the idea here is that the government officials got a private briefing about how bad the virus was going to be, and sold stocks with that knowledge in mind before the general public knew. Likewise, most of the officials in question were ones who didn't actively warn people about the problem, so it seems that they cared more about protecting their investments than they did about protecting the American people they serve.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say you and a friend were going to trade some playing cards. You want to see if you can get a really good card, and would trade some of yours to get it. But before the trade, your friend found out that a rule change in the game was coming out soon, and going to make the good cards he had... not so good. If he did not tell you and you found out after the trade that he knew about the rule coming up, you would be upset. Especially if it was because his dad worked for the playing card company and told his kid so he could trick you. In the stock market we have rules about everyone knowing the same information, so everyone can play fair, because we believe that who your friend's dad is shouldn't mess up a good game for everyone else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It isn't specifically about government officials. </p>
<p>Certain people are privileged with information. And these same people might also hold positions of public and private trust. Therefore they have a duty and are limited by law on how they can use this information. </p>
<p>Some things are fairly obvious - like company or government secrets. Anyone who is provided this information and tries to trade that information for private gain will have broken the trust and may be liable for civil (private) and/or criminal (public) prosecution. </p>
<p>In other cases, it isn't always obvious or even easy to establish. The public stock market (ie sold to anyone) is one where trading in privileged information is restricted so as to maintain a relative fairness in the market. The specific case therefore hinges on whether the government officials were given information not made available to the general public and tried to profit off that information in the public market.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
