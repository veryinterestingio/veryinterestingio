		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a MSc in vertebrate palaeontology, hoping to start my PhD soon, so lets see how I do!</p>
<p>For reconstructing the appearance of dinosaurs or other fossil organisms we have a few useful tools at our disposal. </p>
<p>First, bones can tell you a lot about the appearance of muscle tissue. Muscle attachment sites on bones give some pretty great indication of muscle size and position in the body. Determining these muscle features takes a lot of careful work. Look at work by Oliver Demuth if you want to see a good example of reconstructing muscle from bone features.</p>
<p>Next up, skin and feather appearance. We have actually some great examples of both fossilized for several dinosaurs, so that helps with reconstructions a lot. Search up Leonardo the Brachylophosaurus, the nodosaur Borealopelta or thr Psittacosaurus at the Senckenberg museum. These dinosaur mummies show us almost exactly what these animals looked like in life. For feathers there are great examples of smaller  theropod dinosaurs perfectly preserved with them from places like the Jehol Biota in China, but also larger animals with them such as ornithomimids from Canada or the tyrannosaur Yutyrannus Liaoning Province in China. We suspect many theropods had feathers as we keep finding older examples of feather bearing ones, which would suggest it is a common feature in the group as if the oldest ones were feathered it stands to make sense that thwir descendants would have feathera commonly. Even non theropods had feather like structures, possibily feathers themselves, suggesting they were a widespread feature in all dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Next up, colour. The science behind this is newer but oretty cool. Basically pigment granules called melanosomes exiat in flesh to give it colour (among other things). It turns out these melasomes fossilize and through microscopic techniques you can actually look at their distribution, abundance and variety in fossil skin or feathers to determine the colour of the animal. I will mention Borealopelta again. This dinosaur has melasomes present in such a way to indicate that it was browniah coloured on top and lighter coloured on its stomach. The birdlike Anchiornis is another good example. Most fossils do not preserve these pigments, though, so colour in reconstructions is often based off of living animals.</p>
<p>Next, we use whats called the extant phylogenetic bracket to determine appearances of things we aren't too sure about, to inform our science by comparing dinosaur bones to their closest living relatives. Dinosaurs are archosaurs, meaning they sit in the same family group as crocodiles and birds (which are dinosaurs themselves). Because of this, there are likely a lot of things the tisssues and bones of these animals could tell us about how they looked, moved and other things. We'll alao take a look at other loving animals to see features that may or may not fossilize exactly, like the lips of a monitor lizard or the trunk of an elephant, and see if there are unlooked clues in bones for such things.</p>
<p>Modern palaeoart is often a pretty accurate depiction of dinosaurs and other prehistoric life. Thinking of the palaeoartists I know and follow, they're all palaeontologists themselves and do hours and hours of scientific research in order to make the best reconstruction they can, often collaborating closelt with the authors of studies they are making their art for. Colour choices or elaborate feather displays may be a bit subjective but they're certainly not unfounded. So while these reconstructions may not be exactly what the animal looked like, they're likely pretty close in most cases.</p>
<p>Hopefully this helps and isn't a garbled mess. I just woke up and was very excited to write this!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to that wonderful explanation, paleontologists study living relatives of dinosaurs, plus lineages that are relative unchanged morphologically over the last few hundred MYA. Think rhinos and crocodiles. Much like human forensic science, looking at the fine scale structure of living lineage skulls (like with a CT scan or a 3D rendering) we can predict the musculature attachment of dinosaurs and thereby come much closer to what they may have actually looked like. Even down to the fine pitting in bones, this micro scale perspective helps build a three dimensional body part by understanding fine scale interactions between bone surface, muscles, fascia, and fat deposits.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>More qualified responders than myself will respond to the main thrust of your question. But I can address the popular representations of dinosaurs in artwork and models.</p>
<p>Most of those illustrations are bunk. There was one particular mural on display at the Yale Peabody Museum which was tremendously influential in informing popular ideas of what dinosaurs looked like. The mural was on the cover of Life Magazine in 1953 the image stuck. </p>
<p>These early representations inspired toys, which gave kids from the '50s onward a baked-in idea of what dinosaurs were supposed to look like. And since then, publishers of educational books have commissioned illustrations that were informed by those toys (and indirectly the mural), in spite of changing scientific understanding of what the actual animals looked like.</p>
<p>This has persisted into 2020. You can still find illustrations and toys representing therapod dinosaurs without feathers, T-rex without lips or cheeks. Sauropods finally have tails in the air rather than dragging on the ground, but we still have a long way to go.</p>
<p>I learned about this situation while working on a story on the subject for Smithsonian Magazine, in which I interviewed the man who has the world's largest collection of toy dinosaurs. And somewhere in the course of that conversation in his living room, he convinced me that the toys and the illustrations of dinosaurs really do matter and impact the ongoing misunderstanding of what dinosaurs look like even as we've had tremendous new knowledge owing to computer modelling, CT scans of bones, and other technology.</p>

<p>Researchers reconstructing extinct animals, like dinosaurs, have to take a number of factors into account to ensure the highest level of accuracy possible.  The most basic requirement to accurate reconstruction is a rudimentary understanding of zoology and animal physiology, which can only be accessed through study of extant (currently living) species.  All vertebrate animals follow a relatively conservative body plan, with the same skeletal elements found throughout the group: almost all vertebrates have skulls, a spine, and almost all tetrapods have four limbs.  There are of course exceptions that must be understood as well, like snakes, but for the most part there is remarkable consistency in the skeletal anatomy of vertebrates, even if the external features may appear very different.  Therefore, we as researchers can identify like for like elements (i.e. a femur, a tibia, and a fibula) and understand where they fit into the animal, how they fit together, and what purpose they serve.  When reconstructing animals like saber-toothed cats or mammoths, we have excellent modern analogues (big cats, elephants) that we can use to guide our reconstructions of these animals.</p>
<p>Now, with dinosaurs we have more of a problem.  There really aren’t any living things today that bear much physical resemblance to a <em>Stegosaurus</em> or a <em>Diplodocus</em>.  Reconstructing these animals requires more nuance and a greater familiarity with their development and evolution.  It’s no surprise that our picture of dinosaurs has changed remarkably, many times, in the last century and a half since their discovery.  The basic principles I outlined above, however, still apply.  Dinosaurs typically feature four limbs with the standard elements found in amphibians, reptiles, and mammals.  We understand how these elements associate with one another based on our observations of living animals, and in particular of animals widely distributed throughout the vertebrate clade.  It is unlikely that dinosaurs possessed these features but in a structure or function with which we are entirely unfamiliar.  It’s always possible, but unlikely.  So we can be confident that our basic reconstruction of a skeleton is accurate to how the bones would articulate in life.</p>
<p>Posture is a more difficult issue to resolve, and in the past reconstructions have placed dinosaurs in positions which would have literally killed them.  Upright “kangaroo” walking for large theropods, tail-dragging and even belly-dragging for huge herbivores.  As our understanding of the ecologies of these animals has improved with more and better data, we understand that these reconstructions are inadequate answers to the questions that fossils pose.  Biomechanics and dynamics can also be used to test the feasibility of a reconstruction, although this is far removed from my expertise and I don’t feel confident going into great detail about that subject.</p>
<p>Looking back at past reconstructions of dinosaurs, we can see features that appear glaringly wrong to us, but at the time seemed reasonable.  As more data is collected and studied, it can be added to the body of understanding that guides how paleontologist and paleoartists reconstruct these animals.  Today, many dinosaur species are now depicted as feathered, as opposed to very scaly and reptilian as in the past.  This is due to recent (as in &lt;30 years) discoveries of a plethora of fully-feathered non-avian theropod dinosaurs, including favorites like <em>Velociraptor</em>.  It has long been understood that birds are an extant group of theropod dinosaurs, but for many decades this information failed to become mainstream within dinosaur reconstructions.  Only in the last decade or so has this really been able to become the standard.</p>
<p>Pop culture trends also affect how dinosaurs are commonly depicted, and with the vast quantity of dinosaur art that is created by non-professionals, there can be a lag between what paleontologists and paleoartists understand, and how the animals are represented in the public.  Look no further than the latest Jurassic World movie to see horribly outdated and bizarrely inaccurate dinosaur depictions.</p>
<p>However, professional paleoart is not trend-free either, far from it in fact.  A history of paleoart finds themes that persist for a period of time before being replaced by a new paradigm.  In the past, many dinosaurs were reconstructed as very lean and almost skeletal, showing off every muscle and bone almost as if to display the knowledge and skill of the artist.  Today, we tend to reject these reconstructions and favor those that add layers of subcutaneous fat to give the animals a more life-life appearance.  You can see an example of a lean “shrink-wrapped” dinosaur <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/25/45/a2/2545a2c7fd3f419978cb44b2575f486b.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>, and a more modern take <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_wr5JHdFEx4/WUJ1_U6T8kI/AAAAAAAACvQ/dz_wshSsFrc0r3umY6EYlDax4lZI2KTmQCK4BGAYYCw/s1600/Tyrannosaur%2BWitton%2B2017%2Bdetail%2B1.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>.  For the record, that first image literally makes me uncomfortable to look at.</p>
<p>My own education on the topic of paleoart and the very specific procedure of extinct animal reconstruction has primarily been focused on mammals.  While reconstructing dinosaurs is a serious scientific activity, there is more speculation involved than with prehistoric mammals, particularly those with close extant relatives.  If you are curious on this topic at all I can happily discuss this further and link to some excellent resources on the topic.</p>
<p>Edit: Mark Witton, artist of the more modern reconstruction I linked, has a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072Z1FWFB/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1" target="_blank">book about this very topic</a>.  He's a great paleoartist and his writing will certainly answer your question better than I ever could.</p>
<p>Edit: Thank you everyone for the overwhelming positive responses!  I've been trying to respond to as many follow-up questions as I can but honestly some of them go beyond my body of knowledge.  There are others in this thread who can offer great insight into this topic as well, particularly [this comment] by u/AuroraBroealis which touches on aspects of reconstruction that frankly should have been in my answer.</p>
<p>I want to be completely open about the fact that I am a <em>student</em> of paleontology, currently pursuing a master's degree in the field.  I grew up reading about dinosaurs and throughout my undergraduate career stayed up to date on new findings and more advanced literature, but I do not study dinosaurs in a lab setting or work with their fossils myself, nor does anyone in my department.  We are a Cenozoic-focused department, as in post-dinosaur, Age of Mammals.  My own research focuses on conservation paleobiology and turtle ecology, so those are the topics I really feel most confident addressing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am the opposite of an expert, but I happen to know one thing in response to your first question: they have more than just bones to examine. They also have trace fossils. By this (in reference to dinosaurs) I mean that paleontologists have found not only dinosaur footprints, but impressions of skin (and feathers, iirc). There are also some examples of prehistoric samples preserved in amber like <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-38224564" target="_blank">this dinosaur tail</a>. I'm sorry I can be any more helpful, I am just a humble amateur - perhaps a paleoichnologist will come out of the woodwork and explain better and in more detail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
