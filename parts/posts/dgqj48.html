		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to the other commenter, [[edit: well now this is on top, so my comment is about <em>exceptions</em> to internal microbes leaving you with a only skeleton]] there are definitely different levels of decomposition that can happen. You won't always be left with a skeleton. Sometimes you may be left with a &quot;natural mummy&quot; that isn't very decomposed at all. Examples of conditions where you would find a natural mummy:</p>
<p>Icy mountains - the body is frozen, such as in the Alps. See: Otzi the iceman.</p>
<p>Also human sacrifices have been found in the Andes in even &quot;better&quot; condition. Here is a link but fair warning, it includes pictures of child mummies: <a href="https://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/frozen-mummies-of-the-andes/" target="_blank">https://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/frozen-mummies-of-the-andes/</a></p>
<p>Dry sands - there were bodies buried in the ground in Egypt before the traditional mummification process was developed, I believe, and they were somewhat preserved by these conditions. This obviously dehydrates the body in a way that is different to ice mummies.</p>
<p>And, bogs - they may have high moisture, and not quite freezing temperatures, but importantly, they do have low oxygen and an acidic environment, which prevents the microbes from decomposing the skin.</p>
<p>Basically, various conditions can inhibit the decomposition process that microbes might otherwise cause. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the type of 'sterile' environment you're in. Depending on temperature, there are several ways for a body to decompose. Normally, your mucous glands all along your intestines keep your digestive bacteria in check, so once you dies, and those mucous glands stop protecting your gut, those bacteria start digesting you. This happens at a fairly predictable rate just based off of body temperature when the body passes, but extremes in temperatures can greatly affect this rate.</p>
<p>In a hot/humid 'sterile' environment, like a sealed room, a body will putrefy rapidly, turning into necrotic black soup. This is the fastest way to 'naturally' turn a body into a skeleton without outside factors like insects or foreign bacteria.</p>
<p>In a hot/dry sterile environment, a body can still putrefy, but high temperatures might kill off the gut bacteria before the bloat the body and turn it to ooze, so in this case, it's possible for a body to become a dry mummy at which point other factors like sand erosion might break down and disperse the biomass.</p>
<p>In tepid environments, humidity plays less of a factor, and a body will putrefy, bloat, and eventually turn to ooze on the inside, but the skin might remain recognizable for a fair amount of time. </p>
<p>The interesting case, however, is in very cold environments. In particularly cold environments like the arctic and antarctic circles, as well as some mountain ranges, the low body temperature will cause a body to lose temperature at a rate fast enough that it can drop below the survivable threshold for bacteria long before putrefaction sets in too deeply. Once the bacteria are dead, the next thing that happens is that the moisture in the body will freeze, and ice has the odd ability to sublimate at low temperatures, so after a long enough period of time, the body will eventually dry out and leave a husk similar to a hot/dry decomposition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main mechanism by which bodies decompose after death is biological degradation by microorganisms, which is a pretty predictable process, but if a body was put in a completely sterile environment, also removing all microorganisms from skin, mucous membranes and gastrointestinal tract, then what happens to it completely depends on the conditions it is left in (humidity, temperature, pH, oxygen level). Let's say you leave it in a sterile room, then...</p>
<p>The body is made up of roughly 65% water, 20% protein, 10% fat, 5% minerals.  Water will be lost at different rates depending on the surroundings, with the best-preserved bodies being those that dry up faster, as absence of water slows down chemical reactions and thus prevents both biological and chemical degradation. In a sterile room, the water would slowly be lost to the surrounding air.</p>
<p>Fat, most of which is triglycerides, usually starts decomposing (via lipases) shortly after death into glycerol and fatty acids. These fatty acids probably won't turn into adipocere (corpse wax) because this happens when there's enough water, bacteria, and no oxygen. In a sterile room filled with air (and oxygen in it), the fatty acids will probably be oxidized into aldehydes and ketones (i.e. the fat goes rancid).</p>
<p>Some proteins start degrading very early after death, from the catalysis by leftover proteases and other chemical reactions undergone inside cells and tissues. However, this would be relatively limited: not only are there tissue proteins that are relatively resistant to degradation even in the presence of bacteria (e.g. collagen), but in the absence of microorganisms or any other catalyst, the peptide bonds in proteins are actually quite durable. They do break down in the presence of water, but this is relatively slow, with a half-life of hundreds of years. The corpse in a sterile room would probably dry out first, and of course, the keratin in the skin, nails and hair would be intact.</p>
<p>Minerals in bones and other tissues can leach out to water, especially in acidic pHs, and be affected as well by microorganisms, but in the case of the body in the sterile room, the hydroxyapatite in the bones will probably hold up.</p>
<p>In summary, given enough time, you would end up with a dried-up mummy at which point the oxygen in the air and and light in the room become the main enemies of its structural integrity. A dead body is still subject to degradation by chemical processes, which are comparatively slow in the absence of biodegradation. Unless high temperature or extreme pH are present, the body will usually be well-preserved. Cold temperatures slow down chemical reactions, and low humidity dries up the tissues, which has the same effect. Well-preserved bodies, such as the mummy you would have from the sterile room scenario, still have the basic structures of bones, internal organs and skin even after thousands of years, though at the molecular level there is still some breakdown, as described above.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The bacteria in our guys and other places that can't be cleaned would do the job. Now, you could pump the body full of formaldehyde to prevent internal decay. But that's already how we preserve bodies in caskets which are far less sealed/sanitary than your thought experiment. </p>
<p>Point being I don't think you could get rid of the bacteria in the body without making the body itself too toxic to decompose anyways</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
