<p>Here's a chart of Taiwan's influenza-related out-patient clinic weekly ratio data, 2020 is the thick blue line:

<p>I suspect any large-scale patterns like this will become more apparent in the coming months, but it’s intuitive when you think about it - all of the hypervigilance surrounding this COVID pandemic is surely going to reduce the transmission of other diseases. Will be interesting to see what happens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It should help but it will be difficult to say for certain how much it helped since for most of Feb the CDC has been seeing a reduction in influenza lab results. This means the season was already starting to wind down before the most substantial COVID-19 measures were implemented.</p>
<p>This has not been a good flu season particularly with the influenza vaccine missing the mark a little (IIRC it was only found to be 45% effective). </p>
<p>The reactions you are seeing to COVID-19 can be thought of how we would approach particularly deadly flu (e.g. H1N1) seasons if we did not have a vaccine. </p>
