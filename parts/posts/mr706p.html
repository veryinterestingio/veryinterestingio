This is accomplished with a mixture of brain waves and hormones.</p>
<p>I began waking up an hour early every day for a project. After the first day of the surprise alarm, I began waking up consistently 15 minutes prior to the alarm once I'd gained familiarity with the new project and was actively thinking on it. Halfway through, once the routine was normalized and the remainder was all planned out and known, the novelty wore off. With less excitement, I began sleeping in until the alarm went off, and the usual dread of waking returned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your subconscious gets programmed over time to process stimuli that you might not even be consciously aware of - there might be a particularly sharp turn, or the road surface changes very slightly but the tires make a slight different noise on the road, or the pattern of the light between the buildings shifts or there's a landmark like a water tower and your brain starts counting the minutes down from that water tower. Your brain is very good at pattern recognition and being able to recognize something even with minimal sensory input.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This is something called confirmation bias. You only pay attention to info that confirms your bias.  </p>
<p>You probably wake up before you get there plenty of times, you just don’t pay attention to them. Then you wake up when your nearly there and think “wow what a coincidence”.  </p>
<p>It’s the same as that old “when you think about someone and they suddenly call you”. How many times do you think about someone and they don’t call you?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
