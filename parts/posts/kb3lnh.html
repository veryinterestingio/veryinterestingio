		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have a bunch of particles in the fog blocking your vision. Let’s say there are particles directly in front of you blocking ten percent of your field of view and they’re evenly distributed as small bits in the air. And then another. And five feet away, there’s some more particles blocking another ten percent of your vision. That’s twenty percent. The farther away you go, the more particles are there getting in between you and what you want to see.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming you mean while driving. It’s because the fog is reflecting light from your headlights back at you, and that light is brighter than the actual landscape/road. So all you see a wall of white reflected light. </p>
<p>Behind you there are no headlights, so the brightest source of light is the dimly lit landscape/road. </p>
<p>This is why fog lights are mounted higher or lower than the normal headlights. The light reflected back from the fog is not as direct.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Visibility in fog is constant, wherever you are relative to it. Let's assume there's fog with 50ft of visibility.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are 500 feet away from the fog, you can see 550 feet before things become fully obfuscated. You therefore can see thru only 50ft of the fog.</li>
<li>If you are 500 feet into the fog, you can see 50ft in all directions. This means there's now able to see 100ft diameter of fog, which is effectively twice as much things to see than while standing outside of the fog.</li>
<li>If you are 40 feet from the edge of the fog looking out, you can effectively see everything outside of it (albeit partially obfuscated), so your visibility is technically infinity.</li>
</ul>
<p>So if you're &quot;looking in&quot;, you're almost guaranteed eventually stop seeing things. But if you are &quot;looking within&quot;, or &quot;looking out&quot;, it feels like you can see more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's like your window blinds.  If you crack them open <em>just a little bit</em>, you can see through them a little bit.  If you get real close to them, you can see a LOT through them (because you are closer to the spaces between them).  But if you walk back 100 feet from them, you can't see through them at all, because you are too far away from the spaces.</p>
<p>Edit: now add a few more blinds in front of the one you are looking through.  More blinds, less chance to see through them all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
