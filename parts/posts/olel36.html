<p>The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) - a planet-scale array of eleven ground-based radio telescopes forged through international collaboration - was designed to capture images of a black hole. Two years ago, EHT researchers successfully unveiled the first direct visual evidence of a supermassive black hole and its shadow. The EHT recently released a new version of the historic image, now shown in polarized light.</p>
<p>As we continue to delve into data from past observations and pave the way for the next-generation EHT, we wanted to answer some of your questions! You might ask us about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Observing with a global telescope array</li>
<li>Black hole theory and simulations</li>
<li>The black hole imaging process</li>
<li>Technology and engineering in astronomy</li>
<li>Recent and upcoming results</li>
<li>International collaboration at the EHT</li>
<li>The next-generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT)</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Panel Members consist of:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What kind of time scale increments are you able to capture around black holes? It's my understanding your initial image was produced by processing months long, simultaneous  observations from multiple telescopes around the world. One gathers this had both the effect of making the &quot;aperture&quot; of your imaging device as wide as the earth, and potentially as wide as the earth's orbit; but it would seem it also had the effect of averaging out observations over a fairly long time scale in your image. Do you anticipate ever being able to image in hours or even minutes level time granularity so the accretion disc dynamics might be studied as it rotates around the black hole?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very cool work! Two part question - where did the idea/theory come from to use an array of radio telescopes from around the world come from? Was it a tried and tested method or was it a new innovation that your team came up with?</p>
<p>Second question - is there any utility in scaling it up for a bigger array? Like radio telescopes on the moon + satellites in orbit? I've seen it referenced as a possibility but would love to hear your take on if it would be useful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
