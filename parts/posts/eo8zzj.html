		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My applicable knowledge of recycling is limited to mainly organic (carbon-containing) materials.</p>
<p>Yes things like glass and most metals can be recycled indefinitely, as their chemical structure is relatively small and stable in extreme conditions. Glass is SiO2, and even at incineration temperatures of 1600Â°C, it's still SiO2. A glassmaker can melt any glass, make it into something, and it still have all the properties of glass.</p>
<p>Plastics don't have that luxury. Different plastics have varying chemical structures. Some are interconnected rings, others are long strings. But ultimately, every time you melt down plastics, you're reducing the polymer's complexity. From organized rings &gt; disorganized rings &gt; long strings &gt; small strings.</p>
<p>As of right now, there's no large scale, economical method to transform lower grade/less complex structurally plastics to higher grade.</p>
<p>EDIT 1-13-20, 22:34</p>
<p>Since this has become the top comment in this thread, I decided to expand upon my response as I'm sitting at a computer now and I'll include summarized talking points that other redditors have commented in this discussion.</p>
<ul>
<li>To answer OP's title, yes and no. A lot of recycling could be improved by simply throwing more money at the problem, but that doesn't buy yachts. There's other issues as well with certain items and their ability to be recycled, but who's to say that a method for recycling those specific items couldn't be invented.</li>
<li>Most non-alloy, non plastic-lined metals can be easily recycled. Plastic lined (soda cans, rattle cans, etc), complicated alloy metals, or niche metal products don't have an efficient or even any infrastructure in place to recycle. A point was raised that oxidation of metals could reduce metal quality as well, but I don't know any metallic chemistry or industrial metallurgy to comment further on the subject.</li>
<li>There are thermoplastics and some other plastics that can be reheated and remade into new products with similar or identical chemical and physical properties.</li>
<li>Incineration of plastics to CO2 and then using that CO2 to synthesize other plastics overall doesn't exist. Some CO2 has been used to create feedstock, some for ethanol, but anything super complex is not feasible. This is purely due to their niche uses and the economics of scale.  Alternatively, burning plastics for fuel does work.</li>
<li>Probably the largest hurdle for plastic recycling as of now is separating the plastic types. A vast majority of recycling bins either just lump everything together and it isn't timely to separate the plastic types. Sometimes, it is cheaper for a disposal company to just trash the recycling bin (but it makes us consumers feel good inside)</li>
<li>For other items like cardboard or particle board, by extracting the plant-part out, you effectively destroy the epoxies and other 'stuff' that makes up the product.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As already noted, things like glass and (most) metals are very amenable to recycling, paper and (especially) plastic less so.</p>
<p>But I think it's important to note that the &quot;simply cheaper&quot; bit in your question often reflects a deeper consideration, like energy use. Depending on how you put a value on land use, pollution, and energy consumption, it can work out to be better for the environment overall to just bury or burn certain types of garbage, rather than putting more energy into trying to recycle it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Recyclable plastics are linear polymer chains: think a bowl of leftover spaghetti noodles with no sauce that you put in the fridge. The pasta will hold its shape and if you try to break it apart, the noodles will tear (which is analogous to solid plastic). But if you warm it up or put some oil (solvent) on the noodles, they'll be able to slide past each other and flow and you can form the pasta into a new shape (recycling).   </p>
<p>Now imagine you took that same cold bowl of spaghetti and zip tied random noodles together. Now, no matter how warm you get it or how much oil you put on it, the noodles won't be able to slide past each other and the glob of noodles will maintain its shape. This is what (some) non-recyclable plastics are like. If you keep heating up the plastic, instead of melting, it will just burn instead. These are called crosslinked polymers, or thermosets (the other type is called thermoplastic). With this type of polymer, the physical object you see is one sometimes giant molecule because everything is chemically linked together. On the other hand, recyclable plastics are made of many (still very large) molecules</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of these answers seem to assume you'd be recycling something into more of the same thing, like making plastic out of plastic.  But anything can be vaporized and separated into it's raw elements, which can be reused for whatever uses those elements have.  That would be recycling.  It's just not economical.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Assuming money was unlimited, we could recycle 90%+ of our consumables.  But we would have to build new storage/processing/logistical facilities, and it's possible that would have a greater negative environmental impact than the trash.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
