		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When chili peppers were brought from the New World they were introduced to India in the late <del>15th</del> 16th century by Portuguese traders. The peppers grew very well in the tropical climate of India and was quickly adopted into their foods. From there the peppers spread to southeast Asia where a similar thing happened.</p>
<p>However, chili peppers don't grow very well in Europe where western cuisine comes from.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spicy plants tend to grow in warmer places. Like southern Asia and Africa. Not so much in Europe and northern Asia (though truth be told not much at all grows well in northern Asia). The same is true in the Americas, so when spicy plants like chilis were imported by European traders and colonizers, they couldn't cultivate new world peppers in Europe, but they thrived in eastern colonies and trading partners.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
