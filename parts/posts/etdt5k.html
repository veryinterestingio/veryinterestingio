<p>So how was it eradicated?  Did they actually manage to find and quarantine every single one of the thousands of people infected?  That doesn't sound plausible.</p>
<p>Why didn't it keep spreading?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quarantine for SARS was highly effective, basically if you were quarantined in the first few days, no one would catch it from you. Also, from what I understand, the public fear was so high that people wore PPE (masks etc.), and took lots of precautions (hand washing etc.) which prevented the virus from spreading easily. Luckily, because it couldn’t spread easily it died out on its own.  Basically a population has to meet a certain threshold of susceptible people for an epidemic. As for why it hasn’t appeared again, who knows. - (sorry if there is a better answer, I’m just a microbio enthusiast)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
