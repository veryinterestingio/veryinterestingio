		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5: The darker skin is the result of more of a pigment called melanin. The melanin helps to absorb sunlight, and heats the body, rather than causing damage to our genes.</p>
<p>ELI20: The darker skin is the result of more of a pigment called melanin. The melanin helps to absorb the UV radiation, and heats the body, rather than causing mutations in our DNA which link thymine together into  pairs called dimers. Our body can either utilize blue light to break apart these thymine dimers in a process call photoreactivation, or the bad portion of code can be clipped out, and a proofreader DNA processor (polymerase) can read the opposite strand of DNA to restore the code in a process called nucleotide excision repair. Sometimes this repair process fails. If too many mutations accumulate, a skin cancer can manifest. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common and is caused by chronic sun exposure. Melanomas are less common, but more deadly, and they are associated with acute sun exposure (like a bad sunburn). White people have evolved to allow more sunlight to penetrate cells, thereby synthesizing enough Vitamin D even in winters at northern latitudes where a black person would not thrive without supplementation.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It absorbs more heat yes, but the melanin that absorbs the rays prevents them from damaging your skin cells causing sunburns and skincancer. You do get warmer, but against heat your body can fight much easier with respiration than against damage to the DNA in your cells.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The problem is not the heat but damage from the ultraviolet light that can break apart molecules and change the DNA. Sunburn is radiation-damaged from UV light that damages cells that can't be fixed so the cell kills themselves in a controlled way.</p>
<p>The dark skin has more melanin in the skin so less UV damages the living skin cells. an important part it that the top skin layer is dead skin cells that will fall off you. the layer of dead skin cells is  25 to 30 cells deep. It is continuously replaced by live cells below that replicate and die in a controlled way to create the top layer.</p>
<p>UV light is needed for vitamin D production and that is why people in areas with less sun exposure have paler skin. You need it to produce enough vitamin D. Low vitamin D levels can be a problem for people with dark skin in areas with less sunlight but today we can compensate for it with vitamin D added to food or in dedicated pills. Vitamin D is very important especially for bone growth and rickets is a disease with softening and weakening of bones in children.</p>
<p>Another thing that UV light destroys is folate also known as vitamin B9 that is very important especially for the development of fetuses.  So high folate levels are very important when you are pregnant and supplementation is advised if you intend to become pregnant.</p>
<p>Skin color is likely in large part a compromise between protecting folate primary when you are pregnant and the production of Vitamine D primary for children. Children tend to be paler than adults likely likly to produce more Vitamine D and get darker later to increase folate levels when it is time to have their own children.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Ultraviolet Light is harshest near the equator, and least harsh near the poles -&gt; skin color changed due to need for Vitamin-D -&gt; Not enough UV = too little Vitamin-D, too much UV = Folates breakdown -&gt; differences in UV exposure = differences in skin color</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dark skin is not the adaptation. Light skin is. When our dark skinned ancestors moved out of Africa, and into climates that were colder, and required them to reduce exposure, the couldn’t generate enough vitamin D in their skin. So the skin got lighter, trading off the protection from sun for more vitamin D (because chronically deficient individuals were less healthy and didn’t win the selection game).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
