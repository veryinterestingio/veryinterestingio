		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! Atmospheric chemistry PhD here. I researched wildfire smoke composition and health effects in graduate school. I'm currently doing postdoctoral research in medicine trying to understand the finer details of air pollution toxicity.</p>
<p>Here's a few quick things about wildfire smoke!</p>
<p><strong>What's in the smoke?</strong></p>
<p>A complex mixture of fine particulate matter and gasses. The composition is very complicated as there are hundreds to thousands of different compounds that transform as the smoke plume moves from the source. You will find NOx, CO, CO2, lots of organic carbon, black carbon/soot, inorganic salts and a smaller but still significant amount of transition metals (iron, copper, zinc, aluminum among others).</p>
<p><strong>How does the smoke impact climate?</strong></p>
<p>The brown and black wildfire particle absorbs incoming solar radiation and increases warming while the smoke is present. However, the magnitude of warming by wildfire smoke is uncertain and researchers are actively researching this and other impacts on the climate system. Furthermore, the wildfire smoke particles may provide a favorable surface for water molecules to condense on, thereby driving cloud formation. See pyrocumulus clouds.</p>
<p><strong>How does the smoke impact health?</strong></p>
<p>Wildfire smoke produces toxic gases and fine particulate matter. In general, long and short term exposure of fine particulate matter has been associated with chronic inflammation, increased heart diseases, lung diseases, cancer, and death rates. Recent estimates suggest that \~80% of air pollution deaths are due to cardiovascular effects. Human and animal studies have consistently shown that particulate matter inhalation produces a pro-inflammatory response.  <strong>Recent epidemiological work has suggested that wildfire smoke is MORE TOXIC than urban air pollution particles.</strong> We still don't know the specific chemicals and biological mechanisms associated with the toxic effects of smoke inhalation.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT, PSA ABOUT RESPIRATORS:</strong> If you are concerned about smoke exposure and are not in immediate threat of fire: Get a respirator that filters fine particulate matter and organic vapors if possible. 3M has some pretty good ones. The white dust masks that strap around your face don't block fine particles and organic gasses from entering your lungs!</p>
<p>Best wishes and hope for the safety of our friends in Australia.</p>
<p>**Minor edits for grammar</p>
<p>**Edited to say long and short term exposure to particulate matter is associated with detrimental health effects, rather than just long term.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the worst.</p>
<p>Of anything the Australian environment could have gone through in 2020, you could not have picked a worse possible thing than giant mega-fires that cover the entire country. Or perversely, a more perfect thing could not have happened that would so rapidly speed up the effects of Climate Change in our region.</p>
<p>Maybe if we were to let all the nuclear material we store underground in The Outback leak out by accident, that would be pretty bad for everyone. But mega-fires are realistically the next-worst Climate Change-related disaster for Australia, and here's why:</p>
<ol>
<li>We have the largest Ozone Layer hole in the world and it will only grow faster now due to the smoke released by the bush-fires. Firstly, the Ozone Layer isn't a thick blanket like those diagrams at school, it's simply thin, high-altitude air filled with Ozone particles. But the Ozone Layer is very sensitive to other non-Ozone particles being up into it. Smoke and soot particles, when thrown up by bush-fires, continue rising via water vapor thanks to the combusted organic materials, in a process called &quot;self-lifting&quot;. Upon reaching the Ozone Layer it immediately displaces most of the Ozone particles in that region. As the soot molecules break down inside the water vapor they release Reactive Hydrogen Oxide molecules called &quot;radicals&quot; that actively destroy Ozone particles. The mega-fires make sure it continues to worsen, eating away at earth's protection from the sun's radiation. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/worst-wildfires-can-send-smoke-high-enough-affect-ozone-layer" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/worst-wildfires-can-send-smoke-high-enough-affect-ozone-layer" target="_blank">https://www.sciencenews.org/article/worst-wildfires-can-send-smoke-high-enough-affect-ozone-layer</a></a></li>
<li>The effect of the smoke in the air blanketing our cities is extreme due to months-long fires. For example, early December it was reported that Sydney had reached the &quot;hazardous&quot; level on the Air Quality Index: 200+. On Wednesday, in Canberra, south of Sydney, it was 5,000. Read that again if you have to. That's the equivalent of smoking an entire 35-pack of cigarettes, and then a few more in a bong with some weed, if you stand outside all day long breathing the air in Canberra. It's been declared a state and national emergency. <a href="https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6562383/air-quality-in-parts-of-canberra-20-times-above-hazardous-level/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6562383/air-quality-in-parts-of-canberra-20-times-above-hazardous-level/" target="_blank">https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6562383/air-quality-in-parts-of-canberra-20-times-above-hazardous-level/</a></a></li>
<li>In terms of general pollution of the planet, it's unfathomable: it's like Australia has a million extra trucks, cars and jet planes suddenly all driving at once, spewing out so much carbon that it has already travelled across the ocean and discoloured the glaciers in New Zealand to an ugly nicotine colour from the smoke. From the kangaroos in Australia to the hobbits in Middle Earth. But the smoke then continues to travel past New Zealand and around the world via high-altitude air currents, and in the global ocean currents, which further damages not only our dying coral reefs, but marine life wherever it ends up. <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/118593619/australia-bushfires-more-smoke-on-its-way-to-new-zealand" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/118593619/australia-bushfires-more-smoke-on-its-way-to-new-zealand" target="_blank">https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/118593619/australia-bushfires-more-smoke-on-its-way-to-new-zealand</a></a></li>
<li>Lastly, the fires have consumed an area larger than both the California wildfires in 2018 and the Amazon wildfires in 2019 combined, which means that much vegetation is no longer producing oxygen now until it regrows. If it regrows. There were bush-fires in early colonial times, but the first drops of rain were reported to bring the immediate regrowth of vegetation in burned land within a few days. But this is 2020, the industrial revolution happened, we learned about the Greenhouse Effect in the 1980's, Global Warming in the 90's, Climate Change in the 2000s... and then we heard about Climate Change all though the 2010s.... still did basically nothing... and now Australia is completely cooked. So if our drought and high temperatures continue, which is a mathematical certainty, the burned areas may not regrow. It's currently raining in Victoria today, and the fires have showed little signs of slowing.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is Australia's climate tipping point. We may have a year-round &quot;fire season&quot;. This might be the new normal.</p>
<p>If you still don't believe me, watch Chris Hayes explain it with a Google Earth map:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_b2Hh8g7Xi0" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_b2Hh8g7Xi0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_b2Hh8g7Xi0</a></a> </p>
<p>You can donate today to help the relief efforts, but also as a show of support for Climate Change policy to our leaders who don't think anyone cares: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/donate/1010958179269977/?fundraiser_source=external_url" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/donate/1010958179269977/?fundraiser\_source=external\_url" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/donate/1010958179269977/?fundraiser\_source=external\_url</a></a></p>
<p>Or else we may have to change its name from The OUT-BACK to The OUT-BLACK... and not for the old racist joke reason.</p>

<p>Update: Thanks for the gold and silver! I'll try to pay it forward :)</p>
<p>Update 2: I live in Carlton, an inner-city suburb of Melbourne, Australia. The wind must have just changed directions because all of a sudden it smells like all my neighbours lit their fireplaces at the same time. We can't help but think of Climate Change all the time now. I think that's what drove me to write this comment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
