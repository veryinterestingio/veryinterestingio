		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the cancer's ability to metastasize. One can live for many years with small carcinomas in thyroid nodules that don't really do anything much, for example. And many people are diagnosed with latent cancer on pathology after they have died of something else.</p>
<p>If you get to the point where you are diagnosed, though, treat your cancer or it will probably kill you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I work on neuroblastoma which occurs in babies and young children because something goes wrong during the development of the nervous system. In very young cases with early stage, low risk neuroblastoma they will actually opt for no treatment  because it could do more bad than letting the body 'heal itself'.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You develop and defeat cancers in your body all of the time. </p>
<p>Cancers are basically just cells that have acquired DNA damage that changes their behaviour significantly. Our cells aggressively attempt to repair DNA damage and are successful the vast, vast majority of the time. Importantly, the source of the damage (em radiation, hard radiation, type of chemical, etc) significantly impacts the kind of damage received and your body's likely success with repairs.</p>
<p>What we tend generally to think of as cancers are things that our immune systems have failed to rectify and that have acquired enough additional mutations that they can grow or spread (or both) rapidly. You find a mass, a lump, or a series of masses and lumps. This is what we treat with radiation, surgery, chemotherapy.</p>
<p>This isn't always accurate - I myself have a non-hodgkin's cutaneous t-cell lymphoma that is indolent (slow acting) and requires regular, ongoing suppression of my immune system. I've even had tandem stem cell transplants that failed to solve the underlying problem.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been living with a very benign form of &quot;cancer&quot; for over 20 years. The more you read about cancer, the more you realize that the word means different things to different people. When I talk about my condition, I hardly ever use the word &quot;cancer&quot; because when I do, people start to pity me. It's odd and embarrassing because I know that it's not at the point of causing me any inconveniences in my daily life vis-a-vis someone who has a more serious metabolic disease such as prostate cancer or a malignant tumour. </p>
<p>Instead, I tend to use &quot;metabolic condition&quot; as it's more accurate and less pitiful. In the end, all cancers are different forms of your body not being able to destroy and eliminate cells that are malfunctioning. Curing or treating it comes down to finding out the form of the metabolic disease and the DNA of the person. </p>
<p>There are some very promising treatments coming out now that prescribe drugs based on the dna of the disease and the dna of the patient. The reasons these drugs work are as varied as the forms of cancer out there, meaning to say: a lot. </p>
<p>I am neither a doctor nor a researcher nor a scientist so I am only speaking from my own understanding of this topic after researching whenever I feel curious.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone has to die from something. This question can be thought of as &quot;are there cancers which have a lower risk of mortality than old age?&quot; because if you die <em>with</em> cancer, then you haven't died <em>from</em> cancer. And there are! Prostate cancer is now often left untreated because by the time they're old enough to get it, prostate owners are often more likely to die of other natural causes than they are of prostate cancer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
