<p>Being in a cult is circular thinking that doesn't benefit the individual once they leave, CBT would provide the introspection needed to challenge these beliefs in ways that may help them be replaced by more beneficial thoughts</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The first step there honestly is to find a way to get them out of the echo chamber, and this is similar to the first step of cult deprogramming; it is anecdotal but there have been accounts of certain adult children blocking certain social media sites and certain news networks from their parents' computers and TVs that has done a lot to deprogram them on that front.</p>
<p>This has also anecdotally worked with some actual cults without much more in the way of intervention; somewhat notably, a good chunk of the youngest generation of the Westboro Baptist Church ended up turning away from their family (who, in many ways, operated like a cult) once they spent time in college around the people they were told their whole lives were evil.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's very hard and needs individual treatment based on the person AND the way they got indoctrinated. There is no universal cure for brainwashing and often nothing helps. The first step must usually be done by the cult member, as you can't change anyones views if they don't cooperate.</p>
<p>Usually you try to slowly approach the more vulnerable spots in their belief system. That can for example be the credibility of a cult leader.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Careful, read up this subject - both the idea of &quot;programming&quot; or &quot;brainwashing&quot; and &quot;deprogramming&quot; are not exactly uncontroversial these days (as is the idea of &quot;cults&quot;), and &quot;deprogramming&quot; very often came with kidnapping and related rather problematic &quot;rescue efforts&quot;. </p>
<p>There are tons of articles and books and research out there about people being stuck in echo chambers and how to communicate with them, and they tend to get by without references to what amounts to a pretty nasty case of moral panic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
