		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ear drops meant to help break up earwax buildup don't actually do any cleaning, per se. Rather, the drops you put in your ears act as a softener/lubricant, and help facilitate your ear's natural process of wax expulsion.</p>
<p>In other words; The drops don't pick up the earwax and carry it away, they just break it into smaller, softer pieces, and help clear a path.</p>
<p>I just wanted to add this little edit, since my comment got a lot of traction, and point some things out. </p>
<p>First, I am not a doctor or professional in any way, just someone who's dealt with ear problems for several years, and has had to use drops before. Any knowledge or advice I have is anecdotal, although I have done a lot of reading on the subject, in my attempts to find remedies for myself.</p>
<p>Secondly, and probably most importantly, if anyone is experiencing sudden changes in their ears, particularly involving pain, soreness, or loss of hearing, your smartest choice will always be to consult a doctor. Most likely they'll start you off with some softening drops like those discussed in the post here.</p>
<p>There's been a lot of great information in this post, and I really hope the people looking for remedies find something that works for them! Just remember to be safe about it, by avoiding extreme remedies, including q-tips and those scary metal ear scoops on amazon. It's not worth puncturing an eardrum, folks.</p>
<p>In a second, much later edit; I learned a thing or two, thanks to all the responses I've gotten. I had misused the phrase 'per se,' which I've now corrected.(Thanks, u/EightyMercury!) Turns out I had a completely wrong understanding of the meaning of the phrase. I was also asked to include ear candles in the list of things to avoid, which I completely agree with. Watch out for those snake-oil salesmen.</p>
<p>I've been incredibly sick for the last few days, but you've all made today so much easier to cope with by flooding me with conversation. Thanks everyone, I can't overstate how much I've appreciated the back and forth in this thread. Sorry if I left anybody out trying to respond. It's been a long day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most over-the-counter stuff has the active ingredient Carbamide Peroxide. All it does is soften the earwax so it can drain out naturally. Put some drops in, keep your head tilted to let the droplets react with the wax, and then it'll drain a dark red/brown color.</p>
<p>Side note: DOCTORS ADVISE YOU TO NOT USE Q-TIPS.
I compacted my earwax so much it dampened my hearing. Doctor made me use the drops for a few days and then stuck a little vacuum in my ear and literally pulled out a black raisin / nugget. It was so <del>fascinating</del> gross.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interesting genetic info from 23 and Me regarding Wet and Dry earwax types.....</p>
<p>Why do we have earwax anyway?</p>
<p>It may seem counterintuitive, but earwax helps your ears stay clean. It traps dirt and bacteria and slowly moves it up and out of the ear canal. Not only that, earwax also contains at least 10 compounds that help it prevent bacteria from growing inside your ear in the first place.</p>
<p>How your genes determine earwax type</p>
<p>Wet earwax is dark-colored and sticky, while dry earwax is light-colored and flaky. Both types are equally good at keeping dirt and bacteria at bay, but the difference between the two is determined by a single variant in the ABCC11 gene. The ABCC11 gene contains instructions for a protein that specializes in moving fat into, and out of, your cells. People who have 1 or 2 copies of the C variant in the ABCC11 gene have more fat in their earwax, making it dark-colored and sticky. People who have two copies of the T variant have less fat in their earwax, making it dry, light-colored, and flaky</p>
<p>What your earwax says about your armpits</p>
<p>The same ABCC11 gene is involved in sweat production and body odor. Having more fat molecules in a personâ€™s sweat is linked to more body odor. So the same genetic variant in the ABCC11 gene that determines the dry earwax type is also linked to lower levels of body odor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
