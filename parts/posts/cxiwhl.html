		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Demand for fancier phones with bigger screens and better cameras = higher cost, more people willing to pay for them.</p>
<p>That being said, this is only true if you're comparing very specific subsets of price ranges. Laptops are still notably more expensive. Unless you're say, comparing a middle of the road phone to a low end laptop which isn't really a fair comparison.</p>
<p>Looking at only big namebrands here to remove extreme outliers.</p>
<p>A low-end smartphone (Samsung Galaxy A10) might be $120. A low-end laptop (Asus Chromebook C523) might be $240.</p>
<p>A top-end smartphone (iPhone XS Max) might be $1500. A top-end laptop might be anywhere from $2500 for a more general purpose high-performer (High end macbook pro) or $3200+ for a high-end gaming laptop with a high-end display (ASUS ROG Zephyrus S GX701)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A smartphone is a handheld computer that does most of the computing you need at any given moment of the day, occasionally you can use it to make phone calls.  A laptop is a more powerful computer, usually, that allows you to do the stuff you can't do with the smartphone.  You pay what you pay for a smartphone for the convenience and you pay what you do for a laptop for what it offers.</p>
<p>I like having a computer that can also make phone calls in my pocket throughout the day, having a laptop for school/work, and having a desktop setup for everything else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
