		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You could compare the efficacy number, but it's important to know <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/vaccine-efficacy-effectiveness-and-protection" target="_blank">what it means</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A vaccine’s efficacy is measured in a controlled clinical trial and is based on how many people who got vaccinated developed the ‘outcome of interest’ (usually disease) compared with how many people who got the placebo (dummy vaccine) developed the same outcome.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because of this, the time of the trial and the variants around at the time have effect on the efficacy rate. The population and the healthy infrastructure available to the test group as well. Redoing the trials of the Moderna-vaccine today would yield different results.</p>
<p>It also doesn't mean the chance of death is reduced by this number - in the trials there is about 0% chance of dying from Covid after having the vaccine, even the vaccines with lower efficacy numbers. What is prevented is becoming measurably sick.</p>
<p>Pfizer's vaccine shows efficacy of 95%, Moderna 94.1%, Novavax 90%, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00234-8/fulltext" target="_blank">Sputnik 91.6%</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/cuba-says-abdala-vaccine-9228-effective-against-coronavirus-2021-06-21/" target="_blank">Abdala 92.28%</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soberana_02" target="_blank">Soberana 02+Plus  91.2%</a>, <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2021/03/420071/how-effective-johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-heres-what-you-should-know" target="_blank">J&amp;J 66%</a>, <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-oxford-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank">Astrazenica 63.09%</a>.</p>
<p>Note: J&amp;J only requires one dose, so it's not that bad. Astrazenica's number is a bit controversial - they claimed a higher number earlier but it was rebuked. Now the number is quite low but it would be higher by waiting longer between shots, like most countries do.</p>
<p>The Cuban studies still need to be published, and their vaccines require 3 shots to reach those numbers. But despite being a poor country Cuba has excellent bioscience and a good record when it comes to developing vaccines, so there is not really a reason to doubt the numbers at this point. The Sputnik vaccine is really comparable to the vaccines you may be familiar with.</p>
<p>tl;dr: you can compare efficacy but really all vaccines are awesome for preventing serious damage or death</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>But it's definitely everything other than trivial to compare the efficiency of the different vaccines. You have to include the different study conditions such as dominant virus mutations at the time etc</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good question! </p>
<p>The Russians didn't really publish any reliable/verifiable numbers or supply \~80% of the documentation needed for approval of the vaccine in the EU. And the numbers they did publish (e.g. in that study in Lancet) were done with a vaccine that was significantly different from what was being delivered as Sputnik-V (there are multiple versions of it, even a single dose one!). </p>
<p>So at least in the Sputnik case it is anyone's guess what the real numbers are and for which version/batch of the vaccine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
