		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We do get hurricanes, but they are farther south. If you are in Southern California, a lot of the tropical weather we get here in the late summer/early fall is the &quot;left overs&quot; of the hurricanes that peter out over land in Baja or the colder northern waters off the Californian coast. </p>
<p>Hurricanes get their energy from warm waters. The reasons why hurricanes can reach so far North on the East Coast has to do the with the direction the oceanic currents run. </p>
<p>As a (huge) generalization, the Northern hemispheric currents run clockwise due to the Coriolis force/effect due to Earth's Rotation. This means that warm water from the equator will run north on the &quot;west side&quot; of an ocean and south on the &quot;east side&quot; of the ocean. Ex: In the Pacific, the warm water currents run north from the equator up to Japan and the Korean penninsula up into the artic, where it cools down, then runs south passed Alaska and down the West Coast of the US where it then mixes with the warmer southern waters off the cost of Southern California and the Baja Peninsula. </p>
<p>This is why you hear about typhoons hitting the SEA area and Japan which mimics the hurricanes that hit the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and the East Coast. </p>
<p>In short, hurricanes and typhoons thrive on warm water. Warm water is near the equator, and currents run clockwise patterns. This means that you will have more warm water on the &quot;left side&quot; of an ocean and colder water from the Arctic on the &quot;right side&quot; of an ocean. This is opposite in the Southern Hemisphere due to the Coriolis force switching directions(Currents run counter clockwise). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/ClarkeOrbital's response is wrong. The main reason we don't get hurricanes on the West Coast is because the large-scale <em>winds</em> that move hurricanes around go counter-clockwise and so push tropical storms towards Asia in the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>The small gradient in sea surface temperatures between the west and east pacific is only a small secondary effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The water is too cold. I can’t remember the temps required to generate the energy required for a hurricane, but practically all of California and well down the Baja peninsula  the water is too cold. </p>
<p>As stated, California gets the remnants of tropical storms but it’s not common. </p>
<p>There was a tropical storm that hit Long Beach/LA in the late 1930s, as well of very scant evidence recently discovered in newspapers about a possible hurricane that hit San Diego in the 1850s or 60s when the population of SD county was about 4000 ppl. Given the time of year, descriptions of the wind directions it’s entirely probable that a hurricane or tropical storm hit the area. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
