		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is very much depending on the reason why the patient is unconscious.
E.g. a patient receiving cpr can be intubated without further sedation. If consciousness is returning you usually dose the drugs based on the vitals and the person's response. </p>
<p>Someone who is unresponsive because of a drug overdose but still has circulation will almost always receive a smaller dose of drugs before intubation.
So it really is a judgement call and very much depending on the situation. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anesthesia has a buttload of different drugs that do different things, for example:</p>
<p>- Amnesia (prevents you from forming memories of what is happening)</p>
<p>- Sedation (knocks you out)</p>
<p>- Pain (importantly, this is not the same as sedation; just because you are unconscious doesn't mean your body doesn't perceive pain, so you can still get responses like a racing heart beat and elevated blood pressure from things that hurt)</p>
<p>- Paralysis (prevents your muscles from being able to fire, so that you can't do things like twitch in response to pain or use your own breathing muscles.  Paralysis can be very important for getting a patient to hold still, even if they are sedated; it is also important for patients on a breathing machine, because sometimes you need them to let the breathing machine take over and do all the work rather than the patient's own breathing muscles)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The anesthesiologist chooses the correct drugs (and doses!) as needed for each patient depending on the properties desired, while also being mindful of the side effects of each drug.  For example, ketamine provides some pain control, sedation, and amnesia, but does nothing for paralysis, which would be ideal if you want someone to be able to continue breathing on their own (useful if you are, for example, needing to set and cast a broken arm.)  Fentanyl provides great pain control, but only some sedation, and not much amnesia or paralysis.  Benzodiazepines provide amnesia and mild sedation, but no pain control or paralysis.  There are more intricacies of these things, but you get the idea.  If someone is comatose, you may want to choose something that gets you pain control and amnesia without having to worry about sedation, since drugs that cause sedation can have undesired side effects like lowering blood pressure or heart rates too much..</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anaesthesiology resident here. It depends on what illness(es) the patient has and why they need the surgery.</p>
<p>If someone is already comatose and has some illness or injury bad enough to need an emergency operation, chances are their other vital functions (eg heart, respiratory system, kidneys) are already significantly compromised. When someone is not breathing normally, CO2 tends to build up in the body, leading to an acidosis which denatures many body proteins and enzymes, leading to a generalised downward spiral. On top of that, almost all anaesthetic agents have intrinsic negative effects on blood pressure and heart contractility. So we tend to modify doses heavily, or use alternative drugs like ketamine which actually boost the cardiovascular system. These patients often need invasive blood pressure support and monitoring during surgery and afterwards.</p>
<p>Patients who are comatose are at a high risk of vomiting and aspirating material into their lungs, which can cause major inflammatory reactions, makes it difficult to breath for them, and can lead to life-threatening pneumonia - so we use a special technique known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_sequence_induction" target="_blank">rapid sequence intubation</a> to minimise the chances of this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As other posts have said, there can be such a variety of reasons for why a patient is unconscious that it really depends on those reasons as to how you would manage them. However, I think I can get at some of the question you implied here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>or is it too dangerous if the patient is already unresponsive?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think what you're asking is if you have someone with a level of unconsciousness, and we give drugs that add further unconsciousness, does this result in a dangerously high level of unconsciousness. If we look at what happens to the brain in isolation, the answer is not really. Back when it took many minutes to induce anaesthesia, 4 stages of anaesthesia were identified, 1 being the lightest and 4 being the heaviest. Stage 3 is ideal for surgery: there is no response to surgical stimulus, yet the patient can still regulate their own breathing, heart rate and blood pressure. Stage 4 is when you've overcooked it, the patient is apnoeic (not breathing) and  their blood pressure and cardiac output can collapse. Anaesthetists can ventilate the patient, and give other drugs that maintain their cardiovascular system to avert imminent death from this, but if you bathe anyone's brain in enough of an anaesthetic for long enough, harm and later death will occur.</p>
<p>So the risk is from the amount of anaesthetic drug itself, not from a sum total of different sources of unconsciousness. You might think that as long as we can take over the brain's jobs by controlling your heart, lungs and blood vessels that we you are safe as long as we don't give you a toxic dose of anaesthetic. This is kinda true. However, nothing is never that simple. Every anaesthetic agent to some extent affects the tone of your blood vessel walls, and your cardiac output. Also, as we said, if we have a drug that acts on the brain, then the way your brain controls the lungs and heart changes too.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is why it matters so much why the patient is unconscious. If they are unconscious because they are in profound shock (maybe they have lost a lot of blood, their blood vessels are leaky such as in anaphylaxis, or their heart is failing to pump sufficient blood), then if I give the same anaesthetic that I'd give to them when they are well I'd quite possibly kill them - not because I've made them too unconscious, but because the anaesthetic agent has precipitated a complete collapse in their cardiovascular system. In these patients I would be so cautious about how much and what I give, that the risk of them having some residual awareness is a risk worth taking to keep them alive. Most anaesthetists give drugs so that just in case they are transiently aware, they are incapable of converting this awareness into new memories.</p>
<p>Alternatively, let's say we need to intubate a patient with epileptic seizures we can't control. The patient is completely unconscious during the seizures, to the point where food and secretions from the stomach are regurgitating and entering their lungs. Although they are just as unconscious as the bleeding patient mentioned above, a decent dose of anaesthetic is often helpful for them, as most agents are anti-epileptic. Although I would expect their physiology to drop (dropping their blood pressure is completely expected in general anaesthesia), I wouldn't expect this change to be anything to worry about, at least nothing that can't be addressed with other management. It certainly wouldn't be a hazard to their life as it would be in the above patient.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Tl;DR You can't be too unconscious, but you can be too anaesthetised. Anaesthesia affects your entire physiology, and your physiology before induction determines the strategy for how we anaesthetise you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mom is anesthetist. They are a walking talking encyclopedia of medicine. They know what type of medicine does what, how it chemically reacts with others in the body, how to cancel it - etc. They are really the ones to talk to if you're on multiple medications - they will tell you exactly how one can interact with the other.</p>
<p>From my understanding - they work with body mass / male, female / red headed, not redheaded (true thing!).<br />
They have to be fast on their feet, and react very quickly. They have a very crucial role.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
