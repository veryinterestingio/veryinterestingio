		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably not. Consider that vitamin D3 comes from 7-dehydrocholesterol. The sun turns 7-dehydrocholesterol into vitamin D3, but 7-dehydrocholesterol is also converted into cholesterol. All cells must produce cholesterol, as it is an integral part of the cell membrane. Any feedback regulation that would inhibit 7-dehydrocholesterol would also inhibit cholesterol formation in the cell.</p>
<p>However, vitamin D3 is not the active form of vitamin D. There are two more hydroxylation steps, one in the liver and one predominantly in the kidneys. The active form activates an enzyme that deactivates the active form molecule, essentially creating a negative feedback loop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vitamin D you can find in the supplements is the same substance that is produced in our skin. But this form isn't biologically active - it undergoes further chemical reactions and is transformed into 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in kidneys which is the one responsible for all the vitamin D effects on the body. The 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D also controls how much of the active form is being produced (it controls its very own quantity, if there is enough then no more 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin can be produced). So the chain of reactions isn't stopped at the moment of producing vitamin D in our skin - it is inhibited in kidneys where 25-hydroxyvitamin D is transformed into the active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. If there is enough 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D then the excess of 25-hydroxyvitamin D is transformed into an inactive end product: 1,24-dihydrohyvitamin D. Therefore no, vitamin D would still be produced in your body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
