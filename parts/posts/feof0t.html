		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All metals are recyclable, and contrary to popular belief, most metals <em>do</em> actually get recycled. Even low-alloy steels and cast iron can be remelted and either used directly or blended as necessary with virgin stock to dilute impurities. High-alloy steels like tool steels, high-speed steels, and stainless steels are more valuable, so they get recycled separately. Other base metals like copper, zinc, and lead are even more widely recycled. Their main applications leave them relatively unsullied at the end of life, making it easier to separate them for recycling. Needless to say, more exotic metals like platinum group metals and refractory metals are completely recycled.</p>
<p>In general, the more expensive a metal is, the greater the lengths people will go to in order to recover it. Iron is pretty much the only metal so cheap that recycling is often not economical. Aluminium cans just happen to be the most visible example of metal recycling for the average consumer; other metal recycling happens behind the scenes at scrapyards and electronic waste processing facilities.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All metals are recyclable.  Aluminum is the easiest to reuse as its low melting point offsets the original production cost.  I can tell you that recycled aluminum isn't like virgin aluminum as the process cant control alloy content.  I make aluminum cans for a living and we cannot use recycled plate tor the process it must be virgin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others (e.g. ccdy) have said, other base metals are recycled.</p>
<p>They may be recycled in a not-so-obvious format, for example, lead in lead-acid (e.g. automotive starter) batteries is recycled via the core charge+refund that encourages people to return old batteries for recycling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you’re from the U.S. and wonder why aluminum cans for sodas and beers have a deposit in many states recoverable upon return to a recycling center, while other things like tin cans do not, it has to do with litter.</p>
<p>Up until the 70s, there were no bottle deposits as they were known later. People would litter everywhere and because glass bottles were used so prevalently, people would cut themselves on broken glass in their bare feet.</p>
<p>The solution was to give people a financial incentive to clean up after themselves. It worked fabulously!</p>
<p>So the reason that other kinds of containers like tin cans don’t have a deposit is that they aren’t a problem when it comes to litter.</p>
<p>If this wasn’t what your question was about, well, I hope it demonstrates that programs like financially incentivizing good behavior work!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
