		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello. </p>
<p>I was wondering if deep water currents are affected by the coriolis effect. I have read about Ekman transport and how the coriolis effect plays a role in surface currents, but I was wondering if a similar process could occur in deep water currents? When I look at a map of the ocean currents, all I see for deep water currents is a relatively straight path from the Northern hemisphere to the Southern hemisphere, and then around Antarctica and up into the Pacific. I know they are density-driven, but shouldn't they deflect a little due to the coriolis effect as they move?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes absolutely. My PhD dissertation is studying exactly this effect. While the structure of the surface Ekman layer is determined by friction by atmospheric winds, the structure of the bottom layer is determined by a combination of bottom drag (the fact that the velocity has to go to zero at the boundary with solid earth) and turbulent mixing. Those maps you see of deep ocean currents are just cartoons depicting the flow we determine must exist to give the observed tracer distributions in the ocean - they do not represent what the flows actually look like. Ask me again in 2 years and I'll tell you more but the Ekman layers at the bottom are really important for shaping the deep ocean currents!</p>
<p>A first attempt at determined the effect of Earth's rotation on deep ocean currents is Henry Stommel's classic paper on the &quot;Abyssal Circulation&quot; from 1958, which predicted deep ocean currents that look like this <a href="http://slideplayer.com/slide/10047809/32/images/57/Schematic+Abyssal+Circulation.jpg" target="_blank">http://slideplayer.com/slide/10047809/32/images/57/Schematic+Abyssal+Circulation.jpg</a>, where the interior flows are all there due to rotation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>background -- I'm old, okay?  I did a career at NOAA, on the ocean side, and in fact I wrote some software one time for a small unmanned deep water data collection device.</p>
<p>simplistically, we know more about the surface of Mars than we know about the deep water and the bottom of the ocean.  It is incredibly difficult and expensive to get data down there because photography and radar don't work, especially things like long distance photography and telescopes and different colors and frequencies.</p>
<p>I'm sure its a lot better today because we have more (and cheaper!) remote sensors with tinier circuits and sensors and batteries and data storage, than can be self-powered and can return to the surface after longer periods of submersion.  but its still horribly worse than the weather or the land or anywhere else scientists are interested in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From an absolutely intuitive standpoint: yes.</p>
<p>The Coriolis effect is the result of earth’s rotation on “unaffected” (un attached) objects. </p>
<p>Since the depth of the oceans are dwarfed in comparison to its diameter, the resulting change in rotation the water would experience is negligent, therefor the deep ocean currents undergo the exact same effects from rotation as surface currents. </p>
<p>All I have is a bachelors in geophysics and don’t even work in that field, but I hope this helps. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
