		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We absolutely do. The big one everybody talks about is 1918. That was a regular old flu that swept around the globe, in multiple waves, and behaved very much like Covid is today. </p>
<p>Some make the point that 1918, or around that time (end of WW1), was when truly global commerce became commonplace. Sure we had trade ships crossing the oceans for hundreds of years before that, but not in the volumes, frequency, and speed necessary to transmit pandemics worldwide in a matter of weeks. </p>
<p>The advent of air travel starting in the 50s-70s supercharged that even more. So it's not surprising that the next worst flu pandemics happened in 57, 68, and 77.</p>
<p>Since then there haven't been as many, or as severe of an outbreak. Most scientists believe this is because of the prevalence of the flu shot, and people being casually exposed to so many different variants so regularly due to global travel and trade. Before globalization, it was relatively easy for a flu strain to hide out in some isolated place for decades, or even centuries, never reaching the tipping point for global transmission. Once the door was opened we saw many of them go all around in quick succession during the 20th century. But now that everybody has essentially been exposed and built up some immunity, people with susceptible genomes have been thinned from the population, and many vaccinated against these diseases, their ability to trigger pandemics is much lower than it was 100 years ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We do. The flu has been around so long though that most of us acquire immunity from our mothers to specific strains and have partial immunity from that to help fight against other variants. There are now many, many strains of the flu, some more dangerous than others. An example; </p>
<p>&quot;The 1918 influenza pandemic was the most severe pandemic in recent history. It was caused by an H1N1 virus with genes of avian origin. Although there is not universal consensus regarding where the virus originated, it spread worldwide during 1918-1919.  In the United States, it was first identified in military personnel in spring 1918. It is estimated that about 500 million people or one-third of the world’s population became infected with this virus. The number of deaths was estimated to be at least 50 million worldwide with about 675,000 occurring in the United States.&quot;</p>

<p>Many strains are fairly weak against an immune system that even has partial immunity, but when one pops up and has everything just right it can do some serious damage. Even today, although not as common, people can be hospitalized and/or die from the flu</p>
<p>Edit: honestly what I found most shocking about that is how much the world population has increased in 100 years...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>More deadly variations do emerge - think of the scares over bird flu and swine flu in the past ten years or so. But a mutation being deadly is not necessarily beneficial to the pathogen; in fact it is quite often the opposite. For a respiratory disease like the flu, killing the host quicker means less time the host is walking around infecting other people. The flu is constantly mutating, which is why new flu shots are needed yearly, which are designed to predict the most common variants for that flu season. Some variants may be more dangerous, but there is no selection pressure which would mean they become dominant as opposed to any other strain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We do. Have you ever thought about why you get a vaccine for the same disease every year? It’s because the strains are mutating. Not to mention the increasing resistance to antibiotics most bacterial infections are developing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The flu does mutate, commonly: the annual flu shot we're encouraged to take generally covers several of the variants that are predicted to spread for that winter season. The flu is still the flu, though, and for the same reason a jumping spider can't just 'mutate' into a black widow after a few generations, the flu can't really just mutate into a totally different virus that is immediately going to kill you in novel ways.</p>
<p>What we do see, however, is the increased, uncontrolled spread of influenza in animals and livestock populations leading to the most drastic and potentially dangerous variants, like swine and bird flu.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind influenza is technically already deadly and kills approximately half a million people each year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
