		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Percussion typically doesn't have a fundamental frequency. They occupy a large range of frequencies on a curve rather than the typical melodic instrument which has a fundamental frequency and a quieter set of overtones which give the instrument its timber.</p>
<p>If you run a note from an instrument through a frequency analyzer you'll typically see spikes of the note's frequency then subsequent spikes at integer multiples of the base frequency. You might also see other minor spikes from different parts of the instrument contributing to the timber as well.</p>
<p>If you run something like a bass drum through a frequency analyzer you'll see more of a flatter curve shape with emphasis around the intended range of frequencies and then falling off on either side of it. It's technically considered noise because you can't distinguish a particular pitch.</p>
<p>If you look at older video game systems, their sound chips sometimes used to include a dedicated white noise channel specifically for percussion. The Texas Instruments SN76489 used on the Master System/Game Gear for example has three tone channels and a noise channel. The 2A03 used on the NES also had a noise channel along with its two square wave and one triangle wave channels.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most drummers do tune their drums. They usually tune them in a pattern of intervals. Sometimes it matches the key(s) they'll be playing in, other times it's just to be in tune with itself.
Marching percussion is especially anal about tuning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some drums actually do fall out of tune - snares espicially. It's a very slow process and only needs to happen once in a while, but it does happen. </p>
<p>Cymbals also fall out of tune, but are much more difficult to fix. It's a piece of curved metal - not really something you can delicately tune. But it will warp over time thanks to the elements and simply from being used.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Drums are in fact tuned to specific pitches, but as a listener you'd not notice until you bumped into a band with really poorly tuned drums. You might recall some live bands you've seen play where the drums sounded bad, and not realised at the time it was partly because they're out of tune.</p>
<p>My old drummer used to obsessively tune his drums. One think I did learn (I'm not an expert) is that standard kit drum tuning matches standard guitar tuning - and that drum shells are designed to be tuned to certain pitches. When a band plays guitars and bass tuned down to D or C or lower, the drums should all be tuned down to match.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Drums do fall out of tune after a while and can be tightened to get them back in tune. Cymbals do too, as they get bent slightly, but they usually have to be sent off to get them specially tuned again. </p>
<p>The reason they don’t sound “out of tune” with the rest of the band when they change key is that a properly tightened snare drum only plays one note, no matter where or how you hit it. They’re usually tuned within a half step of some note, A flat to B for a 5 inch snare, all of them tuned to the exact same pitch, and will almost definitely be within a half step of a note in the key. An extremely refined ear might notice if the drums are a little out of tune with the rest of the band, but drums and their tones sound so different from woodwinds or strings that most people can’t tell more about them than whether they’re making noise or not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
