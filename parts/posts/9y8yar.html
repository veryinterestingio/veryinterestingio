		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thing about antidepressants is that they don't directly oppose depression, but they do enable a state that can allow individuals a way out of their depression, so to speak. Like others have stated, antidepressants are a wide class of drugs ranging from SSRIs to tricyclics to MAOIs.</p>
<p>Some of these drugs have potentially severe side effects and some are quite safe even in overdose. Dosage is the biggest determining factor in the effect of a drug right after its actual binding affinities. There are no cut and dry answers here.</p>
<p>The most commonly prescribed type of antidepressant is the SSRI. This class of drugs works primarily by binding to the serotonin transporter and preventing reuptake. This results in greater availability of serotonin and consequently higher rates of serotonin binding to receptors.</p>
<p>Serotonin has a very complex function in the human body. There are several different types of serotonin receptors all with different roles and distribution in the brain/body.</p>
<p>High doses (see overdose) and you end up with symptoms of what's called serotonin syndrome. These include: agitation, confusion, hyperthermia, and muscle rigidity. </p>
<p>Low doses and you may not feel much different at all. A slightly higher dose and you're likely to feel slightly blunted emotions or perhaps some amount of sexual dysfunction or nausea.</p>
<p>Drugs are complicated and so is the body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the person has bipolar disorder as opposed to unipolar depression and is in a manic state, most anti-depressants will likely worsen the manic state. (1) Different medications may effect the person differently. For example, wellbutrin may cause the patient to sleep even less than in an unmedicated manic state. This might suggest that they could induce a manic or hypo-manic state in someone who had no symptoms whatsoever (for example, a malingerer). The use of anti-depressants in children and young adults until the brain finishes development at around age 25 may actually cause suicidal tendencies, regardless of whether or not the child/young adult has depression. (2) For people with serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, the use of anti-depressants in addition to anti-psychotics is probably relatively safe. (3)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can't even tell what the effect of an anti-depressant would have on an individual depressed person. Some people take a drug and see an incredible turn around in their mental health. Others take the exact same drug, same exact position and problem in life, and it makes them suicidal and lactate milk from male breasts. </p>
<p>But the reality of anti-depressants is their mechanism is not well known. For example, SSRIs block reuptake of serotonin, increasing the amount of the neurotransmitter in the body and brain, and thus improving mood. Simple then right? Serotonin controls mood. You increase serotonin, mood improves!</p>
<p>Except, SSRIS take upto 6 weeks before a patient might feel better. And yet...an increase in serotonin is registered almost immediately. If it was just the serotonin, they would instantly feel better.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29446012" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29446012" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29446012</a></a> this study says that non-depressed people see no change in cognitive functioning, whereas depressed people do. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.afr.com/lifestyle/health/mens-health/what-antidepressants-can-do-to-a-brain-that-is-not-depressed-20150907-gjh8mb" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.afr.com/lifestyle/health/mens-health/what-antidepressants-can-do-to-a-brain-that-is-not-depressed-20150907-gjh8mb" target="_blank">https://www.afr.com/lifestyle/health/mens-health/what-antidepressants-can-do-to-a-brain-that-is-not-depressed-20150907-gjh8mb</a></a> this study on primates suggests negative effects of anti-depressants in non-depressed primate brains, causing permanent (as much as anything is permanent in the brain) changes in structure. </p>
<p>In reality though, the effect is minimal. We know this, because hundreds of millions of prescriptions for anti-depressants have been given out since they arrived. If not billions. If even 1% of those were the wrong diagnosis, that's millions taking them. If millions of people do something for 25 years, you will have evidence if the effects are devastating. </p>
<p>Still, I wouldn't do it. It likely has a subtle effect that is hard to measure. Speaking from personal experience, the chemical composition in your brain has a huge effect on you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
