		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Historically, anything west of the Appalachian mountains was considered the &quot;West&quot; in the early US. If you've ever heard the phrase, &quot;Go west, young man,&quot; the &quot;west&quot; that is spoken of is actually Chicago, which was a booming town of great opportunity at the time. As the settlers began to expand the presence of white men into the territories acquired through the Louisiana Purchase and through lands conquered from Mexico, the idea of the &quot;west&quot; moved farther westward to the developing areas. The old west began to be called the middle west, or the Midwest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the time it was named, there was the East Coast, Appalachian Mountains region (the Mid-East, but wasn't really called that), the Midwest (the Ohio River Valley, Great Lakes Regions), the South (Texas was considered the South then) and 'the West' was the various territories made from the Louisiana Purchase and parts of of the Mexican cession.</p>
<p>However, I am from South Dakota, which is technically 'the West', (Deadwood of all places &quot;West&quot; is here), yet most people I know say they are from the 'Midwest'. And to an extent we share a dialect (Midwestern neutral), climate, and landscape with people from the Ohio River Valley, although they have more trees.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The phrase comes from a time when the US was spreading Westward. The 'West' is California and the Rocky mountains while on the way you had to travel through the mid-west.</p>
<p>Just East of the Rocky mountains is desert and arid land, harder to live in so it isn't as heavily populated.</p>
<p>So if you take a look at a map of the US by population density you'll see that the mid-Western States are much more populated than the States to their immediate West. That's why they are considered the middle of the country.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
