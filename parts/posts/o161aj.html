		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So prion disease(s) are quite nuanced, but I will try and give you the most succinct explanations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How does Mad Cow Disease stay dormant for that long without visible negative effects? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So first off, when mad cow disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) is transmitted to humans, we call it variant Cruetzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD), not mad cow disease. Second, it isn't &quot;dormant&quot; in the person, it's just that the person has not had any clinical symptoms yet. The misfolding, accumulation, and associated neuronal death builds up over time until such a point where the loss of neurons/brain tissue is so severe that the person presents with clinical symptoms. Furthermore, we don't know what the incubation time will be as it can vary from patient to patient based on CJD strain type and genetics of the person. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why can't we just test for the individuals who might have it? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We do have some tests now which can help support a prion disease diagnosis. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22528092/" target="_blank">Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification (PMCA)</a> and <a href="https://pn.bmj.com/content/19/1/49" target="_blank">real-time Quaking-Induced Conversion (rt-QuIC)</a> are both useful for this purpose. Neurologists can also <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9450766/" target="_blank">check for levels of a protein called 14-3-3</a> to aid in the diagnosis, however, the standard method is to eliminate other potential diseases that present similarly in clinic (Alzheimer's being a major one) in combination with one or more of the previously mentioned tests. (there are also changes in brain imaging which can also support the diagnosis). However, the gold standard is still post-mortem analysis (ie. autopsy confirmation).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How have we not eliminated it yet?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So this one is tough to answer, but it likely has to do with a few things:</p>
<p>1) We do not fully understand <em>how</em> prions misfold. We know that the misfolded prion protein(s) interact with other, normally folded prion protein(s) to cause them to misfold, likely with the help of chaperones and other cellular constituents. There are some recent papers that came out suggesting it forms <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/12/e2019631118" target="_blank">some intermediary species</a> that help promote conversion, but still much work to be done.</p>
<p>2) Unfortunately, once a patient is diagnosed with prion disease, it is likely far too late for any intervention to be of any help outside of possibly slowing down the disease progress. This is because, generally, when the cells in the brain die (specifically neurons), you don't get them back. And by the time a person presents with clinical symptoms, that usually means enough of their brain has deteriorated beyond a point which medical science can repair.</p>
<p>3) There are antibody studies being done to see if they can be of therapeutic use, but a big issue is that some antibodies may only recognize either the folded or misfolded version of the prion protein, and not all misfolded version are the same (this speaks to a theory in the prion field called the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4189885/#:~:text=The%20%E2%80%9Ccloud%E2%80%9D%20hypothesis%20assumes%20that,appears%20similar%20to%20prion%20adaptation." target="_blank">&quot;Cloud Hypothesis&quot;</a>). Further, removing all prion protein from the body could work (ie. knocking down the gene), as this has been shown to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2634447/" target="_blank">prevent disease in mouse models</a>, because without the normal prion protein available, there is nothing to misfold! Even though there are negligible changes in the PrnpKO mice, we do not know what knocking down/knocking out the prion protein in humans would do, because we do not have a clear understanding on what the normal prion protein does! <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006458#:~:text=Defining%20PrP%20function%20may%20shed,a%20protective%20role%20against%20stress." target="_blank">(studies have shown it plays a role in synapse maintenance, neuron maturation, cell-signaling, cell adhesion, and a protective role against oxidative stress)</a></p>
<p>There is a lot more to it, but that is the best summary I can give without writing a novel!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Currently writing my PhD thesis on a prion vaccine - I'll get to that in a bit. Also used to work for the CFIA as a summer student.</p>
<p>Mad cow disease (BSE) causes variant CJD (vCJD) in humans, and it is true that the incubation period can be decades long. It stays dormant - also known as a pre-clinical phase - because of fundamentally how prions work. Prions fall under protein-misfolding diseases, with an extra sprinkle of deadly on top of it: misfolded prions can either seed or template (depending on which conversion theory you believe) properly folded prion protein into the misfolded/disease causing form; this is known as the prion principle, This is also what makes it infectious. </p>
<p>As for the long incubation period, in a nutshell, the prion protein that you make is slightly different than the prion protein that a cow makes. Thus, there is something called a species barrier that sometimes prevents a different host from getting infected. The best example of this is scrapie (sheep prion disease) which has been known since ancient times, yet scrapie is also known to not infect humans (zoonosis). The assumption is that the species barrier between sheep and humans are just too great for misfolded sheep prions to convert properly folded human prion proteins.</p>
<p>For the case of BSE to cause vCJD, sometimes the species barrier is overcome and it does cause disease, it just takes a long time because the cow and human prion protein are still quite different, but not so different that it is impossible to overcome, like in the case of scrapie. Now of course there are polymorphisms that can either increase or decrease your susceptibility to prion diseases. Comment if you want more explanation of this.</p>
<p>As for why we haven't eliminated it, we...kind of have, for practical purposes. Most governmental agencies (USDA in the US, CFIA in Canada) have a list of specified risk materials (SRMs) that by law make it so that certain parts of a animal (e.g. cow) cannot be processed if it is to be consumed by humans. Example SRMs included brain, eyes, parts of the gut, and some more. Removal of SRMs make it so that BSE essentially never enters a human food chain, and since we stopped doing meat and bone meal (MBM) BSE really is quite controlled. Both the USDA and CFIA also still do surveillance (regular random BSE testing), and Europe's regulating agency actually tests every single cow that is meant for human consumption. So enjoy your beef. vCJD has an occurrence rate of something like 1×10^-9, so nothing to worry about there.</p>
<p>Why haven't we completely eliminated it? Well the prion protein is a self protein and despite the misfolded/infectious prion protein being toxic, it still is a self protein at the end of the day and your body will not really have an immune response against it. This is normal, since otherwise we would all have auto-immune disease, where your body just starts attacking your own self made proteins. And if you know anything about vaccine design, it's very difficult to design a vaccine that only removes the misfolded version because biochemically (amino acid compostion, charge, size) they are identical. The only difference is the 3D shape of it. And also because vCJD is just so rare, and CJD in general is usually sporadic (unknown cause) or genetic, so no pharmaceutical company would develop drugs/treatment for it. </p>
<p>As for testing, the current gold standard is post-mortem testing, which is obviously not possible for humans. Current tests are all amplification based tests like PMCA or RT-QuIC, which can be extremely sensitive, but they're not the easiest assays to run and can be quite finicky. Blood is also just generally hard to work with because many components of blood mess with the tests in this case. They are being worked on though.</p>
<p>The vaccine I have worked on is like 6 years worth of work and obviously not going to explain it here. In essence, we were able to overcome the self protein tolerance so that your immune response actually removes the infectious prion form. We have a manuscript on the way though!</p>
<p>Hopefully this helps.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what everybody has said, prions are ridiculously stable. Previous research has looked at burying it in the ground for years, then digging it up and it could still infect animals. Furthermore, most sterilization techniques such as autoclaving <em>also</em> fail to eliminate it completely. As such, some medical institutions would use a whole new set of neurosurgery tools (costing thousands to hundreds of thousands $) for each procedure rather than sterilizing and reusing them because of the associated risks. If a patient contacts vCJD it could end up costing the hospital tens of millions of $ from being sued and damage control.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are blood tests for detecting Creutzfeldt-Jakob or vCJD (what Mad Cow Disease is called when humans contract it).</p>
<p>Per the FDA, Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (mad cow disease, aka BSE) can't be detected in a live cow - detection is through a brain biopsy.  Also per the FDA and the NIH, it takes about 4 to 6 years for symptoms to show up, and once symptoms do show up, death occurs within 2 weeks to 6 months.  Particularly in a large herd of cows, symptoms might not be noticed prior to the cow being slaughtered and the meat distributed.</p>
<p>Once a human is infected, symptoms might not show up for several years to a few decades (like up to 40 years!), so again, you don't know you have it until symptoms show up...by which time, it's too late. There is no cure or treatment, for animals or humans.</p>
<p>From other sources I found, it seems like there are very few cases of vCJD detected globally every year, but due to the long incubation period in humans, there's some concern that there may be a large population of &quot;silent carriers&quot;, in the UK in particular.  Hence the ban on blood donations.  </p>
<p>Why don't they just test the blood for vCJD?  I couldn't find an answer, but it's probably too expensive to test for on a large scale.  I've heard that restrictions on blood donation for gay and bi men are being eased, but testing for HIV is pretty easy and common, and there are now some very effective treatments for HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>As for elimination, the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/animal-health-literacy/all-about-bse-mad-cow-disease" target="_blank">FDA website</a> says this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The parts of a cow that are not eaten by people are cooked, dried, and ground into a powder. The powder is then used for a variety of purposes, including as an ingredient in animal feed. A cow gets BSE by eating feed contaminated with parts that came from another cow that was sick with BSE. The contaminated feed contains the abnormal prion, and a cow becomes infected with the abnormal prion when it eats the feed.  If a cow gets BSE, it most likely ate the contaminated feed during its first year of life.  Remember, if a cow becomes infected with the abnormal prion when it is one-year-old, it usually will not show signs of BSE until it is five-years-old or older. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the same FDA article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since August 1997, the FDA has not allowed most parts from cows and certain other animals to be used to make food that is fed to cows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I couldn't find similar information regarding this practice in the UK, but I assume they, and other countries, have done the same.</p>
<p>Thanks for sending me down an informational rabbit hole, that was interesting!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Testing for Mad Cow disease aka variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) is very difficult. A diffusion-weighted MRI is needed and testing for CSF markers such as 14-3-3 Tau is also used. The number of people that would need to be tested in order to find even one case is so large that it isn’t feasible, particularly since the testing is invasive and/or expensive. The incidence of vCJD has been decreasing since the introduction of controls in the UK to prevent the contamination of beef by neural tissue containing the causative agent of vCJD, PrPsc. I can’t speak with much authority on why the incubation period is so long, but it may be related to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases that have an increase of a protein that disrupts normal neural function, e.g. Alzheimer’s. Lastly, since you were reading about pre-donation deferrals and screening, this is the latest FDA document on the use of the donor history questionnaire (DHQ) for CJD and other prion disease: <a href="https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/recommendations-reduce-possible-risk-transmission-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease-and-variant-creutzfeldt" target="_blank">https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/recommendations-reduce-possible-risk-transmission-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease-and-variant-creutzfeldt</a>
