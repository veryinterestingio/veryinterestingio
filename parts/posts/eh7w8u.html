We all know the feeling when you wake up in the middle of the night and your limb feels dead. You roll over and as soon as the blood travels back into a limb it starts to “hurt”. Why does it create such a painful feeling?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're not cutting off blood flow when this happens. If that were the case your limb would turn purple and eventually die due to a lack of oxygen.</p>
<p>Under normal operating conditions nerve endings are synchronized, firing off and receiving signals from the brain in unison. Nerve endings regularly fire off a &quot;hey I'm here&quot; signal and the brain regularly sends a &quot;signal received&quot; response, which prompts it to send another signal. It's a constant back and forth communication. When you position your body in a certain way you pinch a major nerve, preventing efficient signal transfer to and from the brain. When the nerve endings lose connection with the brain they get unhappy and start randomly firing trying to get a response. When you reposition and that connection is restored then your brain is flooded with random signals from that limb which gives you the pins and needles feeling. After a few minutes everything has resynched and returned to normal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You feel like you're going numb because you're putting pressure on a nerve, blocking its signal from the rest of the body. When you take away the pressure, it starts sending signals again, but more intensely as it wakes back up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
