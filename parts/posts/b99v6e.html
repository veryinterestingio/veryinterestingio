		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cattle have a natural aversion to feeding around their own dung. This can lead to the formation of taller ungrazed patches of heavily fertilized sward. These habitat patches, termed &quot;islets&quot;, can be beneficial for many grassland arthropods, including spiders (Araneae) and bugs (Hemiptera). They have an important function in maintaining biodiversity in heavily utilized pastures</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Animals do get sick from fecal matter being about so it's a bit off a misconception. They don't get sick because of a farmers work.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>What happens is twofold.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In pens:</p>
<p>They move and the farmer mucks up (grabs the poop) and they don't eat where they poop. The aforementioned poop is deposited in a compost pile for use or sold.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In pasture:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The animal doesn't poop where it's eating it grazes and then is moved to different pasture once the plants are eaten. The poop falls on the already eaten parts additionally they  often use agricultural fencing to divide up the aforementioned  pasture land to keep the animals in a specific area. For some animals dogs can be used as well.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Additional steps depend on what's going on as there are numerous styles of agriculture. The common thread is the poop is not wasted.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If this pasture is a fallow field: it's often spreed and allowed to rot in place.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If the poop is to be used as fertilizer in a different field it is gathered by the farmer and  composted. The compost is then spread by machines.  Raw manure cannot be used on many crops especially root crops. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If the poop is going to be sold it is gathered by the farmer and either composted on site or sold as is to producers of bagged manure or anyone else wanting to buy poop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some diseases that impact us (like cholera) don't affect animals like cows nearly as much or even at all. They do get infected though. Livestock eating dirty plants is what allows a lot of parasites to survive and potentially spread to US. Yay! Thing is, intestinal worms have to be at insanely high levels to really impact a cow to a noticable degree, and others like tapeworms that live in their muscle tissue cause some issues but not catastrophic ones. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans live in really dense populations compared to other organisms and virtually no individual is truly isolated from any other. You can make a chain of personal physical contact from one person to almost any other on the planet, over many degrees of separation. You will eventually come into contact with seriously sick people, it's not a question of <em>if</em>, so we keep our hygiene game strong.</p>
<p>12 cows in a field have virtually no interaction with the other cows of the world, so if none of them have a communicable disease then that's it, none of them have a communicable disease and they can step on each other's shit all day long. If one of those cows DOES get sick though, either through another animal or a contaminated water supply and so on... that can become a big problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
