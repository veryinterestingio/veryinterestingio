<p>Don't know how true that is, but I'm anemic with low BP, and used to chew on &quot;ice in a towel&quot; (ice cubes wrapped in a wet dishcloth) as a kid. Now, I mostly crave Slush Puppies (not easy to find anymore!)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't believe there is anything humans used to eat, that was ice-like, that ever gave us iron.</p>
<p>Pica is a mechanism to eat more diverse food sources, as a means to get the nutrients needed to survive that are missing from a diet, as a last ditch effort, by eating things that an animal doesn't consider edible. Normally this would be a good way to get sick, but when malnourished this might be a risk worth taking.</p>
<p>For example, lots of animals have odd dietary habits like licking rocks, for salt intake. Pica could be seen as a biological mechanism to get a goat who doesn't think rocks are food, to start licking them again. The same underlying forces are probably at work with humans, too, when they have a vitamin deficiency.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
