		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you roll your tshirt tightly it gets compressed and can stay compressed as long as it is rolled.  Squeezing it into a suitcase next to other rolled shirts keeps them all rolled (and compressed) just by the friction of them against each other.</p>
<p>When you fold a tshirt, it's just sitting there.  It's neater, but doesn't really use less space than tossing it into the suitcase.  When you pack this way, the shirts need to be compressed by pushing them down, such as when you sit on the suitcase to close it, but they lose a lot of that compression once you open it again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every folded crease is like a spring because one side of the fold is compressed while the other side is stretched. For example, try folding a piece of cardboard so that both halves lie flat against each other. If you let go, it tends to spring back upwards.</p>
<p>Folded clothes have the same effect. Each fold acts like a spring that props up the item so that it takes up more space when it is sitting still.</p>
<p>When you roll clothes, you are not adding any sharp folds and the act of rolling compresses any of the existing folds. This is why it has less volume!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
