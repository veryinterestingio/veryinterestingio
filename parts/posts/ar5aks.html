Chan School of Public Health at Harvard has been widely quoted as estimating that industrial trans fat elimination will prevent 90,000 deaths annually. Now that most of that has taken place, have reduced rates of coronary disease and associated deaths over the last few years shown up statistically? Or is it too early to know?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most part will be tricky, as labeling requirements are easily <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2014/14_0161.htm" target="_blank">manipulated</a> by adjusting serving sizes and staying under 0.5 grams per serving. The Nestle Tollhouse Break and Bake cookies for example, contain &quot;0g trans fats&quot; per serving of 1 cookie. The ingredient list is pretty upfront that it actually does contain hydrogenated oils in the form of margarine, so each cookie can contain up to 0.49 grams of trans fat. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if trans fat reduction is just fake news; i.e. by calling it something else that is not regulated.  For example, I wanted to know what my favorite Mexican food place was deep frying their tortilla chips in.  They did not know, but were nice enough to show me the 5 gallon bucket it came in. Shortening read the label, ingredients; soy beans.  Isn't shortening going to be a trans fat?    So I looked it up and I think this, can someone explain that it is not? </p>
<p><strong>Interesterified</strong> fat is a type of <strong>oil</strong> where the fatty acids have been moved from one triglyceride molecule to another. This is generally done to modify the melting point, slow rancidification and create an <strong>oil</strong> more suitable for deep frying or making margarine with good taste and low saturated fat content. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
