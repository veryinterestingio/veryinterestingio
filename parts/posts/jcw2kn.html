		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To do a medical trial, you need to have it approved by an ethics board. Among many other steps, you need to assure the board you will be providing enough information that the subjects will have informed consent.</p>
<p>Among other things, informed consent needs to outline all the known and suspected potential hazards of undergoing the trial.</p>
<p>Getting kids to understand informed consent is hard. Hell, for some the question is <em>whether</em> a minor is even capable of informed consent, and if parental consent suffices instead. </p>
<p>Moreover, because it's kids, the trial has to be extremely confident it has minimized the potential harms. Kids are the last group tested partly because it usually has to go through adult trials first. Also because dosage is often by body weight and so kids are at risk due to lower tolerances for the drug. Also because kids are still developing, with brain and hormonal changes, which significantly screws with the ability for anyone to predict what harms the child will be exposed to and whether it will impact their development (because even if they tested it on adults first, adults have already finished development, and so testers will have no real clue how it will work on kids).</p>
<p>Testing on kids is such a tangled knot of concerns and risks and consent issues and the potential harms (and legal risks to the drug company should they make a mistake and get sued) that many drugs are never tested on kids.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Pfizer just announced they'll be enrolling teenagers (16+) in vaccine trials, and have approval and intent to go to 12+.</p>
<p>Children are considered vulnerable subjects and so require additional regulatory consideration to be included. This usually focuses heavily on safety, or whether children present a substantial unmet medical need (I.e. Childhood diseases that don't affect adults). Reasons why children receive additional protections are probably pretty obvious and related to informed consent, dosing, and some differences in biology. There's also the especially strong desire for pharma companies to avoid having an otherwise healthy seeming child die or suffer a severe reaction to a new drug. While you would hate to kill an adult also, causing something bad to a child is particularly heartbreaking and bad press.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This means the vaccine would have to be known to be far safer in order to justify its use in children vs those at much higher risk of death.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know this question was asked a bit ago but I’m a pediatric medical researcher (oncology) and we are starting some COVID stuff, but I do know other researchers who are infectious disease peds researchers, so here is the summary</p>
<ol>
<li>Safety and efficacy will be evaluated just like every other clinical trial, so that means looking at various SAEs (serious adverse events) throughout the study. Usually there is a board / committee that monitors this and if something bad happens, the trial gets halted until further investigation. This happened with one of the vaccines and it was determined to be unrelated.
2) Clinical trials are evaluated in stages so safety will be first, then efficacy.
3) Kids are last because on the whole, they are fairing a LOT better than adults. But also unless it’s a child specific disease, most clinical trials actually start with an adult population and then move to kids. Sometimes in tandem but not always. </li>
</ol>
<p>What people should be more concerned about is the disproportionate # of kids who are getting severely sick / dying and are POCs. It’s startling and incredibly upsetting.</p>
<p>And to clarify, these trials are already happening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m a paediatric clinical researcher who does clinical trials in children</p>
<p>This area is complex but I’ll try to outline a few main points:</p>
<p>Firstly, children can be enrolled in the RECOVERY trial for COVID-19 which is running in the UK; this is both for acute respiratory infection with SARS-CoV-2 and for the new hyperinflammatory syndrome (MIS-C)</p>
<p>Children are also enrolled in the Oxford/Astrazenica COVID vaccine trial in phase II (children aged 5-12)</p>
<p>Children are usually enrolled in clinical trials for new medicines once data in adults has confirmed that new medicines are safe (and hopefully effective) - this is less important for existing medicines which are being repurposed</p>
<p>Proving efficacy in children for most conditions is difficult because it’s so rare for children to have poor outcomes anyway (I.e. few children die) so you need many more</p>
<p>It is particularly difficult for COVID because so few children even become unwell enough to enrol into a clinical trial</p>
<p>It is difficult to get drug companies to run trials for children because they rarely recover the cost of running the trial in what they would make in sales for the drugs to treat children (but new legislation is helping make this more equitable)</p>
<p>Hope that is helpful!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
