		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>because the tripe isn't producing mucus to protect itself like how our stomach is producing mucus to protect itself. If our stomach didn't have that mucus (for example due to overuse of drugs like aspirin or ibuprofen or because of infection by bugs like H. pylori), the acid would eat through the wall of our own stomach and cause an ulcer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your stomach acid is strong enough to eat through your stomach but your stomach constantly produces a mucus lining that is resistant to the acid.  </p>
<p>People who suffer with acid reflux, will frequently burp/puke a little bit up and it will eventually eat through their lower esophagus.</p>
<p>Their was an episode put out recently of Today i Found Out  youtube that touches on a man who could eat metal without issue due to especially powerful acid that allowed him to digest metal and a stomach that overproduced mucus that allowed him to survive the stronger acid.  </p>
<p>He actually made money eating things normal people cant such as: glass, forks,  a small aircraft.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
