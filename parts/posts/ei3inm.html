		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey, this is my job!</p>
<p>Here is a quick and dirty:</p>
<p>Most shows aren't actually choreographed, so it's not too important. Someone (the sponsor) plays music in the background and we shoot for however long they hired us to (say 15 minutes). For these, we usually have an <a href="https://electricmatch.com/pyrotechnics/see/9/5/j-tek-igniter" target="_blank">e-match</a> connected to a time chain for the mortars. An ematch is a a device that is wired into one of our <a href="https://www.cobrafiringsystems.com/product_overview.html" target="_blank">field modules</a> (a hub where we can wire devices that is wirelessly connected to our remote control) and a time chain is a fuse that normally fires 10 mortars, each seperated by 3-4 seconds. So essentially this allows us to push a single button that fires 10 mortars over 30 seconds. We could individually match (fuse) mortars to fire each individually, but that is a lot of time and a lot of extra money. We will put specially effects (comets, mines, cakes) on individual cues to have precise control over those. For these non-choreographed shows, we plan it our before hand timewise, and then just shoot it manually and adjust as we go. Kinda seat-of-the-pants shooting.</p>
<p>For choreographed shows <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=658&amp;v=s7ft8xFUmIY&amp;feature=emb_logo" target="_blank">like this</a> the entire show requires everything to be individually matched and tied in to an assigned cue which is expensive and a lot of work (which is why most of our customers don't do this). What's really cool about these is we do have CAD (called Finale IIRC) that lets us build and play the show on our computer before we do it. When we're happy, it prints out a product sheet for us and a connection sheet that tells us where everything should go and what module and cue it should be plugged into. It also gives a CSV of timecodes and cues that we can upload into our firing system remote, so we can just hit play and it autonomously plays the show for us. Also, the firing system has an integrated music box to, so it plays the music itself while we shoot the show, that way the timing is exact. And our system interfaces with professional audio equipment, so we usually are plugged into our sponsor's audio board and are the ones playing the music and shooting the show.</p>
<p>Things don't always go as planned, as products can be incorrectly marked or shoot faster or slower than what the box labels say. Some stuff just also blows up when it shouldn't (I have a lot of video of this) so safety is number 1 priority with us. We're required to wear certain PPE and we must have fire suppression equipment on hand. Sometimes our electronic firing system fails so we have to hand light. Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cu5POQ7BA" target="_blank">video of us</a> training apprentices on how to handlight...which is as it sounds. Flare on a stick to make the booms go boom. This is really unsafe though, and we try with all our might not to do it, but sometimes if stuff goes wrong, we don't have options, so we still train people how to do it. This whole video is cool, because it is a big enough show that we have 4 firing locations, of which 3 are electronic and the 1 we're at is handlight.</p>
<p>edit: Also, usually there is no rehearsal so we only get one shot to get it right. The only exception to that is indoor shows. In our jurisdiction we must fire the entire show for the Fire Marshall before we get approved and get the permit to perform it publicly indoors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
