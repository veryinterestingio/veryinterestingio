		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Because sound moves faster in warm air than colder air, the wave bends away from the warm air and back toward the ground. That's why sound is able to travel farther in chilly weather. ... Not many people like standing out in cold weather, either, so there are fewer cars, pedestrians, and animals to make a ruckus.‚Äù <a href="https://www.discovery.com/science/Sound-Carries-Farther-Cold-Days" target="_blank">Source.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>temperature and humidity both affect how much sound is absorbed, but this also depends on the <em>frequency</em> of the sound.  i linked an interesting paper on this, just skip ahead to the graphs on page 25 onward if you don't feel like reading it.  i will do my best to summarize the graphs, but this is difficult because they relate many different factors (temperature, frequency, humidity).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>it says that at standard temperature (20C), absorption is greatest at 20% humidity, and that there is more absorption for <em>high frequency</em>. ie, at 20C, and 20% humidity, air will act like a high pass filter, attenuating high frequencies, but letting low frequencies pass through. in general, absorption is measure in dB/m, meaning how much energy is lost per meter of travel.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>moving on to temperature. at <em>low frequency</em>, lower temperatures absorb sound more, at lower humidity, while high temperatures don't have much of any effect on low frequency at any humidity. so to rank from loudest to quietest: high temp &gt; low temp high humidity &gt; low temp low humidity.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>this interaction changes immensely for <em>high frequency</em>. here, absorption is greatest at high temperatures with low humidity, and lowest at low temperatures with high humidity.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>let's summarize these results and tie them back to your questions. i assume you're talking about low temperatures with low humidity. these conditions favor the transmission of high frequency the most, adding to what would be called a &quot;clear&quot; sound, as these frequencies are where voices and other important sounds live. lower frequencies are not as favored by these conditions, this would probably add to the effect of &quot;quietness&quot; as there is less ambient rumble, whatever that may mean.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>these findings are most applicable for long range sound reinforcement, outdoor theaters, large festivals, etc. but they are also true anywhere. the effect however won't be seen at smaller distances, as the air just won't have enough time to properly attenuate any of the sound. i am sure that other factors mentioned in this thread, including speed of sound, atmospheric reflection, and snow absorption also play a huge role, but i wanted to outline another important factor.</p>

This is a small effect though and likely the sound not being reflected by the snow and people not being as active in cold weather</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you have two different scenarios here:  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Clear sound on a cold, crisp, and clear (night?). This is when the pond is frozen, the leaves are long gone, but no wind. All the surfaces are hard and reflective to sound, and nothing is competeing with the sound.  </p>
</li>
<li>Muffled sound during snowfall, or immediately thereafter. The snow falls and entrains a great deal of air in a collapsible blanket. The energy of sound is absorbed and converted to heat in the snowpack, helping to consolidate new snow.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the same reason why it does at night - it's quiet outside.</p>
<p>To explain further: Your hearing isn't really limited by the sensitivity of your ears, it's limited by the background noise. Which means that every sound seems to stand out more when there is less background noise. It really matters is how loud the sound is compared to all the other sounds, rather than its absolute loudness. What really matters is how loud it is compared to the noise, rather than its absolute loudness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
