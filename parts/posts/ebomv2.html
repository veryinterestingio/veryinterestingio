<p>Allergies are an overreaction of your immune systems reacting to something that is not a threat to the body </p>
<p>If you were allergic to cats as an example, contracted HIV, and somehow came into contact with a cat, would your body still react to it in similar ways?</p>
<p>Edit: u/streeturchin1337 has said in a comment down there that they may have heard of leukemia and HIV essentially cancelling each other out in terms of white blood cell count. I too am interested in this so have popped it up here</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>HIV does not really cause the immune system to fail completely. The immune system is extremely complex and has several different arms that are all necessary but not sufficient to protect us. HIV actually affects a relatively specific part of the immune system.</p>
<p>Allergy is a relatively nonspecific term. Allergies that cause anaphylaxis (aka type I hypersensitivity), like penicillin, peanut, shellfish allergies, etc. are caused by the rapid activation of pre-formed antibodies in the blood which are products of the &quot;humoral&quot; immune system, i.e. B lymphocytes and their derivatives. Although T cells (the CD4+ subset of which is the lineage affected in HIV) are involved in activating B cells and inducing the production of antibodies, once this has happened there is a long-term memory response preserved in the B-cell line, so wiping out the T cells is unlikely to affect an existing anaphylactic allergic response.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is another kind of allergy known as a type IV hypersensitivity reaction that is mediated entirely by T cells. Examples of this reaction include contact dermatitis from nickel or poison ivy and the tuberculin skin test (aka PPD test). This kind of reaction is markedly blunted by HIV. In fact, the threshold for a positive PPD test (measured in millimeters of skin reaction) is lowered in patients with HIV because they are not able to produce as large of a reaction to the PPD and would otherwise end up with a high rate of false negatives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Though the question in itself is fine, I'd like to clarify a few things to avoid stigma for those uneducated.</p>
<p>It's worth noting the difference between the stages of HIV. The immune system is generally still in good enough shape to fight most things during chronic HIV infection, until it reaches its 3rd stage. This stage is also known as AIDS, and usually takes 10-20 years to get there if untreated. This is where the immune system has CD4+ counts too low to fight off infections that HIV negative people fight off without too much difficulty (such as influenza.)</p>
<p>If a patient adheres to treatment, then HIV will often never reach the 3rd stage, and they will lead a relatively normal life, with a relatively normal immune system. Even better, in most cases under active, constant treatment, HIV is also untransmittable to anyone else!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>CD4+ cells (those which HIV targets) control the signal of the immune response so it's probably best to understand AIDS as a disruption to the normal immune function versus simply suppressing it.</p>
<p>An example is a fairly common symptom of AIDS, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889856105703076" target="_blank">allergic rhinitis</a>. But studies have found a variety of autoimmune conditions that can flare up:  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4105162/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4105162/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4105162/</a></a>.</p>
<p>To answer your example, a cat allergy could indeed become worse with AIDS though a cursory look at the literature doesn't see any specific studies. It should be noted though that someone with HIV probably shouldn't be around cats since toxoplasmosis is basically a death sentence in severely immunosuppressed.  <a href="https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients" target="_blank">https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients</a></a></p>

<p>HIV suppresses T cell responses, but it suppresses TH1 (protective, anti-viral immunity) more than it suppresses TH2 (anti-parasite and pro-allergy immune responses).  So even though you are immune suppressed, the allergic part of your immune system is less suppressed and is not inhibited by the TH1 processes so actually may be more active.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
