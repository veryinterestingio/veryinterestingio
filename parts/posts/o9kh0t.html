		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The proximity to the sun only matters when you're facing it. The sun makes things hot by shining lots of photons on it. The night side of Mercury is the side facing away from the sun and therefore isn't getting any of those delicious photons.</p>
<p>But it should already be hot from being in the sun during the day-time, right? No. Hot things radiate their heat away. Without an atmosphere to trap the heat and keep it there (like a blanket), it just gets rid of all its heat (in the form of infrared radiation) and gets very cold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lack of atmosphere means heat doesn’t get trapped. That is also why Venus is hotter than Mercury. The light side of Earth’s moon is also quite hot compared to earth. Atmospheres are effective heat traps for a couple of reasons. One being the greenhouse effect, which traps heat. The other being that atmospheres are made up of molecules, which collide with one another distributing their energy, which distributes the heat around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine boiling a pot of water on a gas stove and then turning off the stove. The water stays hot for a long time. Now imagine turning on a gas burner with nothing on it and then turning it off; within a minute or so, the top of the burner is close to room temp. In these scenarios, the water in the pot is the atmosphere. Without the atmosphere, Mercury's dark side gets pretty cold during its year-long night. Overall, the universe is pretty cold despite trillions of nuclear reactors firing all at once, because it's big. So any surface without insulation (oceans, atmospheres) will lose heat very rapidly without direct sun/starlight on it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The side facing towards the sun (&quot;daytime&quot;) will receive a lot of heat from the proximity to the sun.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the side facing away from the sun (&quot;nighttime&quot;) is facing empty space which would be colder than the daytime surface, and with no atmosphere to hold in the heat, the heat escapes quite easily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
