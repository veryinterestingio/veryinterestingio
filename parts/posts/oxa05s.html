		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Credit cards are the first common 2 factor authentication.</p>
<p>You need physical possession of the card <em>as well as</em> the 4 digit PIN. A thief may get the card, but won't have the PIN. If you follow security.</p>
<p>Yes, a 4 digit PIN seems unsecure by modern standards. But it is an old standard. The main security is physical possession of the card, or card details. Which is why it's a huge deal when websites have a breach and leak thousands or 10s of thousands if card details.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aside from what others have said, most services online allow multiple attempts + password recovery. In contrast, if you get your pin wrong 3 times your card is blocked and you must physically go to your bank and/or get a human to verify you so that you can recover your card.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After three wrong attempts you effectively lose your card. Thatâ€™s a huge hammer for that security nail - just imagine a website would permanently ban you from using it in any way until you go to a physical location and get mailed a new password.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You get very few chances to use a PIN incorrectly so brute force is less of an issue. Plus, a mag strip or chip is needed along with the PIN.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
