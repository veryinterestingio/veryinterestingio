		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They get together and discuss the evidence at workshops, like this one from the <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/event/08-26-2020/airborne-transmission-of-sars-cov-2-a-virtual-workshop" target="_blank">National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine</a> that discussed airborne transmission of COVID and potential precautions. Its a bit long, but I highly recommend watching it! </p>
<p>They took a look at the physics of aerosols, how long viral particles can stay viable in air, what influence mask wearing has on the physics, ventilation of public spaces, case studies on spreading events, epidemiology of who gets sick, etc. They also make sure to note that there isn't a silver bullet to stop a pandemic virus, and we need to layer a number of imperfect protections.</p>
<p>The main recommendations they decided on were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the only garuanteed way to not get sick is to stay home</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wearing masks reduces spread and provides some protection to the wearer, but some particles can escape out the sides</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>activities should be brought outside as much as possible. Sun light significantly reduces the viability of SARS-CoV-2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing indoor ventilation to 6-9L/sec/person will help remove viral particles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it is not possible to safely eat inside a poorly ventilated restaurant or drink in a bar, no matter how much social distancing is taking place</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using MERV13 or higher filters and UV light sanitation help supplement ventilation and reduce heating/cooling needs by reducing the amount of outdoor air needed to bring in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>healthcare workers and first responders should use N95 masks and eye protection because they are exposed to very high levels of viral particles. They should also take regular breaks from high exposure environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>floors/surfaces should be cleaned regularly, because viral particles can be resuspended</p>
</li>
<li>the biggest risk in an airplane are the people in your row because ventilation circulates side to side in an airplane. Meal service could possibly be done safely if it was staggered every other person in a row, or every other seat was empty</li>

Often, they use past info from other diseases.  Sometimes the control group is just the populations that don't follow the rules. I'm just a pediatrician, though, so interested in any Epi input!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, we recognise that none of the measures you list (or that we are trying) is 100% effective, so it  would be impractical and foolish to test one at a time.
So we're applying a 'Swiss Cheese' defence, whereby enough of the imperfect measures put together will limit/stop transmission. Illustrated neatly in this image that I snaffled off Twitter earlier this week. <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/hgCOjam" target="_blank">Swiss Cheese Respiratory Virus Defence</a></p>

<p>They use metrics like CFR and IFR and antibody rates to make predictions and simulations for the spread.
Here are simple simulations made by a maths youtuber:

The professional ones would be more tailored to the region and less graphic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll start with, &quot;it's not easy.&quot; The lack of proper control groups makes it very hard. </p>
<p>It is however not an uncommon occurrence to scientists. We very rarely have all the control experiments we would like. Being able to untangle multiple simultaneous changes is part of doing science. </p>
<p>3 main methods are used. </p>
<p>1) comparisons between countries. A number of countries did different things at different times. By looking at many different countries you can find patterns and start to untangle what works. </p>
<p>Part of this is then proposing a hypothesis for why the pattern you noticed matters. For example mask wearing countries have a slower spread, and then justify why: airborne microdroplet spread. </p>
<p>A bad example would be: countries who's names have 6 letters have high spread. There no rational for why this effects the spread. </p>
<p>2) next you have to test rationals for why the spread happens. Either you use these rationals to look for patterns as in part 1 or you use patterns from part 1, and test thier rationals</p>
<p>From the example there, you could test to see if virus can be found in micro droplets from infected people. You can test how well masks block the microdroplets. Etc</p>
<p>3) modeling. This is one of the later methods, because it requires 1 and 2. You put numbers for how each intervention effects the spread.</p>
<p>Intervention A changed the spread rate by X amount and country A had 50% of people actually do it, and intervention B slows the spread rate by Y and country A had 80% of people doing it. Meanwhile country B had 90% of people doing both interventions... Etc. </p>
<p>You then fit to the complicated shapes for statistics for each country. It becomes a much more complicated version of those algebra 2 things you did in math. </p>
<p>7x + 4y = 20 and 4x^2 + 9y = 35. Solve for X and Y. </p>
<p>You don't have an easy equation that only had X in it. But you can still solve for X and Y using the pair of equations. Each country becomes its own equation because they did different things. (Sometimes you can even use cities)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
