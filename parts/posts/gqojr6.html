		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a hormone produced by the kidney called erythropoietin. That hormone makes the blood marrow produce more red blood cells.
When there isn’t enough oxygen reaching the kidney (because of the lost blood), it produces this hormone so more blood is made.</p>
<p>TL;DR: the kidney tells the blood marrow to make more blood</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I have a semi-rare disorder where my body makes too much spinal fluid! Lucky me it can be treated and it went smoothly. Funny thing about this condition (IIH/ pseudo-tumor cerebri) no one knows what causes it! Only how to fix it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body has methods of measuring the actual amount of liquid blood in the vessels, as well as how much oxygen your organs are getting. This is done through a combination of chemoreceptors and pressure receptors. If your body senses it’s low on RBCs, it can release a chemical called Erythropoietin, which causes your bone marrow to up the production of red blood cells, and then it stops releasing that chemical once it detects the amounts are back to normal</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll add that there's a part of your brain that can detect when the volume of blood is too low. When this happens, the pituitary secretes ADH that causes the kidneys to conserve more water instead of excreting it in urine. This helps maintain the volume of blood and blood pressure in addition to the actual amount of red blood cells which has been explained by others here (erythropoietin).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just another piece of info... </p>
<p>Also I've read a couple papers that say people who regularly donate blood seem to also have better outcomes when they suffer blood loss for other reasons.</p>
<p>That's one of the reasons I continue two donate despite the fact that I have very difficult veins.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
