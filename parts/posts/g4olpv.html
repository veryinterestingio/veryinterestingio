		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sugar dissolves in saliva which is basically water. To do this, sugar &quot;pulls&quot; the water from somewhere which is called osmosis. If you have that going on in steady contact to the inside of your mouth, an exchange of water and dissolved sugar occures between the lollipop and the flesh which roughens up the tissue. Also there's lots of bacteria in your mouth that feast on sugar and let behind acidic substances that attack your enamel and in this case, due to the close proximity, your flesh.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
