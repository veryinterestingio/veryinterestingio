		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hold your finger out in front of you and move it slowly from left to right. Follow the tip of your finger with your eyes. If you do this enough and pay attention you’ll notice that your eyes move on a very smooth, continual motion. Now try to replicate that smooth motion without tracking an object. If you try to scan a room for example, you’ll notice that the movement of your eyes are no longer smooth and continual. They jump from point to point. This is actually something humans have evolved to do. When tracking something, it is more beneficial to have continual smooth motion of the eyes (like tracking a predator in front of you). When there is nothing to track, the brain processes images in quick groupings, which is why our eyes “jump” or “click”. Apparently this is beneficial to our survival in order to quickly scan an area for threats.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's called saccadic masking. When you move your eyes to look around it's less 'real time camera' and more 'individual photos stitched together to make a panorama'. As your eyes move from point A to point B, your brain switches off image processing, making you functionally blind (for up to an hour a day IIRC). Your eyes take a picture of point A, then point B and merges them together, to create the illusion you saw the whole panorama. </p>
<p>Fun fact: you can observe this temporary blindness by looking in a mirror and trying to watch your own eyes move.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The eyes dont send pictures to your brain if the eyes is currently moving. It may seem like clicky, but its probably you unconsciously stopping for a moment to be able to see. </p>
<p>It does this so you dont see the world like a shaky handheld camera.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think most of the answers aren’t really getting it. When our eyes are tracking something moving, they move smoothly to track it. If we move our eyes to look at something that isn’t moving, it’s impossible to make smooth pursuit eye movements. Instead we use saccades...rapid eye movements. For example, when you’re reading this paragraph, you’re eyes don’t move gradually across the sentence. They jump a few words at a time. In a typical book page, we make 2-4 saccades per line of text.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
