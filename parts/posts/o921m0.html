		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This may get a bit technical, but the very hand-wavy stuff is: the dimples are really ever only useful for spheres, and for spheres that move at very specific speeds (or of very specific sizes).</p>
<p>The reason why is that a sphere is a bluff body with some very weird properties when it moves at relatively high speeds. We add dimples on top of spheres to get a more regular flow around the back of the sphere, which is the critical part, but in doing so you are adding some drag. It turns out that the drag you get with dimples is less than the drag you lose by improving the flow on the back of the sphere, so it works there.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the fuselage of an airplane doesn't really have this kind of problems. The back of the fuselage usually is pointed, making for an already decent enough flow on the back. What's more, for very complex reasons I won't explain, the dimples make the flow turbulent for the golf ball, but the air is already turbulent near the airplane, so it wouldn't have any effect if not increasing drag the same way it did for spheres.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>But for streamlined bodies, like airplane wings, that's not the case.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do, in a way!</p>
<p>At the front of many types of plane wings you might notice small bumps running along, these serve the same purpose as the dimples on a golf ball: To produce turbulent flow, which tightens up the wake of the object as it flows through a fluid.</p>
<p>Here's some pictures demonstrating what you are looking for, I believe the technical term is a &quot;Vortex Generator&quot;</p>

<p>I believe Vortex Generators also serve the important role of preventing a plane from stalling at certain altitudes and speeds, if I recall correctly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We do.  Many designs of aircraft have air channels. to control airflow in a similar way.  They're channeled instead of  dimpled or pockled because unlike golf balls, we know which end of the plane is supposed to be the front.  That makes it much easier for us to fully optimize the aerodynamics for a plane in its direction of travel in a way that we just can't do for a spheroid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They actually do. Well, kind of.
Think of the last time you were trying to pour water from a bowl: if you don't pour it fast enough, the water stream will stay attached to the outer wall of the bowl, and everything gets messy. It works similarly with golf balls/airplanes flying through air: the air streams stay attached to the surface, as long as it is not flying too fast (or at too large of an angle), in which case the air flow separates from the surface, leaving big, undesirable vortices behind.</p>
<p>The idea behind the dimples in golf balls, is to intentionally introduce small vortices while the flow is still attached to the surface. This reenergizes that layer of air, allowing it to stay attached longer. This means the golf ball can fly considerably faster without being slowed down by the high drag due to separation. </p>
<p>While as others pointed out, there's no need for dimples on the fuselage (the cylindrical tube between the wings where people sit), vortex generators are still widely used on the wings. Next time you are on a plane and look out of the window, you might see a bunch of metal bits sticking out of the surface of the front of the wing with seemingly no purpose. These air the airplabe versions of the golf ball dimples. The purpose of this is not to help the airplane fly faster, but to fly at slower, but at a higher angle (angle of attack). This is required during take-off and landing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
