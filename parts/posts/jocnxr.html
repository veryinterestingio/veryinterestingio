		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever looked at an F1 drivers seating position? That looks to be pretty close to the neutral position of astronauts.</p>

<p>Good race suits are designed with pre-curved legs, arms and race gloves are designed with pre curved fingers etc. Sitting in an F1 car is actually really comfortable and supportive. It has to be so as not to create pressure points with the sheer amount of G they pull in corners and under braking. The seating position wasn’t designed like this for driver comfort but has ended up like this as a result of sculpting the outside of the car for aerodynamics and weight distribution. The fact that it’s ended up pretty close to the bodies natural neutral position is a happy coincidence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a law of kinesiology known as Davis' Law of Soft Tissue Adaption which states that muscles change according to the stress (or lack thereof) placed upon them. Depending on how you use your body, your muscles will have a different length and tonicity than other people, meaning that if you were to knock someone unconscious and put them somewhere with zero gravity, people would end up in different positions. The closest thing you might be able to think of as a &quot;default&quot; position might be fetal position, since everyone more or less starts out in that identical position.</p>
<p>While it doesn't exactly match what you're talking about, there are also two &quot;anatomical positions&quot; that medical technicians use as a point of reference. Western medicine's anatomical position is that of someone standing straight up, feet about shoulder width apart, with the palms facing forward (as a result of the shoulder turning the palms this way - NOT supination from the elbow.)</p>
<p>Eastern anatomical position is the same, except that the arms are raised, as if to make a circle shape around the head (although the hands do not touch.) In this position, the palms also face forward.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The joints have positions called open and closed pack. Basically, “closed Pack” is the position that is a lock and there’s only one movement pattern to get out. “Open pack” is the position that position that the body defaults to when injured and often has more movement options possible. So strictly speaking about the body’s joints, the default is to go to an open pack position for comfort. For any given joint, it’s the position you go to if that area is injured.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Related answer for you, there is a &quot;usual location&quot; for internal organs that most people follow, known in the business as <em>situs solitus</em>. There's also a condition called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situs_inversus" target="_blank">situs inversus</a>, &quot;a congenital condition in which the major visceral organs are reversed or mirrored from their normal positions&quot;. The condition is exceedingly rare, but an <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47871888" target="_blank">Oregon woman who died in 2017</a> donated her body to science and was found to have situs inversus with levocardia (heart in the correct place).</p>
<p>I asked a doctor what goes on when doctors &quot;run the bowel&quot; looking for obstructions. They will make a small incision and thread the intestines out of the body where they can be felt and inspected from end to end. Then, his words, they feed the intestines back into the hole and jiggle the patient side to side until they slosh themselves back into place. Apparently having a garden hose inside you for your entire life does crimp the hose into a certain shape, to which it will return on its own with a little help.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
