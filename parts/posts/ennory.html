		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my state, every student must be offered a dictionary during standardized testing. The dictionaries do last  years, but it's a school, so they get ripped or tossed around or graffitied. Even if only one-twentieth of them need replacing each year, though, that's still hundreds of thousands of copies. Probably more sales than your average novel. I don't think dictionaries are hurting for money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I might find myself arguing that because X meant Y 100 years ago, the new definition it doesn't include situations involving Z, today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I know it was a big deal to get a set in the 70's. I now prefer using the web, but I have to say, the kid me loved the feel of those tomes. And the pictures were so awesome. Oh and the Atlas was cool too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
