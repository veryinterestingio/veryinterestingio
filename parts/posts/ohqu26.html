A flint knife is substantially different from a modern metal one, while mortar-and-pestle are almost identical to Stone Age tools.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the British Museum there's a set of Greek medical instruments, made of bronze, from about 200 BC. Many of them - forceps, retractors, and so forth - look pretty similar, right down to the locking jaw mechanism, to those used today. </p>
<p>The ones which particularly caught my eye were a set of tubes, of various gauges, with a very particular gentle s-curve. They were <em>identical</em> - apart from being bronze, rather than nickel-plated steel - to the early-twentieth century set that my great-grandfather carried in his medical bag. </p>
<p>What were they? Catheters.</p>
<p>I guess that doesn't <em>quite</em> count, because we use slightly more-flexible plastic, now - which, I guess must be a <em>little</em> more comfortable for the patient? They amazed me, though, by demonstrating the sophistication of Classical practical anatomy (and manufacturing), and by how long a particularly well-adapted form remained in use.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
