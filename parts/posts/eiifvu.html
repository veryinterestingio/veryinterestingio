		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: Your individual muscle cells are repeatedly contracting and relaxing and that burns energy.</p>
<p>Ahh yes, the old physics class debate over the meaning of the word &quot;work&quot;. The solution here is to realize that you actually are doing work when you try to move a wall, it just depends on the context you're looking at.  If you are looking at you and the wall, sure, you haven't done any work.  However, if you could look at your muscle fibers, you'd find that there's quite a bit of work going on.</p>
<p>Skeletal muscles aren't like a hydraulic cylinder, they don't apply smooth, continuous force.  Instead, they're made up of groups of muscle cells often referred to as <em>motor units</em> that activate at different stages of the muscle contraction.  When your aren't fatigued, movement feels smooth, because all of the motor units are contracting in an overlapping fashion.  When you're pushing against an immovable object, however, your motor units will individually get fatigued quite quickly, and &quot;take turns&quot; dropping out, and then reactivating.  This means that even if your body isn't actually moving, your individual muscle fibers are using up energy contracting and then relaxing when they get fatigued, and then contracting again.  This is also the source of the shakiness you get if you try to lift too much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While to a first approximation there is no transfer of energy to the wall because there is no macroscopic wall movement, this doesn't gel with the intuitive fact that you get tired if you push on a wall, and energy must be conserved. Your muscles and the wall both flex a little bit, with energy going into distorting the bonds in them just a little. When force is released, that energy going into distorting the bonds is released and ends up as heat in both the wall and your body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many of the explanations here fail to take into account elasticity. When you push an object but don’t yet move it, you are fighting against two forces, the static friction of the surface that the object is on, and the elasticity of the object itself. Until you overcome friction, your work will be absorbed by deflection of the object. When you stop pushing, some of that work will be returned as the object returns to its original shape (hopefully, otherwise you’ve dented it...). </p>
<p>Elasticity is the same reason that the floor “knows” what just the right amount of force is to hold up the wall.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is not correct that “since you continuously apply a force to it there needs to be some sort of energy transfer.” A book resting on a table continuously applies a force to the table, but there is no energy transfer.</p>
<p>When you <strong>start</strong> applying the force, you push against the wall. Flesh, muscles, and other materials in your body will compress, so you use some energy to do that. The material of the wall will compress slightly, and you use some energy to do that. Some of the energy exerted while compressing your body and the wall will be stored as potential energy, as in springs (when released, your flesh and the wall will spring back), and some will be lost as heat.</p>
<p>While you are merely <strong>holding</strong> the force against the wall (assuming you are completely still, neglecting microscopic motions), you are not transferring any energy to the wall. Energy is being consumed in feeding your cells, operating your muscles, and so on, but that has nothing to do with the wall. (Your muscles use energy when pushing even though they are not moving because there is motion on a cellular level; nutrients are going in, waste is going out, and so on. And I think muscles vibrate when they exert force, although I do not have a reference for that.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
