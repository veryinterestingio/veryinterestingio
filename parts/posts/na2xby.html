		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The fact that they're both bulbs doesn't mean that anything bulb-shaped is either tasty or safe.</p>
<p>Onions and garlic are both in the same family, &quot;allium&quot;.  Several other alliums are also edible and share broadly similar flavor profiles: scallions, shallots, and chives, for example.  To be clear though, there are poisonous alliums too - the entire family isn't generically safe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Onions and garlic share a family classification with other types of lilies that have similar bulbs.</p>
<p>The problem is that most lilies are poisonous to humans. Onions and garlic are actually the exceptions that we can consume (but they are also toxic to our furry pets). They are unique because they give a onion-y or garlic-y smell while other lilies do not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They just have strong umami flavours which come from naturally occurring glutamate. Kinda like how MSG makes food taste better. And they release sugars during the cooking for process which adds to the intense and complex flavours. Also smell makes up a good portion of taste perception,and garlic is fragrant</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
