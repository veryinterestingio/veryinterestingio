For those that have said they had mild symptoms, was this mainly because they were infected with a small amount of virus vs. Someone who say inhaled a lot of virions? Or are severity of symptoms independent of viral load and strictly based upon immune system?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your question has two questions within it: 1. does viral load contribute to severity, and 2. does the dose of virus from the initial infection contribute to severity. These are two separate questions.
Question 1: as far as we’ve seen, patients with worse symptoms typically present with higher viral loads in several studies. However, this is still a relatively new and ongoing pandemic with a variety of factors that may contribute to both severity and viral load, particularly different genetic backgrounds from across the world, so this is still being investigated.
Question 2: this is harder to answer, both for me and for scientists (so far). Generally speaking, in vivo mouse studies or in vitro cell culture studies can be easily used to attempt to answer this question: throw different sized doses and see what happens. For most viruses higher initial dose usually reflects with higher severity, and it is so far suspected that COVID-19 is no different. There are exceptions of course - Epstein Barr virus has more difficulty establishing latent infection of B cells with too high of a dose for example. As far as I’ve seen this question has not been directly answered as of yet though with SARS-COV-2. We can’t exactly determine the dose people receive and for ethical reasons we can’t test it on people, but a mouse model would address this nicely.</p>
<p>TLDR; higher viral load seems to correlate with worse symptom severity but we don’t know just yet the doses for SARS-COV-2 in people to correlate with worse outcomes and so on for sure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nothing to cite although I believe the data is available and could probably be found with a Google search, but I have read that a) more severe symptoms correlate with a higher viral load and b) lower viral loads and difficulty detecting via PCR correspond with milder clinical symptoms.</p>
<p>However - whatever is found should be taken with a grain of salt.  Some people, like children, may just have some level of inherent resistance, where the virus replicates with difficulty and the host shows little or no clinical signs. In others who are more susceptible, like the elderly, the virus is able to replicate very efficiently and symptoms are severe.</p>
<p>What I'm saying is don't try to correlate a low viral exposure to fewer symptoms, or a high viral exposure to more severe symptoms even if that seems to be the case. It's going to be much more complicated than that.  Most people are probably exposed to a dose within 1-2 log viral titers and symptoms still vary widely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know any useful references that directly address your question, but this article examines 2 strains of COVID and finds that the more prevalent one now is associated with higher viral load. (See the Figure titled &quot;Cycle Threshold (Ct) for Diagnostic PCR&quot; which appears most of the way down on its own page).</p>
<p>The authors argue that the higher viral load probably reflects a genetic mutation that allows the strain to infect cells more easily and therefore replicate and produce a higher viral load more easily.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Early on, during the inception of the pandemic in New York city, the New Yorker published a very interesting read about viral load. The article was penned by the famous scientific writer Siddhartha Mukherjee: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/06/how-does-the-coronavirus-behave-inside-a-patient" target="_blank">https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/06/how-does-the-coronavirus-behave-inside-a-patient</a></p>
<p>The idea of “viral load” relevance in the context of disease severity initially faced among scientist with the incident multiple causalities among an Italian family in NJ. </p>
<p>Others have used the very same incident to make a strong case for the perceived role of genetics. </p>
