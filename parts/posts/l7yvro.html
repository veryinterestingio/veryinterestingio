Fuel is present, air is there..spark plugs are ...sparking ..and as long as you have a strong battery the starter is turning the engine...why the struggle?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Batteries are powered by chemical reactions that make an electric current as a product.  Most chemical reactions occur much slower in cold temperatures.  Slower reaction = less electricity generated per second.  Less electricity per second means your car can't make enough sparks to ignite the fuel in your engine, which means it can't start.</p>
<p>If you have a strong battery, these effects are small, unless you're in like, <em>really, really</em> cold weather.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Another user pointed out that sparkplugs don't actually carry the current to the engine to make it start.  That's done by a separate motor carrying an inrush current.  It's still an issue with current, just not with sparkplugs</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> Those claiming that engines won't start at low temps because of oil being more viscous or that moving solids are packed closer together and introduce friction as a result aren't <em>completely</em> wrong, but it's not the primary reason for this occurrence.  The density of a liquid or solid (such as motor oil or the metals used in your engine) does change with temperature, but the scale at which this occurs is not enough to prevent your engine from starting (at least for the majority of cars on the road).  It is enough, however, to increase the amount of work required by your engine to do its job, which would increase the current needed to start your engine. You'll also have lower gas mileage when your engine is cold vs warm for the same reason.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would add that the majority of the power being used when starting your car is used just to get the engine moving. In ancient cars this was done with a hand crank on the front of the car. Eventually this was replaced by the electric starters we use now that uses electricity that spins a gear that engages the flywheel to get the engine to start turning.</p>
<p>Getting that flywheel turning takes a lot of force (energy). Think of starting your lawnmower and how much force that takes. That’s just one small, low compression piston. Now imagine the force (energy) that it would take to start much larger, higher compression engines especially ones that are turbocharged. That’s a lot of force or energy that is required to be converted from electricity to mechanical force.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Running a full or advanced synthetic oil will assist with preventing your oil from freezing/thickening up to allow the cylinders to move easier. Most forget to do this if recommended by the manufacturer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
