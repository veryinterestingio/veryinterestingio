Well what was the region like a few thousand years ago when those sandstorms weren't happening?</p>
<p>Was it it's own dessert?  Or did the Amazon river support a river plain like the Mississippi River basin in the US and Canada?</p></div></div>

It was never a climax forest but has varied between extreme desert that it is today and open savannah grassland in different climate periods.
