		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During the last ice age, massive species roamed between ice sheets.  One leading idea is that the ice age reduced seasonality, or the change in temperature and weather from one season to the next.  This allowed animals to graze all year round, and meant predators had to grow in turn.  As the ice age ended and seasonality came back, these massive animals couldn't support their bodies with the nutrients they needed and died out.  That combined with humans starting to hunt in bigger scales around that time wiped them out.  </p>
<p>Some examples of this 'megafauna' are the giant ground sloth and north american lion.</p>
<p>Edit: a few more cool megafauna to look up are the cave bear (bigger than any bear alive now), spotted hyena, megafaunal wolves, and european leopard</p>
<p>Edit 2: a few people seem to have read Yuval Harrari's book Sapiens and take the same line as him in saying humans were the primary cause of these extinctions.  I think that at this point it is very hard to make that claim for many reasons, these being a couple:  species populations aren't known as well as we would like back then.  It might be the case that ground sloths went extinct as humans arrived, but it's not clear whether their populations were already dwindling at that point due to climactic change as seems to be the case with other species.  Also human migration was so closely entangled with climactic changes that teasing the two apart is very hard; the cases that do exist are not as cut and dry as we would like of we were making the strong claim that humans were the most important factor.  Harrari is not wrong, but he's not certainly right.</p>
<p>Fortunately this last point can't be applied to the current extinctions we are seeing today, meaning we do have the capability to try to slow it down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've responded to similar questions before, but I think this topic does bring up some interesting points of discussion.  Sorry if this goes beyond ELI5 a bit, but I'll do my best to keep it understandable.  To start off, I am personally not aware of any overarching trend of decreasing body size over time.  Yes, there are some examples for large extinct members of particular groups of organisms; <a href="https://external-preview.redd.it/ysU0H6bp6YUhyQINcS4ptPW1EShs4Ld2LGzyzAjgAdc.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=429f29def769e329a6b6cf904dc5bbf69f9b50fb" target="_blank">giant insects</a> of the Carboniferous, <a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51bf1cd3e4b0a897bf54112b/t/51c1cef1e4b01e46e939ee7e/1371655924515/Thunder+Lizards+4+blog.jpg?format=1500w" target="_blank">giant dinosaurs</a> of the Jurassic/Cretaceous, and various more recently extinct <a href="http://billhenderson.org/PuzzleHunt/other/megafauna.jpg" target="_blank">mammalian megafauna</a> are the most common examples most people think of.  However, these three sets of organisms are very distantly related, and all reached their largest sizes at completely different times, so there really doesn't seem to be any big connecting explanation that unites them.</p>
<p>For one thing, there are biases in the fossil record that make large species easier to discover than their smaller relatives.  This is due to a combination of the fact that bigger animals are less likely to have their remains entirely destroyed (e.g., by just being swallowed whole), and also are probably easier for palaeontologists to find just because, well, big things are easier to see than small things.  Check out <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/34/4/241/129498/completeness-of-the-fossil-record-estimating?redirectedFrom=PDF" target="_blank">this paper</a> for a nicely written example of bias towards molluscs with larger body sizes for example.</p>
<p>However, there is another form of bias that in my opinion goes a lot further towards explaining this idea, and that is the bias of public perception.  The average person is just more likely to be interested in the most extreme examples of any group of animals, and body size is one of the easiest traits to very easily compare across species.  I'm not saying this is inherently bad or anything, but it's just human nature to find the biggest, scariest, or whatever-est animals the most worthy of our attention.  There's an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_organisms#Animals" target="_blank">entire Wikipedia page</a> dedicated to discussing the largest members of various groups of organisms, for example, so clearly this is something people like to think about.</p>
<p>Additionally, I would like to put forward a simple mathematical argument which demonstrates how increased <em>variation</em> in body size can appear as an increase in <em>average</em> body size.  Humans are not very good at thinking intuitively on logarithmic scales, and sometimes this can lead to inaccurate perceptions of the world.  Imagine a group of animals that starts from a common ancestor of modest body size (say 10 kilograms).  This group then splits into three lineages, one of which is 10 times larger, one of which keeps the same body size, and the last of which becomes 10 times smaller.  The mean body size of these three groups will have increased significantly (3.7 times larger than the original), and yet there has not been a net trend to larger body  size, since another lineage evolved that was smaller than the ancestor to the same degree that the other descendant lineage has become larger.  This example is partially inspired by an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/385199a0.pdf" target="_blank">article by Gould</a> on psychological biases when looking at these kinds of trends.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the answers focus on the ancient past as does your question.   It's worth pointing out that animal size is shrinking in the recent past too.  Humans hunted and ate a lot of the larger species like giant sloths.  Remaining species are smaller because it's more trouble for less meat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming you're talking about dinosaurs, though it doesn't really matter.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the Jurassic period there were increased levels of carbon dioxide, which means more CO2 available for plant growth. It is believed that there were higher levels of plant populations which would allow bigger primary consumers to be supported, thus bigger secondary and tertiary consumers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Natural selection: (some) bigger hervibores may have an advantage over smaller ones because they are less likely to be predated on. So they ard more likely to survive and pass on their genes (which made them grow larger) to the next generations. Larger predators may have an advantage over smaller ones because they are able to predate on larger prey, so similarly they can pass on their genes to the next generation. (This is super simplified and there are many other factors in play such as speed, amount of food needed for survival, etc but I hope you get my point)</p>
</li>
<li>Sexual selection: bigger mates might be more attractive so they reproduce more and pass on more of their &quot;big&quot; genes (once again size is controlled by more than one gene but bear with me). Bigger mates might have an advantage when fighting with competitors for a mate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also I think I might read somewhere that dibosaurs had hollow bones which would make them lighter and thus more easily able to support their weight.</p>
<p>Also also note that I'm only talking about the giant dinosaurs, there were plenty of relatively small ones.</p>
<p>Also also also note that the largest animal to have ever lived is actually the blue whale! It is able to support its weight because of buoyancy.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: Im not a paleontologist or biologist, so please correct me if I've made any mistakes! Hope this helped.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
