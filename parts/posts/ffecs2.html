		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, we need to make sure we know what an earthquake is:  it’s the buildup and sudden release of energy causes by two tectonic plates interacting with each other in any direction.  </p>
<p>The boundaries between tectonic plates are not a clean, uniform “slice” like you would make in a cake.  The boundaries are more like what you see if you dropped a dinner plate and it cracked in half.  The edges will be random and have parts that go to one side or the other.  Still, for the most part the plates interact smoothly, and areas that sit on top of them have multiple “micro quakes” on a daily basis, as the plates move.  Sometimes, however, there is an interaction between the two at a point where neither side is able to move; this causes a buildup of (potential) energy.  When one side finally gives way, there is a release of energy from that single, relatively small point, which is the “epicenter”. This release of energy causes shockwaves (for lack of a better term) to travel outward from the point of release, kind of like ripples in a pond; those waves are the actual earthquake</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the edges of the tectonic plates press against each other, the bedrock at the edges may shift or crumble, but certain areas build up potential energy.</p>
<p>Eventually that energy can be released violently in bursts creating earthquakes and aftershocks. These geological vibrations actually occur along a lenglth of the fault or at multiple points, but the epicenter is not necessarily the &quot;point of origin&quot; of an earthquake. Rather it is the averaged locus of activity. It would be impractical to try to relate all the data of relative motion along the fault to the layperson, so the &quot;epicenter&quot; is the approximate middle point of the area affected by geological turbulance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Earthquakes are rarely the entire giant plate moving. They're usually not even right on the edge between two plates. Rather, they happen along cracks in the bedrock (called faults) <em>near</em> the actual plate edges that are much smaller than the entire plate boundary. But even then, most earthquakes aren't from movement along the entire fault.</p>
<p>Faults are very rough surfaces with lots of friction (like velcro), so when an earthquake happens it usually happens in a relatively small area of the fault. Small enough to look like a point on a map. But if you could zoom in enough, you would see it's still an <strong>area</strong> of the fault the moved, not just a <strong>point</strong>. So you're thinking along the right lines!</p>
<p>In fact, with very large earthquakes (the ones that <em>do</em> happen at the actual plate boundaries) like the 2004 Boxing Day Earthquake in Sumatra, geophysicists have mapped out what parts of the plates actually did the moving, like here:  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Slip-maps-of-the-December-26-2004-and-March-28-2005-Sumatra-earthquakes-with_fig1_239556479" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Slip-maps-of-the-December-26-2004-and-March-28-2005-Sumatra-earthquakes-with\_fig1\_239556479" target="_blank">https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Slip-maps-of-the-December-26-2004-and-March-28-2005-Sumatra-earthquakes-with\_fig1\_239556479</a></a>. The epicenter points (stars) show where each earthquake <em>started</em> moving, but the colors show everywhere that moved, and how much. The earthquake itself was actually a lot like the earth zipping up: it started zipping up at the star, then kept zipping northward. Interesting fact about that earthquake, the area that &quot;zipped&quot; is approximately the same size as the area that could get &quot;zipped&quot; in the Pacific Northwest.  (<a href="https://archive.usgs.gov/archive/sites/soundwaves.usgs.gov/2005/03/outreach.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://archive.usgs.gov/archive/sites/soundwaves.usgs.gov/2005/03/outreach.html" target="_blank">https://archive.usgs.gov/archive/sites/soundwaves.usgs.gov/2005/03/outreach.html</a></a> )</p>
<p>By the way, aftershocks are the (usually) smaller earthquakes that happen after the main one because the rock on either side of the fault isn't done shifting around. The main earthquake moved the rock in one area, which made another area unstable, so it moves too. Then another, and another. Aftershocks can happen for days or weeks after a big earthquake.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of sliding two uneven pieces of wood past each other. One piece gets snagged on the other. You keep applying force, eventually the spot where they are snagged breaks and the wood moves quickly. This is an earthquake along a transform boundary like the San Andreas fault. The spot that snagged is the epicenter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
