		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our lungs exchange O2 with CO2, but not all of it. </p>
<p>Going in, the air is: 78% Nitrogen, 21% oxygen and .04% CO2. </p>
<p>Coming out its: still 78% Nitrogen, but now ~15% oxygen and 5% CO2. So there's still oxygen in it. </p>
<p>If you're performing assisted breathing on someone its because they can't breath on their own. So the 15% O2 you're <em>forcing</em> into their lungs is better than whatever little they're getting on their own account.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's very rare for rescuers to perform mouth to mouth these days. Most models of arrest management in developed countries with robust emergency services systems have moved towards hands only CPR. We'll still deliver oxygen, but it's from a bottle through a face mask or a breathing tube. The initial bystander rescuers should be focusing on quality compressions and clearing the airway rather than performing mouth to mouth. Yes, we breathe out enough oxygen for the patient to use as others have stated. In this day and age, it's generally not required as compressions are far more important.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Normal air is about 21% oxygen, 0.1% carbon dioxide, and a bunch of other stuff. The air we breathe out has about 4% carbon dioxide and 16% oxygen. We do not consume all the oxygen or breathe out pure carbon dioxide. That does cut down on the amount of oxygen a CPR recipient receives a bit, but forcing someone to breathe 16% oxygen is better than them not breathing in any oxygen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because your body doesn't consume all of the oxygen in the air. So when you exhale into someone else's lungs there is still oxygen present.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
