		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello! We are evolutionary biologists from the University of Tennessee with a wide variety of research backgrounds. We are here celebrating a belated Darwin Day, which commemorates the birthday of Charles Darwin each year on February 12. Joining us today are: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Krista De Cooke, PhD student</strong> (u/kdec940) studies the spread of invasive plants and native plant alternatives. Her work aims to develop practical tools to help people select appropriate plants for their needs that also serve a positive ecological purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stephanie Drumheller, PhD</strong> (/u/uglyfossils) studies paleontology, especially taphonomy. Her research focuses on the processes of fossilization, evolution, and biology, of crocodiles and their relatives, including identifying bite marks on fossils. Find her on Twitter @UglyFossils.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Amy Luo, PhD student</strong> (u/borb_watcher) is a behavioral ecologist studying the cultural evolution of bird song dialects. She is interested in the geographic distribution of cultural traits and interaction between cultural evolution and genetic evolution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Brian O'Meara, PhD</strong> (/u/omearabrian) is an evolutionary biologist at the University of Tennessee and President-Elect of the Society of Systematic Biologists. His research focuses on methods to study how traits have changed over time and their potential impact on other traits as well as speciation and extinction. Find him on Twitter @omearabrian and the web at <a href="http://brianomeara.info" target="_blank">http://brianomeara.info</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Dan Simberloff, PhD</strong> (u/kdec940) is a leader in the field of invasion biology and the Nancy Gore Hunger Professor of Environmental Studies at the University of Tennessee. He studies the patterns displayed by species introduced outside their geographic ranges, the impacts such species have on the communities they invade, and the means by which such invasions can be managed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask us anything!</p>
<p>We will be answering questions starting around 5pm Eastern Time, 10 UTC.</p></div></div>

As an example, chimpanzees gestate for about the same time but their babies are much more physically able than humans. Is this only due to head size?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Ok, over the last decade or so Epigenetics has been becoming more talked about where inherited traits and expression are concerned. Is this just a case of pop-science or is Epigenetics legitimately being found to be increasingly important in terms of evolutionary genetic expression?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello, thank you for joining us! I have a few questions, if that's okay.</p>
<p>For the invasive species folks: It seems like it's really hard to get ahead of a highly invasive species, and that removal methods may not be enough. What sort of research can be done to get ahead of that and possibly improve the odds of eradication? What sort of management strategies and decisions need to be made when eradication isn't possible?</p>
<p>For Amy Luo: The evolution of bird song traits sounds absolutely fascinating, and I would love to know more about that. Do you need to quantify specific aspects of the songs, for example? How do you do that?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
