		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The immunity generated from the first dose doesnâ€™t magically go away. The second dose is there to build on the work of the first dose and remind your immune system what does the enemy look like. In more technical terms, the first dose generates IgM antibodies that serve as an immediate response to the foreign protein your body has encountered, but to build a lasting immune memory, IgG antibodies need to be made. The first dose does a good job at generating those IgM and a bit of IgG. The second dose will boost that IgG production.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, its your immune system in school. The first dose is the first lecture. It teaches your cells what the enemy looks like. There's a baby quiz, maybe. Not much at stake.</p>
<p>The second dose is the actual test. Your cells have to prove they actually studied (which of course they have, because they remember the material) so they do REALLY we on the test. I.e., you have worse systems on test day than at the original lecture. They never forget, though, they're just...practicing. they're not really pros until they get tested.</p>
<p>At least, that's how I think of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>From the Pfizer vaccine, you are 52% protected after the first dose and 95% protected after the second. Like others have said, the first dose initiates the immune response while the second refines it. Most likely other vaccines will follow the same pattern of reduced protection after a single dose, then full protection after the second.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
