		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>More of an ELI10 - Generally in the body, histamine is released in response to an allergen and is involved in the subsequent inflammatory response (what we know as &quot;allergies&quot;). In the brain, however, some of the neurons that are involved with wakefulness, also respond to histamine to keep us awake (histaminergic neurons). When we block histamine in the brain, they're less active, hence we get sleepy.</p>
<p>We generally divide anti-histamine drugs by their selectivity. 1st gen drugs (ex. Benedryl) are rather nonselective and act on both histamine receptors in the brain (making us sleepy) and in the periphery (damping the allergic response). 2nd gen drugs (ex. Clarithin, Allergra, Zyrtec, etc.) are more selective for the peripheral receptors and less so the central ones in the brain.</p>
<p><strong>The answer to your title question:</strong> in reality, the division is not as black and white, rather more of a spectrum. Some 2nd-gen antihistamines have more central effect on the brain than others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I haven't seen anyone mention the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">blood-brain barrier</a> which essentially filters what reaches the brain.</p>
<p>Anti-histamines like cetirizine (zirtec) only minimally cross the blood-brain barrier, whereas first-generation drugs cross it very easily, and so more reliably make people sleepy. But the BBB isn't the same for everyone, so some drugs will cross more easily in some people than others.</p>
<p>In general, any drug that crosses the BBB either increases wakefulness or increases sleepiness. It's also the usual answer as to 'why does this drug make me feel very sleepy / wakeful / happy / sad?' - because it crosses the BBB. This can then lead into a conversation about ionization and polarity, but only if you know a really interesting anaesthetist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
