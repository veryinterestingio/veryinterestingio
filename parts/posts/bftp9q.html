		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its if the fever gets too high. </p>
<p>So the body raises its internal temperature to break the intruder's metabolism and chemical processes because odds are they work best at 37.5°C (norm. Human body temp). When the body raises its metabolism its temperature goes up, 38-39°C which is enough to totally mess up the way the intruder functions. </p>
<p>But if it doesnt work and the body temp keeps rising 39-40°C+ our cells now start to break down and stop functioning. Brain cells are especially sensitive to temperature changes. </p>
<p>Temps are based on adult temperatures, baby temps are a little different</p>
<p>Edit: thanks for the feedback guys :) </p>
<p>Great question btw OP</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just recovering from a 105.5 fever (40.8 C). Curious why the body goes that high? Like shouldn't it have a limiter or something? Or does it and some bugs override that function? </p>
<p>Is it a feedback loop that misses its exit clause? </p>
<p>I just reeeaaally want to avoid that experience again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>imersial's response is great – just wanted to chime in that another way to think about it is that fevers work on the same principle chemo/radiation treatments do for cancer. namely, they're bad for <em>all</em> cells; we use those treatments in the hopes that the cancer cells will die before the healthy ones do, but chemo/radiation can and do also make patients really sick because they're harming the healthy cells as well. the same is true on a different scale for fevers and bacteria! when it works right, it kills off bacteria before your healthy cells are harmed, but the same thing that makes it bad for bacteria makes it potentially bad for you as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a medical perspective, fevers are really used as a measure of the bodies response to the pathogen rather than something dangerous that we need to correct. It’s only at very high levels that things get dangerous. That’s due to a set functional range for our own proteins, which deform when the environment around them changes too much.</p>
<p>When I was on my peds rotation, the head of the department asked me why we were treating this patients mild fever (100.6). The answer? Because it makes us (the doctors and the parents) feel better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
