		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's mostly to do with your distance from the strike. THe closer you are the more directly the sound reaches you. The further you are the more terrain, atmospheric layers, buildings, etc the sound can reflect from and refract through. This leads to a lengthening of the perceived sound. It's also worth nothing that quite often strikes occur in clusters, and you can get an enhanced rolling effect which is actaully the overlapping of multiple strike sounds.</p>
<p>If you go to www.lightningmaps.org - this will show you strike locations and estimates of the propagating sound waves -  and zoom all the way in on current active storms you will see lots of locations experiencing overlapping sound waves from surrounding strikes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure the other answers are part right but acoustics probably play a big role. What the sound waves bounce off of and how they overlap and the temperature/humidity of the air are all going to alter the transmission speed/attenuation of different frequencies and how those frequencies are going to interact at the specific location you are in. That probably isn't an ELI5 answer...:-(</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>interestingly, an old timey method of telling how far a storm was from town would be to watch as the lightning strikes then count how many seconds it took to hear the boom. generally speaking each second equates to about a mile.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
