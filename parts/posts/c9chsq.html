A black hole has also been found that was ejected from it's galaxy. Sometimes instead of merging they'll circle each other and one accelerates enough to be <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/gravitational-wave-kicks-monster-black-hole-out-of-galactic-core" target="_blank">ejected</a> from the other's gravitational pull.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You can't do a proper <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16jr7WWGSxo" target="_blank">slingshot maneuver</a> with just two objects. You can do a hard (hyperbolic) turn with just two, but you need a third object to gain speed relative to the primary. It doesn't matter if the primary is a black hole.</p>
<p>At least some hypervelocity stars <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gtie6QD-3CY" target="_blank">start as binaries</a> where one partner becomes <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/yO1rAc7" target="_blank">trapped circling the black hole</a> and the other is yeeted out of the galaxy at ~0.2% of the speed of light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If there was a planet orbiting a star while this happened and say the planet was orbiting the star at a somewhat equal angle to how a black hole was pulling on the star as it rotated around it when the planet’s orbit comes between the star and black hole would the black hole pull the planet “back” or slightly off orbit each time it orbits around inbetween the Sun and black hole?</p>
<p>For example. Let’s say a planets orbit is 300 days. When the planet goes between the star and black hole each “year” would the planets “year” get slightly longer each time?</p>
<p>Say that planet had a civilization with time keeping technology. Would...say those days or weeks be slightly longer and Elongated each time the orbits happen due to the black hole pulling harder then the star?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
