When they are done they will go lay their eggs (often on decaying plant matter) and then typically die. Some species are attracted to street lights and the like others are not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When female gnats are ready to reproduce they release a hormone that attracts males.  Swarming is the result.  They will often do this above an object, like a fence post or even someone's head.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It can't just be mating.  In my brother's back yard in Michigan, there is a 6-8 foot tall &quot;column&quot; of gnats, in fact I call them column gnats.  They have held the same position for years over the summer, generation after generation.  In fact, if you walk into the mist of it, thyey just move up above your head, then return after you step out of their zone.  They are there all summer, so it's can't just be mating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
