		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the dollar store readers are not made to correct hyperopia (“farsightedness”); they are made to correct presbyopia (the loss of focusing flexibility that hits all of us in our early 40s). Presbyopia occurs in all of us in a relatively equal way, so making a standardized power for presbyopia is easy.</p>
<p>Basically, the cheater readers are making the assumption that the wearer has perfect distance vision, and simply brings the focal point forward to a comfortable reading distance.</p>
<p>Now, plus power lenses that correct for presbyopia also happen to help with hyperopia. However, unless your hyperopia just coincidentally happens to be equal between your eyes, free of astigmatism, and of a small enough amount, the readers are only partially correcting it. It may be better than nothing, or even good enough for practical use in many cases, but they do not usually fully or adequately correct the hyperope’s vision.</p>
<p>As far as myopia (“nearsightedness”) goes, its generally too unique to the individual to standardize in a “drug store reader” kind of way. Plus if people are self-diagnosing/correcting myopia, they almost always tend to overcorrect it, making them prone to eyestrain, headaches, and if they are young enough, a worsening of their prescription. In fact a huge part of the refraction procedure (“one or two?”) is making sure the patient hasn’t overcorrected themselves.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nearsightedness needs to be corrected precisely so that objects at infinity are in focus. Each eye may need a different correction and there may be astigmatism as well. Farsightedness just needs to be corrected for a comfortable reading distance.  A limited analogy is that it is like buying and using magnifying glass vs  a camera or projector lens.</p>

<p>&quot;In 2019, LensCrafters founder E. Dean Butler spoke to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times" target="_blank"><em>Los Angeles Times</em></a>,  admitting that Luxottica's dominance of the eyewear industry had  resulted in price markups of nearly 1,000%. In the interview, Butler  noted &quot;You can get amazingly good frames, with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warby_Parker" target="_blank">Warby Parker</a>  level of quality, for $4 to $8. For $15, you can get designer-quality  frames, like what you’d get from Prada.” When told that some eyeglasses  cost as much as $800 in the United States, Butler remarked, “I know.  It’s ridiculous. It’s a complete rip-off.”  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing that is being overlooked is that monopolization of prescription eyeglass companies as well.  This also drives up the cost.</p>
<p>For reading glasses while reading a book, if you cannot see clearly, you can simply move the book closer or farther away.  This is not possible with a street sign.  So, reading glasses can be standardized.  It is also a different kind of deficiency.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
