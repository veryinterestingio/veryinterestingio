		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We assume that quarks are the smallest particle available to the universe (currently). From what I understand, there are a few reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Anything that is a quark cannot be on it's own (meaning we can't break them apart to look at them individually, thus pull more information than is available). This is due to something called Color Confinement. Without getting into the mathematics, the amount of energy needed to pull apart quark pairs would instantly create new quarks. But even if we COULD separate them, we'd have nothing to use to visibly examine them as they're smaller than anything we can currently use to view objects (smaller than electrons so no electron scanning, etc.). Of course, this wouldn't really a big issue because we have other ways of detecting things that are invisible to the electromagnetic spectrum, but it would definitely put a damper on things.</li>
<li>Our understanding of the universe and reality is based on mathematical models and do not represent reality fully. Basically, our understanding of what goes on at subatomic levels is guessed upon using our observations and tests in our macroscale world. Our models have been correct so far, but they don't account for everything and a discovery in the future could change how we see things.</li>
<li>We will always be asking &quot;and then what&quot;. That's the fundamental foundation of Science. Once we fully understand our Universe (if we ever do), we'll be at a point where we can look beyond.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT 1: Wow, this is my first silver. Thank you kind soul! I wonder what it breaks into...</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Atoms don't wear clothing.</p>
<p>EDIT 3: I LOVE GOOOOOOLD. (can I add a flair for GoldMember to my name?)</p>
<p>EDIT 4: It's been brought to my attention by actual theoretical physicists (as they say they are) that my simplification has some inconsistencies. I'd like to touch on this briefly without going into too much detail.</p>
<p>There are terms I've used in this explanation that do not precisely line up with reality. For instance, calling the quark the &quot;smallest&quot; particle isn't specifically true due to other particles being much smaller in terms of mass and intrinsic energy. I've done these types of changes not to confuse or lead astray, but because the alternative (the actual math and explanation of systems) is the exact opposite of what ELI5 is supposed to represent. I'm attempting to explain extremely complicated ideas second hand without delving into other mechanics that are necessary to understand precisely why these things work the way they do. </p>
<p>So instead of trying to fix all my errors and correct my terms, I implore that you take this as a foundation and do your own research. There are tons of resources available online that can help you understand the nitty gritty.</p>
<p>PBS Spacetime has a YouTube channel where they discuss the fabric of Spacetime (;p).</p>
<p>Fermilab is another great example, also can be found on YouTube.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What about in the other direction?  If we know an atom is a discreet object with things revolving around other things, and we know a solar system is a distinct entity with things revolving around other things, and we know a galaxy is a distinct entity with things revolving around other things....and we know that in each case there's a relative fuckton of empty space between distinct entities, is there any reason whatsoever to believe that our 'known' universe isn't just a distinct entity amongst innumerable other distinct entities?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have such a hard time getting my arms around the idea that we are all here, and conscious, and we know there exists quantum sub particles and waves (or whatever that soup is) which are ultimately the building blocks of our very selves, the core of our capability for being conscious, yet we don't know what they are nor how they got there (not really at least). </p>
<p>Another way of putting it is to say, there is a set of basic particles and waves, energy if you will, that combine and organize over and over to form particles, atoms, molecules, cells, organs, and eventually &quot;living&quot; beings which are capable (almost capable) of understanding their own building blocks. </p>
<p>We are sets of energy aware of our underlying base energy forms. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
