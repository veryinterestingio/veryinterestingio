		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like closing an interstate highway.  If I-95 suddenly disappeared, you could still drive from Miami to New York; you'd just have to take alternative (longer) paths, and you would be further slowed by all the other cars taking that route instead of I-95.</p>
<p>Internet routing works the same way.  There are redundancies built into the system, whereby traffic will take an alternative path if its preferred route is blocked.  Now if ALL the cables got cut and there were no alternative paths to take, then yes.  The affected continents would be effectively cut off from each other for internet purposes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cuting the cable cuts the internet. But it depends on the country. Cuting the internet to France is difficult, as there are multiple cables connecting France to other countries. But less developped countries are vulnerable. A few years ago, a cable was cut down in southern France, shutting down internet in most of Africa. Although backup cables existed, they couldn't handle all of the traffic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the chief design goals of the internet was its durability. The internet as it exists now, particularly with the web, is very different in design and purpose than its origins as a tool for military communications during the Cold Wars. </p>
<p>The goal was that there was no &quot;central hub.&quot; There isn't even a singular internet. It's just various communication tools connected to one another. If one gets cut off, that's not going to crash the whole system. You could split it in two, and each half will function perfectly fine, just as if you had simply disconnected one device.</p>
<p>While there's been a lot of infrastructure built up around the internet that does give elements of centralization to various extents (see what happens when AWS or Cloudflare goes down), the core of the internet's design remains in place. A web service outage might cause a lot of websites to go down, but it's not going to stop your online game session. A state might cut off its internet to suppress protests, but that's not going to stop the functionality of the internet for other countries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On top of redundant cabling others have mentioned, even if you managed to cut every single cable that goes into a country they would not be fully cut off from the internet(although their bandwidth would be miniscule by comparison). Satellite connections to the internet are available around the globe and, short of blowing up all comm satellites, impossible to block.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
