Removing them requires sealing off all those vessels and is just more trouble than it is worth. The kidney may still have some function left so it can still help, so they are all left in if possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Removing it is additional work and risk that isn’t really useful unless the kidney is infected or something.</p>
<p>Usually it’s fine and just not working, so it’s easier and safer to leave it in instead of chopping around in there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a doctor but not a transplant surgeon.  I apologize if I butcher anything (pun intended).</p>
<p>The easy answer is a transplant kidney and native kidney are in different places.</p>
<p>Your body is actually a series of compartments.  In your abdomen, the biggest one if the peritoneum (sorry for big words) but we'll call it &quot;the belly cavity&quot;</p>
<p>Your native kidney are in a tighter, more cramped, and harder to get to place in your back called the retroperitoneum (behind the peritoneum  or &quot;behind the belly cavity&quot;)</p>
<p>And doctors typically want to do the easiest and safest thing.  So instead of placing your new kidney in the harder to get place, we put in somewhere totally different where it's easy to hook up to your bladder and blood vessels.  Because honestly, it can be anywhere as long as you have those hookups.  Putting it close to the bladder and blood vessels also lowers the chance of the suturing falling apart from stretching.</p>
<p>Most commonly, that's actually in the front, bottom part of your abdomen.  And the transplant surgeon doesn't even go into the &quot;belly cavity&quot; itself, they put it in the space deep to your muscle but not yet in the belly do they don't have to deal with your intestines and all that stuff (Extraperitoneal if you want to be fancy).  And there's also a risk of the transplant kidney &quot;spinning on itself&quot; if it's in the belly cavity since there's more room and that can twist off the blood supply and kill the transplant.</p>
<p>Also, most of the time when people need a transplant the kidneys are shrunken up, way smaller, and it's okay just to kind of leave them there because they're inert.   People with kidneys that fail because they have a ton of cysts on them, however, may still have massive kidneys.  How much space they take up and bleeding into those cysts can cause pain so they are sometimes removed.  Kidneys are removed for cancer, naturally.  Also, scarred up kidneys from infection can sometimes make your blood pressure go higher so they are removed.</p>
<p>But your run of the mill guy with diabeetus and the high blood (pressure) are going to have these small raisin kidneys you just ignore</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kidney transplant is more dangerous on the donor. There are so many blood vessels going to the kidney that removing a kidney means a lot of arteries to seal and big risks of massive internal bleeding. So if they don't have to remove it, for instance no cancer or infection, the kidney is simply not doing his job, it is safer to leave it there and just continue to do nothing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
