		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Corona and influenza viruses are single stranded rna viruses. Once they get into your cells they start replicating, which your immune system is very good at recognizing and killing. </p>
<p>Herpes is a double stranded DNA virus. It can get into your cells and just sit there not replicating, so it is hard for your immune system to see. It will become active and replicate periodically, but then it infects other cells  where it will just sit dormant again. So your immune system is playing whack-a-mole, which isn't very effective. </p>
<p>Hiv is a retro virus, so it actually integrates into your cells own dna. You basically can't get rid of it without killing the host cell, and the cells it primarily infects are t cells, which are immune cells that  are generally tasked with antiviral immunity. So it basically infects and can kill the very cells responsible for killing it. It can also hide in other cells that create a reservoir for it to become infectious again, which makes it even more difficult to treat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>u/Cr4zyC47L4dy did a good job explaining! I just wanted to add a couple more points. HIV and herpes virus are very different viruses but both are thought to utilize your nervous system to evade detection by your immune system.</p>
<p>Your central nervous system is considered &quot;immune privileged&quot;* in that your normal immune system can't access it. Neurons have limited capacity for regeneration so tightly controlling immune response and inflammation via limiting access to the CNS is important. This also allows for viruses like <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-065X.2006.00440.x" target="_blank">HIV to maintain viral pools</a> that can reinfect the host if antiviral drugs are stopped.</p>
<p><a href="https://uptodate.com/contents/genital-herpes-beyond-the-basics" target="_blank">Herpes infects your peripheral sensory neurons</a> and travels to the cell body in the dorsal root ganglia near your spine. There it remains dormant before reactivating (exact triggers are still debated), traveling down the dendrites and being released at the original site of infection. Because the virus is released so far from the cells which are producing it, the immune system never ends up being able to fully rid your body of the virus. Often people with chronic herpes infections will have a 'tingling' sensation before breaking out in sores. This has been attributed to the virus traveling down the sensory dendrites.</p>
<p>Chicken pox is caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV) which is in the herpes virus family. VZV can also infect sensory nerves and lay dormant in the dorsal root ganglia for years before reemerging as shingles. The characteristic distribution of shingles is in a band around half your torso (stopping at midline) which is due to the distribution of your sensory nerves.</p>
<p>*new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_privilege#Central_nervous_system" target="_blank">research</a> suggests that the CNS isn't technically immune privileged as immune cells may enter through non-canonical methods. But the CNS remains less accessible to the immune system than most organs so it falls somewhere between immune privileged and ordinary ole organ.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Why are some viruses like corona or the flu one and done, while others like herpes or HIV can last your entire life?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The former case is the normal case.  Persistent diseases are rare exceptions and each one's cause is different.</p>
<p>Herpes mostly survives because it knows how to hide in nerve cells, which the immune system is terrified to attack.</p>
<p>HIV lives in the immune system's attack cells.</p>
<p>Other diseases have varying mechanisms, but they're usually some variant on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can't find the thing (molds, cryptos)</li>
<li>Can't kill it once you find it (strep)</li>
<li>Killing the thing doesn't kill it for some awful reason (parasites; anything that makes cysts)</li>
<li>It's breaking your attack drones (aids)</li>
<li>It's breaking your sensor drones (leprosy)</li>
<li>Every time you kill it in the west wing, it's already setting up shop in the east wing (half of these fuckers)</li>
<li>By the time you're halfway done killing it, it's 100% done killing you (rabies)</li>
<li>You just get it over and over and over again because it's everywhere (the cold)</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to also point out that we really don't know if a virus is &quot;one and done.&quot; Viral latency can occur in both DNA and RNA viruses, so an infection we think may be over/eradicated may just be lying dormant in some cell only waiting for some trigger to re-emerge.</p>
<p>HIV and Herpes are common examples of DNA viruses that go become latent. Hepatitis D is an example of an RNA virus that can become latent in some infections. </p>
<p>Despite mapping the genomes of viruses and knowing every protein on their coats, we still don't know every spot they infect within our bodies. And since we are unable to scan every cell in our bodies for viral DNA/RNA, we don't actually know if a virus is ever completely eradicated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason for this is the same reason it is relatively easy to kill a frog and much more difficult to do this to a tortoise.  Herpes, HIV are evolved with more defensive positions. Neither is supposed to kill its host. HIV evolved in nonhuman primates, and tends not to kill them. In primates, it behaves more like HTLV does in humans. But in humans it is lethal because we have longer life spans and greater contact with each other and therefore greater contact with other pathogens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
