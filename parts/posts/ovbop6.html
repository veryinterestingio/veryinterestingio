<p>ETA: I’m wondering specifically about the MRNA vaccines. And I’m referring to common anti-inflammatories like the ones listed, not the immunosuppressive drugs used in cancer treatments or organ transplants.</p>
<p>ETA2: I don’t know why comments keep getting deleted. I’m not the one deleting them???</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe you are confusing the two. Anti-inflammatory vs immune suppressants like steroids and some chemo. </p>
<p>Tylenol and aspirin are more like anti inflammatory that blunts the inflammatory cascade. Your body still produces antibodies. </p>
<p>Steroids is also used as an antiinflammatory and it can also suppress the immune system if used for extended period of time. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While the process might be slightly different for mRNA vaccines, in simplest terms, the end goal of all vaccines is for them to reach a specific type of cell in your Adaptive immune system called, which in turn will proliferate into either Plasma cells and/or <strong>Memory B cells</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Plasma cells</strong> rapidly produce millions of antibodies for a specific antigen. <strong>This produces short-term immunity</strong>. After some time, the antibodies and Plasma cells stop being created as they no longer perseve a threat. Simply put, rhere's no need to have your body dedicate resources and create such massive amounts of antibodies that only work against one antigen if it's no longer present. </p>
</li>
<li><strong>Memory B cells</strong> are also created in much smaller numbers. These cells &quot;remembers&quot; the antigen (covid-19) it was created to fight against and remain long after the antigen has left the system. <strong>This produces long-term immunity</strong>. If the antigen presents itself again, the memory b cell will start rapidly producing antibodies to fight against it. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I'll highlight a few reasons why this process takes an estimate of two weeks below, but really I'm just glazing the surface: however what I'm about to write below is much more general, and I imagine mRNA vaccines may have slight differences.</strong> The study of immunity and immune systems is one of the much more complex parts of anatomy/physiology, and I most certainly haven't learned enough to explain it in more depth than this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>memory b cells and Plasma cells are not instantly created when you get the vaccine.</strong> In fact, memory b cells are one of the last stages of your immune response</li>
<li><strong>Macrophages</strong>, another type of White Blood Cell, first have to find the antigen/vaccine. </li>
<li><strong>messenger proteins</strong> have to be sent (from Macrophages) to inform your body that they found &quot;something&quot; that may be a threat </li>
<li><strong>Dendritic cells</strong> then arrive and create antigen markers based on the vaccine/antigen. These are also called &quot;antigen presenting cells</li>
<li><strong>Dendritic cells</strong> then have to travel to a local lymph node and find a matching T-Helper cell that can&quot; link&quot; to the specific antigen markers the dendritic cell is presenting. </li>
<li><strong>T-Helper cells</strong> then proliferate and simultaneously activates several components of your Adaptive immune system to fight against this antigen: one of which is a immature B-cell found in the center of the lymph node. </li>
<li><strong>The B-cell</strong> , now activated, then proliferates into Plasma cells which rapidly produce antibodies to fight the infection, and Memory B cells, which remain in the lymph node and provide long term immunity alongside me</li>
<li>You also have to consider the time it takes for all the proliferation above, as well as the time it takes to actually produce antibodies, memory B cells, and Memory T-helper cells.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Needless to say, the process above doesn't just happen overnight. I imagine two weeks is the minimum estimated showcased time that your body needs to create Memory cells or antibodies. This is also why they say getting the vaccine shortly before becoming infected (less than two weeks) still helps to some extent and make the symptoms less severe: It's because your body had a head start on the process listed above. </p>
<p>The process above is definitely complex, and yet is only scratching the surface of your immune system. I don't expect you to remember it, but I hope it gives you an idea of why it may take as long as it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/zQGOcOUBi6s" target="_blank">If you're interested, this video really helps visually explain the process I stated above: granted it's directed towards bacteria instead of viruses</a></p>
<p>This is a fun read for those interested. A study of the timeline for antigen creation from both pfizer and moderna: as well as the effect of booster shots vs pre-infected with Covid. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A common misunderstanding is that the mRNA vaccine is a weaker version of the COVID virus.</p>
<p>This is false -- it is not the virus but the RNA sequence that instructs your cells to produce the spike protein sequence which is also in the covid - so the vaccination never gives you any virus - think of it if you were to be able to replicate just legs of a human, but not the whole human - the spike protein is like the legs of the virus without the other parts.</p>
<p>It works because the bodys immune system learn to fight the spike protein, although harmless, just like it would with the real virus, and hence builds an immune defense system for when it sees the real thing.</p>
<p>It is like being in boot camp in the army  before you go to war.  The army instructor would use the large supply of legs to teach the army recruits to shoot the enemy in the leg.</p>
<p>The two weeks is because that is the time it takes for the body to react and understand the how to fight.</p>
<p>Other drugs may interfere with your system learning how to fight the spike protein, and I think the viral suppressing drugs does that specifically - different anti viral drugs works differently, but say you take one that encases virus in cement -- now you would have all the replicated legs encased in cement, and your army recruits would not know to learn anything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It actually doesn't take 2 weeks. That's just a cautious rule of thumb to maximize efficacy.</p>
<p>In the trials for mRNA vaccines, the vaccinated group started diverging from the control group at around day 11. Since these trials were comparing symptomatic infections confirmed by a positive test, it's not unreasonable to assume the vaccines start working after about ~5-7 days:</p>
<p>11 days - 3-5 days for symptoms to show up - 1 day to go get tested</p>
<p>The 2 shots + 2 weeks recommendation is to maximize efficacy, but you already start benefiting after about 1 week.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
