Wouldnt it be much easier if the caterpillar just stayed at the same leaf and continue munching away at it?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plants are generally not as passive as we think they are. Many species have self-defense mechanisms in place, such as toxins or other chemicals that are foul to the insect. When damaged, the plant will condense these chemicals in the damaged area to prevent further damage and increase sugar flow to repair the damage. I suspect the caterpillar's behavior is because of this, they move to a new leaf because it starts to taste awful. 😋</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They browse plants like we browse a buffet. They sample and nibble on plants to see if they like them. If they like the plant they'll usually eat all of it in one sitting. </p>
<p>Plants respond to being eaten with all kinds of anti-herbivore chemistry (not just &quot;toxins&quot;) and that will drive most caterpillars off. Basically the food goes bad as they eat, and so they will take a few bites and wander off.</p>
<p>Some caterpillars are specialized though and are resistant to the toxins, in fact they like them, so making the poisons just encourage feeding. There are specialist caterpillars on tobacco which have been well studied. The tobacco plants have this evolved a supplement defensive protein which inhibits digestion, making the plant even less valuable to the caterpillar. If it tries to compensate by eating more it will have to eat more toxin to do it, and since there resistance to the toxins is limited, it's a somewhat effective defense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
