		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apple and Qualcomm depend on the chip foundries like Intel and TSMC.  They have engineers and physicists trying their best to fit more and faster transistors on to chips ASAP, while keeping power usage manageable.  Then you have CPU designers like Intel and AMD trying to make the best use of those transistors to achieve the best CPU performance per watt.</p>
<p>It takes time for advancements in etching transistors on silicon to make their way through to consumer products.  At times, if one manufacturer has had a lead over its rivals, there have been suspicions that they were sitting on advances until the others caught up but this doesn't seem to have caused drastic slowing of progress.  One problem is that it's now so expensive to be in the market that there are fewer and fewer competitors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that engineers are still making new discoveries in the industry! Roughly speaking, you can sort of think of the processing power of a computer chip being proportional to how many individual elements (transistors) you are able to fit on one chip. The smaller you make each individual element, the more you can fit on a chip and the more powerful that chip will be. This transistor density has been roughly scaling with Moore's Law for the past \~50 years and while Intel has at some points purposely slowed down their development to better align with Moore's Law, in general Intel, Samsung, and TSMC (the 3 large chip makers) are all releasing the most powerful chips as soon as they can reliably manufacture them.</p>
<p>One of the main improvements that drives the increase in processing power is again related to how many transistors we can fit on the chip. The ELI5 is that we need to draw these transistors into the chip with light. The longer the wavelength of the light we use, the larger the features will end up. Originally, they used mercury lamps (wavelength \~400 nm ) which limited the feature size to a couple hundred nanometers (still really small!) but they are now using what we call extreme ultraviolet (wavelength \~10 nm) which enables us to shrink everything down to about 10 nm.</p>
<p>EDIT: A lot of people have been mentioning limits to scaling (ie: the death of Moore's Law) and while there definitely are fundamental laws in physics that limit scaling, there are a lot of neat tricks engineers have come up with that will probably continue to drive improvements for years to come (both in terms of materials and architectures). One of the top examples that come to mind off the top of my head is introducing what we call &quot;high-k atomic layer deposition&quot; in the mid 2000's. </p>
<p>ELI10 of high-k ALD: A lot of people in the thread have mentioned &quot;quantum tunneling&quot; which basically occurs when something becomes so thin, an electron can just appear on the other side (wave-particle duality sucks). If you break a transistor down to its most simple parts, it is just a capacitor and engineers want to make the dielectric as thin as possible (think of your basic parallel plate capacitor formula). At some point, all of your electrons just &quot;tunnel&quot; across which leads to a bunch of leakage/power loss. Instead of scaling the thickness, engineers switched the dielectric material to one with higher dielectric constant (&quot;k&quot;) which allows you to get the same device performance with less leakage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before you make a 1mm drill bit, you probably have to make a 2mm drill bit, to build the tools you need to make a 1mm drill bit. You don't start with rocks and sticks and make a 1mm drill bit. It's an iterative process, where precision at one scale leads to precision at the next smaller scale.</p>
<p>Chip technology has progressed in that fashion. It's very similar to how t-shirts are printed, via lithography. You make images of the circuits, and project them onto a silicon crystal. There are a few dozen other steps. At each generation, the scale gets smaller, making them faster, and more powerful (larger circuits). This is Moore's law.</p>
<p>Eventually, there are hard physical limitations to how small you can scale this process. We're more or less hitting these limitations, now. So, we're turning to other strategies, like putting more chips in one package. It's unclear at the moment what direction the technology will go.</p>
<p>tldr; for many years, the path forward has been obvious, and iterative: make it smaller. Now, the path forward is less obvious, and may require fundamentally new technologies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work at a company that produces components that go into the machines that produce chips. Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) is one of the processes for chip manufacturing and LAM Research has a nifty video on YouTube about it. It's crazy how much goes into it the technology. Surface finish, cleanliness, and cycle time are among the most important that come to mind. There's a lot that can ruin the process so these factors are continuously monitored by our quality control group.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
