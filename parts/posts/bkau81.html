<p>What are the odds they’d be there to capture that and how much time do they spend waiting for these types of things?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>some of the series at the end do a brief section about how they go about capturing the footage that they showed.  They make their own custom rigs with various types of cameras to help them get shots. They leave camera 'traps' in places and hope to get lucky with them. They wander around following research or local guides to help increase their chances of being in the right place at the right time. So a lot of it is somewhat down to luck. They will know from research roughly where to go for certain things, but being able to capture specific things is down to luck on whether they get any usable footage in the days they allocated at a site. Depending on what they are looking to film at any given site, the time they allocate will differ.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

After only getting about an hours worth of filming the animal asleep, and just as they decided to give up, they captured the hunt scene that made in the show.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Videos like these they compiled from thousands of hour of footage over a long time. Planet Earth took 5 years to make.</p>
<p>A camera person could be set up in a location recording several days worth of footage of nothing but trees before finally getting the 10 second clip of a moose walking by. Then they'll typically follow the animal several days. </p>
<p>Theres not much of a difference in skill/dedication between a scout sniper and a wildlife photographer, other than one shoots with a gun the other shoots with a camera.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The recent Attenborough series has a bonus episode where they take you behind the scenes of some of the shots. I believe it was called &quot;our planet&quot;.</p>
<p>It may help answer some of your questions, for example it took 2 people living in a shed for the winter 3 years to capture just 25 secs of footage of this super rare tiger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
