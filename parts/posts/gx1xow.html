<p>They're not. Many different locks use the same key. It's just very unlike that you'll find one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>They're not unique. Rather there are a sufficient number of variations that using duplicate keys for multiple locks is fine, so long as it is not know which locks are opened by the same shape of key.</p>
<p>As for how they keep track of this, I'm assuming there are nation-wide registers for such things, or perhaps just manufacturer-wide registers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a lot of others have explained, they aren't and there's really no way they could be realistically.</p>
<p>The basic standard lock you'd see on anyone's front door is a cylinder lock with pins.  To unlock you need rotate the cylinder to move the latch out of the way so the handle can turn.  Inside that cylinder there are typically 5 or 6 sets of pins depending on brand and cost.  Each set is two pins.  A small one that's the same in every slot and a second one below it of variable length.  For a decent quality lock there's 9 or 10 possible lengths for those variable pins.  Lastly there's a small spring behind both sets of pins pushing it all down.  If you try to turn the cylinder without a key you won't be able to because the pins are across the shear point where the cylinder meets its housing.  When you insert the correct key, the various bumps and valleys push the pins up different amounts so the gaps between the flat pins and the variable pins all line up with the shear line and allow the cylinder to rotate.  So a lock might have a key code something like 25463 meaning the first pin is length 2, the second 5 and so on.</p>
<p>So, the number of keys you can have is determined by the number of pins and the number of lengths.  There are some additional limiting factors however.  Let's imagine a lock with 3 pins and 5 lengths.  First off any key like 222, 333, etc would be terrible because if they're all the same all you would need to do to unlock it is jam any old thin object in and wiggle it up and down a little till it lined up and turned.  Likewise for anything in a smooth line like 123 or 246.  On top of that you can't make too large of a jump between pins.  If you tried to make a lock keyed 161 it wouldn't work because the changes are too steep and you wouldn't be able to slide the key in.</p>
<p>So if you have a 5 pin lock with 9 length options (average residential lock) mathematically there are 59,049 possible combinations.  Once you take those other limits into account though there are fewer than 20,000 useful combinations.</p>
<p>This isn't really a problem though because tens of thousands of combinations makes the odds of finding another lock at random that fits a key you have pretty low.  Even lower for someone with malicious intent managing to randomly find a lock of a place they actually want to get into.</p>
<p>The other thing too is, for a typical lock like that, there are lots of easier ways to get around it if someone REALLY wanted to than stumbling across the matching key.  A good solid kick near the handle will break most doors with a wooden frame fairly easily.  You could also break a window or whatever.  Locks keep people from just opportunistically walking in but at the end of the day it's not going to stop anyone determined to make entry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
