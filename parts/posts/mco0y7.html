		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A bit of both. On the natural side, it is an evolutionary response. Females with larger breasts and larger waist to hip ratio have been shown to produce higher levels of the hormones that promote fertility. More fertile means higher likelihood of giving birth to your offspring. The &quot;goal&quot; (if you can say such a thing) of all life is to survive and multiply. So being able to physically identify mates with a higher likelihood of successful breeding is an evolutionary advantage.</p>
<p>Here's a study that says much the same thing with actual evidence</p>
<p>Jasieńska, G., Ziomkiewicz, A., Ellison, P. T., Lipson, S. F., &amp; Thune, I. (2004). Large breasts and narrow waists indicate high reproductive potential in women. Proceedings. Biological sciences, 271(1545), 1213–1217. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2004.2712" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2004.2712</a></p>
<p>On the other hand the social aspect of showing off the breast being a sexual thing is mostly a social construct that mostly came about as we developed clothes. Because we were &quot;exposed&quot; less to the female breast, it became something seen only during sex and was thus something special and associated with the act of sex itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human women are the only primates with breasts that remain engorged constantly. In other primates, it only becomes engorged to signal that the female is in heat.</p>
<p>Males that are attracted to that would more successfully reproduce. Even in humans it should serve as an attraction to healthier females (until our modern obesity epidemic).</p>
<p>So yes, it is natural in primates to be attracted to breasts and we are primates with the sexually dimorphic trait of engorged breasts. Some learned behaviors can make the attraction stronger or weaker, but biologic attraction is a given.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
