		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is called an <em>immersed tube tunnel</em>. The first thing to do is to cut a trench in the seafloor along the route of the tunnel. Meanwhile, prefabricated sections of the tube are built in dry docks from  steel or reinforced concrete. These are then sealed at each end with temporary bulkheads and floated to the construction site. When it is in the correct location, the tube is ballasted and sunk to the seabed alongside the previous section of tube. </p>
<p>The two sections are linked using rubber seals and the bulkheads removed. Then the tube is covered with gravel which weighs it down on the seafloor and prevents it being damaged by ships. The next section can then be moved into position. This site has some nice graphics about how it has been done including in Scandinavia.</p>

<p>Immersed tubes only really work in shallow waters. For deeper channels the tunnel - until now - has been cut into the bedrock below the seafloor using a tunnel boring machine. However, the Norwegians are looking at a <em>submerged floating tunnel</em> to cross the Sognefjord. Here, the tunnel actually hangs in the water from giant floats - the idea has been around for a long time, but no one (and I really can't think why anyone would have a problem of being in a tunnel hanging in the middle of the ocean) has yet built one. There's a list of proposed projects here:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/iCowboy's answer is rather good.  Since you specifically mentioned the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%98resund_Bridge" target="_blank">Øresund bridge</a> and tunnel, I'm just adding this answer to link you to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sufr9mMxPW8" target="_blank">a Megastructures episode</a> specifically about that structure.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that this is not the only way to construct underwater tunnels; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_Tunnel" target="_blank">Channel Tunnel</a> between Britain and France <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVJ45QxESYs" target="_blank">was built</a> using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel_boring_machine" target="_blank">tunnel boring machines</a>.</p>
<p>And finally, just for fun, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr2HAJXPP2A" target="_blank">here</a>'s another video about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busan%E2%80%93Geoje_Fixed_Link" target="_blank">an undersea tunnel in Korea</a> built using the immersion method.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It can also be done with a earth pressure balance machine , it's a tunnel boring machine with a pressurized cutting head.  The tunnel liner is constructed inside the machine  &amp; pushed out the back as it advances.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oZqYLGNzKE" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oZqYLGNzKE" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oZqYLGNzKE</a></a></p>
<p>In New York the water tunnels are a 1000 ft deep &amp; in granite, they drill ahead of the TBM &amp; grout the cracks  in front of the machine before it passes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The tunnels for the new subway under the Anacostia river in DC ... there was nothing but mud for them to go through, with nothing but sand underneath ... so the engineers devised this fantastical all-in-one machine which bored the hole, set rebar, poured fast-drying concrete, and dried it all in one operation.  that was a number of years ago, I don't know if you can find anything on the internet about it anymore or not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
