		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is because procrastination is a type of emotion regulation strategy of our brains.</p>
<p>When a stimuli puts you in a negative mood, you want to escape from that stimuli. You don't like a particular sound? You close your ears. It is the same with tasks. You generate a short-term solution, and technically that solution works - for the time being. So in the end it turns into a chronic problem when you continue to perform this kind of behavior.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Procrastination, often a coping mechanism for anxiety, is different from laziness.  A new task can often exacerbate an underlying level of anxiety so putting that task off can manage one's anxiety level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of human behavior can be explained by how we are supposed to behave in the wild.</p>
<p>Civilization hasn't existed long enough for us to fully evolve and adapt yet.</p>
<p>Procrastination is probably a habit we formed to conserve energy. Our bodies way of saying 'save that energy for something more important like getting food'</p>
<p>But since getting food for us is never a problem, it just makes us lazy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We tend to procrastinate on big, abstract things (spend 2 hours studying tonight to get slightly more knowledge to pass a test to get a slightly higher grade to get into a good college to work for 4 years to maybe get a better job). We don't procrastinate on things which have immediate, obvious gratification. The brain is just bad at seeing the point of spending energy where it doesn't see benefit.</p>
<p>This is one reason proper planning of a task (visualising, breaking it down into discrete actionable steps) helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because we have the option to. And if we have the option, we prefer to expend as little energy as possible, reserving it for when we need it. Unfortunately, we no longer live in the wild, waiting to flee from some stalking predator.</p>
<p>Instead, we have to build discipline and good habits, thanks to our civilized world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
