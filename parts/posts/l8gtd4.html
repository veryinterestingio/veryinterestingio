		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually don't think we know for sure - if this happens all of the time it's called tinnitus and lots of people suffer from it.</p>
<p>One possibility is that it's something about your nerves, that send signals from your ear to your brain. Another is that it's in your ear itself - there are actually tiny cells that act like little motors to amplify sounds you hear. When a sound moves your inner ear (specifically, the basilar membrane in your cochlea) these cells push back and forth to magnify that movement.</p>
<p>Sometimes these cells can get triggered and keep going when there's no sound coming in - just like the feedback loop you might hear from a microphone and PA system that keeps trying to make a sound louder after it's already gone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the inner ear, there is a membrane that vibrates when sound waves enter the ear and  cause pressure differentials in the local air. One end of the membrane is stiff and vibrates in resonance with high tones and the other end is floppy and resonated with bass tones and the in-between is well... the tones in-between. Along this membrane, there are hair cells that transduce this vibration into a neural signal that eventually goes to your auditory area of the brain after some very complex processing.
The hair cells that transduce high pitch sounds are  more recent in evolutionary development and for some reason, they are more susceptible to damage and they like to die a lot. This is why the ringing is usually high pitch. Presumably, when these cells die, in their blaze of glory,  they trigger upstream signalling to the brain so you end up perceiving a sound.
On average, we lose about 1 Hz per day in our hearing range (20 Hz to 20 000 Hz)  as we age. This is the underlying principle behind those apps that test your age by hearing. You can try this with a teenager and an older  person and older people will stop perceiving sounds when you get up to the 20kHz sounds as they don't have the cells to transduce this sound anymore. These cells have presumably died every time they hear a random ping in the ear.<br />
