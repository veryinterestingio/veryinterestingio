		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>tl,dr: If you push a kid on a swing, gravity and air-resistance slow them down and they swing less further each time, eventually stopping at the bottom. If you push them at random times, you might speed them up one time then slow them down the next. But if you time it right, adding new energy in at just the right time, you can make them swing higher and higher. A seizure, in this analogy, would be like repeatedly adding so much energy that the kid goes around and around in a full circle, the chain wraps around the top pole, and everything comes to a tragic halt when the length of free chain becomes less than the thickness of the kid.</p>
<hr />
<p>Every time a signal comes in from our senses, a wave of activity sweeps through parts of our brains. Each neuron is connected to many other neurons, via connections that either excite or inhibit. <em>Those</em> neurons do the same to others, which do the same to the others, etc etc, and eventually the system converges on a pattern: the smell of an orange, or the color blue, or vice-versa. Then the neurons 'reset', with neurotransmitters and electric charges ready to do it all over again. When we are awake and alert, these waves of activity occur whenever and wherever they are needed - i.e. asynchronously - at 13-30 cycles per second.</p>
<p>The reset thing is necessary, because each neuron is part of many patterns and it takes some finite amount of time for the previous state to wear off, for neurotransmitters to be cleared out of receptors in the synapses. The inhibition thing is crucially important, providing negative feedback (which is a <em>good</em> thing, in electrical systems that we'd like to behave in reasonable ways), because without it every neuron would continue to excite every other neuron, in an out-of-control positive feedback loop. The asynchronous thing is important, because new waves can be started at any time. You can probably see where this is going.</p>
<p>If a large number of strong signals arrive in rapid succession, in most brains the reset time and the inhibition thing do their jobs and there is no out-of-control feedback loop. In the brains of people who have epilepsy, a rapidly repeating signal like a blinking light starts wave after wave of excitation, faster than previous waves die out, faster than the neurotransmitters for the inhibition signals get cleared out of the synapses. Instead of brain waves looking like a sine wave, rising and falling, they just keep rising.</p>
<p>Since every neuron is involved in a huge number of patterns, things that are seemingly unrelated to vision get messed up too. Seen through an MRI or EEG, brain 'waves' that usually look something like sine waves look more like fireworks. Muscular control and the ability to remain conscious and aware are equally impossible, until we 'reboot' and return to usual brain behavior.</p>
<p>(Source: I have seizures. A few of the things I have said about the way brains work might be imprecise and will likely irk someone, because there are a lot of things we don't really understand yet about brains, like... how they work. But we do know a lot about what happens when they don't work.)</p>
<p>Edit: thank you, kind strangers. And everyone who decided not tear strips off me for inaccuracies in my analogies. And everyone pointing out that my descriptions of why flashing lights affect people with epilepsy only describe one aspect of epilepsy that affects a small percentage of people with epilepsy, who have a dismayingly large diversity of experiences and have come up with equally diverse ways of dealing with those experiences. And special thanks to everyone who shared their own experiences... I know all too well what a pain in the butt it can be to hash it all out again and again, but it <em>always</em> helps someone. For all the times that someone was me: thanks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This does not answer your question, but one important thing to note is that only about 3% to 5% of people who have epilepsy have seizures that are triggered by flashing lights.  Epilepsy is a very broad term encompassing anyone who has recurring seizures.  There are a wide range of types of seizures and a wide range of causes of them.  It is not a specific disease with everyone being affected in the same way.  So the majority of people who have epilepsy are not affected in any way by flashing lights and it will not trigger seizures for them.  Those that do get affected by flashing lights have what is called photosensitive epilepsy.  Amongst those people there is again a variety of ways in which their seizures can be caused, with some being more sensitive to things than others.  Patterns may even cause their seizures, such as stripes or squares.  So it is not just lights.  It is all about how the brain reacts to these stimuli.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
