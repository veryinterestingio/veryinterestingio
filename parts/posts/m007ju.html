The most obvious reason seems to be that this way the sensory input reaches the brain a few milliseconds faster, but I somehow find it hard to believe that the evolutionary pressure has been so high for all animals that those with diverging organs had no way to reproduce in large enough quantities.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The concept of most sensory organs located directly near the brain is mostly vertebrate-centric. Arthropods can diverge from this rule in their extreme diversity, as there are several groups that evolved accessory organs related to functions specifically needed for tasks in their group.</p>
<p>A few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Crickets and grasshoppers being one of the few with a communication system through sound, developed ears on their legs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Butterflys and moths appear to have ear-like structures at the base of their wings, with their wing veins directing sounds towards it. Very useful for detecting predators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For another butterfly example, some species are able to taste with their legs. This is to find the right host plant for egg deposition.</p>
</li>
<li>Spiders have several families with very poor eyesight, which effectively have turned vibration sensing in their extremities into a substitute for ears and eyes.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of animals have this concentration of their sensory organs as a part of cephalization, the concentration of nerves and sensory organs in a anterior 'head' region. This happens mostly on animals with bilateral symmetry, and has separately evolved many times. However this seems to have less with reaction time   and much more with movement. most animals with bilateral symmetry are basically tubes, with a mouth in one end a anus in the other. So if a little tube goes around bumping into things mouth first, it is very beneficial for more sensory organs (and more concentrated nerves to deal with those sensory organs) to develop on the Head end of the animal. This isn't universal on all animals, or even all animals with bilateral symmetry. Like someone else in the thread said, lots of arthropods have developed new sensory organs away from the head that have more specific uses, as have vertebrates with the Lateral Line organ in fish for example. Most of these still however have  Cephalized, head-centric sensory organs and nerve systems. However, despite their overwhelming presence in animals with bilateral symmetry, not all animals have bilateral symmetry or, the need to sense things directly in front of them. Many echinoderms for example don't have cephalization as adults, because they lost their bilateral symmetry.  So for example adult starfish and such have pentameral simmetry, and so have lost cephalization, instead have a distributed neural net and eyes at the tip of each arm. Cnidarians with their radial simmetry also don't have brains and concentrated sensory organs. Instead having a neural network and distributed sensory organs. Bivalve molluscs also only generally have a neural network because while they have bilateral simmetry they have a sedentary existence just filter feeding whole staying place. So I would say that in general the Brain develops closer to the concentrated sensory organs rather than. The other way around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The input time is a good point, but also, it also lets everything be in reference to the most important thing on the body.  If something if going to hit your hand or knee, you might not notice it, or you might be a bit off in dodging it.  If you SEE something coming toward your EYES, you don’t have to think about what to move, you just know to get the eyes out of the way, and the brain is thus moved out of the way.  You can apply the same thinking to smell and hearing, though it’s not as clear as with sight.  </p>
<p>Also, it’s easier to protect one thing rather than protect multiple.  The evolution benefit of “putting all the eggs in one basket” probably performed better than any attempt to “decentralize” any sensory organs in creatures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others also have pointed out: reducing the time between the sensors and their analysis can be life saving and the evolutionary pressure to have these organs close to the brain is therefore pretty high. Insects or other arthropods are mentioned often here as an answer, but insects have a decentralized nervous system and can therefore fit sensory organs almost anywhere in the body with it still being close to a ganglion (accumulation of brain cells in insects, some sort of brian-like structure).<br />
My favorite fun fact on hearing in insects:  Moths have evolved without hearing organs. Only after bats evolved to hunt with ultrasound, moths had to quickly evolve to this new danger and different moths evolved ears (tympanal hearing organs) pretty much anywhere just to counter the bats a little bit.<br />
&quot;In moths, tympanal hearing organs have evolved independently at least five times (Minet and Surlykke <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00359-014-0945-8#ref-CR30" target="_blank">2003</a>; Greenfield <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00359-014-0945-8#ref-CR23" target="_blank">2014</a>).  In the superfamily Noctuoidea, the ear is placed on the metathoracic  segment and has two sensory cells, A1 and A2, except in the  Notodontidae, where only one A-cell is found. In Geometroidea and  Pyraloidea, as well as in Drepanoidea the ears are found at the base of  the abdomen and have four sensory cells, A1-A4. In those Sphingidae  (Bombycoidea) species, which can hear, ears are located on the  proboscis.&quot;<br />

It's adaptive to need to build fewer expensive specialist cells than generic body cells in most cases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
