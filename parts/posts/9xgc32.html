		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In 2011, the European Union passed a [directive] (<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm" target="_blank">http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm</a>) that made it so websites had to inform users about the usage of cookies. This was done to give people more knowledge and control over what data websites were storing. This is a European directive, so technically, that only counts for when citizens of the EU access your site, but it is easier to just show the warning to all users.</p>
<p>The cookie law is different from the GDPR which passed earlier this year (which is why suddenly every website updated their terms of conditions)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a recent requirement due to the implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation" target="_blank">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> in the European Union (EU) in May 2018. </p>
<p>One of the requirements of the GDPR is that websites when cookies can be used to track a user (which is what most cookies are used for), <a href="https://www.itgovernance.eu/blog/en/how-the-gdpr-affects-cookie-policies" target="_blank">the website must disclose that to the user</a> so they know they are being tracked. </p>
<p>You also may remember that earlier this year for about a month you received a stream of emails from every website you had an account on informing you that they had updated their privacy policy. Same reason: GDPR. </p>
<p>Even though the GDPR is really only enforceable in Europe, many online sites have users and do business in Europe and those can be prosecuted under that law. The alternative would be for such sites to block any users who originate in the EU. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
