			<a href="/posts/dcsrm2" onclick="return false">Coming from a 3rd year electrical engineering students perspective, I know how static electricity works but what I don't know is why it works essentially. What I'm asking is; why do some materials hold a better charge than others and while one material likes to gain a negative charge, Visa versa?</a>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our basic understanding of static electricity still seems to be pretty murky.</p>
<p>There is some evidence that static charging is not mediated by electrons and holes per se, but rather by ionic separation (a molecule splits apart into positive and negative ions, each of which resides on a different surface). Different materials reside at different parts of the triboelectric series based on their ability to stabilize different types of ions.</p>
<p>There have been demonstrations of making systematic changes to a material that change its position in the triboelectric series in a predictable way. See <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/am501557m" target="_blank"><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/am501557m" target="_blank">https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/am501557m</a></a></p>
<p>Surface area has to do with the amount of charge a material can &quot;hold&quot;, but not with the sign of charging. (This is why toner particles used in photocopiers are so small -- high surface area to mass ratios)</p>
<p><em>Edited to add</em> that it is well-established that humidity helps to dissipate static charge (presumably by slow neutralization of charges due to ion or electron mobility on water-rich surfaces or through moist air). Materials that are very hydrophilic (tending to absorb or bind water on their surfaces) tend not to be able to build up or maintain a static charge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Posting what I think is an appropriate follow-up question:</p>
<p>Last week we had a party.  We had a bunch of balloons, all the same size, all made of the same latex.  They all had foil confetti stuffed into them and were then inflated.  Half were inflated the normal way, by breathing into them.  The other half were inflated with helium from a canister.  </p>
<p>I tried to show my son how you could rub a balloon on your jumper repeatedly until it amassed enough overall charge on the surface that it would stick to the wall.  After rubbing different balloons we noticed that in the balloons containing air, the confetti distributed itself evenly across the inner surface of the balloon once it became charged.  In the helium-containing balloons, on the other hand, the majority of the confetti just sat in the bottom of the balloon, seemingly not attracted or repelled by any charge at all.</p>
<p>What is the explanation for this?  Does the gas inside the balloon somehow affect the ability of the latex to pick up or retain an overall charge?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There has been some recent research that suggested that the high school picture that in a pair of materials, one uniformly acquires positive and the other negative charge upon contact electrification is incorrect.</p>
<p>They propose that each surface supports a random mosaic of oppositely charged regions of nanoscopic dimensions. </p>
<p>They actually showed in their experiment that contact electrification was occuring between two sheets of the same material, which shouldn't happen according to the conventional view. There should be no thermodynamic force driving this electrification since the material surfaces/bulk exhibit the same chemical potential. </p>
<p>They actually measured the charge distributions on surfaces of different materials and found these differently charged mosaics to be on an order of a micrometer or less across. Sometimes the local charges could be a few orders of magnitude higher than the average surface charge.</p>
<p>So to get back to your questions, from a physics point of view the topic seems to raise more questions the more research is conducted into the fundamentals of it. But for your questions regarding which materials become positively or negatively charged, the concepts of electronegativity and electron affinity should suffice. As to your question about why some materials can hold charge better than others, there isn't a single direct answer. You have to consider different loss mechanisms, surface area, breakdown processes and such. </p>
<p>Here's the link to the paper in case you want to read up on it:</p>

<p>I suppose from a chemical point of view friction energy would be able to rip out electrons from rather <em>electropositive functional groups</em> in one material that will be captured by more <em>electronegative functional groups</em> in the other material. So I'd say it boils down to electronegativity.</p>
<p>This is similar to how sodium and chloride can react by forming ions. The difference is that in the case of NaCl, those ions mix together and have a strong ionic bond afterwards, while in the example above the ions of either kind are attached to only one of the materials respectively (e.g. the fur) and can therefore be separated from one another.</p>
<p>Just because a material is an &quot;isolator&quot; (every material becomes conductive at sufficient voltage) does not mean that there aren't any surface charges present, only that they do not propagate well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You could think of it like the &quot;glue-ness&quot; of a material. Glues actually work at the electrostatic/covalent level, so it's less of a metaphor and more of the same effect seen from a different perspective.</p>
<p>Static electricity is the effect of some electrons getting stuck to this or that material. If you rub two materials together, electrons will tend to stick to whichever is more &quot;sticky&quot; due to its outermost atoms, which are there due to its chemical formulation and whatever structure its molecules are organized into. Whichever material ends up losing electrons, it will have &quot;holes&quot; in their place. Holes are not stored anywhere, they're just an effect of an electrical imbalance... or if you prefer, they're &quot;stored&quot; in the nuclei of the material's atoms.</p>
<p>Some materials are much better at getting electrostatically charged if they have a structure composed of &quot;sticky&quot; atoms separated by non-conductive atoms, like it was made from a mesh of tiny capacitors. Glass and other &quot;non conductors&quot; are often just like that at the molecular level, not conducting at the macroscopic level but still having &quot;hotspots&quot; at the atomic-molecular level. This is also the basis for semiconductors to work, with dopants acting like hotspots where electrons tend to get attracted from the surrounding average material, or the surrounding average material tends to pull electrons from the dopant, creating a &quot;hole&quot;. </p>
<p>PS: it's &quot;vice versa&quot;, not &quot;Visa versa&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
