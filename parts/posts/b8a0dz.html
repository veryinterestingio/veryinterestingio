Why don’t you hear the phrase used to describe other similarly sized and geographically distinct places that one might consider a subcontinent such as Arabia, Alaska, Central America, Scandinavia/Karelia/Murmansk, Eastern Canada, the Horn of Africa, Eastern Siberia, etc.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Note that the use of the term 'Indian subcontinent' predates the discovery of tectonic plates.</p>
<p>The Indian sub-continent is bounded by mountains and other unfriendly terrain on all of its landward approaches.</p>
<p>This led to a degree of distinctiveness from the surrounding areas. Not only do Indians look different from the Persians/Arabs to the west and the Sinosphere peoples to the east, but they have a very different culture (or spectrum of cultures).</p>
<p>You rarely hear 'subcontinent' used in different contexts because there really isn't anywhere else like India in this respect. All of the various places you mentioned don't contain significant geographically isolated distinct peoples and cultures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>India is it's own land mass and sits on it's own tectonic plate. That plate smashed into another continental plate. So while it is part of the continent of Asia, it would also be it's own continent if it had not smashed into another one. So they call it a sub continent.</p>

<p>Edit: Its. </p>
<p>Also, why do all other versions of possessives require an apostrophe?  If you get your message across it doesn't matter anyway IMHO.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You've got some good answers for why India is considered a subcontinent. However no one has pointed out that India isn't the only subcontinent. The Arabian Peninsula is also often described as a subcontinent, as is Greenland.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>India is its own small tectonic plate. The only other landmass in a similar situation is the Arabian Peninsula. The Indian Plate is also colliding with the Eurasian Plate at fairly high speed (in geological terms) and is actively creating the massive Himalayan mountain range that almost totally cuts the Indian Subcontinent off from the rest of Asia. The Arabian plate is generally being a lot more mellow, so the Arabian Peninsula isn't nearly as geographically separate from Asia and Africa.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
