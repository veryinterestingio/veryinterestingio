		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apparently it has to do with the fact that M and P are two of the easiest phonemes the human mouth can produce, as well as the phonem A. That make both of those words two of the easiest sound combinations a human baby can pronounce, therefore, really common words that, being some of the first said at such an early age, can be related to parenthood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most languages in Asia and Europe (Well more in Europe than Asia) have a common root so share similar vocabulary. This ancestral language (called Proto Indo-European) had some word like mātr for mother and pātr for father. Which is where our words for mother and father come from.</p>
<p>Also ma-ma or pa-pa will be one of the first sounds a baby will make thus they are often associated with parents (mother and father respectively).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A French guy did a comprehensive video on this topic. Turns out &quot;mama&quot; and &quot;papa&quot; are just the very first syllables a toddler can form, along with &quot;baba&quot;, in Arabic for example &quot;baba&quot; is used to refer to the father. These words are not a proof that all languages come from the same root, the &quot;Babel&quot; linguistic theory.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Mama&quot; and &quot;papa&quot; are sort of a special case. There's a big <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mama_and_papa" target="_blank">wikipedia page</a> about them -- it's marked as needing more sources but does seem to accord with what I'd heard elsewhere. Basically those are easy and natural sounds for babies to make, and it's normal for babies to have some way to refer to their parents pretty early on.</p>
<p>A lot of other words that are similar in many languages are similar because the languages are related to each other. Similar words which mean the same things in different languages are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognate" target="_blank">cognates</a>.</p>
<p>For example, many words in Spanish are similar to words with the same meaning in French because both Spanish and French developed (over the course of several hundred years) from Latin. The Spanish words for &quot;mother&quot; and &quot;father&quot; are &quot;madre&quot; and &quot;padre&quot;; the French cognates for these are &quot;mère&quot; and &quot;père&quot;. The Latin words they're derived from are &quot;mater&quot; and &quot;pater&quot;. French and Spanish and other languages which developed from Latin (Italian, Romanian, etc) are in a group called the Romance languages. English did not develop from Latin, but the words are still sort of similar because they're in another language group (the Germanic language family) from a nearby area in Europe.</p>
<p>Note that there are some other reasons that words can be similar across languages. I'll give a couple examples from English and Japanese, which are totally not related to each other.</p>
<p>In some cases, words are directly borrowed from another language because the other language has a really good word for a thing. These are called loanwords. For example, Japanese &quot;beisoboru&quot; (borrowed from English &quot;baseball&quot;) or &quot;tsunami&quot; (borrowed into English from Japanese).</p>
<p>Another case is onomatopoiea, which is words that describe the sound of something. For example, a cat sound is &quot;meow&quot; in English and <del>&quot;niao&quot;</del> (edit: actually ニャー, &quot;nyaa&quot;) in Japanese. They're similar words because they're trying to describe the same sound. (Edit: a better example would be English &quot;moo&quot; vs Japanese ムー &quot;muu&quot;.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
