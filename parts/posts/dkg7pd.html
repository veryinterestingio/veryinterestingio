<p>One time, for about a week, i could feel a muslce on the right side of my back twitch a couple times every second whenever i sat down. It didnt hurt, just kind of annoying. It went away on its own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every muscle is supplied by a nerve that tells it how and when to move. Every nerve is made up of many many nerve cells (neurons) running in parallel together. Each neuron’s body lives in the spinal cord, and it’s “tail” reaches out along the nerve to the muscle. At the muscle, each individual neuron “tail” splits off into a bunch of branches to make contact with a certain number of individual muscle cells. This combination of a single neuron with the specific number of muscle  cells it touches is called a “motor unit.” Muscles are able to contract very hard or very light depending on the number of motor units that fire. A repetitive, involuntary muscle “twitch” is called a fasciculation. These happen when the neuron of one or a few motor units get irritated or excited, causing them to fire repeatedly without your permission. Since it’s only a few motor units, the resulting contraction is very small and localized.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
