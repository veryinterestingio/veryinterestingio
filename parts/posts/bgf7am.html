		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cannabis doesn't actually have a trace profile significantly longer than any other substance, it's a bit of myth cooked up by adverse parties. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2763020/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2763020/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2763020/</a></a></p>
<p>THC is broken down quickly and excreted in comparable rates to other common substances, but  11-nor-9-carboxy-Î”9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THCCOOH), formed by the breakdown of THC, lasts significantly longer. Most urine tests are for THCCOOH.</p>
<p>The industry standard for THCCOOH is 50 ng/ml, which occasional smokers (1-2X a week) can achieve in a little under three days. </p>
<p>The long detection times you are referring to occur in chronic users because, as the other guy said, THC is fat soluble. The body clears THC at a more or less constant rate, but ingesting THC at a higher rate than it can be cleared results in THC being saturated more fully over your fat cells. </p>
<p>Even with that in mind, studies show that the average chronic user, with a low BMI, can clear out THC stores and return to the under 50 ng/ml limit in just over a week. Though there are many who may retain THC in their urine for close to a month.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a side question. When losing weight (fat), does your urine have higher amounts of THC traces because your fat is being broken down? So if you were trying to pass a urine test, would forgoing exercise and eating above maintenance help you pass? Does this also mean losing fat will keep you somewhat high as your body breaks down the stored thc molecules?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
