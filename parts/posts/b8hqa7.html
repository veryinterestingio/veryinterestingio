		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Today is the 12th annual World Autism Awareness Day. In honor of that, we're here to answer your questions about how our environment can influence risk of developing Autism Spectrum Disorder, or ASD, in our most vulnerable population -- our children.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/conditions/autism/index.cfm" target="_blank">Autism</a> encompasses a group of complex disorders involving brain development. Autism symptoms appear very early in childhood and include difficulties in social communication as well as restricted patterns of behavior and interests. Once considered rare, current estimates indicate that autism affects about one in 59 children in the United States.</p>
<p>Scientists now know that ASD is most influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), part of NIH, supports autism research aimed at understanding how environmental exposures early in life may combine with genetic susceptibility to alter brain development to create the core symptoms of autism. One way we do that is to support researchers, like Dr. Schmidt, on her work focusing on maternal folic acid intake during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Her research has found that maternal folic acid, the synthetic form of folate, is one of the first modifiable factors identified to date with the potential to reduce occurrence of ASD by 40 percent if taken near conception. Folic acid appears to protect against ASD especially in mothers and children who are genetically susceptible to ASD. Further, her  provide evidence that folic acid supplements near conception might counter risk associated with gestational environmental contaminant exposures, like <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Combined+Prenatal+Pesticide+Exposure+and+Folic+Acid+Intake+in+Relation+to+Autism+Spectrum+Disorder" target="_blank">pesticides</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Joint+effects+of+prenatal+air+pollutant+exposure+and+maternal+folic+acid+supplementation+on+risk+of+autism+spectrum+disorder" target="_blank">air pollution</a>, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Prenatal+exposure+to+phthalates+and+autism+spectrum+disorder+in+the+MARBLES+study" target="_blank">phthalates</a>.</p>
<p>Her <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Association+of+Maternal+Prenatal+Vitamin+Use+With+Risk+for+Autism+Spectrum+Disorder+Recurrence+in+Young+Siblings" target="_blank">recent work</a> shows that taking prenatal vitamins that contain folic acid in the first month of pregnancy is also associated with reduced recurrence of autism by about half in younger siblings of children with autism who are at higher risk due to shared genetics and environment. She is also looking at potential ways that folic acid might protect against autism. There are many ways the many nutrients in prenatal vitamins could be critical for brain development and could protect mechanistic pathways implicated in autism, such as epigenetics, DNA repair/synthesis, mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Dr. Schmidt hopes that future research to understand the pathways involved could improve our understanding of autism etiology.</p>
<p>Dr. Schmidt is also helping to lead the <a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/mindinstitute/research/marbles/index.html" target="_blank">NIEHS-funded Markers of Autism Risk in Babies (MARBLES) study</a>, which is a longitudinal study for pregnant women who have a biological child with ASD. The MARBLES study, which began in 2006, investigates possible prenatal and postpartum biological and environmental exposures and risk factors that may contribute to the development of autism.</p>
<p>Ask us anything about Dr. Schmidt's research on folic acid, the MARBLES study, or other NIEHS-funded research on the environmental risk factors of ASD!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Drs. Schmidt and Lawler, thank you so much for this Q&amp;A session!  I have a question:  Dr. Schmidt mentions that taking folic acid whilst pregnant reduces the chances of the autism in the infant.  But women with the mthfr gene mutation have trouble processing the folic acid. That mutation and the folic acid consumption is known for an increased number of autism cases.  Women with the mthfr mutation are encouraged to use folinic acid instead of folic acid.  So my question is:  shouldn't all women be encouraged to use folinic acid - and NOT folic acid - because the majority of women do not know if they carry the mthfr mutation?  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many people on the autism spectrum who do not view autism as a disorder or a disability, and so do not necessarily feel as though autism is something that needs to be prevented.  (For instance, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2015/jul/16/autism-doesnt-have-to-be-viewed-as-a-disability-or-disorder" target="_blank">here's an op-ed</a> by Nikki Stevenson, who chairs a UK autism charity, which argues against a disease/disability model of autism.)</p>
<p>Have you come across anyone who feels that way?  How do they feel about your work to reduce or protect against the occurrence of autism?  If an autistic person were to tell you that they feel as if your work to prevent autism at least indirectly leads to a perpetuation of negative perceptions of autistic people, how would you address their concerns?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi there!  Thanks for coming.  I would like to know your answer about an issue very important to me; namely, reporting on &quot;positive findings&quot; without adjusting for multiple comparisons.</p>
<p>I note that many of your publications  rely on data taken from a cohort &quot;Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and the Environment (CHARGE)&quot;, and MARBLES, and I must confess, I have some sciencey concerns because it doesn't appear to me that you are making adjustments for multiple comparisons (I continue to see 95% CI being reported as &quot;significant &quot;).  Even your recent study (<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2726608" target="_blank">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2726608</a>) you made 5 comparisons (MARBLES cohort), from what I can tell, in your final model (primary outcome).  By using alpha at 0.05, we can get the following results:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alpha: 0.05 R: 5</p>
<p><strong>With no correction the chance of finding one or more significant differences in 5 tests=  0.2262 (22.62%).</strong></p>
<p>Adjustments with no correlation
For an overall alpha level of 0.05</p>
<p>Sidak's adjustment, for each test:
Lower the 0.05 to 0.0102062</p>
<p>Bonferonni's adjustment, for each test: Lower the 0.05 to 0.01</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>When I add table 3 to the mix (another 6), the chance of finding a &quot;significant&quot; result is 43%, and the corrected p-value should have been to around ~0.0045.</strong></p>
<p>In other words, the chance of replicability with your study could be rather low, and some of your results may simply be due to chance.     The first month prenatal vitamin &quot;ASD&quot; result had a respectable CI (0.5, 0.3-0.81)so it might hold up. But honestly, how many times can the MARBLES/CHARGES cohorts be tested without adjusting for multiple comparisons?  When i look at the studies that have been published with MARBLES cohort, there are some with literally hundreds of comparisons (<a href="https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-018-0428-4" target="_blank">https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-018-0428-4</a>).  In that particular study, there is a throwaway comment about &quot;multiple comparisons&quot; but even the most rudimentary of adjustments would have likely obliterated most of the &quot;significant&quot; findings.</p>
<p>A long winded way to get to my question: <strong>have you re-run your results adjusting for multiple comparisons, and if so, did the results change?</strong>  With the number of studies published using MARBLES/CHARGE data, couldn't it be very valuable to put it into the context of the (now) hundreds of multiple comparisons that the investigators using these datasets have done?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
