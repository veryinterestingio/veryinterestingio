Is this true even now with the amount of immigration from Latin America and Asia where people tend to be shorter on average? Are millennials taller than their parents? Has the age at which we stop growing decreased making young children of this generation taller than the previous generation?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, living conditions would be a bigger factor than genetics as how tall people get within the specified time period (50 years). It is said that North Koreans are, on average, three inches shorter than South Koreans due to poor living conditions in the North.</p>
<p>Things like better nutrition, better healthcare and lack of corporeal punishment on women and children with sticks thinner than your thumb all lead to taller people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The conclusions are;</p>
<p>Better genetic mixing. (inbreeding is linked to shorter status) </p>
<p>Better and more food. (It is important for growth that a person gets enough vitamins and minerals during his/hers youth)</p>
<p>Less childhood-infectiondeceases. (infectiondeceases can inhibit growth during its presence)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another factor that I haven't seen commented yet, is the fact that people are able to successfully bring larger babies to term. Thanks to medical advances (c-sections and the like), mothers and their babies are less likely to die during childbirth. Notably when a much larger baby (9+ lbs) is involved. It used to be uncommon for both the mother and child to survive if the baby was 14 lbs, but now, that's a relatively common occurrence (as far as 14 lb babies are concerned).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
