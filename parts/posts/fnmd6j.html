		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You need the immune system to recognize the vaccine component as a threat, not just trash. If you just inject the dead vaccine, it's possible that your macrophages (essentially trash collectors) will just eat the dead virus and move on.</p>
<p>Instead, if you add components called &quot;adjuvants,&quot; the body will actually respond to this new molecule. The T and B cells will respond by making antibodies against that molecule.</p>
<p>So when you're choosing what molecule, you need to find something that is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>unique to the virus (If a very similar component exists in your heart, after the vaccine, your body will destroy that part of your heart. This is called molecular mimicry and is what can happen after you get strep throat. That's why we treat strep throat a little aggressively)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>found in most versions of Covid-19 (Obviously, or this won't be helpful
This is why the flu virus is hard to vaccinate against. We predict which strains are most likely, but we can guess wrong)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Safe for humans to be injected with</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doesn't create TOO strong of an immune response (If people get a fever and feel like shit for a week after the vaccine, they would rather risk getting the actual virus. This is an issue with the flu vaccine (have you heard people say they got flu from the vaccine? They didn't, but they may have gotten too strong of an immune response)).</p>
</li>
<li>Creates a strong enough response in the immunocompromised. (This is a really hard line to walk. People with bad immune systems are high risk to viruses, but they're also harder to vaccinate since their body may not respond to vaccines.)</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Background:  It has long been noted that people who have recovered from certain diseases have immunity to the disease.  That's because their body's immune system has learned to recognize the disease-causing virus/organism as a threat and has built up specific antibodies which are ready to fight it.</p>
<p>A vaccine is a way to trick the body into building up that immunity without giving the person the disease.  They need something which 'looks like' the virus/organism and will create the same response.  A 'dead virus' is the easiest way to do this -- it looks like like the virus but is not active.  There are other ways, though.  They could deactivate the virus in some other way.  They could include surface proteins from the virus.  They could include other things that the virus produces.  The point is to get your body to react to the vaccine as if it were the disease -- but without giving you the disease</p>
<p>None of this is related to why it takes so long to develop a vaccine.  The main roadblock there is testing.  If they are going to give millions of people a vaccine they have to make sure there are no side effects.  That means giving a small group of people the vaccine and waiting to making sure it's not harmful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Injecting dead virus MIGHT be enough for some people, but not everyone. And it's risky, you need to kill the virus enough to not infect, but not enough that it's completely disfigured and unrecognizable by your immune cells.
Luckily modern cellular science has taken the guess work out of this and literally billions of people have been saved. While I'm here gotta shout out to Louis Pasteur and all the science giants through history, we owe them a debt that cannot be paid back, only forward</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Making a vaccine is trying to get your body to deploy massive amounts of soldiers to a crisis that doesn't exist and doing it without any of the soldiers getting so nervous that they start shooting.</p>
<p>That's the line you need to ride to make an effective vaccine. You could inject the deactivated (dead) virus and some people would probably develop immunity. Others would have a severe immunoreaction and get sick and possibly die. Others simply wouldn't develop immunity and you wouldn't know that your vaccine was ineffective until massive amounts of unsuspected infections clued you in too late down the line to help.</p>
<p>Testing takes time, if you don't test thoroughly then you run the risk of creating more illness and death than the disease.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>They help trigger your body to fight the virus.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Imagine you and your friends are at school on the playground. One short, scrawny, goofy looking kids comes up to you whispering that he wants to fight you and your friends. Funny right. Well you and your friends just ignore him and laugh.</p>
<p>Well what if this kid came up with three other older, bigger kids and said he was going to beat you up. Then you and your friends would defend yourselves and you would have a fight.</p>
<p>Those other components are included to provoke your immune system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
