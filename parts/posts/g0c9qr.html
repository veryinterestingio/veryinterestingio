		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Movies, games etc provide an instant dopomine release, which encourages you to continue (instant gratification). When studying you dont get the dopamine release until a lot longer, when you ace a test or feel proud of yourself for studying all day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We pick the video games and movies we pay attention to. As for studies, even if it’s something we enjoy, if it’s taught in a way that is uninteresting, or not how you learn. It’s a wash.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it's voluntary (genuine) interest vs forced interest.  You can pursue an educational interest with just as much fervor if it's something that genuinely interests you.  Something you're truly curious about.</p>
<p>But also because movies/video games/books are often specifically designed to engross us, where as normal activities in life are not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
