		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What makes chickenpox so much worse for adults than for kids? Here's the most accurate, least satisfying answer: Adults experience complications when they get the illness more than children do. That means that if an adult who never contracted chickenpox starts breaking out in the little itchy blisters, they're more likely to suffer side-effects such as pneumonia (an infection in the lungs), hepatitis (an infection in the liver), and encephalitis (an infection in the brain). In men, these risks are even higher. Obviously, all of those side-effects are dangerous in their own way, but why would adults be more likely to get them than little kids?</p>
<p>The fact is, the jury is still out on that. Some experts speculate that the answer lies in the differences between adult and child immune systems. Kids' immune systems are dominated by phagocytes, which are big cells that &quot;eat&quot; any foreign material, while adult immune systems employ more antibodies, which attack microbial invaders like X-Wings attack TIE Fighters. It might be that the hungry, hungry hippo style of immune system is just more effective against certain viruses.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In chicken pox, the stuff that's bad is not actually the virus itself, but the body's reaction to it. Children's immune system is still in development stage. They are not great at their job, which is identifying the pathogen and producing a response to it. However, adults are very good at it. So the response produced is more severe (hypersensitivity) and cause death. It's like this: a gang of thieves enter a sleeping man's home, steals his stuff, knocks over a bit of other stuff and leaves. This is how it is in kids. In adults however, the scenario would change to an awake and fully armed man. He sees the thieves, proceeds to attack them, they fire in return, things turn bloody.</p>
<p>Edit: I'd also like to add that the child's immune system isn't completely dormant. It does make some good antibodies and they get the job done, making only a few red bumps along the way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
