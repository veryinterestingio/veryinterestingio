		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Delta arose in India when vaccination levels there were extremely low. Delta has only slightly increased vaccine resistance relative to the earlier strains of SARS-CoV-2. And delta has greatly increased transmission capacity. </p>
<p>So delta arose in the absence of vaccination, doesn’t do much to avoid immunization, and has obvious selective advantages unrelated to vaccination. So yes, the delta variant would still be here if there was no vaccination. In fact, if vaccination had been rolled out fast enough, delta (and other variants) would have been prevented, because the simplest way to reduce variation is to reduce the pool from which variants can be selected - that is, vaccinate to make far fewer viruses, making fewer variants. </p>
<p>For all the huge push anti-vax liars are currently making for the meme that vaccination drives mutation, it’s obviously not true, just from common sense. A moment’s thought will tell you that this isn’t the first vaccine that’s been made - we have hundreds of years experience with vaccination — and vaccines haven’t driven mutations in the past. Measles vaccination is over 50 years old, and measles didn’t evolve vaccine resistance. Polio vaccination is around 60 years old, no vaccine resistance. Yellow fever vaccine has been used for over 90 years, no vaccine-induced mutations. Mumps, rubella, smallpox. No vaccine driven mutations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The two are almost entirely unrelated.</p>
<p>Diseases mutate on their own. Their lifecycle is rapid. It can take a million generations for a species to mutate, and for humans who don't have kids until we're 20 years old that means a long time. When you reproduce as quickly as viruses do, it's much faster.</p>
<p>Any virus will mutate given enough time and hosts. The existence of a vaccine isn't directly relevant. What vaccines can do, is eliminate hosts and restrict time. If enough people had gotten vaccinated earlier, there would have been less colonies of coronavirus having millions and millions of offspring, and thus the odds of a stable mutation cropping up would be far, far lower.</p>
<p>So, in short, if vaccines are used properly as medical experts suggest, they can kill off a virus before it mutates into something even deadlier, or something the vaccine won't stop. The existence and administration of a vaccine will basically never make a pandemic worse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a example of people  confusing antibiotics and bacteria. Bacteria actually do evolve resistance to antibiotics because they can change/swap DNA to be resistant to antibiotics. Viruses change purely because of the availability of hosts to create new viruses. Errors in the DNA that makes them more survivable in a host propagate faster. The more hosts you have the more likely the virus is to mutate, beneficial mutations will outperform the non-beneficial mutations or even the original strain, that’s the way evolution works. And virus evolution is very very quick. If you give them more hosts, you get more variations. Usually variations that are lethal to the host limit the time that a virus has to spread or “live” which is why a lot of viruses that start out lethal evolve into something that’s less so.  </p>
<p>However, if we’re talking about human viruses, that’s a whole lot of bodies to bury while the virus becomes “civilized”, so get the f’n vaccine please.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
