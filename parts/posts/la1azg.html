		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The object would accelerate towards the core. Once at the core, there is no gravity, so the speed of the object doesn't change at the core. So the object will shoot straight through towards the other side.</p>
<p>If there is no air resistance, the object will make it to approximately the same height that it was dropped from on the other side. At that point, it would finally come to a stop, before being pulled back down. The object would continue to oscillate between the two ends of the tunnel.</p>
<p>With air resistance, the object gets slowed down gradually and would reach a lower height with each oscillation until it finally settles in the center of the Earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simplest case: The hole is along the Earths axis of rotation (or the Earth isn't rotating), the Earth is a perfect sphere with uniform density, and there is no air. The object will fall straight down, accelerating as it falls. The acceleration will be proportional to how far from the center the object is (at the surface a=g, at the halfway point a=0.5*g, at the center a=0). Once it passes the core, the objects inertia will keep it going, but now its slowing down. It will reach the surface level \~44 minutes after it is dropped, then fall back. The motion can be described by simple harmonic motion.</p>
<p>If there is air in the hole: The object will quickly reach terminal velocity as it falls. It will still overshoot the center, but it won't leave the inner core. After a few oscillations, its motion will begin to resemble damped harmonic oscillation.</p>
<p>If the Earth follows its real density profile: The objects acceleration will stop being proportional to its distance from the center. The acceleration will be relatively constant for most of the trip, only starting to drop around the outer core. You also need to account for the Earths lumpiness; dropping the object from one side might not make it to the surface of the other side, or it might make it overshoot (if we go back to the condition of no air).</p>
<p>If you consider the Earths rotation: This can be described in therms of an inertial frame, or a non-inertial frame. The non-inertial answer is that the object will experience Coriolis acceleration, that has magnitude a=Wxv, where W is the vector of the Earths rotation (2*pi/24hr, directed straight out of the north pole), v is the velocity vector of the object, and x is the cross product, meaning the more perpendicular the other two vectors are the larger the acceleration. The inertial answer is that the object has some lateral velocity when it is dropped anywhere but one of the poles, and the lateral velocity of the hole gets smaller as it gets closer to the center of the Earth. Either way, the object will keep bumping against the wall of the hole; the east wall as it falls toward the center, the west wall as it falls away from the center (with both actually being the same wall, since east and west are relative and will seem to swap when you pass the center). If the bumps are frictionless, this will not affect the motion in the direction of the fall.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming the hole was pole to pole (to negate rotation of the earth) and that there is no air resistance the object would accelerate towards the center of the earth, as it passes the center it would begin to decelerate until it reaches exactly the same height it was dropped from on the other side. It would then drop back into the hole and repeat infinitely. According to some calculations I haven’t checked myself, it would take ~42mins for the object to reach the other side. </p>
<p>If we don’t negate air resistance then the same general principle applies in relation to your specific question about how gravity affects it, except now it doesn’t quite reach the other side, and will go back and forth, until it eventually comes to rest in the center. It would also take significantly longer than 42 mins now because the object would reach terminal velocity - which varies depending on what object you drop.</p>
<p>If the hole was not pole to pole, then the object would eventually hit the side of the wall, dramatically slowing it down, making it unlikely it would pass the center at all. It would depend on the friction of the side of the hole whether it even makes it to the center, it’s possible it would reach a point where the rotation is so quick (it would be relatively faster as you approach the center) and the friction so high that it essentially comes to rest as it’s pushed too hard against the wall to overcome friction to continue descending towards the center.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>we did this problem in classical mechanics class. It would oscillate, between the two sides, at the same frequency as if it were to orbit close to the earth, which is about 83 minutes.   </p>
<p>That being said. There would be air resistance so it would slow down. And the earth itself rotates so , if it were in a tube, it would hit the sides. Finally, the inside of the planet is very hot, so it would melt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
