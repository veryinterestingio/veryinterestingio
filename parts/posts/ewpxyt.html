		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For a 5-year old:</p>
<p>Your body loses fat like pulling a small drain at the bottom of the bathtub.  The amount of water in the tub decreases from everywhere, not just the area with the drain.</p>
<p>Your body stores fat like filling up a bathtub with water.  The bottom of the tub is not perfectly flat, so the 'foot' of the bath will have an inch of liquid before the head gets even a little.  </p>
<p>In this way, some areas of your body may be more prone to fill up first with fat but it goes everywhere eventually, and when burning fat it will pull from everywhere and some pesky spots last.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Studies on targeted fat loss date back to as far as the early 1970s, when University of California researchers compared the limbs of tennis players.</p>
<p>They discovered that despite the athletes being one-arm dominant, the subcutaneous (top layer) fat percentage between limbs was the same.</p>
<p>The University of Connecticut conducted a study in 2007 using resistance training and got a similar result.</p>
<p>Where your body loses fat from first comes down to your sex, genetics and body shape, explains exercise physiologist Brooke Norgate.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't. &quot;Targeted fat loss&quot; is not a real thing.</p>
<p>When you exercise, fat cells release molecules of fatty acid into your bloodstream. The fatty acids are released from fat cells throughout the body. </p>
<p>For example, if you do sit down cycling where only your legs move, body fat from all over your body gets utilized, not just from your legs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most answer correctly say you cant target fat loss, however it isnt fair to say &quot;it doesnt.&quot; Your body decides where to burn fat based on your genetics and hormones. Your body will have it's own preference for where to store fat and where to burn it from.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The part of you that &quot;stores fat&quot; is called adipose tissue. It's an organ in its own right, as much as skin or connective tissue, And the main thing it does is store molecules of fat. Think of it like a massive network of warehouses through your body. Your gut, thighs, etc are kind of like massive shipping yards, but there's more, all over, even in little storage boxes studded through your muscles, to make sure that when your cells need energy from fat, there's gonna be some close by.</p>
<p>I mean... they're weird, like... inflatable balloon warehouses but c'mon work with me here.</p>
<p>So whether your body is storing or burning fat, <strong>it tries to keep the level in all the warehouses the same</strong>. It never, for example, stuffs the ones in your thighs 110% full while your face ones just happen to only have 80% in them. And the order to &quot;burn fat to make fuel&quot; goes to the entire body at once.</p>
<p>So that's the answer, the amount of adipose tissue you have in each area <strong><em>is set</em></strong>. The reason fat loss appears different at different parts of the body is because 10% removed from the massive district of tens of thousands of storerooms is going to look very different from 10% removed from the little pod on the corner of the street.</p>
<hr />
<p>Some side notes:</p>
<p>One: it's possible that levels of certain hormones can sometimes change, a little bit, where fat is stored. It seems that if you're very stressed while putting on weight, your body will prioritize the fat around the organs and liver.</p>
<p>Two: adipose tissue being an organ in its own right is part of the metabolic reason why high fat percentage sometimes leads to poor health outcomes; ones actual literal adipose cells are literally stretched too much. On the flip side, it's also why some people can have a high body fat percentage and be a superstar on health metrics; these people literally have more adipose tissue cells, so the same body fat percentage is stored more efficiently.</p>
<p>Three: don't get liposuction! It removes the actual adipose tissue, not just fat! That's a real actual organ that does things!</p>
<p>Four: ever hear that to lose a pound of fat means burning 3500 calories, so a 500 calorie deficit is a pound of loss a week? But then also remembered that a pound is ~454g, and a gram of fat has 9 calories, which means it should be 4086 calories? The 3500 number comes from taking a pound of adipose tissue off a cadaver and putting it in a calorimeter! When your body burns fat it's only the actual fat molecules, not the whole tissue! If you lose a pound per week on a 500 calorie deficit, some of it must be water (or more likely, one of your measurements is wrong). People constantly repeat very silly things about dieting!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
