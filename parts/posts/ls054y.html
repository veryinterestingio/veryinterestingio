		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we shed our skin cells, we shed dead cells from the outer layer of skin, called the epidermis. Scars that stick around generally affect the tissue layer beneath, called the dermis. </p>
<p>When we shed skin, the skin is regenerated from the bottom up. New epidermal cells are formed by cell division at the bottom. To make room for the new cells, the older cells are pushed upwards and eventually die and fall off. </p>
<p>Because the genetic material within a cell generally does not change, the cells that are dividing at the bottom are transmitting the same genetic characteristics - that of the scar tissue. For that reason, all of the cells that are constantly being created to replace the dead skin are being created from scar tissue, so the scar remains permanent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our skin is made up of many layers that have a specific order to them. The outer layers are dead skin cells that are flattened to form a barrier. The living layer underneath is formed of a web of stretchy fibres called collagen. In normal skin, the collagen fibres are all pointing in different directions quite evenly, and spaced out quite regularly. This makes plenty of space for skin cells in-between the fibres, and it means that your skin is equally stretchy in all directions.</p>
<p>When we get a cut, our bodies' main job is to close the cut. So when it starts rebuilding the collagen web, it does it in the fastest way possible. The result is that the collagen is more or less pointing the same direction now, and it's much more tightly packed together. Depending on the type of wound an dhow your body scars, you might also end up with it overstuffed with cells or understuffed with cells. The result is a bit of skin that doesn't move like the rest of it, and sometimes is raised or dimpled. Because of the different structure, other cells like melanocytes (which are the cells that give your skin its color) move through a scar strangely. This can mean they can't get in easily, and you end up with pale scars, or it can mean they clump up, and you end up with darker scars.</p>
<p>Scars fade as the collagen web is gradually taken apart and replaced over time. But the bigger and deeper the scar, and the more ordered the scar collagen is, the longer it takes for the skin to go back to normal.</p>
<p>One of the ways we prevent scars is by treating the wound with medicines that specifically slow down wound healing, allowing a more natural collagen web to form instead of the rushed version. This can be dangerous of course, since an open wound is a bad thing, but it's important for things like eye surgery, where you really don't want a scar blocking a person's eyesight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Ah yes, the eerie opening-of-old-wounds, and even eerier, <em>long-healed broken bones falling apart again</em>. [shudder] There are many reports of this phenomenon in explorers' literature and it's been replicated in guinea pigs. (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bjs.18002811112/abstract" target="_blank">here</a>)  </p>
<p>It's most likely due to breakdown of the collagen in scar tissue. It's well known that vitamin C is necessary for collagen <em>synthesis</em>  - thus slowed healing of new wounds in extreme scurvy, including  failure of fractured bone to heal. But apparently it's also necessary  for collagen <em>maintenance</em> in  those connective tissues that still have a large number of living  fibroblasts, which apparently is the case in scars and also in healed  bones. In those tissues, during extreme scurvy, the fibroblasts will  actually start breaking down the previously-laid-down collagen fibers.  This breakdown will occur faster if the scar was originally laid down  during a time of mild scurvy; such scars are already weaker.  </p>
<p>You also get teeth loosening or falling out for the same reason.  </p>
<p>More cites <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1961.tb46115.x/abstract" target="_blank">here</a> and also <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJM195808072590605" target="_blank">here</a>. These are all really old papers; very small-n and no molecular tools, but they did know their histology back then.  </p>
<p>EDIT: Found this in one of the old papers above - interesting to see a firsthand account:  </p>
<p>&quot;But  a most extraordinary circumstance, and what would be scarcely credible  upon any single evidence, is, that the scars of wounds which had been  for many years healed, were forced open again by this virulent  distemper. Of this, there was a remarkable instance in one of the  invalids on board the <em>Centurion</em>, who had been wounded above fifty years before at the battle of the <em>Boyne</em>;  for though he was cured soon after, and had continued well for a great  number of years past, yet on his being attacked by the scurvy, his  wounds, in the progress of his disease, broke out afresh, and appeared  as if they had never been healed. Nay, what is still more astonishing,  the callous of a broken bone, which had been completely formed for a  long time, was found to be hereby dissolved, and the fracture seemed as  if it had never been consolidated.&quot;  </p>
<p>from George Anson's &quot;A Voyage Around The World&quot;, 1748</p>
