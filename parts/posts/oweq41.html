This is cause the fabric kinda sticks to the skin in ways it doesn't when it is not wey. Why is that? Shouldn't water generate less friction than normal, not-wet skin?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The water causes the clothes to stick to your skin because the fabric is attracted to the water. It's the same basic principal that allows paper towels to soak up water. This increases the total amount of fabric-to-skin contact.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes but normally when you put on clothes there's little to no fabric-to-skin contact, so even though water is better than skin, it's worse than just avoiding contact altogether. A better comparison would be wet clothes vs a skin-tight rubber suit. The wet clothes are easier to put on because fabric-to-wet skin contact is better than rubber-to-skin contact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water is ever so slightly sticky (why it sometimes dribbles down a kettle instead of leaving the spout smoothly), especially with itself (why it forms nice puddles instead of spreading out into infinity on a flat surface). </p>
<p>When clothes go over wet skin, the stickiness of the water is amplified by the fact that it can absorb into your skin and the clothes at the same time, increasing contact surface to transmit friction and even bringing the clothes closer the skin.</p>
<p>On less permeable surfaces (like a car tyre on a road), water does provide lubrication, because it forms a fluid film, and the friction of a flat solid surface with a fluid is less than friction between two solid surfaces. </p>
<p>But sliding clothes onto wet skin is not nearly enough to form a real fluid film. As a result waterâ€™s cohesive properties dominate, as opposed to lubrication.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
