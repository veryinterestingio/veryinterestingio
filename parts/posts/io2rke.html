		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My answer is going to be a bit more general, so will not directly answer the specific local questions (and hopefully by the end of the answer, it will be clear why a more direct answer is very challenging). </p>
<p>We can start with the observation that a variety of recent heatwaves in the last 10-20 years have been linked back to a variety of changes (general increases in mean temperature, but specific changes in sea surface temperatures, atmospheric dynamics, etc that combine to generate specific heatwaves) attributable to anthropogenically driven climate change. As an example, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2012JD018020" target="_blank">Trenberth &amp; Fasulluo, 2012</a> discuss the mechanisms behind the heatwaves that hit Europe and Russia during 2010 and link these back, in part, to changes related to climate change.</p>
<p>The Trenberth &amp; Fasullo paper (or similar 'attribution' type papers for extreme heat events) are a good place to start as it demonstrates some of the challenges of isolating specific mechanisms that generate extreme heat events and in turn linking those back to changes induced by climate change. If we turn our attention more to the spirit of the question, i.e. future predictions, it is good to keep those challenges in mind. One of the reasons that it's challenging to answer the original question posed by OP, is that climate change is not just changing the mean air temperature, but there are a myriad of effects and it's been recognized for a long time that one of the implications of this is that when we consider temperature extremes, it's not as simple as just thinking about the shift in the mean, but that the variance of the temperature changes as well (e.g. <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/bams/article/81/3/427/57373" target="_blank">Meehl et al, 2000</a>). More simply, if we envision the range of temperatures for a place measured over a reasonable period (e.g. 20 years) as a bell curve (an oversimplification, but instructive for the moment), knowing the projected change in the mean (i.e. shifting the center of the bell curve toward higher temps) is not enough to project the change in the probability of extreme temperatures, or their magnitudes, because the shape of the bell curve is changing as well. This is explored much more thoroughly (with a lot of discussion of some of the drivers, e.g. changes in soil moisture, etc) in <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40641-016-0042-x" target="_blank">Horton et al, 2016</a>. This also highlights that to really understand these changes for a particular region requires coupling of large-scale global climate models with embedded, finer resolution regional models that resolve some of these important changes (something that is becoming increasingly common to do, but is still new-ish in terms of what we've been doing with climate models and projections). In detail, looking at how extremes will change suggest that as the mean shifts to higher temperatures, that the shape of the distribution of temperature events will begin to change (which we knew before) and be biased toward more extreme heat events, i.e. they become more likely than if you just thought about the change in the mean (e.g. <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015GL064914" target="_blank">Horton et al, 2014</a> or <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep05884" target="_blank">Kodra &amp; Ganguly, 2014</a>). Results like these show that the statistics of the maximum temperatures will (in most places) increase more than the mean temperature (i.e. if the mean temp of a place is projected to increase by 2C, then the mean maximum temperature might increase by 4C as a purely hypothetical example). However, another implication of this is that answering your original question, i.e. identifying absolute maximum temperatures likely under a given assumed future climate, becomes extremely dependent on exactly how we treat that distribution and its tails (which in general, is always an issue with predicting maxima or minima of natural events even if we don't think the underlying distribution is changing, i.e. absolute values are dictated by how we treat the tails of distributions for which we may have no observational constraint because of our length of record and the return period for extreme events) or how good a job the models do at resolving those tails. For this reason, when we consider extreme temperatures it's more common to see efforts like the one in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2631#Abs2" target="_blank">Jones et al, 2015</a>, where they are considering future risks of extreme heat events in the US, but are presenting this as number of days (and/or number of people exposed) above a temperature threshold, which is still dependent on how we consider a future hypothetical distribution, but is less absolutely sensitive (compared to asking 'What is the maximum') to how the tail is described or how well it may be resolved in a climate model.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> While we know that extreme heat events will become more likely as the mean temperature increases, that generally the maximum temperatures are predicted to increase more than the mean temperatures, and that the shape of the distribution of temperatures will change, saying anything concrete about absolute maximums or changes to absolute maximums require knowing more about precisely how that distribution will change and/or what the extreme tail of that distribution will look like (which we don't know). You could take results like those in the Horton et al 2014 paper (link above) and do some back of the envelope projections based on changes in mean vs max, but I'm not aware of a rigorous answer to the specific question posed by OP.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
