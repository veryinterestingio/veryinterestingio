Janitors clean at night, and security makes rounds inside the building (in some locations).
Sometimes their are employees still in there working very late.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In any modern office buildings, the light should be motion activated so it very likely is someone turning on the lights. Usually you can see that not all the lights are on, only some are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can give you an answer. I work for a commercial retail / office real-estate management company in Toronto. The ELI5 version is &quot;so that people can see&quot; ... but I'll go a bit deeper maybe ELI-15. </p>
<p>Reason 1 - There are people in the building. Large buildings are multi tenant, so even if the building has a company name on the side there may be 30 different companies leasing in it. Within those companies you are going to run into 24/7 operations departments including banks dealing with global markets, law offices that work 24/7 on cases,  financial institutions that work overnight to meet deadlines, and Security guards working for high security tenants.  There are also overnight staff who work for the landlord including security, cleaners and operations. Any noisy and or otherwise disruptive construction work happens after hours as well so, large buildings usually have multiple construction projects happening in them overnight. This number of people is small in comparison to daily operations but is still significant. </p>
<p>Reason 2 - Practicality. Large buildings don't usually have light switches in the traditional sense. The lights (as well as fans, pumps and everything else) run on a Building Automation System (BAS) that has a daytime and night time mode. Night time mode keeps some lights on in the office (will get into why later) This guarantees that even if the office admin forgets to hit the switch when leaving for the day, the lights will go into night mode and only a few lights will be left on. After hours if a worker wants all the lights turned on for a floor, they dial a number and put in a code (unique to that tenant) the lights turn on for a pre-programmed amount of time (usually 2 hours default) and the tenant gets billed. There are also sometimes personal office lights which are not on a program and are instead on a switch. In new offices these are usually on a motion sensor and or a motion sensor which can be turned on / off with a switch. These lights are the responsibility of the employee in that office to turn off.</p>
<p>Reason 3 - Safety and or the illusion of safety. This one is simple, people who work in places late at night feel safer when the lights are on. There are a lot of people who are just generally uneasy when the lights are out.  The fear is that someone is going to jump out from behind a filing cabinet and do bad things to them. The reality is that lights being on does not make the office environment safer from bad guys but security theater is sometimes just as important as actual security.</p>
<p>Reason 4 - Legal stuff. Every place in the world will have some version of a law called something along the lines of &quot;occupiers liability act&quot; which states that if you own property and people will be visiting that property for a lawful reason then you have a legal obligation to make it safe for them. How safe? whats reasonable .... whats reasonable? whatever a judge decides based on arguments made by lawyers. Would it be reasonable to have a few lights on if cleaners, operations, security guards, construction workers, late night employees, ect. are going to be walking through the office space late at night? Probably .... </p>
<p>I might have missed or left out some stuff but I think that is the gist of it. Lighting in high rise office buildings does reduce significantly after hours and I encourage everyone to turn off their personal office lights and or close the blinds at night. One issue all major city's have is migratory birds flying into the glass and being killed. In Toronto we have a program called FLAP (Fatal Light Awareness Program) they encourage people to turn off their lights at night to reduce those casualty's. Unfortunately, a lot of the time these suggestions are forgotten or ignored and security / cleaning staff are left to deal with lots of injured or dead birds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work in one. We were instructed to always leave the lights on for the cleaning crew, which makes sense. It's not like the cleaning crew can clean every room simultaneously, so the last rooms cleaned will be the last lights turned off, which is why some lights will be on much later than others. </p>
<p>It won't be symmetrical either, because crews on different floors move at different paces, have varying degrees of cleaning to do, and may start in different sections of a floor than the the other crews. Some tenants may want their lights left on all night for security reasons, some office workers actually do work late into the night or arrive super early, sometimes people just forget to turn them off, and some areas may not be lit at all because they are vacant at the moment. </p>
<p>Essentially, a skyscraper is like a vertical small town or massive apartment complex. At any given time of the night, lots of lights are on in people's homes, you just don't notice it because they aren't all stacked up in one neat column covered in windows on display.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
