			<a href="/posts/n4cb31" onclick="return false">Why, when observing a drop of water or any sustance under a microscope, bacteria and microorganisms always move on a 2D plane? Weren't they suppose to move on a 3D space and we should see them changing their size because they move closer or further from the lens?</a>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. And also, no. Because of lens focus complications.
Microscope usage is defined by the “glass slide”. What ever is going to be observed is deliberately limited to a 2D plane so that the lens can focus once, and observation can then happen for prolonged periods of time. As proof that this often still doesn’t work as well as intended— take a look at microscopic photographs of bacteria, etc. You will see faded blurry shapes around the clear and sharp shapes. Those blurs are bacteria/etc. that are further/closer to the lens than the focus is currently calibrated for. Imagine the difficulty in trying to get more than one single bacteria in focus in a 1-inch deep liquid— never mind the difficulty keeping it in focus! To keep it in focus would require it so “swim” perfectly parallel to the lens. Highly unlikely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

But, you need to do this to keep them from vanishing completely. when they go out of the super-thin depth of field of the microscope.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>That's what happens when we focus on very small, up close objects. We can bring into sharp focus a certain depth away from the lens, but anything closer or further away quickly becomes blurry.</p>
<p>Often slides under a microscope will place a thin plastic square over what they're viewing which compresses a 3D water droplet into something closer to 2D, but it still has depth. You can find things closer and further in that tiny almost flat space, but you need to adjust the focus to see them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Microscopes do have planes of focus. Where things can be on top of/below other things. Anyone who does microscopy knows you constantly have to move the fine adjustment up &amp; down to see the refractile nature of things. Like even within a single cell, you may need to move up and down to see the different organelles present.</p>
<p>Also, when using a &quot;wet mount&quot; or some sort of fluid it's typical to coverslip it to a) create a more uniform layer and b) to keep the sample from contacting the objective lens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
