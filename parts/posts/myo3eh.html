		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Marine fishes have two options for osmoregulation(fancy word for making sure the animals body has the right salt:water ratio) : accumulate enough salts to make your inner organs have the same salt concentration as the outer water. This way getting fresh water doesnt matter since your body is adapted to the salt.
Other option, is to have good kidneys that can get a lot of the salt out through piss more salty than the csgo community. This way the animal doesnt need to modify its entire body to work with salt water.</p>
<p>First option is used by marine sharks, rays, etc while the second is used by marine bony fishes. I didnt learn about marine mammals in particular, but I'd say its the second option. Correct me if im wrong.</p>
<p>PS: Yes OP, basically all mammals and most organisms do need fresh water. </p>
<p>EDIT: shoutout to u/mynameismrguyperson for the extra info that technically sharks dont accumulate the sea salts, rather they build up urea(main waste in urine) and a fancy chemical called TMAO that is sort of equivalent to accumulating sea salts.</p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/204/11/1831/32941/Osmoregulation-in-Marine-Mammals" target="_blank">https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/204/11/1831/32941/Osmoregulation-in-Marine-Mammals</a></p>
<p>Turns out Im wrong and mammals are not at all similar to fishes in osmoregulation tactics. TLDR They drink less salt water and simply make fresh water from all their own metabolic( a blanket term for all the chemical reactions in the body) processes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sea mammals do need fresh water like all other organisms though because they are submerged in water they need less fresh water than land critters. They don't need to sweat or pant to regulate their body heat and when they need to urinate they don't need to expel a mostly liquid stream to avoid getting waste on themselves. Their urine is very concentrated. Because they are so good at holding onto water they are able to get the majority of the fresh water they need from the food they eat. AFAIK they can drink sea water if needed, as I understand it they very rarely need to drink though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I recently visited Seaworld and asked the trainers about this. Both whales and dolphins need fresh water. In the wild, they get it from the water content in their food. In captivity, the trainers supplement them with freshwater ice cubes. The ice cubes serve as both a training reward and a source of fresh water. </p>
<p>I had a chance to feed the dolphins,, and the trainer told me not to break up the fish, because it would lose some of the water content.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Herbavoires are very adept at eliminating salt content from their food, which is just as salty as the water. </p>
<p>Carnivores eat fish and other bits and bobs of the sea that have salt content similar to their blood content so they do not need to do as much filtering (they still do but not the degree of herbavoires)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
