		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are travelling through cervical fluid. When a woman ovulates and is most fertile, her cervical fluid becomes clear and mucous like, perfect for sperm to travel along. The consistancy of cervical fluid changes throughout the month and becomes less easy for said swimmers to travel along when she is not fertile.</p>
<p>The cavities do contain these cervical fluids but it's not as much as you think, its just enough to coat the surface of the womb. Aside from this, it is empty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both uterus and Fallopian tubes are filled with liquid. They're even directly connected to the peritoneal cavity, and trust me, you don't want to have any air in there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
