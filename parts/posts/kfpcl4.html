<p>Serum Institute of India also has a version of the Novavax vaccine which they’ve called COVAVAX. </p>
<p>Both are independently being tested in clinical trials in India. </p>
<p>Do these vaccines differ from their source company counterparts? If so, how? If not, why are they being re-tested in distinct clinical trials?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>India along with countries like Bangladesh can receive special rights for producing patented medicines for very low cost. This has created a massive and booming pharmaceutical industry in these countries. I remember last time I visited Bangladesh pretty much every town had a pharmacy district with multiple drugstores on the same street. There wasn't a prescribed medicine you couldn't find. This extends to vaccines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
