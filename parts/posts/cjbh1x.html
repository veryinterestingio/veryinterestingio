		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Under certain conditions the pixelated/digital camo does a better job at breaking up the lines/outline/silhouette of the soldier. </p>
<p>The point of camouflage is not only to match the background colour of the soldier's environment, but also to break up any easily identifiable lines. If camo was colour matched to the surroundings but still in big stripes, the soldier would still stand out pretty good (depending on lighting conditions etc.)</p>
<p>Old camo schemes were big hand designed &quot;splotches&quot;. Good, but smaller more random splotches break up the pattern of the soldier, load carrying vest, gun/ammo etc. better. The newer digital patterns are even better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So in the early 2000’s, the Marines began moving over from BDU’s (the old green/black woodland pattern) to something called MARPAT. MARPAT was a pixelated pattern designed to blend more easily into the background and to distinguish Marines from other services. It came in two colors, though the desert-tan version has seen more use than the green version you typically see in-garrison.</p>
<p>Like other Marine uniforms, everyone loved it and wanted their own version. The different service chiefs put out a call from vendors to design something specific to each branch, and after several years of expensive designs and testing, they got their wish. The Army came out with the ACU pattern which was a sort of digital-grey pattern, the Air Force came out with ABU, and the Navy went with the Type I blue pattern uniform before dropping that and going to the NWU tan/green uniform.</p>
<p>Here’s the problem that came with everyone coming up with their own service-specific digital pattern uniforms: it cost a lot of money, and they mostly sucked at what they were supposed to do. The Army and Air Force uniforms blended in with absolutely nothing, and would quickly fade to a light-grey after too much use out in the field. The Navy Type I uniform was great at blending in with the ocean....which is exactly what you don’t want to do if you get tossed overboard from a boat. Also, they had a tendency to be explosively flammable. </p>
<p>So after a decade and a half of these uniforms, the Army and Air Force are now consolidating into the OCP pattern, which is a chunky tan/green/black camouflage pattern similar to the original BDU’s, but cut like the Army ACUs, The Navy, as I mentioned, is going with the NWU, and the Marines are doing their own thing and sticking with MARPAT.</p>
<p>TLDR: The Marines made a functional and cool uniform, service chiefs from other branches got jealous and made crappy knockoffs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The human eye and brain is very good at detecting the shape or silhouette of an object, the color and movement. Camo tries to break up the outline and color of what a human should look like.</p>
<p>If you look at a forest or a bush. The shadows of the leaves and the sunlight breaking through create small patches of light and dark, similar to the pixelated dots on a camo shirt.</p>
<p>And from a distance have those pixels not all blend together into a gray outline <a href="http://www.operatoreditor.com/img/camoTest/test_acu_1.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.operatoreditor.com/img/camoTest/test_acu_1.jpg</a></p>
<p>Compared to <a href="http://multicampattern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/062.jpg" target="_blank">http://multicampattern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/062.jpg</a></p>
<p>By seeing the outline, aiming is easier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the question is why pixels since they are &quot;artificial&quot; looking.</p>
<p>The answer is if you're close enough to see the pixels, you're close enough to see the solder. I don't think there would be much difference if the pixels were similarly sized &quot;organic-looking&quot; shapes. The key is breaking up recognizable lines and patterns.</p>
<p>Also, if you think about the things that are on the solder (buckles, straps, gun) there are plenty of straight lines. Having camo with some straight edges to mask those straight features makes sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
