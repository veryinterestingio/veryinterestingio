		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The brain decouples attention from outward sensation. It decides that nothing too important, difficult or dangerous is happening out there, and cuts the connection between the external and internal worlds.</p>
<p>Your brain works at memory retrieval of things important to your own life, your future, your relationships etc - things you know a lot about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a big day dreamer. I can just sit and stare at the tv or whatever and go completely offline in my own imagination, Making up some wild story in which i'm the main character.
I do the same during slow periods in my work or bus rides. So it is also a great way to pass the time.
But it also happens on moments i have to pay attention (presentations, classes, meetings) i'm paying attention and something is said which makes me think of a question and that just opens pandorras box.  I start loosing my self in possoble scenarios and then my brain drifts off trying to calm down and bam 10 minutes gone. And to add to it i have also forgotyen what the question was that i had.</p>
<p>What truely happens with the brain i don't know but that is what happens to me if i were to describe it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure, but I have heard a theory that one of the reasons we like staring at ocean waves or a campfire is because they are a no repeating random view that's safe that gives our brand a randomized screensaver that keeps our forebrains kind of occupied and let's our subconscious process and think up new stuff.not sure if valid or not</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It goes into a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man. It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity. It is the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and superstition, and it lies between the pit of man's fears and the summit of his knowledge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
