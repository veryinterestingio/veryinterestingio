		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;anxiety lump&quot; in your throat (when you're about to do public speaking, or when you're upset and about to cry), is caused by muscular tension keeping your glottis dilated to maximize air flow. The &quot;clenched chest&quot; or &quot;heartache&quot; deeper down your torso is caused by vagus nerve (which largely controls parasympathetic control of your organs) getting kicked out of &quot;chill&quot; mode by stress and entering &quot;survival&quot; mode, so it's going to tell the various organs to pump blood harder and faster, stop digesting, start producing cortisol and adrenaline, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a part of your brain called the amygdala that controls your fight or flight response. When the amygdala activates it causes a response in nerves and blood vessels in your abdomen and chest. Often times people feel sick to their stomach or have chest pain when really anxious because of this</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5? You're an animal. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominidae" target="_blank">A primate specifically.</a></p>
<p>And evolution has primed us with thousands of specific adaptions to survive our predators.</p>
<p>One of those is the <strong>acute stress response</strong>, better known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response" target="_blank">'flight or fight'</a>. Which involves flooding our systems with cocktails of hormones to devote resources towards immediate survival.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for us now living <em>out</em> of the food chain, the response is hair-triggered by design. After all, there was no such thing as <em>nearly</em> escaping your predators. You either live to reproduce or you don't.</p>
<p>Meaning our bodies have a habit of going all-in at the slightest provocation. Even in situations where it's not appropriate, such as stressful social situations or receiving bad news.</p>
<p>So to specifically answer your question - what's happening is a sudden cascade of signalling hormones that up the heart rate, dilate the pupils, halt digestion, flush your face, shake the muscles, bring your brain into hyper-arousal and prepare for a situation that the body thinks is life or death.</p>
<p>But it's not life or death.</p>
<p>You've just bumped into your ex at the supermarket.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The adrenaline response does one thing = get energy to the muscles ASAP. All other processes that require energy are turned down to low. Digestion (butterflies), waste (urination), immune system (stress cold), all take a backseat to skeletal muscle (jitters) and sensory nervous system (time slowing down). The circulatory system also gets ahead of the work that is about to happen by raising blood pressure, increasing heart rate, and increasing breathing. Thermoregulation also gets ahead of the work by cooling down your body (sweating) preemptively so the action of your muscles doesn't cause you to prematurely overheat when you're running/fighting for your life. Emergency fuel stores (glycogen) are also released by your liver to add more gas to your muscles, which is why people under adrenaline are stronger than their baseline.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
