They grow, shrink or whatever, but they dont keep the shape. Store bought cookies, on the other hand, sometimes have some designs and shapes that seem imposible to achieve at home. How is it possible?</p></div></div>

<p>If you make madelines at home (with the relevant pan), the same thing will happen on the front side. Madeline pans don't usually have a back/top sheet, but you could put one on there if you wanted it dead flat. Same idea with industrial cookies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to other commenters re baking in a mould there’s another couple of tricks of the trade. The recipe will be engineered in a way that the dough is the perfect consistency to maintain said shape.</p>
<p>At our bakery while we don’t bake any elaborate shapes we do chill all our shortbread before baking, this helps it maintain its shape. So you could try that if you want to maintain the original shape better at home - after cutting out the shape put the dough in the fridge for a couple of hours before baking :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Everything is done by machines that have been built to do their one job and calibrated to perform exactly the same way over and over. Their recipes are designed to give them the results they want and the machines eliminate the opportunity for human error.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I make sugar cookies at Christmas every year. We keep adding flour as we work to the board, rolling pin, the cutters, etc. i notice that the later batches (more flour incorporated) stay in exact shapes whereas the earlier ones spread more or are more puffy. I'd imagine commercially, they have these ratios down to a science to create those neat edges everytime. You can also see that's not true for every type of cookie. Some, like chocolate chip, are often a little rough around the edges.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
