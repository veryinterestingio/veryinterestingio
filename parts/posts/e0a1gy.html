		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The unit isn't putting out air at 25 C.</p>
<p>If it's in cooling mode, it's putting out very cold air until the ambient temperature reaches 25 C. </p>
<p>If it's in heating mode, it's putting out very warm air until the ambient temperature hits 25 C.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In cooling mode, the thermostat will wait until the temperature goes over 25°C and then turn on the AC until it falls back under 25°C. This produces a 'spike' of cold air when the AC is on, followed by the temperature slowly drifting up toward warm.</p>
<p>In heating mode, the thermostat will wait until the temperature goes under 25°C, then turn on the heater until it is back over 25°C. This produces a 'spike' of hot (and dry!) air when the heater comes on, followed by the temperature slowly dropping back down toward cold.</p>
<p>Naturally, these feel different from one another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don’t forget: you perceive the average radiant temperature of your surroundings.
In summer with HVAC at 25C, the walls might be 28C so you feel warm.
In winter with the HVAC set at 25C, the walls could be 18C, so you feel chilled.</p>
<p>Also, HVAC is always playing catch up- if the unit is on in summer, the air is warmer than 25, if it’s in in winter the the air is cooler than 25.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humidity is also important. </p>
<p>Air can hold a certain amount of water. The closer it is to capacity, the less additional water it can absorb and the more humid it feels. The farther from full capacity it is, the more water it will absorb and the drier the air feels.</p>
<p>Hot air can hold more water than cold air, and the A/C doesn’t change the amount of water in the air, it just adjusts the temperature.</p>
<p>So if you start with cold air, there will be very little water in it, because it can’t hold much, but because it can’t hold much, that little bit of water gets it most of the way to full, so it doesn’t feel very dry. If you heat that air up, there is now a lot more room for water in the air, but it is still only holding that little bit of water, so now it’s going to feel very dry.</p>
<p>If you start with hot air, it has more room for water, so it will be holding a good amount of water. Cool it down, and now it has less room for water, but is still holding that larger amount, so it feels more humid.</p>
<p>If you’re heating the air to 25C, the end result is going to feel drier than if you’re cooling the air to 25C, because the amount of water in the air to start with is likely to be different depending on which direction you’re coming from temperature-wise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
