		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have mentioned that it takes many times more plant material to feed a cow to get meat for you than it would take just to feed you with the plant material. I often see 10x thrown out there.</p>
<p>Another key is that getting the food to the cows requires transportation, which emits greenhouse gas. So it's 10x the plant material, and around 11x the transportation since instead of just transporting the plants to the processing facility and then your grocery store, they transport plants to the cows, then the cows to the processing facility and grocery store. This increase in transportation cost applies to all non-hunted meat, unlike the methane that comes up for cows.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Raising animals to provide meat uses a lot of food and water and land over their lifetime compared to how much meat you eventually get to eat at the end. And then even more water to grow all the grain that the food animal needs to eat.</p>
<p>In terms of total water, <a href="https://www.producer.com/livestock/how-much-water-is-required-to-produce-a-pound-of-beef/" target="_blank">it's estimated</a> to take 1,590 gallons (6018 L) of water to produce just 1 lb (0.45 kg) of beef.</p>
<p>Farming plants to eat also produces way less greenhouse gases than farming livestock (which produce CO2 and methane). Plants consume CO2 and produce oxygen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Raising cattle at a large scale consumes significant resources compared to other food, land, and water systems.</p>
<p>In Brazil grazing land is more profitable than wild rainforests so ranchers will slash and burn natural forests to create grazing land for castle displacing a vital natural habitat and carbon sink. </p>
<p>Depending on what you feed cattle there can be significant environmental impacts as well. If you feed castle food humans can eat (such as corn or grain) many tons of food go into raising the cow, far more than humans will ultimately get to eat when the cow is slaughtered (because much of the nutrients went to keeping the cow alive and growing.)</p>
<p>Overall animals turn feed into significantly less food and the practices and conditions we use to mass produce meat displace natural environments and create a ton of waste products as well compared to eating plants.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has been established that diversity is essential for a healthy environment.</p>
<p>Half of the world's land is farmland. </p>
<p>70% of the world's bird population is poultry, mostly chickens. </p>
<p>We account for 1/3 of the mammal population by weight, a further 60% is mammals we raise to eat (e.g. cows). The remainin livestock of mammals makes up 4%. We have generated a planet that is made up of humankind for humankind which has decreased diversity.  </p>
<p>For every large carnivore in the natural environment, there are around 100 prey animals that take up large quantities of space. Every time we chose to eat a piece of meat, we are unknowingly using up large quantities of land. Every person on this planet can not possibly consume meat, there just is not the space. </p>
<p>It has been argued in the latest Attenborough film (a life on our planet) that the quickest and effective way to restore some diversity is by switching to a meat free diet. That would allow farmland to diminish (to make room for the Wildlands to thrive again) and  diversity would the start to increase again. </p>
<p>Simple as that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have to grow 10 calories of animal feed to produce 1 calorie of meat. Instead of growing the animal feed, you could just grow vegetables for humans instead and produce way more calories of food. Or you could  grow 1 calorie of vegetables for 1/10th the amount of resources (land, water, fertilizer, fuel, etc).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
