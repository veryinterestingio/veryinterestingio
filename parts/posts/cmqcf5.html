I’m very surprised that in a world where science and medicine seem so focus on extending life expectancy, we don’t see and hear much about this case.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Science is definitely interested in how it genetically does this, but the mechanism of destroying most of your body and nervous system to revert back into a crude polyp isn't really useful to a more complicated animal.</p>
<p>The jellyfish that re-emerge from the polyp colony after a recycling are genetic clones of the original and they can do this indefinitely, although rarely do it more than once in practice.</p>
<p>Breaking you down into cellular mush and then producing a few infants that are genetic clones of you is a neat trick, but doesn't help you the adult live longer as an adult.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It’s not like jellyfish avoid death, it’s rather that their death of a part of the new cycle of life for those.. components</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Jellyfish don't have brains, and that does simplify things - a lot.  Lots of scientists are very interested in the auto-cloning process.  The folks working on extending human life expectancy are really keen on having the same &quot;person&quot; live longer, so the whole brain is mostly required for their work to gain acceptance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's cool, true, but not really relevant to longevity itself.  Basically, the jellyfish (and hydrozoan, but I am lumping them together here) life cycle usually works like <a href="https://teara.govt.nz/files/large_images/di-5355-enz.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>.  Jellyfish float around, produce eggs and sperm which combine and produce an embryo and then a larva.  The larva sinks down to the ocean floor where it turns into what looks like a tiny sea anemone.  This buds off new free-swimming jellyfish from the top of it, which then float away to grow and reproduce.</p>
<p>What happens with this particular species is that it can transform from jellyfish medusa (the jellyfish part) back to the polyp (the sea anemone-looking part).</p>
<p>Now in one sense, this is like an adult going back to a baby, or a butterfly turning back into a caterpillar.  So it's getting younger right, which means it can last forever!   But hold on.  It's getting younger in terms of <em>shape</em>, but that doesn't tell you anything about the animal's age on the level of its DNA.  Its easy to imagine a situation where the total lifespan of the animal is not extended, it's just able to swap back and forth from medusa to polyp as circumstances require.</p>
<p>However...it's not unreasonable to expect these guys could live a very long time and not age at all....not because they are able to revert to polyps, but because lots of related invertebrates seem to simply not age.  Corals can live thousands of years <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/deep-sea-corals-may-be-oldest-living-marine-organism" target="_blank">1</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27671533" target="_blank">2</a>, jellyfish polyps can live at least decades, and so can hydra, who show <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/this-tiny-animal-can-live-an-estimated-1400-years/" target="_blank">no signs at all of aging</a>.  And our minimum estimation of lifespan is based on how long we have watched them, because they have no hard parts to date.  I strongly suspect many or maybe even most cnidarians (the group of animals that all of the above belong to) don't really age at all on a genetic level.  And for all we know that may be true of a broad range of invertebrates.  For example, the humble sea urchin can live <a href="https://today.oregonstate.edu/archives/2003/nov/red-sea-urchins-discovered-be-one-earths-oldest-animals" target="_blank">200 years</a> and show no signs of aging...and we would never have discovered that if the animal had not had hard parts which could be dated.  I've got no proof, but my guess is that there are plenty of invertebrates that don't age but which we have no idea about because there's no way to tell how old they are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
