		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of good answers here already. One thing I wanted to chime in with is the concept of electron shielding.</p>
<p>If shielding was perfect, then adding one proton (+) and one electron (-) should have no change in attraction i.e. radius/affinity/electronegativity. But shielding is not perfect and is even worse when talking about electrons in the same orbital. So the effective nuclear charge gets larger as you move across a row in the periodic table but once you go to a new row and a shell is complete, the shielding to the new orbital is much stronger.</p>
<p>To get really into the concept of shielding you have to treat the orbitals quantum mechanically and look at the probability distributions and how they penetrate deeper into the nucleus, i.e. exposed positive charge.</p>
<p>Happy to go deeper into the answer if people are interested...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electronegativity is based on electron affinity (which tells how stable is an atom with an extra electron) in a covalent bond. This means, that the atom that is more stable with an extra electron than the other has higher electronegativity. All atoms are trying to get to the configuration of a nobel gas (the most stable state) --&gt; atoms which have more electrons are closer to filling their valence shell --&gt; they're also closer the nobel gas.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have read a few answers and they approach to the answer partially.
First let's talk about isoelectonic ions. If we try to compare elements with the same amount of electrons we will notice the following:
For N-2, O-, F and Ne+ (7 electrons in the outer layer), nitrogen is the least likely to accept an electron, because it's already negative (-2) and it's only trying to complete the octet, while neon is positively charged and is trying to complete the octet, even more than fluorine.
If we take the same elements, but neutralized (electrons according to the number of protons), N(5e), O(6e), F(7e) and Ne(8e), we can see that nitrogen needs 3 electrons, but focusing in the first electron capture we can see that there are 7 positive charges trying to pull in that electron to make an ion that have a 8:7 negative charges over positive charges, while fluorine will end up with just a 10:9 ratio that is closer to the 1:1 energetically favorable configuration (for now we will just avoid shielding effects), neon here doesn't need more electrons to complete the octet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
