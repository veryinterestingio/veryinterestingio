		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's already a concern. In 2009, a pair of satellites collided. This is particularly bad because it's a compounding problem. When two satellites collide, they can produce <em>thousands</em> of pieces of debris.</p>
<p>Currently there are about 17000 known pieces of debris in orbit. Almost half of these are from exactly two collisions - the accidental collision in 2009, and from a Chinese test shooting down a satellite with a missile in 2007.</p>
<p>Generally, new satellites need to have a de-orbiting end-of-life plan to avoid adding more clutter, so this is something that's already shaping policy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The nightmare scenario is termed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome" target="_blank">Kessler Syndrome</a>. Essentially, it's a cascade effect where two satellites collide and scatter debris that collides with other satellites (at immense relative speeds of course), which in turn scatter debris which destroys other satellites, and eventually you've got basically a shell of tiny shards of metal, plastic, glass, ceramic, etc around the Earth that makes launching anything else into space like running through an active battlefield with bullets whizzing past at 17,000 mph. </p>
<p>It has the very real potential to make space travel effectively impossible for a very long time. </p>
<p>This scenario could happen at any time, really, but it definitely doesn't help when &quot;bad actors&quot; like North Korea are launching their own satellites into orbit without cooperation with/concern for other space agencies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Many agencies are now doing what’s called “active removal” of space debris, for example ESA will be launching a remove debris operation <a href="http://www.esa.int/Safety_Security/Space_Debris/Active_debris_removal" target="_blank">“edeorbit”</a> ” in the next few years to try and get a start on reducing the problem. </p>
<p>Some other companies are testing different methods of ways to remove debris : harpoon, net or a rod. The University of Surrey (and partners) have plans to launch a satellite to test these various methods - called <a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/surrey-space-centre/missions/removedebris" target="_blank">remove debris</a> </p>
<p>Many others have talked about the Kessler syndrome which is a real problem - the main being that it will become increasingly difficult to maintain satellites in space without them being damaged, and also launching satellites in a way to avoid direct collision. In an age where we have got visions of exploring the universe This will be problematic!</p>
<p>One last idea for be removal of space debris - a bit more out there - is to take the <a href="https://www.seeker.com/space-junk-debris-recycle-mars-exploration-satellites-2085063955.html" target="_blank">space junk to mars</a> as the materials and parts like nuts and bolts could be reused and very useful. As they are further from earth’s gravity it would theoretically take less fuel to send them to mars, but there are many other problems! Hence why it’s just an idea for now (to the best of my knowledge).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
