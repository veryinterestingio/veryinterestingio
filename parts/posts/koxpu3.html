		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hot objects do glow, and they'll generally start red and move up through yellow towards white but you'll never really get something to blue because that's not how black body radiation curves work.  The sun is basically white because its surface(where the light is made) is at just 5800 Kelvin which is why &quot;Cool White&quot; LEDs have a 5500-6000K color temperature.  Higher temperatures mean a bluer white but still very white.</p>
<p>The blue flame from the bunsen burner isn't because its stupid hot, its because of <em>what</em> is stupid hot.  When you burn methane it will look blue because its hot enough to excite the electrons on the molecules and when they settle down they give off a blue photon.  You can get a similar effect if you burn copper, you'll end up with a green flame and its very obvious in this case that its green from the copper and not green from the heat.</p>
<p>TDLR - Two different properties can give a flame color, the blue flame is not blue hot, its blue because of what is hot</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey I kinda hate all these replies: there ARE blue stars, and those in fact have a hotter surface temp than the sun. Also, methane does burn blue, but yeah it’s still hot. Show your brother pictures of blue stars. They’re huge and hot and burn all their fuel up in like a hundred million years, and explode!  Normal stars last billions of years or more. <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/massive-blue-supergiant-challenges-theory-of-how-big-a-star-can-be" target="_blank">https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/massive-blue-supergiant-challenges-theory-of-how-big-a-star-can-be</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a pretty hard question to answer well; it's easy to get into some tricky quantum mechanics etc.</p>
<p>One of the few simple facts in all of this is that a photon of blue light has more energy than a photon of red light.</p>
<p>An object will always be emitting thermal radiation in the form of photons, but the maximum energy of these will be determined by its temperature. At room temperature these are all infrared, but as you heat something up it will eventually start emitting visible red photons - but it will still be emitting lots of infrared photons too. The sun surface temperature is around 5600degC (5773K). At this temperature it will be emitting some blue photons*, but it will still be emitting bucketloads of red, infrared, etc. To our eyes the average appears white. This type of cross-spectrum temperature-driven radiation is called 'Blackbody radiation'.</p>
<p>With things like flame colours, you're looking at a different process to blackbody radiation. Instead certain specific electrons around an atom are being boosted up to a higher energy state, and then emitting a precise frequency of photon as they drop back down again.</p>
<p>In a gas flame, when the hole in the bunsen is closed, the gas &amp; air can't pre-mix so it burns quite inefficiently, which leads to specks of carbon (soot). This soot is a big blackbody emitter &amp; overwhelmes everything else. When you open the hole, the gas &amp; air premixes &amp; it burns without soot, so you can now see this blue light that's being emitted as the electrons around the gas and air molecules drop back to their usual (ground) energy states.</p>
<p>It's a bit like the combustion reactions are producing some clean notes like playing individual keys on a piano, but these can be overwhelmed by the soot blackbody emissions coming in and hammering handfuls of keys.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>*tangent: Some of these blue photons happen to be in tune with an electron in Nitrogen, so they get absorbed &amp; reemitted in random directions, while other visible frequencies pass right by. Hence the sky scatters blue light, and appears blue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Sun is also blue. As others have pointed out, the sun is actually white - a mixture of all of the visible spectrum. Its <em>peak</em> output is in yellow/green, as you can see from <a href="https://www2.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/sb/Aug-2004/reflectance_wavelength.jpg" target="_blank">this graph</a> of the Sun's energy in wavelength. So it's <em>mostly</em> white but just <em>slightly</em> more green/yellow.</p>
<p>The sky is blue^^[citation ^^needed] and that energy has to come from <em>somewhere</em>. As sunlight filters through the atmosphere it gets refracted a bit (like light going through a prism) and the blue wavelengths get refracted way more than the others. This means the blue light goes all <em>around</em> making the sky appear blue, which means there's less blue light coming directly from the Sun (from our perspective).</p>
<p>Your perception of color is as much a function as which wavelengths you <em>don't</em> see as it is which ones you do. Since you're seeing less blue light, the green/yellow becomes even more dominant.</p>
<p>And as others have pointed out, flame color is as much a function of what it's burning as it is the heat of it. The Sun creates a huge range of wavelengths (hence, being white) while, say, a bunsen burner is using a relatively pure fuel and only producing a narrow range.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
