		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what others have said, that fridge is probably made of lower-efficiency but higher-durability parts.  Thicker metal that won't conduct heat as well and would cost a hell of a lot more if you were building it today, but will resist corrosion for a lot longer, for example.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that an awful lot of refrigerators from 1943 did not make it to 2020.  The ones that did are probably exceptional for some reason or another.  So there's a certain amount of survivor bias: don't assume that the fridges that are still operational are necessarily representative of typical fridges of the time.</p>
<p>More simply:  the old fridge probably costs way more to run and build, and probably just happened to be an unusually strongly-built one from the outset.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I doubt a fridge from the 40s would have actually made it this far without needing maintenance though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Industrial Refrigeration Mechanic here, a fridge is constructed with steel tubing or copper tubing that has silver soldered joints totally sealed from outside contaminants. With no rubber hoses or driveshaft seals that leak microscopically, like a car system.</p>
<p>The fridge is also in a dry location subject to a lot less vibration.</p>
<p>The fridge is designed with a compressor which is designed to be durable, running at a constant speed, really optimum conditions for a long life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One reason automotive A/C systems develop leaks is actually due to insufficient use. Rubber seals (such as the dynamic seal on the compressor) will eventually dry out if the A/C sits unused for long enough, and on the first use they wear out quite a bit and can easily develop a leak.</p>
<p>Manufacturers developed a good solution to this.
The A/C compressor in modern cars will engage whenever a cars defroster setting is selected. This ensures sufficient lubrication of the A/C systems during times of low usage, such as the winter time.
However, this is not a cure-all. Vehicles that sit unused for long periods of time should be ran occasionally with the A/C turned on to ensure that the seals do not dry out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
