		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>More specifically:
Why, when a person from a region that typically eats spicy food eats something you think is hot, do they say &quot;this isn't spicy&quot; even if there's like 5 jalapenos (exaggeration.) Can they taste the spice but they're just used to it and are being mean to my caucasian tastebuds, or can they literally not register any spice. If the second one, how does this work? If the prior, how does being used to spicy things work?</p>
<p>Edit: on reflection, 5 jalapenos clearly isnt an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Edit 2: I'm talking MY caucasian tastebuds. Me being from Europe where spice is not everywhere. I'm not saying white people can't be used to spice. (That's sort of what I was asking anyway, is spice tolerance nature or nurture)</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>after repeated exposure to capsaicin (the spicy) the receptors in your mouth begin to stop responding as much to it, as nerves tend to do when constantly stimulated (downregulation).  Basically the nerve is sort of saying &quot;ok ok we get it turn it off&quot; and adds a phosphate group to one part of the receptor and the end result is you've (temporarily) become less able to sense the spiciness.</p>
<p>This process is reversible, and you will eventually return to the same spicy food tolerance as you started with if you quit eating spicy food for a while.</p>
<p>So no, below a certain threshold the person actually cannot feel the heat as much.  But the person will still seek spicy food if they begin to enjoy the hot sensation, and will need spicier food for the same effect now that they have a higher tolerance.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, I am caucasian and enjoy spicy food.  It doesn't really matter what area of the world you are from, you can get used to it.  It's just that you probably didn't start getting used to it when you were five like people from some areas often would.  The whole white people can't handle spice thing is just one of those white people stereotypes we all kind of laugh off even though they're kinda ignorant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Obviously most of the comments are spot on about habituation, but I’d just like to add that there is evidence that a genetic contribution plays a role too. Some people can be classified as “strong tasters,” and some people as “weak tasters.” People who are weak tasters tend to seek out and prefer very flavorful foods to get the stimulation they crave from their food. I am almost certain I fall into this group, because even though I’m Caucasian I greatly prefer super strong tasting foods—spicy curries, strong pickled foods, egregious amounts of salt in everything. The more potent and spicy my food the better.</p>
<p>Edit to add more info: <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/2016/05/31/super-tasters-non-tasters-is-it-better-to-be-average/" target="_blank">Harvard article on super tasters vs non tasters</a> . About halfway down the article is where they start discussing genetic contributions to taste.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When they say &quot;this isn't spicy&quot; what they are saying is &quot;this is not intolerably burning my mouth, and I've had spicier.&quot;  </p>
<p>As with most tastes, people build up tolerances.  Think of someone drinking whiskey for the first time vs the 1,000th time.  Or bitter flavors; children hate them but adults are much more open to it.  </p>
<p>Likewise, 'spice&quot; is basically a chemical irritant put out by plants to keep the wrong animal from eating it.  Humans didn't evolve to eat those plants, and so feel the irritation.  But if we keep doing it a lot, the nerve endings start to transmitting less of the signal.  So if you eat a lot, you build up tolerance.  </p>
<p>In cultures where people eat a lot of spicy foods, the adults are all eating spicy food, the food is made available to children, and children generally try the food.  Many cultures don't make separate meals for kids after a fairly young age, so if the kids want to eat, they need to eat foods with at least some spice in it, and so start building up at least a little tolerance from a young age.  Anyone from anywhere can do the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
