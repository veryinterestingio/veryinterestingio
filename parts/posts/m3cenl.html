The problem is, the components needed in the reaction are inefficient, degrade/deplete quickly, or are expensive to make/maintain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Understanding how something works and having the ability to replicate it are not the same thing.  </p>
<p>Furthermore there isn't really an incentive - for all purposes that require plants on a large scale (really only one: biomass creation) you just use, well, <em>plants</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Expense. Constructing an 'artificial plant' as you described would be very expensive, since all the necessary enzymes will have to be artificially synthesized and assembled. However, even is an 'artificial plant' is made, it would need be maintained, which adds to the running costs.</p>
<p>At this point, it would be much more cost effective to just plant an actual plant, which does all that is needed, in addition to providing for wildlife, maintaining biodiversity and reducing the (potentially global) temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have energy on the wrong side there. It takes CO2 and energy and gives O2 in exchange.</p>
<p>Also organic photosynthesis is incredibly complicated and uses a ton of membranes, enzymes and proteins that would be very hard to synthesize on even a tiny scale never mind a useful one.</p>
<p>Your question is like asking &quot;we know how cellular respiration works so why can't we create &quot;artificial animals&quot;?&quot; Like, just grow entire frogs and monkeys in a test tube, or 3D print them? </p>
<p>If that seems obviously absurd for our current tech, be aware that plants are just as complicated as animals in terms of cell machinery.</p>
<p>If your question is just about using sunlight to convert CO2 to O2 (not actually artificial entire plants), then <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-04949-2_5" target="_blank">yes that absolutely is a thing that exists and is currently a huge area of upcoming research.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
