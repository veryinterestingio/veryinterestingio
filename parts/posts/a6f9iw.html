		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot less variables with a bolt action. They are simple and strong, and that makes for less ‘play’ in the action. Semi autos use a gas system, rechamber based on recoil and basically have more moving parts, which is more that can throw off the ballistics of a given shot. They are also often constructed to be more portable, and light. Which results in shorter barrel length, which means reduced accuracy. (I seem to have been informed this is more to do with velocity than ballistics, fair enough)</p>
<p>Most modern sniper rifles also use more powerful rounds than ‘traditional’ rifle cartridges, such as 338 lapua magnum. These rounds offer superior ballistics, but are impractical for use in a marksman rifle, on the move with an infantry section.</p>
<p>That said, it’s not always true. A modern marksman rifle is produced to a higher standard of accuracy than a bolt action sniper rifle from 100 years ago. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, bolt actions are more accurate than semi-automatic actions because of the movement of the bolt carrier when firing. In a bolt action, the firing system is static except for the firing pin; nothing moves until after the shot has been fired and the operator decides to cycle the action and eject the spent casing and force another round into battery (put a round into the chamber.) In a semi-automatic platform, immediate after the firing pin hits the primer  and fires the round, the exhaust from the explosion forces the action backwards, ejecting the round, and then automatically loading the next. It's this forced movement that makes them a little less reliable accuracy-wise, since at a long distance, even a fraction of a millimeter (a super tiny amount) can end up as a significant difference. Thinking using your imagination, imagine GIGANTIC scissors that are 1000 meters long. if you close them, you might only move the handle a few inches on your end, but on the far end, because of the lever it's created, the tip will move much farther for the same amount of movement (and faster, too). That's it generally. The lateral movement of the action pulls the barrel, creating relatively minor movements that translate into larger differences downrange. Also, depending on the need, this might not actually be a big deal. Most modern military snipers, even in elite squads, use semi-automatic platforms. To them, in a scenario where it really matters, the difference between the two isn't significant enough to warrant sacrificing speed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For some reason no one here knows how to talk to a five year old.</p>
<p>The accuracy of a gun has a lot to do with staying still while the bullet is leaving the barrel. </p>
<p>A Simi automatic gun has the bolt moving all the time inside the gun while the bullet is going through the barrel. Since it has to bring a new bullet into the chamber. </p>
<p>A bolt action rifle does not do anything after the trigger is pulled. So the gun will move that little bit less while shooting. So that way the gun is a little bit more accurate. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Accuracy depend on repeatability so if you point the gun in the exact same direction and the air in front of it is the same the bullet hold hit the same point.</p>
<p>Bolt action is just a barrel and a bolt you lock in place. All stay the same way when  from the time you fire the bullet until it have left the gun and the shooter cycle the weapon. </p>
<p>A semi-auto need a way to cycle the gun with the energy from that is released when you fire it. </p>
<p>Common way are  blowback that is using motion of the cartridge case backwards to the bolt or gas-operated  by having a small hole in the barrel and let gas out and use the pressure. There are many variant and other to do that to.</p>
<p>The problem is to do that in a way so the speed of the bulles it the same time and that the exact moment that part start to move and the vibration that introduce is the same for each shoot. It is not the case that the bullet have left the barrel before part start to move and gas is released so uneven operation will reduce accuracy.</p>
<p>So you have you will have all  the same problem for accuracy as a blot action have and you add problem by requiring the cycling mechanism to work the same each time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
