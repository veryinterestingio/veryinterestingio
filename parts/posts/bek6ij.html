		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is Robbert Dijkgraaf, Director and Leon Levy Professor at the Institute for Advanced Study, one of the world's foremost centers for curiosity-driven basic research, located in Princeton, New Jersey. I'm a mathematical physicist specializing in string theory, and my research focuses on the interface between mathematics and particle physics, as well as the advancement of science education. Ask me anything about fundamental questions in physics like the Big Bang, black holes, or the mathematics of the universe!</p>
<p>In light of recent news, here is <a href="https://www.ias.edu/ideas/dijkgraaf-EHT-black-hole" target="_blank">an article I wrote last week about the first black hole photograph</a>. You can also view a talk I gave at the 2017 National Math Festival on <a href="https://vimeopro.com/msri/2017-national-math-festival/video/219027177" target="_blank">The End of Space and Time: The Mathematics of Black Holes and the Big Bang</a>.</p>
<p>This AMA is in partnership with the <a href="http://www.msri.org" target="_blank">Mathematical Sciences Research Institute</a>  in Berkeley, California, as we are the co-organizers of the <a href="http://www.nationalmathfestival.org/2019-festival" target="_blank">National Math Festival</a> taking place on May 4th in Washington, DC. I'll start answering questions at 11:30 a.m. Eastern (15:30 UT), and end around 1:00 p.m. AMA!</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>EDIT 1:00 p.m.</strong>: Thank you for all of your great questions! I'm sorry I couldn't get to them all, but you can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/RHDijkgraaf" target="_blank">@RHDijkgraaf</a> or visit the <a href="https://www.ias.edu" target="_blank">IAS website</a> to learn more about the many ideas we discussed.</p>
<p>Working at the IAS, I am reminded every day that we live in an incredible age for science and discovery, and we must never forget how essential basic research and original thinking are to innovation and societal progress. The Institute’s Founding Director Abraham Flexner may have said it best in a 1939 essay, <a href="https://www.ias.edu/about/usefulness-useless-knowledge" target="_blank">“The Usefulness of Useless Knowledge”</a>, reprinted in a book that I recently coauthored.</p>
<p>IAS, MSRI, and MoMath welcome you to join us at the [2019 National Math Festival]( <a href="http://www.nationalmathfestival.org/2019-festival" target="_blank">http://www.nationalmathfestival.org/2019-festival</a>) on Saturday, May 4, to inspire the next generation to embrace curiosity and experience the thrill of discovery. IAS is presenting two of the mathematical lectures, featuring our own Dr. Avi Wigderson on cryptography, and Dr. Marcus du Sautoy of Oxford, discussing art and algorithms. Learn more on the <a href="http://www.nationalmathfestival.org/2019-festival" target="_blank">NMF website</a>.</p></div></div>
