		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your ears are still receiving the sound, but the auditory cortex in your brain chooses to ignore it, otherwise your sleep would be disrupted multiple times every night. </p>
<p>It’s not actually just the volume that triggers you to wake up. It’s whether your unconscious mind interprets that sound as a potential threat, for example if your bedroom door opens quietly it could certainly wake you up if you don’t expect anyone to enter your room. Your brain, without you being consciously aware of it, thinks, “that sounds like it could be a threat. I better wake up and check it out.” A loud or abrupt sound will startle you and trigger your fight or flight response, shocking you into consciousness in the same way. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a question on top of this: when I go to sleep, i usually play music with an alarm. How come I don't wake up to the music changing (let's say from a slow song to hard rock) but I do to the alarm? Is it because my brain is accustomed to the music and knows the alarm means to wake up?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since your question was answered I'll give you a LPT:
Go through your alarm ringtones and choose the one with the highest pitch/tones. It's much easier to wake up from higher pitch, I don't remember why though lol. Works like a charm!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>It's actually fascinating how brain works - I often wake up, and only after several seconds start to &quot;hear&quot; the track playing. It's like the &quot;hearing&quot; service was still loading at the moment :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
