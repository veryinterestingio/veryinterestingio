		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All these responses are off. When you're over-tired/exhausted this causes you to have an overactive sympathetic nervous system.</p>
<p>Your sympathetic nervous system is what predominantly governs your emotions. This effect causes you to experience emotions with much greater sensitivity. I.e. Laughing way more at something that is funny. Or being irritable at little things.</p>
<p>Fun fact: this is also why people with severe depression that experience strong <del>dysphoria</del> apathy (loss of feelings either good or bad) feel relief when they go a night or two without sleep: their overactive sympathetic nervous system overpowers the feeling of dysphoria and they can experience emotions again! (however this is a very temporary fix and lack of sleep has a whole host of problems so should not be used as a &quot;cure&quot;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
