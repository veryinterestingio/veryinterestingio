		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Clocks are just a geared mechanism. So first you figure out the gear ratios needed  to make 60 movements of the second hand = 1 rotation round the dial and 60 rotations of the second hand = 1 rotation of the minute hand and 60 rotations of the minute hand = 5 steps round the dial for the hour hand. Then you fine tune the pendulum length to set the second duration by checking the time against a sundial over hours/days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The definitive story about this has already been written by several people much smarter than any of us.</p>
<p>Over 200 years ago, the navigation of ships was a matter of intense government interest in England. The &quot;latitude&quot; was very easy to calculate. However, the &quot;longitude&quot; was based on time, so a very accurate clock was needed. The longer you were at sea, the more accurate the clock needed to be.</p>
<p>Here is a 3-hour movie that explains the issue, and how it was solved.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Background first: When geared clocks were invented, we already had water clocks &amp; sundials capable of showing accurate days and hours.  There had even been advanced clocks capable of dividing the hours into smaller divisions since the ancient Babylonians, who chose 60 divisions because it made math much easier in their base 12 counting system.  </p>
<p>Industrial manufacture of gears came along, and people designed clocks that could indicate these smaller divisions simply by gearing another hand to make 60 full rotations each time the hour hand did 1/12 of a rotation.  These smaller (more minute) divisions of the day were called &quot;minute divisions&quot;.</p>
<p>Finally we get to seconds.  Gear-making had exploded, growing much more accurate, and it wasn't  long before they were capable of making clocks with a second division of the hour, even smaller than the &quot;minute divisions&quot;, simply by inserting a new hand &amp; more gears with ratios so that the &quot;second division&quot; hand would rotate 60 times as the &quot;minute division&quot; hand did one rotation.</p>
<p>These mechanical clocks could be adjusted to slightly speed them up or slow them down, and each clock would be adjusted until it matched another clock deemed to be accurate.  Once the clock accurately reflected one day, gear ratios meant hours, minutes and seconds automatically became accurate (as accurate as you could get in those days, anyway).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
