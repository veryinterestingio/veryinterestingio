		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just saw a post about a huge megalodon tooth that was found off the coast of North Carolina. How does something like that wash ashore? Does it ever reach the ocean floor, or has it been traveling around the world via ocean currents for millions of years until it finally reaches land? Or did it reach the shore a long time ago and was only recently exposed??</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wave action scrubs the bottom of surf zones.</p>
<p>If you stand still in heavy surf you will quickly notice you are not standing still.</p>
<p>Depending on current, and tide the wave action will either be pushing you to shore, or pulling you out into deeper water.</p>
<p>In coastal areas you will see seashells, and even rocks pushed several inches each wave until they rest on a debris line at the edge of the surf.</p>
<p>The beach sand itself is made by being washed out to deeper water, then piled back onto the beach by the waves scrubbing, and abrading until fine.</p>
<p>There is a beach in Hawaii called the magic sand beach. Each tide the sand is completely washed away to bare rocks, then when the current reverses washed back into place forming a beautiful sandy beach again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sediment at the ocean floor is also moved by the currents. It's actually something that causes significant work for human efforts in maintaining our waterways and coastal waters. Currents can create sandbars where we don't want any or erode earthworks where we do want them.</p>
<p><a href="https://minskimwaterblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/meeting-of-the-waters.png?w=536&amp;h=334&amp;zoom=2" target="_blank">For example this image shows where two rivers come together.</a> The black water comes from the Rio Negro, the water is stained black from all the vegetable matter the water flowed past in the jungle, like steeped tea. The tan coloured water comes from the Rio Solim√µes which is coloured by the sediment it carries from the Andes.</p>
<p>The river water is so radically different that there's an almost 10 degree temperature difference and a 4km/h speed difference between the two currents.</p>
<p>In some places the cliff faces and beach are also full of fossils so it can also work the other way around. Instead of washing up, a storm can erode layers of cliff face or beach to reveal new fossils, teeth and shells.</p>
<p>It also helps that shark teeth are extremely common. Shark teeth are disposable, <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/86/61/51/86615153521f6165a4816911f872b10e.jpg" target="_blank">a shark's jaw kinda looks like a conveyer belt of teeth</a>. Rows of them and whenever a tooth breaks off the next tooth in the row is rotated forward to take it's place.</p>
<p>A single shark can go through thousands of teeth through it's lifetime. So millions of years worth of shark generations left a lot of teeth in the sea bed. With that many teeth lying around some are bound to come up sooner or later. In some places famous for them you can dive with a bucket and just sift the teeth out of the sediment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another post mentioned Calvert Cliffs. In this area, the clay cliffs erode over time, exposing fossils as it erodes. So these don't come from far out in the ocean, but are rather exposed from the cliffs where they have been for millions of years. Some areas are probably different, but you can find megalodon teeth there as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Really wish I could find meg teeth here but we dont. The odd mastodon bone, which is awesome.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
