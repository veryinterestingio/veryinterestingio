		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The universe doesn't have an &quot;edge&quot;. It's unbounded, and possibly infinite in size.</p>
<p>The <em>observable</em> universe is just the sphere from which light could have reached us in the time since the Big Bang. If you teleported to the edge of the observable universe, you would still see stars and galaxies in all directions. The more distant stars and galaxies would look younger, as they were in the earlier history universe, because their light took longer to reach you. You'd see this from any point in the universe. The universe basically is the same everywhere.</p>
<p>That said, you <em>could</em> get this sort of view, if you were sitting outside of a <em>galaxy</em>. Almost every object you see in the night sky is a star within our own galaxy. Some are star <em>clusters</em> within our galaxy. Some are planets, and the Moon. And there are three galaxies you can see in the sky with the naked eye, but they are faint cloudy objects rather than point-like stars.</p>
<p>So if you sat like 20,000 light years above the disc of the Milky Way, you would see the Milky Way full of stars below you, but you would not see any other stars in the rest of the sky. You might see a few faint cloudy galaxies, but that's it.</p>
<p>So you can get a view that's mostly starless except for a chunk of the sky, but you won't get it at the edge of the universe, because the universe has no edge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As no one has ever gone to such extreme depths of the universe, and indeed humans have not even existed long enough to go to more than the smallest of smidges into the universe, so, we don't know.</p>
<p>There are scientific theories that are based on repeatable experiments and a lot of circumstantial evidence to bear those theories out, that suggest the universe is, at a minimum, five-hundred times larger beyond the limits of what we can observe. </p>
<p>Those theories also suggest that the universe does not have an edge such as you describe. They suggest that the universe is endless and infinite or that spacetime is somehow wrapped around itself. Those two ideas could easily be the same idea.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about our current two &quot;best&quot; theories is that they are incomplete and incompatible. If you explore those ideas (well worth your time) you will find a monstrous amount of data, ideas, flag waving, sub-theories, and craziness supporting one of those theories and on the other side you will find Newton and Einstein. That is not to say that there is not a fair amount of wackiness under those two, but that investigating Spacetime is truly difficult and the other side simply requires billions and billions of monies to be spent on colliders and whatnot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>As far as we know the universe is infinite and always has been and is (at large scales at least) uniformly filled with stuff through out the entire infinitum (and always has been).</strong></p>
<p>The useful analogy here is something like an infinite chess board filled with chess pieces. The board is our &quot;space&quot; and it is (as far as we know) infinite, meaning that the chess board has no end and stretches off in all directions forever. The chess pieces are our &quot;stuff in space&quot;, i.e. mass, energy, etc. To start off, let's imagine that there's a chess piece on every square, so we have a &quot;chess piece density&quot; of 1 piece/square. Note this implies that there is also an infinite amount of stuff, since there's an infinite number of squares but the ratio, the density of stuff, is still finite.</p>
<p>So the entire point of Big Bang Cosmology is all about the fact that in our theory of gravity, what's called general relativity (one of the big things Einstein is famous for), the geometry of space-time itself, the distances between objects and the durations of times are: 1) not absolute but malleable and relative quantities, and 2) they are locally altered or changed by the presence of mass or energy in a region.</p>
<p>So in other words, the board itself can change in time and the way this change happens is actually caused by the presence of the chess pieces.</p>
<p>In fact, for the specific initial set-up we described (an infinite board with a piece of every square, a so-called &quot;uniform homogeneous energy density&quot;) our theory of gravity says that something important should happen: space should expand. In our analogy this would mean that between each and every chess square, a new square pops into existence. And then as expansion continues more squares pop into existence between those squares, and so on. So where initially there was no space between any two pieces then there is one square in between them, then 3, then 5 and so on.</p>
<p>What would this look like for our chess pieces? Well first we notice that there are two different types of perceived motion here. When a chess piece physically moves from one square to another we call that &quot;peculiar motion&quot; and some chess pieces, depending on where they are, will observe this as motion towards them, and others will observe it as motion away from them (again it depends where they're situated relative to how it moves). But, because of this expansion there is also a very different type of perceived motion. As the board expands every chess piece sees every other chess piece as moving away from it. The number of squares between EACH AND EVERY piece is increasing. This is called &quot;recessional motion&quot; and it's very different from peculiar motion because when you move away from one piece you are not moving towards another, you're moving away from everyone.</p>
<p>This analogy isn't perfect, no analogy is. For example, space is not actually discrete like a chess board. Even speculative theories that involve &quot;quantized space&quot; don't really mean in that way. But it does convey, I think, a lot of the key concepts. For example, it also helps us to understand what is really meant by statements like &quot;the universe is bigger now than it was in the past&quot;. As we said, as far as we know the chess board is infinite now and it was infinite &quot;in the beginning&quot; but still because of the expansion it is still bigger. For every square there was before there are now more squares and the distances between everything has grown. Similarly, even though there were always an infinite amount of chess pieces, if chess pieces aren't added as the expansion occurs then the &quot;chess piece density&quot; drops with expansion. In other words the universe cools. (NOTE: it turns out this if isn't actually true, the energy of the energy does actually grow a bit by a small constant amount with continued expansion, we call this new energy &quot;dark energy&quot;).</p>
<p>Hopefully that gives you some idea of how this is working. </p>
<p>And so, the Big Bang is not a violent outward expansion  of stuff through empty space, it is the progressive and orderly expansion of <em>space itself</em> DUE to the uniform (and as far as we know) infinite initial distribution of mass/energy (i.e. chess pieces) throughout that space.</p>
<p>Why did our universe start out that way? We don't know. But from that state, plus turning the crank of our theory of gravity, you get &quot;Big Bang Cosmology&quot;, this expansion of space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically yes and no. The stars you see at night are the stars in our galaxy. So all you need to do is to get out of our galaxy. Then you'll see our galaxy as a huge disc of stars while other galaxies will be too dim for you to see them with naked eye. At best you'll see just hazy smudges where the other galaxies are. Then there is the question of whether there is an edge to our universe where you can see the true edge of the universe. That is a place where you'll be neghboring the last galaxy. Nobody knows an answer to that. Literally everything science posts about that theme are just hypothesis and mathematical models. We have no idea if any of them is true or false. My hypothesis is that since matter and universe exist, universe likely have an edge. For an edgless universe with infinite matter you need infinite energy and that will prevent cooling of the universe after big bang. If it won't cool, there will be no stable matter and so no observer to find out. Based on this universe itself could be infinite, but matter can't and so I think there is a place with the last star.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
