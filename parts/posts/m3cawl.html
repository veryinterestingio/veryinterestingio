<p>I've read on wikipedia about how it being dry has changed the delta and other areas of the river, and that it used to deposit a bunch of silt in the gulf. But how has the change affected the gulf itself? Thanks.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sick—a question I’m qualified to answer!  </p>
<p>I did my graduate research specifically on the Minute 319 artificial flood on the Colorado River back in 2014, as a geology  student working in an organic chem lab at the University of Florida.  I was studying the effects of intermittent flooding on carbon cycling: looking at ages and sources of organic matter within the floodwaters.</p>
<p>I spent two weeks in Mexico to study the artificial flood, driving a rental up and down the floodplains while collecting water, soil, and air samples.  I wasn’t entirely focused on the riparian ecology, but I met many of the people who were, got to speak to them, and witnessed them at work.</p>
<p>Dam construction has resulted in a reduction of fresh water, sediments, and organic material into the delta.  This is theorized to have been responsible for the shrinkage of the Colorado River Delta to about 5% of its historic expanse.  Because all that freshwater is not fighting back against tidal forces, the incoming brackish tides advance some 50 km inland, which kills off the native cotton wood and willow trees, and allows invasive salt cedars to take over.  This in turn has displaced as many as 40 migratory bird species.</p>
<p>I can go more into detail on the flooding event itself, and my own research if yall want (on the chemistry of the flood waters).  Right now I’m in field training future infantry soldiers.</p>
<p>EDIT: I was not in the Army at the time.  I was just a graduate student.  But now I’m in a different line of work, as an Infantry Officer for the US Army.  The only time I use my geology background these days is to get ahead on land navigation exercises.</p>
<p>EDIT: There are a bunch of Youtube videos about Minute 319, but here's one: <a href="https://youtu.be/TODV7FW746s" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/TODV7FW746s</a> I'm in it at 3:37, behind the guy holding champagne.  The dark blue underarmor baseball cap with red rim, holding a camera, with a pouch on my hip.  Light shirt, dark pants!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Answering the intended question, it's complicated. It's been argued that essentially shutting off the Colorado river's water delivery to the Gulf of California has changed the salinity of the northern end of the Gulf (it went from brackish to hypersaline) and the currents in this portion of the Gulf (these use to move water along the long axis of the basin, but this has shifted to across the basin, e.g., <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025322798001893" target="_blank">Carriquiry &amp; Sanchez, 1999</a>), which have been linked to a variety of potential ecological impacts (e.g., <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/28/12/1059/207147/Dead-delta-s-former-productivity-Two-trillion?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank">Kowalewski et al, 2000</a>). </p>
<p>However, there is decent evidence that Colorado impoundment are not the cause of many of the ecological impacts noted and/or are incorrect (e.g., the northern Gulf was never consistently brackish, etc) and that more broadly, even before human intervention, there was a lot of variability in the outflow of the Colorado (as the catchment went through wet and dry periods) so that the northern Gulf was already &quot;use to&quot; periods of very low - to zero flow (e.g. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825216303890" target="_blank">Brusca et al., 2017</a>). Brusca highlights that many of the ecological impacts often blamed on Colorado diversion/impoundment in the Gulf of California are actually related to other human impacts (e.g., fishing practices, etc). A lot of focus is on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaquita" target="_blank">Vaquita porpoise</a>, whose decline has been blamed on decreasing freshwater inputs to the northern Gulf, but arguably seems more related to accidental catching in nets (e.g. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/69/1/12/5172289" target="_blank">Rojas-Bracho et al., 2019</a>), but similar arguments abound for other, less charismatic creatures (e.g., molluscs).</p>
<p>Less controversial / more certain is that reduction of stream flow and sediment delivery has had dramatic effects on the Colorado River delta and the riparian ecosystem that use to inhabit it, and the immediately upstream areas (e.g., <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925857416304931" target="_blank">Mueller et al, 2017</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925857417302914?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">Pitt et al, 2017</a>), but as hashed out more above, the extent to which this has had meaningful impacts for the entirety of the Gulf of California is unclear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you’re really interested in the Colorado River, there’s a book called Where the Water Goes by a journalist named David Owen that I really recommend. He starts at the headwaters of the Colorado River and follows it to its end point, discussing its history, uses, the impacts of impounding it, and the politics of its usage.</p>
<p>Basically, when the Colorado flowed freely, there was a wetland on the Mexican side of the border that supported quite a bit of wildlife. Every once in a while, water will reach that area and life will come back, only to leave when it dries back up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work on a team that did research on the colorado river delta. My team was involved in getting the mexican and american governments to work together to open the dams and have semi regular flows to the Gulf. </p>
<p>Ecologocially, the area was historically a place for migratory bird species. Those animals have had to find other ways to move across that area. </p>
<p>Also the impact on the people living in san Luis rio colorado and other surrounding areas can not be understated. There used to be a lot of recreation in that area that is no longer possible due to the lack of water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
