		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, recent research has continued to confirm that race is a significant factor in determining performance on standard neuropsychological tests, including those used to determine neuropsychological disability.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3154384/" target="_blank">The introduction to this 2011 article summarizes the state of research at that time</a> with references to other research.</p>
<p>Some interesting findings include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Several studies have demonstrated lower NP performance among African-Americans as compared to Caucasians on a wide variety of NP measures (Diehr, et al., 2003; Diehr, Heaton, Miller, &amp; Grant, 1998; Gladsjo, et al., 1999; Heaton, et al., 2004; Heaton, et al., 2003; Norman, 2000; Rilling, et al., 2005). Importantly, it has been shown that these differences persists even when groups were matched for other demographic factors, including age, gender, education, and reading ability to a lesser extent (Manly, et al., 2005).</p>
<p>Accurate classification of the level of NP impairment in diverse racial groups has pragmatic clinical relevance to neuropsychologists. Without race/ethnicity-corrected scores in the clinical setting, a substantial number of normal African-Americans patients might be incorrectly classified as neuropsychologically impaired, and misdiagnosed. For example, Norman et al. (2000) demonstrated that 46%of African-Americans were classified as NP impaired (i.e., NP test T-score&lt; 40) on the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) Trials 1â€“5 using the original Delis et al.(Delis, Kramer, Kaplan, &amp; Ober, 1987) norms, which were based upon a predominantly Caucasian standardization sample. When CVLT norms were corrected for age, gender, and education, but not race,36% of African-Americans were still classified as NP impaired. Once race was sufficiently accounted for in the equation, only 17.8% of African Americans were classified as neuropsychologically impaired demonstrating that the new CVLT norms clearly improved the proportion of individuals scoring greater than one standard deviation below the mean [for reference, 1 SD below the mean in a normal distribution is approximately the 16th percentile, so adding race as a factor has substantially improved the performance of the test in accurately reflecting performance]. Misdiagnoses for neurodegenerative disorders or other conditions that affect brain functions have serious implications in terms of public health consequences as well as social and healthcare consequences for the patients and their families. Accurate classification of NP-impairment among African Americans is equally important in research settings for similar reasons.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>You can see that any test which classifies nearly half of a randomly selected sample of the population as neuropsychologically impaired is a bad test by definition, so in order to correct for observed differences in performance that can substantially be explained by race, different standards must be used.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't this be more accurately be based on genetic studies? After all, race is not really a scientific term. We have come far enough along to actually pinpoint genetic variations and can adjust for that. For example, is the discrepancy related to melanin content or geographic influences on brain functions from thousands of years ago?</p>
<p>There are players from all around the world in the NFL. From the Pacific Islands to the Isle of Mann. There are so many players of &quot;mixed-race&quot; that is seems obvious that there needs to be some other way to describe the process than based on a &quot;racial&quot; classification.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
