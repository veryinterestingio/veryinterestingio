		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Butterflies tend to eat nectar or other sources of salty or sweet liquids.  Humans are covered in salty-sweet sweat, sebum, and other skin secretions which are tasty to insects and other animals.  Additionally, some humans use soap, body wash, shampoo, or perfumes which may smell floral, further attracting insects.</p>
<p>Furthermore - this is a self-reported incident.  It's very likely that the person in that Youtube video is exaggerating the butterfly's attraction to him because he wants to think it likes him.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve been raising monarchs. They have personality, surprisingly. One of mine that came out of its chrysalis had a damaged wing and was not able to fly. My friend bonded with him (the sex markings are obvious if you know what to look for) and fed him nectar. He was unable to fly but would stay in her hair all day long. I’ve had a few emerge from their chrysalis and be more “friendly” than others. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a scientist or anything and totally hate to be that person, but the butterfly died after a few days and doesn't seem able to fly very far. Probably wasn't very healthy to begin with :( Super sad, at least he made someone very happy!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
