		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well the first answer is that the US isn't like any single European country. Instead it is more like the entire EU. And that is why our elections seem so disorganized. Because 50 states are holding elections all at the same time and they all have different rules on how the elections work.</p>
<p>Next, outside the system it seems like it is a whole lot of effort for just a single election. But you, as a European, might not realize exactly how many things were voted on in the US this past Tuesday.</p>
<p>As an example, I live in California. I voted for one of my two Senators (the other wasn't up for re-election), my district House Representative, and a new Governor for my state. Those you probably know.</p>
<p>I also had to vote for on my State ballot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lieutenant Governor</li>
<li>Secretary of State</li>
<li>Controller</li>
<li>State Treasurer</li>
<li>Attorney General</li>
<li>Insurance Commissioner</li>
<li>Board of Equalization Representative </li>
<li>State Senator (different than US Senator)</li>
<li>State Assembly Member</li>
<li>State Superintendent of Public Instruction</li>
</ul>
<p>There were also 5 judges that I had to vote on and <del>10</del> 12 Propositions that change the laws in my State.</p>
<p><strong>THEN</strong> there is all the local elections. Which included 5 measures, 1 for the county and 4 for the city (could have been more buy the school district I live in didn't have a bond measure this year). But there were the local offices I had to vote on</p>
<ul>
<li>Sheriff</li>
<li>County Supervisor</li>
<li>Board of Education members (had to pick 3)</li>
<li>City Council member</li>
</ul>
<p>In total that was <del>39</del> 41 things I voted on. And that is just one of 50 states. So yeah it looks disoganized compared to a European election, but it is also on a scale unlike a European election. We had 113 million people vote, that is more than the population of any European country, let alone their voting population.</p>
<p>EDIT: Some formatting errors, and I forgot about 2 state propositions</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because an election has like 40 different separate elections in it. Every body in the country only has one of the 40 elections in common , the vote for President.   Next comes the vote for US senators and state governor and other state officials ,  of which only the people in the same state as you have in common with you.  There are 50 states in the US.   </p>
<p>Next come the senator for your state legislature, of which only people in your same district have the same election.</p>
<p>Then comes the county wide officials to be elected. No other people in the US have on their ballot except for people who live in the same county as you.  There are 3142 counties in the US.</p>
<p>Next come the city specific elections and ballot initiatives and bond financing proposals.  There are thousands of cities and towns in the US.</p>
<p>So I just roll my eyes when some non-American says  &quot;we have paper ballots and just weigh the 'yes' pile and 'no' pile separately in my small country and why can't the US do the same??&quot; That only really works when every voter votes on the same set of issues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The US election system is complicated by the US's large size, complicated political structure, and long history of democracy.  It definitely has its problems, but many Europeans fall into the trap of comparing the US to their own European country, when really it's closer in size, population, and complexity to the entire European Union.</p>
<p>Your country may not have had any election messes in your lifetime, but neither has my own state of Massachusetts.  And Europe as a whole has definitely had some messy elections...</p>

<p>It's easy for Europeans to think that election problems in, say, Hungary don't affect them personally and don't reflect on the EU as a whole.  Americans don't have the same luxury with Florida.</p>
<p>I'm not saying Europe is just as bad, I'm saying that while &quot;just count the votes&quot; is a simple idea, the problems of who gets to vote, when and where, what votes should be counted, and how the counting should be done are universal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the issues is thast you have 50 different states (and some other areas) that have 50 different ways to vote, different ways to count it, different ways to report it, different rules, regulations and so on.</p>
<p>Its not that its a mess and badly organized, its not, in fact almost everything is totally fine and done without issue.  Its that there are so many different ways that the process works, that at least some aspect of it will be different enough that you'll hear about it, or an issue happens and so on.  In reality, almost all votes are fine, no issues, no problems, nothing, but you end up with just so many different ways, that there are some outlier things out there that lag and cause issues and take time to resolve correctly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every State has a slightly different voting system, just like every country in the EU has a different system. They each organize their own systems, but in general it mostly is just counting votes. </p>
<p>There are different levels of government: City, County, State, Federal and each level can have things that have to be voted on in a given election. So it takes a while to go through all the vote and count them for every thing being voted on. </p>
<p>As for recounts, those occur automatically if the difference between candidates is narrow. Every state has a different margin but automatic recounts generally occur for 2% or less but some States go as high as 5%. Every candidate also has the right to ask (demand) for a recount as well and this is a common thing to do if for no other reason than to save face. </p>
<p>As for strange things like &quot;hanging chads&quot; or the vanishing voting machine. Those are not planned parts of the system. Those are errors, things going wrong and getting lost, or deliberate sabotage. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
