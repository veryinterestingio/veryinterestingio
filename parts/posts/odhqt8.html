		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We’re not totally sure.</p>
<p>When we use the word tickle, sometimes we use the word to describe the light flitting sensation that triggers an urge to scratch, sometimes we use the word to describe the nervous laughter inducing sensation generated by someone else applying deep, arrhythmic pressure to a ticklish zone. I’m going to assume you mean the latter. </p>
<p>Here’s what we do know: </p>
<p>We can’t tickle ourselves.</p>
<p>There is strong evidence that this is a primate only instinct.</p>
<p>It’s important for parent-child bonding </p>
<p>Here are some hypotheses as to what it’s for:</p>
<p>Bonding</p>
<p>Combat training </p>
<p>Self protection</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read somewhere that it is evolutionary to protect our vital locations. The neck, stomach, ribs, bottom of feet, and armpits. They said that these locations are hyper sensitive so that we innately learn to protect these areas. Sounded legit to me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
