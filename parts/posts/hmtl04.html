		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The tiny dimensions do not directly limit the resolution of the transistor, but rather make it harder to achieve good on-off ratio, because of the required precision and onset of quantum tunneling at very small scales. The resolution is not limited since even with a few atoms the voltage on the gate can be controlled continuously - the gate is not a closed, finite box with a well defined integer number of electrons.</p>
<p>Having said that, you are onto something in two aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There exist structures with quantized conductance steps. It is a consequence of the formation of individual conducting bands in narrow channels in high-mobility semiconductors at low temperatures (on the order of 1 K or smaller) [1,2 and many more]. This, however, does not mean the conductance can only take discrete values. It indicates rather that as a function of gate voltage there are discrete conductance plateaus, and the conductance value changes rapidly between those plateaus.</p>
</li>
<li>It is possible to realize a &quot;puddles&quot; in semiconductor that at low temperatures hold a few (integer number) of electrons - quantum dots. Having them placed next to semiconductor channel controls the conducting channel in discrete steps, with a step indicating addition/removal of a single electron from a quantum dot. In research context this is usually referred to as sensing of an electron occupancy of a quantum dot. This method is a candidate for readout of certain type of qubits in quantum computing [3,4 and many more].</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is important to note that what the gate is &quot;keeping in&quot; or &quot;keeping out&quot; are not <em>atoms</em>, but electrons which are easy to move because they are shared.  Don't think of the atomic-scale gate as having to move atoms to transfer matter as in the case of a &quot;normal, physical gate&quot;.    </p>
<p>I understand how you would get to this thought though - imagine cattle going through a really thin gate, it would take forever because you would be limited to one cow at a time. Digital transistors, even if they were used in an analog state, would have almost unlimited tunability because what is being moved are <em>electrons</em>, not atoms, and electrons are really tiny and have very little mass.  </p>
<p>Modern transistors are more like dams holding back water than doors or gates.  Turn the knob on the dam a bit and water gets to come through.  Near-infinite tunability of the rate of water passing through the dam is possible, with enough control.  However, if a dam engineer wants to know if the dam is open or closed (as in the case of a computer &quot;checking&quot; a transistor) it is much easier to just take a look at whether water is coming through or not instead of trying to measure the exact rate of transfer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you have so few atoms in the channel, several parameters that you could treat as continuous parameters in long channel transistors become much more quantized. The main one is channel doping (if you are using a doped channel transistor). Essentially, adjacent transistors may vary widely in their channel doping, which implies that their conductances vary widely as well. It becomes much harder to control and fine tune parameters of interest such as early resistance using the geometry of the transistor only. That in turn makes analog design very difficult.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am not well versed in the topic of the question, so risking derailing the thread a bit I'd like to ask a few questions in order to educate myself:<br />
- How exactly would they be used as &quot;analog devices&quot;? What I mean is what exactly determines something being digital or analog, and how would those small transistors be used as such? How would that affect their functionality I guess is what I'm asking.<br />
- What are &quot;discrete steps&quot;?<br />
- What is the &quot;resolution&quot; the question mentions?  </p>
<p>I'm sorry I know I probably sound very uneducated right now, but that's a topic of my interest and those are a lot of terms I know nothing about. Just didn't want to make a whole lot of threads for these questions, and I feel like someone replying here could help me with the basics of this stuff so I can read more about it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quantized conductance is a thing and it occurs in nanowires with diameters close to the deBroglie wavelength ot the electron in a given material. Such a nanowire forms at the junction of two overlapping very fine gold wires when they bounce in and out of contact for example. The reason you see quantized conductance there, i. e. discrete steps in the resistance, is due to ballistic transport. This phenomenon arises at a thickness of just a few atoms, down to single atom junctions. Transistors are actuslly to large for this mode of transportation (if you will) to become significant! Hene the electron still exhibits classical transport. I hope to have provided some keywords to fuel your google foo, IË‹ll gladly answer questions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
