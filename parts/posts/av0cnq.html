		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A bubble is when a commodity stops being valued primarily as a commodity and starts being primarily valued for its value.  In other words people are willing to buy it just because they think it will be worth even more in the future without having any interest in what it actually is.</p>
<p>The housing bubble was a good example and one of the more impactful ones(with only the stockmarket crash being worse ifaik).  First, people started buying more houses and the prices rose normally, just because more people were buying houses, than there were houses available to buy.  Normal, healthy supply and demand stuff.</p>
<p>Then people noticed that some people were able to make a sizable chunk of profit during this time by selling their houses for more than they had originally cost.  This is normally good since it bring more houses unto the market at a time when there is a lot of demand.  The problem is that people wanted in on that action and started buying houses just as an investment.</p>
<p>This meant that even MORE people wanted to buy houses and even LESS were available.  This causes housing prices to rise even further, bring more investors into the market, raising prices further, etc.  It became a loop. Eventually people started thinking it as a sure thing can't lose investment.  This is when it started to turn toxic.  People were investing money they couldn't afford to lose and in some cases didn't even have because they thought they were guaranteed a huge profit.  The banks tried profiting on this too by offering interest-only loans were you never paid for the principle. People expected to buy a house, wait a bit till it became more valuable, then run away laughing to the bank.  For a few people to get in and out early, this is what happens.</p>
<p>But commodities like houses are only good for one thing--using them.  By now, investors own most of the houses that had been coming up for sale.  Anyone who actually wanted to buy a house to live in it couldn't afford it anymore.  This meant the only people you could sell your investment house to were other investors.  Eventually, there was simply no more investors left who either wanted or could afford to buy investment houses.  At the same time, you had a bunch of houses which had been built just because houses costs so much and builders could sell them for much more than it cost to make them.</p>
<p>So now you had suddenly tons of houses on the market and no one who would buy them.  Law of supply and demand. The housing prices now dropped until someone could afford them again.  Since investment people no longer want to buy them because of crashing prices, that meant only people who wanted to live in them, and now thanks to the construction boom, there were lots of choices, so houses quickly became cheap.  That means that anyone who bought them and couldn't afford to actually pay for them when they were expensive were now in huge trouble and could never pay their mortgage.  And that meant banks were stuck with no way of getting their money back.</p>
<p>Big wall of text there, but that is how every bubble works.  Something rises in price, investors get involved and blow up the prices further, more are made to keep up with demand and eventually investors stop buying from each other and the prices fall back to what they should have been.  </p>
<p>EDIT: Due to the unexpected popularity of this post, I have gone back and edited it for spelling, grammar, and clarity.  Glad so many of you are finding it helpful!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People are giving you some good answers, but they are largely incomplete.  </p>
<p>This is ELI 'have a basic understanding on econ': Two <em>critical</em> elements to a 'bubble' are that 1) the overvaluation is funded by debt, and 2) (most critically) that debt is held as an asset by someone else (eg, when you buy a bond, you are holding someone else's debt as an asset). </p>
<p>These two elements are required, in the right ratio, to be an actual bubble.  Things can go up in value a lot without these two elements, but that is just 'regular overvalued market' and not a bubble.  </p>
<p>Somebody else called beanie babies a 'bubble'. I'd disagree with this b/c I doubt there was significant debt fueling the valuation increase.  I mean <em>maybe</em> you could make half an argument that people <em>might</em> have been using credit cards to speculatively buy beanie babies, but 1) I doubt there was a significant amount of that happening, and 2) nobody was seriously holding that debt as an asset.  </p>
<p>The opposite example would be housing in 2002-2008.  The rise in housing prices was absolutely fueled by debt, and that debt was held by banks/individuals as an asset (this asset-holding relationship was actually the root of the financial crisis.)</p>
<p>A popular topic today is 'are student loans a bubble?'.  I'd say pretty much no it isn't - although you can certainly argue that student debt has caused a ton of inflation in the cost of education.  The reason that student loans aren't a 'bubble' is that the student debts isn't held as an asset by anyone else.  The student loan market is about $1.4T but only about $200B is held as student Loan Asset Backed Debt (SLABS), and those student loans are nearly 100% private loans and are traded/hedged as unsecured debt.  In somewhat plain english, b/c there isn't an asset-holding relationship, there isn't anything to 'pop'.  So its not a bubble.  </p>
<p>But again, that DOES NOT mean that college tuition is not overvalued - just that the loans are not a bubble.  These are two separate, but related, concepts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A bubble is when the prices of a thing are inflated far beyond their actual value. Typically this attracts more and more people who are not interested in owning that actual thing, they are just trying to cash in. So you just have speculators selling from one to another until the price eventually gets too high, there are no more sucker to buy them, and the bubble &quot;pops.&quot;</p>
<p>One example would be Beanie Babies, if you are old enough to remember that. They became a massive craze in the 1990s, such that people were investing in them in expectation of big profits. But once everyone realized,&quot;wait a minute, these are cheap plush toys.&quot; then the bottom fell out immediately. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another component to a bubble is how Markets inform prices.</p>
<p>Think about five lemonade stands that all sell lemonade for three dollars a cup. </p>
<p>If one goes down in price, that movement in price can be for a few reasons. It might be that that particular seller has found a way to make lemonade cheaper. It might be that the lemonade stand can make more profit by lowering their price and increasing the demand for their lemonade in particular. In order to compete all five lemonade stands will have to lower their prices as well. If they can’t lower their price the same way and remain viable- then chances are these four stands aren’t able to make their lemonade as cheap as the one that can lower their price and stay in business.
The reverse is also true. If one raises their price it’s because their costs have gone up for them. If all five raise their price- then perhaps costs have gone up for all of them. Or perhaps there’s a higher demand for lemonade and everyone can raise their prices and remain viable businesses. In both cases we see, however, that the price shift is due to some kind of change- that the movement of price is based on some kind of information. </p>
<p>Now let’s say you believe that you can sell this lemonade more a week from now so you buy all the lemonade from all the stands. </p>
<p>Do they charge more or less?
Well for them they see that they’re selling out every single day- so they’ll make more lemonade to sell to you. And maybe you’ll buy it because sure it’s ten cents more but you can probably sell it for four dollars next week. The same thing happens for 9 days until on the tenth day you and all five sellers are selling a lot of lemonade for four dollars. </p>
<p>And all six of you are out there with your stands with a lot of lemonade. Everyone has a sign saying $4 a cup because the information they’ve gotten from the market tells them they can charge that much. But it’s not actually true. And no ones buying so you lower your prices.</p>
<p>You can go to 3.00 and break even.
But everyone can go that low because they make their lemonade for less.
So eventually if you want to get rid of the lemonade you’re not even looking at breaking even you’ll go lower than what you paid because if you don’t sell it you’ll lose more. But on this day you have between you all 11 days worth of lemonade that you want to sell today and you can’t because the demand is what it was before you started buying up everyone’s lemonade- when it only cost three dollars. You were speculating and your speculation misinformed the market. Now you just want to get rid of what you can as fast as possible because now you just see the price going lower and lower. When you go below what they paid, they have to go lower too because otherwise they will lose money they also need to keep their loss to a minimum. </p>
<p>So you see how the misinformation in the market can make prices go up and down. </p>
<p>Well let’s say for example everyone who pays for that lemonade uses a credit card. Maybe instead of paying the three dollars cash they have they’ll pay four dollars on a credit card. But just because everyone has a five dollar lemonade credit card doesn’t mean everyone can afford to pay that card back. So if the lemonade credit card company doesn’t screen enough people to make sure they can you’ll see more people buying lemonade than can afford it. So when the lemonade stands move their prices even higher to say five dollars- everyone still wants lemonade and they say hey you know what I’ll put it on the card. </p>
<p>Until everyone starts maxing their cards out and can’t pay them back. At that point the prices start dropping because no one can buy lemonade. People who bought lemonade want to sell there’s because they can’t afford the lemonade they have prices drop down even more. </p>
<p>So you can see in this hypothetical and imaginative example that speculation and buying in credit have the potential to misinform the market (which can create a bubble). </p>
<p>Well with the housing market you also have speculation and people buying on credit (mortgages). Same goes for student loans really “I can’t afford fifty thousand dollars a semester for school but I’ll just take out a loan because it’ll be worth it some day when I’m a famous artist”. “I can’t afford this house but I’ll make more money soon- maybe I can swing the loan for now”. Meanwhile maybe that persons boss can’t afford that home buyer but hey business is going to be booming soon so just for now they’ll rough it out....</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Over speculation. That is, people think that prices will raise in the future without doing due diligence and therefore do anything and everything to get into the market. They just want &quot;in&quot; without looking at the terms and how to get &quot;out&quot;. </p>
<p>The Tech Bubble was because folks were throwing money at &quot;the internet&quot;. Housing was because housing never drops. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
