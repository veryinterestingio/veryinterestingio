		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit: My thought process is that using one eye would still cause enough uncomfortable sensations that closing / squinting both eyes is the only viable option but apparently not. One eye is completely normal and painless. </p>
<p>This happened to me when I was driving the other day and I was worried I‚Äôd have to pull over on the highway, but when I closed one eye I was able to see with no pain sensation whatsoever with roughly the same amount of light radiation entering my üëÅ.</p>
<p>I know it‚Äôs technically less light for my brain to process, less intense on the nerve signals firing but I couldn‚Äôt intuitively get to the bottom of this because the common person might assume having one eye open could be worse?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have a blink reflex when exposed to bright light. Ideally, you're exposed to a light that's too bright and you squint or close your eyes to prevent any damage. </p>
<p>You might ask, &quot;Surely only closing one eye shouldn't help, since the open eye could still be damaged, right?&quot; And you'd be absolutely correct. This is a glitch of the human nervous system. </p>
<p>Essentially, this glitch occurs because your brain registers bright light by adding together the amount of light received in both eyes. If one eye is closed, that eye is receiving the same amount of light, but the brain is only registering half of the original amount. </p>
<p>Fun fact, some people (Ze Frank is a notable example) don't have this glitch. You can (but don't, it's not good for your eyes) test this by shining a light in one of your eyes, blocking the light from getting to the other eye, and watching to see if your non-lit pupil constricts. Normal people's pupils will both constrict if one eye is exposed to bright light. In the case of Ze Frank and others, only the pupil receiving the light will constrict.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One way to force your pupils to accommodate faster is to quickly blink both eyes repeatedly when you change light levels.  I don't know the mechanism behind it but it works for very bright sunlight and for darkness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain combines the things each eye sees and uses information from both eyes to form a single &quot;image&quot;. You can test this real quick by closing one eye and leaving the other open and then switching which eye is closed. If you look at an object you should see it &quot;move&quot; if you do this fast enough. </p>
<p>If you tried to walk around like this for a day you should notice you will have problems with knowing how close objects really are and balance.</p>
<p>This becomes an actually helpful thing if you're in a situation where the combined &quot;image&quot; is too much for your brain( like too much brightness too fast ) and closing one eye does reduce the brightness your brain &quot;sees&quot; because it's less &quot;information&quot;.</p>
<p>Of course this isn't really reducing the brightness the remaining opened eye is observing but your brain determines what you &quot;feel&quot; and it let's you know this is better than both eyes opened.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
