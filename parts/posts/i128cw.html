		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol tricks receptors in your skin into releasing the same Nerochemical trigger as when you are being burned. So your body reacts by telling you it hurts. Alcohol actually doesn’t make a wound heal faster. It can damage the tissue and cause the wound to heal more slowly. However, the alcohol will disinfect the wound, so if the wound was dirty it may be a matter of the alcohol slows the healing to a lesser degree than the bacteria would have and gives the appearance of speeding up the process. It is not recommended to put alcohol or hydrogen peroxide on a wound though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve noticed on my last few injuries that if I constantly keep it moist with a triple antibiotic, the wound doesnt scab, it just heals with layers of soft flesh. This is especially helpful with injuries on flexible parts like knuckles and other joints so the scabs dont rip everytime you use the joint. The wound heals in under two weeks.</p>
<p>I have been using alcohol regularly to clean the wound. I guess I will stop that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
