		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Shampoo, and more generally soaps, contain surfactants. Surfactants are molecules containing one end that really loves water (hydrophilic) and one end that really loves dirt/oil/grease (hydrophobic). When a surfactant finds some dirt, the hydrophobic end will bind with the dirt and then hydrophilic end will interact with the water which allows the whole molecule+dirt to be washed away. </p>
<p>Under circumstances where there is very little dirt, the hydrophobic ends don't have much to attach to. They also really don't want to be touched by water, so what they end up doing is grouping together in a sphere (micelle) where the hydrophobic ends are pointing inwards towards each other, and the hydrophilic ends are pointing outwards towards the water. This (along with a decrease in surface tension) is what causes a bubble to form.</p>
<p>So, when your hair is really dirty, the surfactants will bind with the dirt and not need to come together to form micelles. On the second wash, where there should be considerably less dirt, the surfactant will form micelles and thus form soap bubbles. </p>
<p>TLDR: dirt is the enemy of suds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone whose partner actually manufactures shampoo (and as someone who's manufactured shampoo themselves), I can also let you in on a not-so-secret secret. If you're getting lots of bubbles/lather, you're actually using too much shampoo. </p>
<p>Ideally, you use just enough to take the dirt and oil away from your hair, but still leave some of your body's natural oils near your scalp/follicles. This lets your hair grow properly without drying/damaging your scalp. If your first wash has low lather, and your second wash has LOTS of lather, you should train yourself into seeing those bubbles as money going down the drain. The only real time you want a second shampoo is if your hair is exceptionally greasy/dirty and even after the second shampoo you don't get much more lather than the first. </p>
<p>TL; DR: Some bubbles are good, LOTS of bubbles = wasted money &amp; dry scalp</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hairdresser here. First wash quick, scrub your scalp to pick up and loosen the oils, no suds will happen. Quick rinse. Second shampoo slow, massage, will suds a lot, no more oils. Rinse. Conditioner into ends, depending on quality, hold it in 30 seconds, brush your teeth. Generally stay away from sulphate shampoos if you hate 'fluffy' hair. More expensive shampoos are more concentrate and less sulphate and will respect hairs natural oils without stripping and gentle cleansing. Cheep conditioner also can be full of silicas, so keep it off the scalp as it blocks the follicles (hair holes) but good conditioner opposite, will nourish scalp skin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
