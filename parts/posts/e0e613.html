<p>It makes sense that feeding someone in this condition can kill them, but how do doctors fine the line between feeding them too much and not enough?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg32/chapter/1-Guidance" target="_blank">the guidance</a> from the UK based on the severity of malnourishment. Basically if they are malnourished but not too severely, they just feed them what they need while monitoring their blood work (esp. electrolyte levels). If they are severely malnourished, they will start them on a diet of 5-10 kcal/kg/day with specified vitamin and mineral supplements, again monitoring blood work. The biggest risk for these patients is electrolyte abnormalities, for example a very high potassium level can cause a fatal cardiac arrhythmia.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m a dietitian. We’re usually consulted in a case of starvation and handle the process. What we’re monitoring for is something called refeeding syndrome, which is what you’re referring to. In a state of starvation, electrolytes, specifically magnesium and phosphorus, are depleted everywhere in the body and redistribute from in the cells to the extrastitial fluids to maintain homeostasis. When you feed someone again, especially carbohydrate, that magnesium and phosphorus is needed for metabolism, so it rushes back into the cells, leaving everywhere else insufficient.</p>
<p>Basically, how you manage it is limiting caloric and carbohydrate load, and monitoring electrolyte levels in the blood. When electrolytes get low, they’re corrected intravenously and increasing calories is stalled until they normalize. This process continues until we’re meeting 100% of the patient’s caloric needs. It can take up to a week to get there safely. </p>
<p>Typically, these clients are tube fed, as in most modern countries, extreme starvation has a secondary medical cause, such as swallowing difficulties, gastroperesis, or extreme lack of appetite from cancer. I’d have to look into the research, but I think if they could eat food orally rather than through a tube, we’d opt for that. Again, it would be carefully planned and chosen to limit calories and carbohydrate and electrolytes would be monitored closely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Refeeding syndrome is the issue with re-nourishing malnourished people. Essentially, when a patients gets a first dose of real nutrition in several weeks/months (whether it be from food or from tube feedings or from TPN—IV nutrition)  the carbohydrates in the nutrition stimulate an insulin response. The electrolytes in the blood (potassium, phosphorus, magnesium) then hop on the insulin train, go into the cells (of the body (muscle, liver, etc) and what’s remaining in their blood is insufficient for life. At the start of a new tube feed (which is typically the way malnourished people are fed, because there’s probably a reason they can’t eat real food—like a head or neck tumor—hence they’re now in the hospital, malnourished) electrolytes in the blood are monitored ideally several times per day and replaced with IV electrolytes. As everyone said, the nutrition is started slowly to mediate the insulin response, and increased over several days as electrolytes are replaced. </p>
<p>This could also happen with small liquid meals, in the case of eating-disorder patients who are capable of getting nutrition through their mouth. The only time IV nutrition would be used is if the GI tract is damaged or blocked in a way that didn’t allow meaningful nutrition to pass through and be absorbed. In all cases, it’s started slow and electrolytes are monitored. Ideally the patient is at goal calories on the 3rd day, depending on how the electrolytes respond to replacement. </p>
<p>All of this requires careful coordination between the dietitian, the doctor, and the RNs, and the lab to make sure feedings are being advanced appropriately. </p>
