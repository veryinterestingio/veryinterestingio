		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hair is always falling off and regrowing. Eyelashes don't do this as often as the hairs on your head. Hair turning gray is a result of the natural cycle of the hair follicle over your lifespan. </p>
<p>As the cycle continues, your hair produces less color, turning gray. This process usually begins after age 35.</p>
<p>Other factors such as vitamin deficiency, stress, and genetics also play a role to when your hair starts losing color.</p>
<p>In some ways this is similar to cancer being more likely to occur the older you are. As cells divide, they lose a bit of themselves that keep them from turning into cancer. Over time, it accumulates and has a higher chance of turning into a cancer cell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had accidentally pulled out a few lashes with an eyelash curler when I was about 20 years old and they never grew back; so now I have a little gap in between them in one place and it’s been about 12 years since then. I want to know why they’re never grew back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
