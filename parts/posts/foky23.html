		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This may have been asked here before, but I’m trying to understand how a virus can show completely different symptoms in one person versus the next. For example, Donovan Mitchell, a NBA shooting guard for the Utah Jazz, tested positive for COVID-19 a week and a half ago. He’s repeatedly stated that he is completely asymptomatic and is feeling better than ever, even stating the he would be able to play in a 7-game series right now. But then I see stories of people in their mid-20’s (around the same age as Mitchell), who appear relatively healthy, having to be put on respirators and checked into ICU. I’ve never heard of a virus affecting people completely different like this. For example, if two people around the same age and health get the flu, it usually affects them about the same. And even if it’s not exactly the same, they both would experience negative symptoms to some degree. Why is COVID-19 so different? Any explanation on this would be appreciated! Thanks!</p></div></div>

In layman’s terms there are two important decisions your body must make. The first is how aggressively does the body want to fight the virus when it initially enters your body.  Usually this is at the level of your throat before it gets into your lungs. If your body succeeds in fending off the virus at this level, you will have mild to no symptoms. If your body fails to fight off the virus at this level, it will enter your lungs. This second part is where your body has to walk a fine line. There is a degree of variability of your immune system to decide how much “ammo”it wants to throw at the virus. If your immune system is filled with accurate snipers you will have no problem clearing the virus from your lungs. Now if it panics and starts throwing  grenades at anything that moves, it will kill much of your healthy lung tissue and clog up the airways with fluid causing you essentially drown yourself. Of course you might be saved if you medical professionals stick a tube down your throat and connect you to a machine that forces air into your lungs for days. There’s is nothing you can do to improve the accuracy or measured response of your immune system.  Covid 19 is no joke. We’re all playing Russian roulette when we make contact with others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Lot of people get asymptomatic flu too, we just don't find them out because we don't run flu tests on everyone. You often get a flu even if you didn't come in contact with someone ill, simply because an asymptomatic carrier infected you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Retired MD, PhD here, with research experience involving the immune system. I agree with the poster that the highly variable response of different patients is an interesting question.  It is also an important question. We need to know the specific factors that might predict clinical outcomes and responses to various interventions, thereby identifying patients who might need and might benefit from treatment modalities that are in short supply -- including hospitalization, ventilators, and drugs.  The already publicized risk parameters of age and pre-existing illness are too broad to be useful as accurate predictors.</p>
<p>I believe that if all clinical trials for COVID-19 treatment used a common system to collect wide-ranging data, then an unbiased Artificial Intelligence-driven analysis might be able to tease out important markers to classify patients into risk groups.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has sponsored the Human Immunology Project Consortium, which is &quot;a major collaborative effort that is generating large amounts of data . . . to characterize the status of the immune system in diverse poulations under both normal conditions and in response to stimuli.&quot;  The HIPC approach has proven useful in teasing out markers correlating with disease severity for West Nile Virus.  For COVID-19 useful data to collect might include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Environmental factors, like smoking history, medication and supplements used, specific concomitant and past diseases, nutritional status (e.g. vitamin D levels), and circumstances of a patient's exposure to coronavirus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Immunologic parameters, e.g. cytokine profiles and inflammatory markers, B and T cell recognition of specific viral proteins, immune cell populations in plasma or in nasal washes.</p>
</li>
<li>Genetic information.  Genome Wide Association Studies have been fruitful in identifying a marker that is important in the treatment response of Hepatitis C patients, and one could hope that a similar approach with COVID-19 patients could yield useful information -- perhaps even suggest druggable targets.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is possible that this kind of systematic data collection has already been initiated, but has not yet yielded flashy results that would be reported in the press.  I hope that this kind of study is not being overlooked with the current short-term efforts to slow viral spread and to shore up the medical system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
