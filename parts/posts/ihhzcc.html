		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bricks are made of clay from the Earth, and the specific clay they use has iron in it. When iron is exposed to oxygen, it turns red/orange (like rust).</p>
<p>Bricks become darker over time because they are porous (lots of little holes in them) that can be filled with dirt. Power-washing can bring them back to life :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say red is the &quot;normal&quot; colour for bricks. It varies based on the local availability of clay and sand at the point of manufacture. You might find entire towns built from the same colour bricks that all came from the same quarry, or you might find streets that constantly change colour as you walk down them because they used the sand and clay they found as they dug out the foundations to make the next house along the line.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bricks are typically made with clay. In most parts of the world clay tends to be rich in iron oxides, which gives it's red or orange colour.</p>
<p>When bricks are baked (to gain it's resistance) that colour tends to darken.</p>
<p>Furthermore other minerals are present in clay (or added to the brick formula composition), which alters it's colours. That's how brick manufacturers are able to get almost any shade in bricks, from black, to yellow, brown, red and all other colours in between.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For <em>really</em> old bricks the variation in colour is down to how well fired ('baked' in the kiln)  they were.</p>
<p>Case in point, the house I grew up in, the present structure dated back to the 17th century. The bricks would have been fired on site, and varied from normal reddish 'brick colour' to blue where they had been in the centre of the stack and overfired, to pretty much still just clay coloured which you could crumble with your hands where they had been on the outside.</p>
<p>A bit like burning a cake at the back of the oven while under cooking the bit at the front.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Basically how dwellings developed from ancient times up to now. Filled with fascinating side stories, crazy historical characters, fun and educational. </p>
<p>Just two nights ago I was on a chapter that included the history of brickmaking. </p>
