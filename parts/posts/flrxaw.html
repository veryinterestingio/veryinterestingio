		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cows and other ruminant animals have relatively complex digestive systems. Cow stomachs have 4 compartments that allow them to extract all of the nutrients from grass, aided in large part by their gut microbiome (the bacteria that live in their stomachs). Plus, they eat a <em>ton</em> of it. Cows will spend a large chunk of the day grazing and a similarly large amount of time chewing the cud to break it down. A cow can eat up to 68kg (150lbs) of grass a day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Cow-specific explanation:</strong></p>
<p>There are two problems with grass.</p>
<ol>
<li>Grass has sturdy cell walls made of cellulose, which mammals can't digest, and so we can't effectively get to the protein inside the cells. </li>
<li>Grass doesn't contain all the <em>amino acids</em> a growing cow needs. Amino acids are the building blocks proteins are made of. Plants often don't have all the amino acids an animal needs. This is why vegetarian humans need to be sure to eat a variety of plants together (like beans &amp; rice) to ensure they get complete protein.</li>
</ol>
<p>Cows do two things really well that makes eating grass viable for them.</p>
<ol>
<li>The first is simple: chewing! They chew their food a lot. They actually bring food back up from their stomach and chew it a second time after it's partially digested. This is that 'cud'' cows are famous for chewing. The heavy chewing helps break up the cellulose into small bits so the cow can get to the protein inside the grass cells.</li>
<li>The second thing they do is team up with bacteria that can break down cellulose. Cellulose is actually made of <strong><em>sugar,</em></strong> but the linkage between the sugar molecules is very hard to break. Mammals don't have this power on their own, so the cows 'host' bacteria to do the job for them. This is why cows have a four-stomach, four-star bacteria hotel inside them. The bacteria get a great place to live and a steady supply of food, and in return, they give the cow a cut of everything they produce, including amino acids (the building blocks of protein) the cow needs that aren't found in grass, as well the sugar from the broken down cellulose.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Big picture explanation:</strong></p>
<p>Every living thing makes a trade between extracting/making what they need from low-quality food or being good at getting high-quality food.</p>
<p>Plants and dedicated herbivores (like cows) have 'chemical factories' inside their bodies that help them create the nutrients they need from simpler compounds.</p>
<p>Predators (like humans, cats, snakes, sharks, etc.) have relatively simple digestive systems, because they eat the chemical factory creatures and 'steal' the output of their chemical factories.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people are answering your question directly, but I want to add that most cows that are used for meat are not fed only grass. They are given a bunch of grain like corn, and that really fattens them up. It's a lot harder for a grass fed cow to gain weight, which is why (among other reasons) grass fed beef is more expensive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
