I've been assured that taking my usual antihistamies won't have any effect on the vaccine working, and I believe that, but I'd love to know why.</p>
<p>Since allergies are an immune response, and antihistamines suppress them, what is different about other kinds of immune response that means antihistamines don't disrupt them?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is in the word. Anti-histamine inhibits histamine (inflammatory protein) from being released by specific immune cells, mainly granulocytes (basophils, eosinophils, neutrophils). Vaccine immune response is focused more on lymphocyte specialization, sensitizing B-lymphocytes to antigens which then become plasma cells that produce antibodies to previously encountered antigens. Of course this is a very simplified explanation of immunology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would reframe it as the antihistamines are treating the symptoms of an unwanted immunogenicity, specifically the inflammatory cascade. The underlying immunogenicity is still there, usually IgE in the case of pollens, you're just tuning down part of the nonspecific defense.</p>
<p>That cascade is beneficial for certain things, like protecting an open wound, but it can actually be harmful for other diseases including Covid. At least some portion of severe Covid patients develop systemic inflammatory responses that were damaging lung tissue and driving mortality.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To put it simply, the immune response for hay fever is entirely different than the immune response for coronavirus and other viral infections, including vaccination which oftentime tries to replicate the real deal.</p>
<p>Hay fever is caused by large particles, like dust or pollen, inducing an immune response, typically mediated by mast cells which release histamine. This histamine is responsible for the various symptoms such as increased mucus secretions and decreased viscosity etc. The end result of the degranulation of mast cells (and some other granulocytes) is the release of histamine which can be effectively blocked by, you guessed it... anti-histamines!</p>
<p>Antiviral and some vaccine responses are primarily due to  antigen presenting cells (APCs) detecting some foreign protein, in the moderna vaccines’ case, the spike protein, and starting the cascade that bolsters a lot of immune pathways. These APCs regularly scout the body and digest foreign matter, and sometimes they recognize cells that are displaying foreign material on their surface. After modifying this ingested material, they present it on their membrane on a reception that screams for attention from other cell types, one of these being lymphoid cells. B and T cells are then selected for the response to the foreign protein, B cells producing antibodies that target the protein, and cytotoxic T cells directly killing all cells displaying this protein in a non-APC fashion (through MHC class 1 receptor mediated presentation). This process takes a couple days and most cells in this pathway release chemicals known as cytokines, which induce very intense and sometimes targeted symptoms. There isn’t one drug to rule them all when inhibiting these cytokines, but we also don’t want to do that as they are required for the proper response needed to generate immunity. Histamines play very little role in this response and as such, anti-histamines are largely ineffective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is very simple: immune responses have different defence strategies, depending on the nature of the pathogen or allergen. Allergic responses are highly dependent on histamine and can therefore be blocked by anti-histamins. Immune responses to viruses have nothing to do with histamine and therefore covid vaccines are not affected by it. the immune system is just very specialised and complex in order to react to different threats. It‘s absolutely amazing!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
