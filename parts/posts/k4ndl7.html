		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is there a risk here for developing an autoimmune disorder where we teach our bodies to target molecules that fit our ACE2 receptors (the key molecules, not the receptors, angiotensin, I think it's called) and inadvertently, this creates some cascade which leads to a cycle of really high blood pressure/ immune system inflammation?  Are the coronavirus spikes different enough from our innate enzymes that this risk is really low?</p>
<p>Edit: I added the bit in parentheses, as some ppl thought that I was talking about the receptors themselves, my bad.</p>
<p>Another edit: This is partially coming from a place of already having an autoimmune disorder, I've seen my own body attack cells it isn't supposed to attack.  With the talk of expedited trials, I can't help but be a little worried about outcomes that aren't immediately obvious.</p></div></div>

You can think of the ACE2 like a doorknob and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein like a hand. The normal substrate of ACE2 is angiotensin, which also has a very different structure from the spike protein.</p>
<p>So, there's no risk of the immune system mistaking one for the other. And as others have mentioned, if it did happen, it would have shown up in clinical trials.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple reasons why this would be unlikely. First off, a healthy immune system undergoes a mechanism called self-tolerance. Through a complex interplay between your immune cells and you regular cells, any antibody that is created that targets your own cells is not propagated and cells that make that antibody undergo death. So unless a person already has an autoimmune condition, they are unlikely to develop one from a regular protein challenge.</p>
<p>Secondly, gaining immunity from a vaccine is not very different than gaining immunity from the virus. All viruses utilize some kind of surface protein to bind and eventually enter cells. Everyone is constantly infected with dozens of viruses. People don't generally develop autoimmune conditions from it. </p>
<p>Thirdly, immunity is highly specific. On the molecular scale, there is an immense amount of variability in what a even a short peptide sequence can look like. Something that is selected to bind the specific spike protein is highly unlikely to bind anything different unless its really really close in structure. The ACE2 receptor is not at all close in structure to the spike protein, there is just an interface through which they interact. It's kind of like saying &quot;my key ring holds my key which inserts itself into my lock, shouldn't I be worried that my key ring will unlock my door?&quot; </p>
<p>Lastly, the vaccine has been tested in animal models (the immune systems are not that different) and on people. I guarantee that immune system response was very very well studied in every phase trial. No serious auto-immune conditions have been reported in the thousands of people tested. Is it possible that some very small population may have other adverse effects and was not chosen for the trials? Yes, absolutely. However, scientist on the whole have a pretty good understanding of the immune system by now and it is very unlikely. Even so, the potential benefit of eradicating a disease that can kill \~1% of the population probably outweighs an the risk of a previously unseen complication in &lt;0.01% of the population.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nearly nil. We'd see it early if it caused direct targeting on angiotensin or other familiar human proteins.</p>
<p>However most infections has a chance to trigger auto-immunity, and inherently, in theory, so does any vaccine. We don't have any examples of this yet, nor any real indications any current vaccines increase incidence of auto-immune disorders (to my knowledge).</p>
<p>However this is looooong term stuff. If one of the vaccines, for one reason or another, slightly increases the chance for some auto-immune disorder or something else, we probably won't know for years.</p>
<p>As an aside I find all the people not being skeptical at all a bit dangerous. We're all right to be skeptical, that's healthy, especially with a vaccine on such a fast track and almost no clinical long term examples in history.
However we must also temper that skepticism with the fact that we do know for a fact that the long term effects of Covid-19, even in people not badly affected of primary disease, can be debilitating for a long time. And I can almost guarantee there'll be even more insidious after effects found much later considering how this thing spreads in vivo.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Short answer.. no.. Couple points   </p>
<ol>
<li>Think of it this way. The ACE2 receptor is like a certain type of lock on some our cells (thinkof the cells as buildings). The virus basically has a spike protein/key that can specifically bind to these receptors and open the door to get in. What a vaccine does is train the immune system ( an e.g. would be antibodies = beat cops, B/T cells = patrol squad cars) to look for the type of key/spike protein and NOT the lock/ACE2 receptor. So a vaccine won't teach the immune system to attack the ACE2 receptor   
<ol>
<li>Secondly, in normal healthy immune systems, by the time the system is mature, it has trained not to look at proteins that are normally produced in hte body - called self-antigens - to avoid your question exactly. That's a different detailed convo for another time - but the analogy above holds.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On the contrary to most replies, the answer is yes, the vaccines can induce B-cell autoimmunity, but this is far less likely than a SARS-CoV 2 infection itself.</p>
<p>Many who have replied seem to be unaware that B-cell autoimmunity is often induced through B-cell sensitisation due to complexes between self and foreign antigens.</p>
<p>This would include complexes of spike proteins bound to ACE2, outside the cell (as a consequence of cell lysis for example). But also note that the spike protein has been documented to bind to a wide variety of cell surface proteins, through neu5ac residues. The sialic acid residues of gangliosides for example could explain the Guillain-Barr√© syndrome association with COVID-19.</p>
<p>The mistake arises when the B-cell receptor is sensitive to the self-antigen, and internalises the receptor bound to the self/foreign antigen complex, but mistakenly only presents peptides from the foreign antigen on MHC-II to T-cells. Thus autoreactive B-cells can be activated even when there is no T-cell receptor autoimmunity. T-cell autoimmunity is far rarer than autoreactive B-cells due to robust negative selection processes in the thymus.</p>
<p>edit - a paper investigating this process in vivo:</p>
<p>&quot;Cocapture of cognate and bystander antigens can activate autoreactive B cells&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/4/734" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/4/734" target="_blank">https://www.pnas.org/content/114/4/734</a></a></p>
<p>Of course this B-cell mistake needs to occur multiple times in B-cell germinal centres for a serious illness to develop, and the kinetics depend on the antigen availability.</p>
<p>Hence why in the case of a viral induced autoimmunity (Guillain-Barr√© syndrome for example), the influenza virus is much more likely to induce the disease than a flu vaccine. The good news is, at least as far as GBS is concerned, is that it is rare. The incidence in Norway during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was one in \~58,000 documented cases of Influenza and the incidence following Flu vaccination is at least an order of magnitude rarer than this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
