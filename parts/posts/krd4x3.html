		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The term is &quot;precession&quot; which applies to the rotation of the axis of a top spinning as well. I do not have the figures for Earth's orbit, but the precession of Mercury's orbit was part of the early confirmation of Einstein's theory of relativity. In the case of Mercury, the movement is amplified by an effect of the synchronization of it's rotation and the time of it's orbit.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add on: the apses (for the Earth, the perihelion and aphelion) precess <em>primarily</em> because of the interactions of other planets. Wikipedia has an excellent article under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsidal_precession" target="_blank">apsidal precession</a>. From that article, regarding Mercury (which, as /u/the_fungible_man reminds us, has the largest effect of relativity):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For Mercury, the perihelion precession rate due to general relativistic effects is 43″ (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcsecond" target="_blank">arcseconds</a>) per century. By comparison, the precession due to perturbations from the other planets in the Solar System is 532″ per century, whereas the oblateness of the Sun (quadrupole moment) causes a negligible contribution of 0.025″ per century.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus if you had a star orbited by a single planet, the apsidal precession would be <strong>much</strong> smaller. But still present.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe you are under a wrong imperssion here: The aphelion and the preihelion don't have anything to do with the point where January 1st takes place. Our seasons - and with them, the point where January 1st occurs - come from the precession of the axis.</p>
<p>If you are specifically interested in the movement of the aphelion, I have some keywords for you:</p>
<p>The &quot;siderial year&quot; is the time the Earth needs for one 360°-revolution around the sun, as viewed against the fixed stars.</p>
<p>The &quot;anomalistic year&quot; is the time from one aphelion to the next. Since the aphelion does indeed move, it is about four minutes longer than the siderial year.</p>
<p>The &quot;tropical year&quot; is the time from one summer equionx to the next (or, roughly speaking, from one January 1st to the next). Because of the Earth's procession, it is about 20 minutes shorter than the siderial year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
