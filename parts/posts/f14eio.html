		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes it can be less about the battery strength and more about the connection. </p>
<p>Typically what's happening in this situation is that the connections are becoming stronger after hitting it. Then over time, the batter shifts just slightly and the connection is not as strong this causing issues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Already been asked before but I’ll copy my answer here:
Batteries work by electrons being stripped from a piece of metal with acid and pushed through a wire. When the metal is degraded too much, there’s no more electrons to strip off it and the battery no longer works. When you slap the remote the acid hits parts of the metal that may not have been soaking as much and shakes any potential lingering electrons off making them available to be pushed through the wire. Imagine you vacuum a dusty rug and it looks pretty good but then you pick it up and slap it and some dust debris still flies off. Same idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Knocking bits off the plates in the battery to expose unused/conductive anode/cathode. </p>
<p>While many say it is the connection between the battery and the remote, I find that only very old and near fully depleted batteries suffer from this.</p>
<p>And on heavier loads like a flashlight, you can see it get significantly brighter when wacked, Yet only nearly dead cells need this, you won't find a flashlight with new cells that has been sitting for months need to be hit to get full brightness. </p>
<p>It also has to be wacked more and more as the battery dies. If it was oxide buildup on the connections it would matter more on how old the battery is and not its state of charge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tiny bits of oxidation occur between the battery terminals and the contacts in the remote that over time can in some cases impede electrical contact.  When you move the batteries around it &quot;breaks up&quot; that oxidation just enough to make a bit of renewed contact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
