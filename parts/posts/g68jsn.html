It wasn't out of selfishness. It just happens to be where I live and it doesn't take much of a scientist to understand its not going to go smoothly here with all the anti-vax nuts and misinformation.</p>
<p>Edit 2: I said 250 million to factor out people that already have had the virus and the anti-vax people who are going to refuse and die. It was still a pretty rough guess but I am well aware there are 350 million Americans.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually the regulatory hurdles would be large. If you do the discovery, optimization, process development, risk assessments etc. and then start your clinical trials with what you've got, you've already chewed up a lot of time. If you're confident you could start manufacturing (and in my opinion this would be fairly simple as far as biologics go) during your trials and have it ready by the conclusion - risky but smart bet.</p>
<p>You'll see that JnJ is manufacturing 800 million doses at risk, which means they're confident enough in a conservative candidate that they think the conclusion of a successful clinical trial will coincide with their stockpile being complete. From a pharmaceuticals standpoint that is a huge, huge, huge accomplishment if they pull it off, even with some regulatory barriers relaxed. Even this is anticipated to take a little under a year-ish.</p>
<p>EDIT below -</p>
<p>It isn't uncommon to get the ball rolling towards commercial batches if your process is set/validated etc. and you anticipate a successful conclusion, and in my opinion vaccines are a lot &quot;simpler&quot; to make than other biologics because there is quite a bit of expertise in the area, but yes they're accelerating the process at what (in my opinion) is an impressive pace. That's what I was trying to emphasize.</p>
<p>I did *not* want my comment on what they're doing to sound like an overhyped Buzzfeed article, but having had to go back and dot i's and cross t's for filings, I remain in awe of how fast they're going.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.cell.com/immunity/fulltext/S1074-7613(20)30120-5" target="_blank">Here's a good peer-reviewed perspective piece from Amanat et al. in Immunity published April 6th.</a> They outline many challenges with developing a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preliminary data suggesting (from a preprint article) complications with testing vaccine candidates in animal models (<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.939389v3" target="_blank">Bao et al., 2020</a>)</li>
<li>Need for <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/pharmaceutical-quality-resources/current-good-manufacturing-practice-cgmp-regulations" target="_blank">current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP)</a> processes for producing such a vaccine being developed from scratch</li>
<li>Upscaling such cGMP-quality vaccines - depending on the type of vaccine that ends up working can be anything from adapting existing large scale processes or having to start from scratch</li>
<li>Distribution, administration, and dosage - more than one dose is likely needed, that are spread out, and also take time to provide any protective immunity (which Amanet et al. estimates will take 1 to 2 months)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Amanat et al. therefore predict that a vaccine wouldn't be available until probably 12 - 18 months</strong> <strong><em>after</em></strong> <strong>the initiation of clinical trials.</strong></p>
<p>I highly encourage reading the paper or at least giving it a skim. It's open access to the public and has a lot more details about SARS-CoV-2 in general and the different vaccines being tried.</p>
<p>Edit: fixed links and added a little more context for one of them</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apologies in advance, I’m not going to be able source most of this, but I work in process development at a major biologics / pharma company and have previously developed manufacturing lines and strategies for GMP nucleic acid processes (triphosphates and oligonucleotides).</p>
<p>The regulatory hurtles are not a major contributor to the timeline — The FDA has the power to grant emergency use authorization as they see fit, so if there was a vaccine we knew worked, it could be pushed through in &lt;1 day. The challenge is building confidence that one works.</p>
<p>Beyond the confidence piece, it is entirely dependent on which vaccine candidate we’re talking about. Ramping vaccine production is going to be a function of: (1) process yield, (2) process cycle time, (3) manufacturing capacity, and (4) supply chain capacity.</p>
<p>Best case:
Moderna’s mRNA vaccine is likely the best case scenario for ramping demand. Amidite (RNA bases) supply chains are fairly strong and can ramp up if needed and it’s fairly straightforward to ramp mRNA synthesis / processing, so that will almost certainly not be a limiting factor at the time of approval. It’d probably be a 2-3 month manufacturing campaign for 250M doses, and they’d almost certainly have that campaign started or even completed prior to approval.</p>
<p>Worst case:
It requires a low yield egg based manufacturing process. For the flu vaccine (which will still need to be produced) they use about 900,000 eggs per day for 6-9 months to produce about 150M doses. If a COVID-19 vaccine’s yield was less than that of the yearly flu’s it would just take longer to produce the same amount of doses, so bottom line: At least a year for 250M doses, but probably longer (and much longer if there are supply problems with eggs / processing equipment).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, about the claim that Johnson and Johnson has manufactured 800 million doses 'at risk'.  They can do this because the physical production cost of the vaccine is actually quite low in comparison to R&amp;D, trials, distribution, etc.  </p>
<p>They gain a lot by being first to market if correct, but lose very little if it doesn't pan out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
