		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interviews with Chris Hadfield describe what it is like going blind in space, and I've been fascinated by why space causes vision loss in astronauts. The inability to shed tears in space (requiring them to be wiped away) has always made me wonder what effect that might have on the anterior part of the eye.</p>
<p>A little digging around about vision loss in space showed theories that it could be down to increased levels of cerebrospinal fluid causing intracranial pressure. I thought it might be something to do with blood pressure, though the measurements of astronauts' blood pressure when returning from the ISS varied greatly; some astronauts had low blood pressure but high levels of CSF. </p>
<p>Some astronauts with vision loss were observed to have choroidal folding, this I know very little about as I'm a first year optometry student.</p>
<p>If anyone could shed some light on this I would be grateful. Thank you for your time.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, my lab has actually done some research for NASA on this exact topic.  The term for this phenomenon is 'Spaceflight Associated Neuro-Oculuar Syndrome' or SANS.</p>
<p>The general consensus, currently, is that due to being in a microgravity environment, the systems that regulate intercranial pressure don't function normally.  This chronic increase in pressure causes two things - 1) Macular nerve degeneration/damage and 2) Retinal thickening.  We haven't been able to recreate the nerve degeneration, but if we take someone and keep them in a strict 6-degree head-down tilt (IE have your feet a little higher than your head) for 30 days in a mildly hypercapnic (extra CO2) environment, we can reproduce the retinal thickening.  This retinal thickening interferes with the interaction of photons with receptors and thus interferes with the perception of light - AKA vision loss.</p>
<p>In addition to those factors, there may be sleep disruptions associated with spaceflight that are also contributing to retinal thickening and macular nerve degeneration.    We've only shown a relationship to the retinal thickening though.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Here are a couple of abstracts(looking at sleep, and sleep/retinal thickening from the same study) that might help.  <a href="https://digitalcommons.wku.edu/ijesab/vol8/iss6/57/" target="_blank"><a href="https://digitalcommons.wku.edu/ijesab/vol8/iss6/57/" target="_blank">https://digitalcommons.wku.edu/ijesab/vol8/iss6/57/</a></a>   <a href="https://www.fasebj.org/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.2018.32.1_supplement.lb260" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.fasebj.org/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.2018.32.1\_supplement.lb260" target="_blank">https://www.fasebj.org/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.2018.32.1\_supplement.lb260</a></a>  There is also the NASA white paper on SANS: <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20180000936.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20180000936.pdf" target="_blank">https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20180000936.pdf</a></a> (It's a little outdated)</p>

<p>The folks involved in actually writing and submitting the manuscripts have been.... a little busy so IIRC, the manuscript is just now going through review.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
