		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This seems like a really stupid question but here goes:</p>
<p>My dog is 7 and she's obviously gonna die much younger than I will. That got me to wondering, since she's a mammal like me, with roughly the same batch of parts, why do we have such different lifespans? Also, why do some dog breeds live way longer than others? It seems to have something to do with size, but there doesn't seem to be an exact correlation.</p>
<p>What is it in our genes that says &quot;this many years for a human, this many years for a dog, this many for a horse, etc.?&quot;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for the education!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the ends of your chromosomes are sequences of DNA called telomeres. Their job is to keep your DNA from fraying. Think of them like the aglets at the ends of your shoelaces. As your DNA replicates over time your telomeres slowly unravel and get shorter. The rate at which telomeres shorten in a given species directly correlates with their average lifespans. Mice telomeres, for instance, were observed in one study as unraveling at a rate nearly 100x that of a human</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lifespan is but an attribute  that evolution gets to play with. Just like some animals are blessed with wings, fake wings, or 4 wings,  or underwater breathing, or scales vs. fur, so are some blessed with a good lifespan.<br />
We might think we're lucky compared to dogs but think about giant tortoises (150 years) and the monarch butterfly (6 months, I think).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
