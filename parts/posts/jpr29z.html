		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Male homo sapiens unlike other apes have androgen sensitive hair.</p>
<p>Basically our hair follicles are sensitive to male hormones. That is why in puberty we start to grow beards. The hair follicles on our lower faces get the hormones and become active.</p>
<p>The paradox is that after puberty the follicles on the scalp become sensitive to androgens but they become dormant instead of active. The exact rate and location of the dormancy depends on your specific genes but generally it's from the front and crown on what's called male pattern baldness.</p>
<p>Loss from all over simultaneously is rarer and not male pattern, this could be genetic or environmental.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems like the main explanation is that the hair cells shrink and stop growing due to a sensitivity to the male hormone DHT, and:</p>
<p>&quot;The reason why men do not lose hair in the posterior scalp is that these follicles are genetically programmed to be stem cells and do not shed. &quot; </p>
<p><a href="https://health.howstuffworks.com/wellness/men/hygiene/why-arent-there-more-patterns-in-male-pattern-baldness.htm" target="_blank">https://health.howstuffworks.com/wellness/men/hygiene/why-arent-there-more-patterns-in-male-pattern-baldness.htm</a></p>
<p>But it's a complex problem, and there is still much to learn about it.  One interesting theory, which seems not to have picked up much support yet, it that DHT affects bone and muscle growth, restrcting blood supply to certain area.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/why-do-men-go-bald-from-the-top-of-their-heads/" target="_blank">https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/why-do-men-go-bald-from-the-top-of-their-heads/</a></p>
<p>I'm not sure how much I believe that second one, but perhaps with further support, it could answer the question. As the article mentions this issue is still being debated, and some aspects remain mysterious.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m Native American and my hair doesn’t recede period. You might say “all males hair recedes somewhat.” I’m telling you ours doesn’t. Here’s the weird part, at the SAME time, us Native Americans don’t grow hair in other places at the same rate as other non-native males. Chest hair is one of the best examples. It’s as if we traded a lifetime with a full head of hair for little to no chest hair.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
