And also like your arsehole, there is an outer one which is consciously controlled, and an inner one which is unconsciously controlled. So it’s a bit of both really.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blow holes are specailized nostrils, they are connected directly to the trachea, when they dive it automatically contracts tightly by strong muscles that surround it, so that water cannot get into the whale or dolphin’s lungs.</p>
<p>When they surface to breath again they forcefully exhale the co2, similar to blowing your nose</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another cool adaptation that cetaceans have developed because taking a breath has to be a conscious thought is their ability to only sleep with one side of their brain at a time. That way they can still surface to breath as well as control whatever functions they need in order to survive (watching for threats, staying with the group, etc) while still letting their brain rest. They also have a fairly complex muscular structure (similar to our lips) combined with a series of air sacs in their blowhole which is what allows them to make the incredible range of sounds and noises that you hear cetaceans making.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
