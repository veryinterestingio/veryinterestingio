		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The electrons in electricity are not like gasoline in an engine, they are more like water in a water wheel. Their movement provides the power but they aren't consumed in the process. There needs to be a return path (or a path to ground) in order for them to flow because they can't just bunch up at the other end. Like the water in a dam which is let over a water wheel to drive it, the electrons flowing are used to do work and the energy is derived from the greater potential of their arrangement being released, not because they are themselves a &quot;fuel&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Go to the mall, and step on an escalator.  You can go up, and the stairs don't disappear!  Just like electricity in a circuit, the stairs go around and around -- and give you potential energy, without burning up the stairs.  It is the motion of the stairs that matters, just like it is the flow of the electricity that matters (and not the fact that it goes in a circle).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the same as how Waterwheels can be turned at a waterfall, but we don't lose any water. The water didn't get used but rather the energy that was used was from the fact that it was flowing. Water can't power a Waterwheel once it's reached the ground and stopped flowing.</p>
<p>Electricity is similar, we aren't using up electrons but rather setting up a situation where electrons flow through a circuit. And similar to the Waterwheel example the electrons stop powering things once they've reached the ground.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The electrons themselves don't really get used up. But as they pass through the filament of the light, which has a really high resistance, they move really fast, and basically smash into all the atoms of the filament. This causes the filament to heat up as the atoms vibrate faster and faster (heat basically increases as atoms move faster), which themselves bump into atoms in the air and what not, transferring energy around through heat. Additionally, these atoms also have bound electrons that aren't traveling in the electric current, and the extra heat energy can cause them to jump up to a higher energy state (electrons exist in energy state, sort of like levels of a building to really eli5 it). When they move back down to a lower energy state, a photon is released (sounds weird but again for eli5 it basically pops into existence). The release of photons is again energy transferred, this time from heat to visible light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to these beautiful answers, there are two types of currents. Alternating and direct. The one in your home wall socket is most likely alternating. </p>
<p>In that case the electrons do not go back into your socket, they go back and forth at either 50 or 60 times a second, depending on where you live.</p>
<p>Current from batteries is the one that flows in a circuit. Regardless of the type of current, the circuit must be closed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
