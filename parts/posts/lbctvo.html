He explained that when we fall asleep very rapidly our brain has the same reaction as when we fall and causes us to instinctively reflex to try and prevent the fall.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something interesting about these “jerks” is that once you are able to sleep through them, that is when your body is finally truly asleep. </p>
<p>If you have a baby (or toddler/child) who has trouble falling and staying asleep, it’s recommended to hold them until they jerk. Once they are finished jerking (especially with babies and kids, the jerking can last for a few minutes) you can finally put them down in their crib/bed without worrying about waking them. This was the trick I LIVED by until my baby was about 3. Otherwise he would wake up the second you put him down and you’d have to start the whole process over.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
