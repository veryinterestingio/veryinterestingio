		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most meat that we buy from the supermarket comes from vertebrate animals (ie animals with a spine and bones).</p>
<p>Squid however, are a type of invertebrate animals that don't have bones like vertebrates do (except a beak). This means that a squid's flesh has to function for movement and for structure, where a vertebrate animal's flesh only has to provide movement because bones provide structure. As such, a squid's flesh is different from a vertebrate animal's flesh and therefore can have a &quot;chewier&quot; and more &quot;rubbery&quot; feeling when we eat it.</p>
<p>Edit: spelling and phrasing. Thank you to all the culinary experts for pointing out that indeed, squid meat is only rubbery when overcooked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It might not fully explain it but its worth noting that Cephalopods (the family containing Squid, Octopuses and Cuttlefish), split off into their own evolutionary tree at a very early point, long before the development of any sort of complex nervous system or a lot of other things we would consider &quot;normal&quot; for an animal such as vision.</p>
<p>They are so far removed from most other animals that they're a pretty good example of what intelligent alien life could look like. </p>
<p>Probably a pretty good reason why they taste a bit different to anything else ;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you mean beef, pork, chicken or fish when you say &quot;meat&quot; then the reason why squid (and all cephalopods) is so different is that when we eat beef, pork, and chicken we are strictly eating the muscle tissue of those animals. </p>
<p>When we eat squids (and octopuses) we are eating the actual, entire body of the animal or when it comes to the arms the entire arm.  </p>
<p>What muscle tissue we do eat is embedded in a tissue matrix that is the rough equivalent of the skin, gristle, nerves, fatty tissue and collagen of land animals most of which we do NOT eat when we eat their meat.</p>
<p>Additionally, because they are boneless a much larger percentage of their tissue is made up of things like collagen in order to give their bodies the flexibility and strength they need without having bones.</p>
<p>As a result, the percentage of muscle that makes up what you are eating when you eat a squid is much, much smaller than it is in other meats which often are close to 100% muscle tissue. </p>
<p>That fact is what makes squid &quot;meat&quot; very different from the meat of other animals we eat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
