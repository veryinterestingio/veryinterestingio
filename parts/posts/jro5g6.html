		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not really a meaningful distinction. Tunneling is just the fact that quantum mechanics allows wavefunctions to be nonzero in regions of space which should be inaccessible to the particle according to classical mechanics.</p>
<p>It's not inherently a time-dependent process, although it can be. But even if you just consider stationary states, the wavefunction is still nonzero in certain regions of space, and that would still be called &quot;tunneling&quot;, even though it's not really a particle &quot;moving&quot; from one place to another.</p>
<p>And anyway, elementary particles are fundamentally identical to other particles of the same type. To say that an electron &quot;becomes a different electron&quot; is not meaningful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electrons are indistinguishable particles, meaning that there is no possible way of telling two electrons apart; they are identical in every way. When electrons are described with maths, special care has to be taken to ensure nothing changes in any measurable way if two electrons are swapped. In a bit more detail, fermions must have &quot;antisymmetric&quot; wave functions and bosoms must have &quot;symmetric&quot; wave functions.</p>
<p>That being said, in the case of tunnelling, the electron doesn't initially have a position; its position is described by a probability distribution (wave function) over space, with the highest probability being on the side it was last measured and the lower probability being on the other side. It does not &quot;choose&quot; a position until it is measured, at which point that wavefunction collapses and all the probability is now at the point it was measured.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
