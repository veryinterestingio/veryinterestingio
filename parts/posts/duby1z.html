		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few years ago my physics-chemistry teacher asked my class which of the 4 basic forces of nature was the strongest. I answered Gravity because of black holes. They are gravity at its maximum, and them being the most powerful things in the universe, it made sense to me that gravity would also be the strongest. However he corrected me and said it was actually the strong nuclear force the most powerful and that gravity was actually the weakest. </p>
<p>So my question is: if strong and weak nuclear forces are technically more powerful than gravity, how can neutron stars come to exist? How can gravity overcome nuclear forces and start fusing the atoms in the core of the stars together in ways that are not &quot;natural&quot;?</p>
<p>(I only know the very basics of what happens to create a neutron star, so if I'm saying something wrong, please feel free to correct me)</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, your teacher is correct.</p>
<p>The reason why gravity seems to be the strongest over large length scales is that the strong and weak forces have very short ranges (~ 10^(-15) and 10^(-18) meters, respectively), and electrostatic forces tend to cancel each other out when you have material that is macroscopically neutrally charged.</p>
<p>So for material which extends over a large region of space, and has no net charge, gravity tends to dominate. That's why gravity is a very important force for astronomy/astrophysics/cosmology, but it's totally irrelevant for things like atomic/nuclear physics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A teacher once pointed out to me that if you jump off a building and gravity accelerated you for 100 stories, the <del>nuclear</del> electromagnetic force holding the concrete together would stop you in less than an inch. That helped me grasp how much stronger nuclear forces are in an analogy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You need the gravitational attraction of a whole star or stellar remnant with its over 10^55 atoms to get enough pressure for nuclear reactions.</p>
<p>If the strong interaction would have a larger range then the force between two elementary particles would be enough to lift up a whole car.</p>
<p>If you could magically remove one out of 10^17 electrons on Earth the resulting tiny imbalance in electric charge would be sufficient to make Earth explode - against the gravitational attraction.</p>
<p>Gravity dominates on large scales only because its range is not limited and because there is only a single type of charge - the more stuff you accumulate the stronger gravity gets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think &quot;which force is the strongest&quot; is actually an ill-posed question. A better question would be: &quot;normalizing for the masses, charges, distances, and other properties of the particles involved, which force is the strongest?&quot; Once you do all those things, the relative strengths of the forces becomes a trivial comparison of scalar coefficients.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
