		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, maybe. There are a couple of strains that there have been zero reported cases of and scientists think they may have gone extinct.  Which is good news for flu shot makers because they just hope they are right about which strains they develop vaccines for months in advance of flu season.  Fewer types of flu strains means they will have higher likelihood of picking the correct strains to vaccinate against.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The flu viruses generally have animal reservoirs. Things like bird flu and swine flu are named as such because those are the animals they cross over to humans from. For this reason they will come back once people stop with the various protection measures we are currently using.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
