		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All of this is from <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/why-wintergreen-lifesavers-spark-in-the-dark-602179" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>Triboluminescence is light produced while striking or rubbing two pieces of a special material together. It is basically light from friction, as the term comes from the Greek tribein, meaning &quot;to rub,&quot; and the Latin prefix lumin, meaning &quot;light&quot;. In general, luminescence occurs when energy is input into atoms from heat, friction, electricity, or other sources. The electrons in the atom absorb this energy. When the electrons return to their usual state, the energy is released in the form of light.</p>
<p>The spectrum of the light produced from the triboluminescence of sugar (sucrose) is the same as the spectrum of lightning. Lightning originates from a flow of electrons passing through the air, exciting the electrons of nitrogen molecules (the primary component of air), which emit blue light as they release their energy. Triboluminescence of sugar can be thought of as lightning on a very small scale. When a sugar crystal is stressed, the positive and negative charges in the crystal are separated, generating an electric potential. When enough charge has accumulated, the electrons jump across a fracture in the crystal, colliding with â€‹exciting electrons in the nitrogen molecules. Most of the light emitted by the nitrogen in the air is ultraviolet, but a small fraction is in the visible region. To most people, the emission appears bluish-white, although some people discern a blue-green color (human color vision in the dark is not very good).</p>
<p>The emission from wintergreen candy is much brighter than that of sucrose alone because wintergreen flavor (methyl salicylate) is fluorescent. Methyl salicylate absorbs ultraviolet light in the same spectral region as the lightning emissions generated by the sugar. The methyl salicylate electrons become excited and emit blue light. Much more of the wintergreen emission than the original sugar emission is in the visible region of the spectrum, so wintergreen light seems brighter than sucrose light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I can read, it is caused by electrical charges being separated in the breaking process(atoms being separated from some of its electrons). This causes potential build-ups which in turn causes the electrical arcing observed.</p>
<p>Basically it seems like &quot;static electrical buildups&quot; caused by the breaking of the crystals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
