Last night my partner and I went out into the desert to stargaze, and when there were no cars nearby, we both experienced a constant quiet noise. It's a hard noise to describe--not a ringing or a whooshing noise, but almost a pulsating kind of noise. Is it the sound of blood going through your ears? Brain making up noises to fill the gaps?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's what you sound like. Not just blood but your organs, gasses trapped inside you, your bodily processes at work. These sounds are always present but are drowned out or unfocused on because of all the stimulation of the outside world. But once there's nothing left to distract you, you finally hear...yourself. And that's when you realize silence will never truly exist for you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, either tinnitus, or sounds from your own body - the blood moving inside you, your own heart, the sounds of yourself breathing. </p>
<p>The structure of bones in your ears have muscles that contract to limit the amount of sound that enters your ears. In very quiet environments they fully relax, and it is surprising how much you can hear when they do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
