Just like any muscle, they begin to hurt after constant use, until we rest them.</p>
<p>5 explanation:  Stand up and hold your arm out straight in front of you.  Keep doing it.  Keep going.  Is it beginning to hurt?  That's what your eyelid does when it's open all day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The eye is a very complicated structure when you consider that it has to be crystal clear to let light through. </p>
<p>The only way to make it transparent is to have as little cells as possible in the lights path. But that comes with a new problem: how do you feed those cells and keep the eyeball moist and clean? In the rest of your body, blood vessels take care of that but if you did that in the eye you’d see red trees everywhere. </p>
<p>Your eye relies on peripheral cells pumping fluid into it and circulating that fluid inside the eyeball to feed the cells of the surface of your eye. The constant pumping requires quite some energy, and when that energy depletes, your eyes get dry. Your body tries to compensate by making you blink more to spread the little bit of fluid it has over your whole eye, but it’s not enough, and your body wants to close your eyes so the eyelids can keep your eyes moist</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Here is a possible explanation.</strong> (Please apologize my english, I'm not a native speaker)</p>
<p>Your autonomic nervous system can be divided in sympathetic (Fight &amp; Flight) and parasympathetic (Rest &amp; Digest).</p>
<p>Mostly, those 2 parts of that nervous system act as counterparts - when one is more active, the other one is less active, they cannot both be &quot;much&quot; active at the same time.</p>
<p>When you're tired, your parasympathetic nervous system, which helps activate everything you need for &quot;rest&quot;, becomes more active, and the sympathetic one becomes less active.</p>
<p>There is sympathetic nerves that go from your spine all the way through your chest up to your eyes. They control how much tension some muscles around your eyes have. It is needed for high activity and when you focus, the symapthetic nerves make sure your eyes and pupils are wide open and can receive important info fast (evolutionary-like: where is the wild animal coming from or going, etc).</p>
<p><strong>When you're tired, the sympathetic nerves are less active, causing your pupil to constrict, your eyelids drop and even your eyeball sinks a bit deeper into your skull.</strong></p>
<p>There is even a syndrome, where those sympathetic nerves are cut, called Horner-Syndrome. The patients have exactly what i described above, but more extreme (because the sympathetic nervous system is still to some part active in us healthy humans, it's never 0% active, but in those patients it is cut off). They have <strong><em>constricted pupils</em></strong> <em>(=Miosis),</em> <strong><em>hanging eyelids</em></strong> <em>(=Ptosis)</em> and <strong><em>eyeballs sinking in</em></strong> <em>(=Enophthalmus).</em> Those patients always have one eye that &quot;looks tired&quot;.</p>
