		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, a lot to address here. So a male chicken is a rooster and a female chicken is a hen. Hens do not need to mate to produce eggs. A hen will produce eggs regardless. Unfertilized eggs contain no embryos and so no chicken will ever grow from them. The eggs we buy in grocery stores are almost always unfertilized. If a hen and a rooster mate, those eggs will be fertilized, and thus will hatch chickens if cared for. Hens, like humans, have ovaries that produce eggs. They start off small and soft, and as they pass through a long tube called the oviduct, they get larger and develop their hard shell, which is just calcite (a mineral of calcium). Unlike humans, chickens have a single hole for both removing waste and for reproduction, called a cloaca. The oviduct terminates into the cloaca, and the hen then pushes the egg out from there. As for how they do it so fast, it's because the breeds of chickens that are used for egg production have been bred to produce eggs as fast as possible</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
