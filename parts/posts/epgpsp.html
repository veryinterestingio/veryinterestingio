		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The don't magically connect, a surgeon does this through painstaking microsurgery on the affected nerve via tiny stitches and glues. As there are limitations to the size of nerve which can be repaired as well as limited capacity for nerves to heal back together once brought the ends are joined, there is often loss of sensation and motor function though major functions can be restored in some cases.</p>
<p>Also some of the major nerves are probably waaayyyy bigger than you think. I was shocked when I started anatomy for the first time and saw them. The sciatic nerve which runs down the back of your leg from your lumbosacral spine is the biggest and is about the width of your index finger! Obviously the smaller branches can be much much finer than this.</p>

<p>EDIT: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mrsfluffles/" target="_blank">mrsfluffles</a> reply re: fingers specifically is true. The fingers are moved by muscles in the forearm with minor contribution by some muscles in the hand for some movements. </p>
<p>I was commenting on the reattachment of nerves in general.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For fingers: the nerve in the finger is called the digital nerve, and it only controls sensation in your fingers, not movement. The muscles in your forearm have tendons that go down to your fingers, which is what controls the movement in your fingers. Try clenching your fist, you will notice the muscles in your forearm moving. If the surgeon attaches the finger and repairs the tendons (without complications), you'll be able to move your fingers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had a nerve reattached in my wrist ten years ago, and the surgery is only 20% of the process. I still needed  months of physical therapy and electrical stimulation to regain control of my fingers. I have it to maybe 80% functionality now and that's the ceiling. If you just stitch it up and do nothing else, you'll end up with a shriveled limb that is of no use.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both nerves and tendons are simply repaired with sutures. Tendons use larger sutures which have more robust knots to allow movement right away. Nerves are repaired with smaller, simpler sutures with the aim to just grab the outside or ‘epineurium’ of the nerve. The digital nerves are easy enough to see but preferably you should repair them with magnified glasses called Loupes. The ‘control’ of the finger comes back right away once the tendon is plugged back together, but nerves won’t regrow for some time and it can take months to recover your sensation, if at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
