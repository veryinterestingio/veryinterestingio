		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a Medical Laboratory Scientist, and lots of my schooling revolved around learning a shitload about immunology. So this is going to be more like ELI18, because the human immune system is wack. Wall of text warning and I can't TL;DR this. Please anyone who reads an inaccuracy or inconsistency correct me. Also I wrote this on my phone and it took a long time so I hope it helps.</p>
<p>So there's different reasons for the various things you mentioned. Let's start with lactose, which is a sugar that needs to be broken down by an enzyme called lactase into glucose and galactose in order to be absorbed by the intestines. </p>
<p>Some people do not produce sufficient quantities to break down the sugar, however bacteria in your gut <em>are</em> able to metabolize lactose, and their consumption of it causes a fermentation reaction, which is the cause of the signs and symptoms of lactose intolerance.</p>
<p>So this is an enzymatic insufficiency.</p>
<p>Gluten intolerance is a complex spectrum of disorders, lots of scientific debate is still ongoing to better understand. </p>
<p>Coeliac's disease is understood to be an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders are diseases where <em>your</em> body makes antibodies against your own tissues by failing a process that classifies things as yourself or foreign. In Coeliac's your body damages your intestines because of a reaction to gluten. This causes you to be unable to absorb nutrients</p>
<p>So when your immune system &quot;sees&quot; something as a threat it makes antibodies that bind to the &quot;enemy&quot;. </p>
<p>How does it do this? An antibody is a protein made by your immune system to bind in a &quot;lock and key&quot; fashion to proteins on the surface of threats known as antigens. This binding causes a cascade of various responses from other elements of your immune system.</p>
<p>Part of which is the inflammatory response, which is managed by a type immune cell called t-cells, their destructive processes damage the villi in the intestine.</p>
<p>Other allergies such as shellfish, peanuts, or anything like that, is caused by an over reaction by a class or immune antibodies known as IgE antibodies. There are five common classes of immune antibodies IgA, IgG, IgM, and IgE.</p>
<p>IgE is known to be the antibody that's most heavily involved in allergic reactions, causing a cascade of cellular and chemical responses. This can cause a variety of things to happen, like hives, rash, itching, or even anaphylaxis. Once again a protein on the surface of some food you've eaten is perceived as a threat.</p>
<p>Each consecutive exposure causes increasing overreaction by your immune system.</p>
<p>As for why this happens more as you get older, it could be sample bias, it could be repeat exposure that wasn't initially severe enough to be noticable, or changes in your immune system, natural over the top allergies. </p>
<p>Also people who develop an autoimmune disease are at an increased probability to develop another autoimmune disease.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I binge drank a ton of beer one day, and had a stomach ache, diarrhea and fatigue that lasted like 7 years. It was like a 7 year hangover. I thought I just fucked myself up permanently, until I did some research and tried a gluten free diet and it completely changed my life!</p>
<p>In my case, it kinda makes sense, you binge drink a poison and your body learns to hate the poison.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body has a rulebook called DNA. This rulebook has certain timers built into it. Because of these timers we grow when we're little and stop growing when we hit our early 20s. Lactose is a sugar found in milk. Our body mostly needed it when we were breastfed, but not once we grew up. So to be efficient, our body stops making it easy to digest Lactose at an age that we no longer consume it/have access to maternal milk</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>1) Partly because when we are young we have little controll over what we eat. We all had that one kid inour class who would throw up at the drop of a hat. As these kids grow older and become in controll of what they eat they realize that they may have low level alergies and intolerances.</p>
<p>2) In terms of gluten intolerance or an allergy to foods there is also your immune system at play. Our immune system is really good at destroying things that could harm us like bacteria, viruses, and other bad things. Our immune system is so powerful that when it messes up it can actually harm a person more than help them. Two common ways our immune systems harm us is in the form of <strong>allergies</strong> and <strong>auto-immune disease</strong>. Both of these frequently develop or worsen with age.</p>
<p>An allergy is when our body kicks into attack mode against something that isnt dangerous like pollen or peanuts. Attack mode means swelling and heating up so the immune system can do its job. In mild cases your body itches, but in dangerous cases your body swells. Every time your body is exposed to something you are allergic to there is a chance that the reaction will be worse than last time. so a kid who has a mild egg allergy as a kid might become deathly allergic in adulthood.</p>
<p>An auto-immmune disease means that your body accidentially creates weapons against itself. These weapons are antibodies. When your body is exposed to a new type of virus or bacteria or immune system, through trial and error, develops a specific type of antibody that can destroy it. Sometimes, for reasons that science doesn't totally understand, our immune system might accidentally make antibodies that attack our own cells. Celiacs is the name of the auto immune disease that is triggered by gluten. Celiacs can develop at any point in life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I was diagnosed as a coeliac, the Dr explained that it was like male pattern baldness: the faulty gene is already in our DNA, but there's no way of knowing until the symptoms appear. It's just a ticking timebomb.</p>
<p>What makes coeliac disease even harder to diagnose is that it has dozens of unrelated symptoms, none of which are <em>guaranteed</em> to appear. </p>
<p>The only way to confirm coeliacs is to take a biopsy of the intestine, which is usually only used as a last resort. So someone could have been a full blown coeliac for years until they finally get the biopsy done (I had about 3 years of tests, which is actually pretty quick. I know people who were waiting 20+ years). </p>
<p>So, between faulty genes, and the length of time it takes to get diagnosed, you're likely to be aware of it much later in life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
