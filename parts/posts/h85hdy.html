		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically I was led to believe that catching on fire was going to be a pretty constant threat during adult life. Teaching us what to do when we found ourselves on fire was a higher priority than a large number of actually critical life skills accessible to young children. I was 25 before someone bothered to teach me how to recognize the signs of abusive behavior, but I was ready to survive a clothing fire before I graduated from Kindergarten. Poor mental health and suicide? Crippling debt from financial illiteracy? Eh, those problems will work themselves out so long as we keep these highly combustible youngsters safe from the <em>real</em> danger!</p>
<p>I have not, to date, been on fire. I have never met someone who has been on fire. I've never read a newspaper article about a person who found themselves on fire. I have never seen a person catch fire, for any reason, in real life. I can only assume there was a reason for this focus on stop, drop, and roll. There must have been a time when kids were just bursting into flames left and right, until parents pushed schools to implement an aggressive anti-fire policy. Is this real? Did our grandparents' generation sit around the kitchen table, shake there heads, and say &quot;Lost another one today. Burnt to cinders, he did.&quot;?</p>
<p>Basically, what is the history of this initiative, and was it ever essential enough to warrant its current prominence?</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks everyone for contributing to this wonderful discussion. I've learned a lot here today. First, I learned that many of you have caught fire. Multiple times. Like, an alarming number of you. Second, I learned that I hate fire safety, and want it removed from schools, to be replaced by Quickbooks tutorial sessions or something. I had no idea I believed something so stupid, so I really must thank you all for setting me straight on that issue. Finally, I learned that the high priority of stop, drop, and roll training happens because, yes, we did once live in a world made of crepe paper and lighter fluid. Toasters were ungrounded, smokers happily flicked ashes onto davenports, and pajamas were made of a type of sawdust called rayon. Bless you, Dick Van Dyke, and bless you, friendly schoolroom fire fighter. But most of all, bless you whoever decided that the 50s was a fucking terrible idea and we should just put a third prong on our electrical plugs like not-insane people.</p></div></div>

<p>Before that, the early 50s had enough instances of clothes burning people, that the Flammable Fabrics Act of 1953 was passed.</p>
<p>Between those, someone came up with the catchy phrase.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was at my Indian friend's wedding and her sister's back caught fire while lighting candles. She started running around screaming and her American friend who instantly thought &quot;stop drop and roll&quot; tackled her and rolled her out. Managed to put her out before her hair caught on fire and she &quot;only&quot; needed grafts on her back.  But yes,  I concede to your point:  my high school  life skills class was much more useful on a daily basis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My dad is a Pyrotechnician</p>
<p>Years ago some fireworks exploded during a show. </p>
<p>Fortunately as a Kid he was taught “Stop! Drop! And Roll!” When he was on fire. </p>
<p>He probably learned it as a kid 50 years prior. </p>
<p>Fortunately he escaped with minor burns and is still alive and kicking 15-20 years later. </p>
<p>Somethings are worth instilling in kids when they young where they stick with you for life. </p>
<p>Safety is one of those things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Along with “stop, drop, and roll” we were also taught to always sleep with your door closed, and when you wake up in the morning, touch the door to make sure that it isn’t hot. I went to sleep every night believing when I woke up in the morning my home would be on fire. Like TRULY believed this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
