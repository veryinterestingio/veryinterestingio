<p>The way it was explained to me is that the copper contacts can develop a thin oxide coating that changed the electrical characteristics of the connection. The sudden jolt or vibration would cause the contacts to rub together and scrape off some of the oxide coating.</p>
<p>The modern day equivalent is removing and reinserting parts (CPU, memory modules, expansion cards, etc) since jolting hard disk drives is a recipe for disaster. That said, it's also less necessary now since many of these contacts have a thin coating of gold which won't oxidize.</p>
<p>Incidentally, percussive maintenance can also be useful for mechanical devices where parts that should move against each other can get stuck together when allowed to sit for a while.</p>
<p>Edit: also what /u/finster009 and /u/pbmadman wrote.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The Atari 520 ST was famous for having socketed chips that would work their way up and out of the socket due to cycles of expansion caused by heating and cooling, eventually causing the machine to &quot;fail&quot;.   </p>
<p>A solution - not a great one - but a solution that often worked, was to hold the entire machine about 11-18&quot; above the desk surface and drop it. The compression of the keyboard slamming down on the chips beneath them would push them back into the socket, temporarily &quot;fixing&quot; the problem. It was called the &quot;Atari ST drop test&quot;.   </p>
<p>Likewise, early Mac Classics had a logic board at a 90 degree angle to the mainboard that had soldered connections between the two PCBs. Cooling and heating cycles would cause tiny hairline fractures to form in the &quot;cold solder joints&quot; until eventually the system would fail until you reflowed those cold solder joints.   </p>
<p>At Intel in the early 2000's, I had a production downtime even in the data center. We had to give status updates to a distro list as we progressed with the troubleshooting and resolution. At one point, at about 3:45 AM, after having worked on the machine since about 8 the previous evening, I sent out an update - lost in pages and pages of updates, that said, &quot;beat server, kicked server, cursed at server, curled into fetal position and cried myself to sleep. Woke from nap on DC floor, trouble persists.&quot;   </p>
<p>A manager responded within 5 minutes, &quot;Percussive maintenance - sometimes it works, but it often makes you feel better.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
