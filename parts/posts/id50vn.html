		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've noticed that if there's a mosquito in the room, and I swat at it but fail to kill it, it usually seems to disappear for about 30 minutes before it tries to come after me again.</p>
<p>I'm curious how programmed or predictable mosquito behaviors are. For example, does it actually have a behavior like &quot;if swatted at, lay low for 30 minutes before trying again?&quot; Or am I just imagining the correlation? Second, if they do have a &quot;hide&quot; behavior, do they choose predictable locations? Do they prefer corners of the room? Areas with less light (do they even use light in making their decisions)? Do they go low to the ground? High on the ceiling? Do they use air currents and calmness to choose a spot?</p>
<p>It seems like I usually find mosquitos hiding out in a shadowy corner near the floor of the room, which is infuriating because if it would just hang out in the open against the white, well-lit wall, it would be a lot easier to hunt them down. This correlation could definitely just be my own confirmation bias at play, though, so I'm curious if much is known on this topic.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thank you for the lovely replies so far! I just wanted to clarify that I'm not actually that interested in *where* mosquitos hide in a descriptive sense, I'm more interested in how and &quot;why&quot; they make their decisions... like which senses do they use most (vision, smell, touch), and do they actually have different phases like hunting vs. hiding, or are they just sort of always doing the same thing and flying around aimlessly until they detect prey, then go for an attack?</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Well this post blew up! You may notice that it's a bit of a comment graveyard... sorry but askscience has strict commenting policies and the mods had to remove most of the replies. The vast majority of replies were either 1) personal tips for hunting mosquitoes, or 2) personal anecdotes on where mosquitoes hide. </p>
<p>Precisely one comment linked to an actual scientific research article (thank you /u/Hillsbottom!) showing that at the very least mosquitoes can learn to associate being swatted at with certain chemical odors, and then avoid the source of those odors (people) in the future.</p>
<p>I didn't feel satisfied so I spent a few hours trawling the literature... turns out there's simply no research on this topic! We know a great deal about mosquito hunting behavior and how it finds its target, but seemingly nothing on hiding behavior. It's not even clear whether there exists a &quot;hiding&quot; behavioral program, or if they're just sort of always on the hunt and are just updating their attraction/aversion biases in response to swats, etc. </p>
<p>However, after reading up on it I do think it's safe to say that the majority of the hunting/hiding behaviors are instinctual and not learned. It turns out adult mosquitoes are only alive and hunting for \~2-4 days before they stop and spend several days digesting + laying eggs (they typically repeat this hunt/rest cycle \~3-4 times before they die). Furthermore, a mosquito can collect all the blood it needs in one meal if left undisturbed, so in reality it typically only feeds on 1-5 people before stopping. Therefore, even though to us it seems like mosquitoes are constantly present and attacking us, from a single mosquito's perspective it may only ever encounter a few humans (less than 10) in its life cycle, and over the course of only a few days. That isn't a lot of data for the mosquito to &quot;learn&quot; with. So, if the possible answers to my original question are 1) it's random, 2) they have instinct-driven preferences for hiding, with a lot of variation between regions/species, or 3) they learn where to hide from experience, we can probably rule out #3.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a wealth of research on mosquito behaviour but mostly in relation to the ones that spread diseases. </p>
<p>This paper:  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/blog/post/mosquitos-learn-to-avoid-people-whove-swatted-at-them" target="_blank">https://www.researchgate.net/blog/post/mosquitos-learn-to-avoid-people-whove-swatted-at-them</a> shows that they 'learn' to avoided being swatted. From the article 'the insects’ ability to associate the smell of a specific human with the vibration of a swat may be a factor'.</p>
<p>In terms of resting it all depends on the species of mosquito. There has been a lot of research looking at the resting and feeding behaviour of the mosquitoes, mostly in relation to malaria prevention.</p>
<p>It can divided into two categories. An endophilic mosquito is one that rests indoors, inside a human dwelling, and an exophillic one is one that's rest outside. You also get some that will only bite outside and some that only bite inside.</p>
<p>I am unaware of any research about whether they always rest in the same place but my gut feeling is they don't. However asian tiger mosquitoes tend to hide in dark corners and behind furniture to avoid being seen.</p>
<p>EDIT 1
Update:
I am a mosquito biologist but i didn't have time to find and cite more sources. I love how much interest this question has raised! </p>
<p>Behavioural research into mosquitoes has huge gaps especially when you go beyond the species that don't spread malaria. Much of it is based on host preferences </p>
<p>Most mosquitoes do live short fast lives however some species in colder climate will overwinter. Here is a link the a paper on culex pipiens (common house mosquito) <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21476444/" target="_blank">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21476444/</a>. How they pick their locations as far as I can see is unkown.</p>
<p>Resting behaviour is important in working out out effective mosquito nets and indoor residual spraying is ( this is where you spray an insecticide on walls and when the mosquito land it picks up some of it an dies). This paper  <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23427653/" target="_blank">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23427653/</a> showa Aedes mosquitoes do have a preference to things like the colour of mosquito bed nets and horizontal versus vertical surface when it comes to resting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While we’re on this topic, why mosquitoes have to have such an awful fly-pitch? Like why does the single most annoying insect also produces the most annoying sound? Even flies aren't that bad.  </p>
<p>P.S. One might argue that me thinking that mosquito’s pitch is the most annoying is a result of another bias, where associating this sound with a negative event makes the sound itself negative, but I'd say mosquitos sound awful pretty objectively.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Strangely black and white striped surfaces do hinder their landing pattern. Zebra stripes are a natural mosquito repellent. <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/02/zebra-stripes-confuse-biting-flies-causing-them-abort-their-landings#" target="_blank">science mag article</a></p>
