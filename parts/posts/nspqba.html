		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The outermost layer of your skin is primarily dead cells. It's a very thin but very effective plating of armor that is constantly getting worn away by the environment, but it's getting replaced from underneath just as fast as it wears away, if not faster.</p>
<p>Those dead cells keep growing into the same paterns (AKA your fingerprints) because they're growing in the same pattern as the deeper layers of your skin. That underlying skin stays relatively unchanged since the outer layers protect it. If you manage to damage these layers from severe burns, corrosive chemical exposure, or deep flesh wounding, you <em>can</em> permanently alter or even destroy your fingerprints. But common activities practically never make it past the outer layer, so in most situations fingerprints will always grow in the same pattern across your entire life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work for a company that installed fingerprint readers in hospitals.  Part of my job was walking hundreds of nurses through putting their finger or thumb down on the reader and associating it with their login ID.  Most nurses in their 30s and older had such smooth fingerprints from repeated hand washing that that their prints could not be recognized by the reader.  Thumb prints were less likely to be unreadable so we could often use those.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to elaborate on the other answer, it's the dermal layer of skin that contains the blueprint. The epidermis is the part you see and the &quot;dead skin&quot; which gets old and wrinkly. There are changes with time to skin flexibility but the blueprint remains the same</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I nearly successfully guilltoned my finger, and my fingerprint was altered with the injury, certainly. It was a bad injury. Permanent nail bed damage on the other side too. </p>
<p>Despite all, the original fingerprint has made some of its way back after about 5 years, which I was amazed at. </p>
<p>Where it was really bad, my print is definitely going to stay altered. But it's trying to be normal as best as it can.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
