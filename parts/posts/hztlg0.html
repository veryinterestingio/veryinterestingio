		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A Buddhist would completely dismiss this question. This question is unknowable and Buddhism does not consider unknowable questions. Buddhism also does not acknowledge the existence of a 'self' or an individual identity at all. Zen Buddhism in particular teaches that all things are Buddha nature. Rock, tree, person, cat are Buddha nature. There is no self, there is only Buddha nature. If you're interested in more about this let me know, it will get very long. These kinds of concepts in Buddhism tend to be difficult for Westerners to understand. </p>
<p>Thinking really hard back on my studies and I do not think that Shintoism even addresses this concept. Shinto barely even address the afterlife and, like Japanese Buddhism is far more concerned with the &quot;now.&quot;</p>
<p>Christianity believes the soul is created by God. When exactly this occurs is hotly debated. Some say at conception, some say at first breath, some say when the fetus becomes viable outside the womb, some say at moment of birth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a very outdated belief but one I nonetheless found humurous and interesting: back before cells and developmental biology were much understood, a popular notion held that a sperm was a microscopic human being. These humans, or homunculi, were already fully formed and only had to grow in size in order to be born. Neat solution to many mysteries of conception! </p>
<p>A proposed problem with this idea was that if these homunculi were fully formed and only different from an adult in size, they might contain sperm themselves, leading to an chain of homunculi &quot;all the way down.&quot; However, many people had no problem with this objection, as it neatly explained how in Adam &quot;all had sinned.&quot; The whole human race was existing and already in Adam's loins! </p>
<p>So for one brief period in history it may not have been unusual for a Christian to believe that he was created simultaneously with Adam and has spent all the generations before his birth just intermittently increasing in size. Shedding layer after layer of paternal ancestors until, finally, they got their turn.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading in one of Plato's works that he believed in our eternal existence. Human souls existed in a perfect world where they knew <em>everything</em> and had to learn all of it anew here on Earth.</p>
<p>In Hinduism, I think most sub-religions talk about reincarnation, always existing in one form or the other.</p>
<p>In Islam, they believe that all souls were created in adult form at the same time as Adam and have been or will be born at some point on Earth as well. So I suppose they exist in the spiritual world as they wait.</p>
<p>You may be interested in Bahai Faith, as they have a four-dimensional explanation to pre-existence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can only truly speak for Catholicism, and I presume by extension all trinitarian Christianity, excluding Mormonism and pseudo-christian cults. In the Roman Catholic Church, the human nature is a unity of spirit: soul and body together. As it is written in Genesis, the Lord God formed man from dust of the earth and breathed into his nostrils the breath of the spirit. This affirms our nature as spiritual beings (i.e. religious beings created with ability for compatible union with God and knowledge of His creation) comprised of a unity of earthly body and spiritual soul. This may be contrasted to Angels (good and evil) who are purely spirit with no material body, or animals who are not spiritual beings, but may or may not have a soul (that gets into more nuanced and less on-topic theology, although Christ has reconciled all things to Himself, so it's possible ALL created beings have a soul). It is believed that at the moment of conception, God immediately creates a new soul that forms the consciousness and free will of the person, and this is the part that carries on into the afterlife when the physical body dies. Creation of the soul by God is not to be conflated with generation by the parents, it is a miraculous outcome of divine intervention and not a mere biological characteristic.</p>
<p>You may be interested in Tibetan Buddhism. Take the following with a grain of salt, I'm not Buddhist and dare not claim authority of the dhamma. In the book commonly called in the West, &quot;The Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot;, there is explained the state of Bardo. The Bardo in it's gross form is the state of consciousness in between incarnations, but can be further refined to the state of non-attachment that occurs between moments of perception. Think of it as the void between thoughts, if you like. Consciousness has no real &quot;beginning&quot; in Buddhism, as I understand, it just sort of arises and is dependent on the conditions around it. The neat thing about the Tibetan Book of the Dead is that it has several chapters on the types of beings, experiences, emotions, and thoughts encountered in the Bardo and what to do when you encounter them in order to either attain enlightenment after death, or an incarnation conducive to enlightenment when you are reborn (which is the moment a living infant exits the &quot;door of the womb&quot;, if I remember correctly, and it has instructions for how to pick your future parents!)</p>
<p>Final note: Plato theorized that all human souls came into existence before the creation of all physical matter; Islam states that all souls were created with the creation of Adam and come into existence at a time pre-determined by Allah with no memory of being in Heaven; and Judaism is all over the place concerning the soul, or lack thereof, and the state of prelife, or lack thereof, if you want to go down that Rabbi hole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
