		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ooh! Ooh! I actually do this as part of my job!</p>
<p>Most airports have a Wildlife Management Program which identifies what sort of wildlife is in the vicinity throughout the year.</p>
<p>Airports are very attractive places for a great number of animals because they offer food, shelter, water and there are few to no natural predators. So you have to manage the animals that naturally exist (like turtles, raccoons, skunks, foxes, hawks, frogs, etc.) and then make the airfield an unattractive place for migratory birds and larger birds that want to nest like geese and ducks.</p>
<p>Our primary way of nudging unwanted birds away is with scare cartridges fired from modified starter pistols. They go off like small fireworks and make a lot of noise, and we fire off several to get the birds in the air and away form the traffic areas.</p>
<p>We also deal with the occasional deer or coyote, and in that case we have to open various gates and herd the animal out with pickup trucks. Worst case scenario we have a shotgun, but it's very rare that it comes out. I've been doing it for 16 years and I've only ever used the gun twice in that time.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it's the airport maintenance department which has staff routinely checking problem areas for wildlife throughout the day, every day.</p>
<p><strong>edit</strong>: Wow! So many questions! I see Airport Ops as just another job, so I often forget that it's sort of a foreign world to a lot of people. Because so many people asked about the two times with the gun, I'll just say both time it was to put animals out of their misery after close encounters with aircraft. One was a young coyote that chased after a small Cessna and made contact with the prop. The other was a deer that got hit by a Cessna Citation Excel (medium-sized business jet) on its landing roll. The Excel took substantial damage to the leading edge and underside of the port wing. The deer was in very bad shape, but still alive.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the gun usually only comes out when Canada geese hunker down to nest in approach/departure areas and refuse to leave. Once we exhaust all our other humane options, we make the call and use the gun. It's not something we as professionals enjoy doing, and the optics and potential PR nightmare are definitely unappealing.</p>
<p><strong>edit 2</strong>: I want to thank everyone for the questions. I've tried to answer as many as I could (and I still am, but I'm at work and I have a bunch of things to do before I leave) but I'll add some extra information here because so many people have asked:</p>
<p>Q: How do you get this kind of job?</p>
<p>A: There isn't really a lot of formal education to work in Airport Operations. Aviation is what I call a <em>Passion Industry</em>, so most of the people working in it come in with a lot of knowledge, and that's a huge start because it's a super-complicated industry. There are various college-level courses in aviation management and aviation ground schools, as well as a smattering of related online courses, but no formal certificate. Experience has value here.</p>
<p>Operations generally look for people with a wide range of skills, primarily an airbrakes endorsement on your drivers licence for the heavy equipment, current first aid training and an interest in fire fighting is a plus. We tend to hire a lot of rural guys, because an airfield is sort of like a farm operation and country boys tend to work well across the entire platform of vehicles we run from agricultural tractors to high-speed snow blowers, they can easily handle the long hours in the equipment and they're natural problem-solvers when it comes to the type of property issues we have on an airfield.</p>
<p>Regular duties include regular runway inspection reports, escorting contractors, plowing snow, cutting grass, dealing with tenants, security issues, wildlife, landscaping, tours, education, ARFF fire fighting, building inspections, gate/fence/perimeter inspection, pavement repair, painting, the list goes on and on. It's a super-huge job with lots of responsibilities. Every airport is different too, so the job molds itself to whatever's required at whatever aerodrome you're working.</p>
<p><strong>edit 3</strong>: My shift wraps up soon. I want to genuinely thank everyone for their questions. This kind of behind-the-scenes job can feel a bit thankless and lonely sometimes, so it was a pleasure to talk to so many of you about my admittedly unusual career.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was researching invasive bird populations at a Hawaiian island, which overlapped with the area around an airport. It is definitely NOT naturally bird free and is actively managed as much as possible. It is federal land so a federal employee (usually fish &amp; wildlife) hangs out and manages the entire facility ( read manage = shoot). Everything is certified and deemed humane, and let me tell you, that guy was a damn good hunter so no creature suffered. He also was responsible for IDing the birds before so as to not kill any threatened or endangered ones. We actually used a lot of his catches for research, so nothing went to waste. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A variety of different methods are employed at different airports. Some airports actually used trained falcons to keep other birds away form runways. Others use drones or sirens to scare them away. Some try to use preventative measures by clearing plants around the airport that birds would use shelter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
