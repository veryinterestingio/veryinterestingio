A liquid mantle, he suggests, would be subject to tidal forces and we would be bombarded with daily earthquakes as Earth's innards shifted up and down.</p>
<p>Obviously the mantle is somewhat goopy, but I feel the Professor raises a point. So since the mantle is at least something not solid, is it subject to tidal forces, and how does that affect the Earth's crust?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Earths mantle is a solid, it is described as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheid" target="_blank">rheid</a>, i.e. it is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscoelasticity" target="_blank">viscoelastic solid</a> that is often is approximated as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscoelasticity#Maxwell_model" target="_blank">Maxwell material</a> that can flow on long time scales. While an imperfect analogy, you can think of this kind of like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_drop_experiment" target="_blank">pitch</a>, i.e. an extremely viscous material will appear solid even though it is flowing, just extremely slowly. As I said, this is an imperfect analogy as rocks are true solids at the surface and become rheids at elevated temperatures and pressures (unlike pitch, which is an extremely viscous fluid at ambient temperature and pressure), but gets the basic concept across. With reference to the mantle, we know that is solid because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-wave" target="_blank">S-waves</a> propagate through the mantle (as opposed to the outer core of the Earth, through which S-waves do not pass, which along with other observations indicate that the outer core is a liquid).</p>
<p>Going back to the original question, the solid earth does <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_tide" target="_blank">experience tides</a>. At the bottom of that wiki article, you can see that the magnitude of the surface movement caused by these tides is relatively small (10s to 100s of mms), but it is measurable by a variety of sensitive instruments and is accounted for in equipment/facilities that rely on very precise alignment over long distances (e.g. particle accelerators).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ocean tides are an effect of the moon's gravitational pull. But that gravitational force is not only exerted on just the water, it's exerted upon the <em>entire earth</em>. So it's also squeezing the earth itself, and indeed, the earth's crust moves or bulges accordingly. This is called an &quot;earth tide&quot; and, unlike the ocean tide, the effect is too negligible for us to notice with the naked eye.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of good answers here discuss the Earth experiencing tidal forces, but id like to bring up that we can observe this phenomenon in locations other than Earth.</p>
<p>Jupiters closest moon, Io, is tormented by tidal forces due to Jupiter and the other 3 Galilean Satellites. On Earth, the largest tidal range of the ocean (liquid) is about 40 ft. On Io, the crust itself (solid) experiences a tidal range of about 330 ft. Because of this, Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system due to it being stretched and squeezed so much. </p>
<p>That being said, to the professor's credit, Io does experience massive and frequent &quot;io-quakes.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
