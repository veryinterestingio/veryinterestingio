		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since 2015, using NASA hardware, scientists and researchers have worked with astronauts on the International Space Station to conduct a series of experiments to grow, harvest and eat a variety of crops in space with seeds sent from Earth. The most recent experiment has the ISS crew growing Mizuna mustard using two different light recipes and multiple harvests, with the experiment's final harvest scheduled for later this week. This work builds upon decades of NASA and international research into growing plants in space.</p>
<p>These experiments are advancing the knowledge required to successfully grow a large variety of crops on long-duration missions, such as a crewed mission to Mars. Being able to crops grown in space provides many benefits including supplementing the astronauts' packaged diet with essential nutrients and combating diet fatigue.</p>
<p>Here answering your questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ralph Fritsche, Space Crop Production Project Manager, NASA's Kennedy Space Center</li>
<li>Jess Bunchek, Pseudonaut and Associate Scientist, NASA's Kennedy Space Center</li>
<li>Lashelle Spencer, Research and Development Scientist, NASA's Kennedy Space Center</li>
<li>Jacob Torres, Technical and Horticultural Scientist, NASA's Kennedy Space Center </li>
<li>Giola Massa, NASA Veggie project lead, NASA's Kennedy Space Center </li>
</ul>
<p>We will see you at 2:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (19:30 UT), ask us anything!</p></div></div>

Besides the plant growth itself, what other aspects of space crops is your team exploring?
