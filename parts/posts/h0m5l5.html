		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Air is &quot;sticky&quot;<em> and clings onto surfaces. This creates a layer</em> of basically stationary air right at the surface of fan blades. As dust falls into this layer it gets trapped on the surface. And as others have mentioned, dust collects dust and static and what not adds on to the effect.</p>
<p>*Note: viscosity and boundary layer. </p>

<p>Edit: Forgot to mention why fans seem extra prone to this. Fans are for moving air around hence they generally see more &quot;air movement per surface area&quot; which is why the effect is more pronounced there!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Finally something I know a little about. Thereâ€™s a concept known as a boundary layer that describes how fluids (gas or liquid) behave near surfaces. In a nutshell, as the air approaches the fan blade its velocity matches that of the fan blade so the two become relatively stationary, and then the dust accumulates just like anything else. This is also why you can never blow all the dust off something.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The boundary layer theory that many have brought, by itself, has some flaws. This explains why the air doesn't blow off the dust but not why it accumulates in the first place.</p>
<p>If it was just a combination of random motion plus the increased airflow carrying more dust then the dust would accumulate evently, or, in fact, the theory suggests it would accumulate the most near the trailing edge (the rear part of the blace) because the boundary layer gets thicker the closer it is to the trailing edge. Yet this is the opposite of what happens, the dust accumulates at the leading edge (the front part).</p>
<p>Also since it is just random accumulation then, given enough time, a stopped fan would build up a similar ammount of dust, but this doesn't seem to happen.</p>
<p>This points to the conclusion that in fact the blade movement is making the blade attract more dust than usual. This could be due to the electrostatic forces that build up because of the air friction. Since the most air friction happens at the leading edge this is consistent on how the dust accumulates in the blade. This combined with the boundary layer preventing the attracted dust getting easily blown off seems a much more plausible explanation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humidity, generally.  And dust will grab more dust.</p>
<p>Additional dust attraction could be from any cleaner/spray (like Pledge or Liquid Gold) used on the previous cleaning... like for a ceiling fan.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well dust accumulates on everything.  It sounds like the question you're asking is &quot;Why doesn't dust get blown off of fans?&quot;</p>
<p>There are some static electric effects but the basic reason is that air is effectively motionless on (non-frictionless) solid surfaces.  The difference in speed between one spot in the air and another can be very different, in fact this is where turbulence comes from.  The difference in speed between air and the solid it's next to is very small, and effectively zero at the surface.</p>
<p>You can see this when you stir milk into coffee.  The center mixes fast, if you look very close to the edges it takes a very long time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
