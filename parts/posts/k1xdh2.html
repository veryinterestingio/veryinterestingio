This feeling happens when your body goes into sleep mode too quick, the actual name of you want to do research is &quot;hypnagogic jerk&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don’t you hate that feeling when you are in that phase of your sleep where you are not even sleeping and not even awake and suddenly you feel like you have fallen from the sky? Even while sleeping sometimes you get this sensation so strongly that you end up sometimes falling off your bed.</p>
<p>How many times have you asked yourself why this happens to your body? It is the most unanswered feeling ever because you feel so much but it is almost impossible to explain. Some people say it is because of your soul going out of your body and then when it travels and comes back it falls back to your body, hence resulting in this feeling of jerk and increased heart beat as well.</p>
<p>Well, like everything this has logic behind it. This weird sensation is called the ‘Hypnic Jerk’ in medical terms. Hypnic jerks are a type of myoclonic twitches caused by sudden muscle contractions or lapses of contraction. Myoclonic jerks are pretty normal when experienced occasionally but regular jerks like these indicate neurological disorders.
These jerks end up in increased rate of heart beats, breathlessness, sweat and sometimes falling in real life too. People with irregular sleep patterns often feel these hypnic jerks. There are many reasons why this happens to you, if you often feel anxious, stressed just before sleeping or you have had too much of caffeine.</p>
<p>While sleeping our body goes through several sleep cycles and there are different sleep stages. The first stage of sleep which is called the ‘NREM’ is the reason why this jerk is felt. When we are about to sleep our muscles relax and our brain gets confused why the relaxation happened and so the muscles tense up again, which results in the falling sensations. It is a reflex due to a revolutionary process which humans developed when they used to sleep on the trees for survival.</p>
<p>According to Marianne Middleton, clinical coordinator at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital Sleep Disorders Center, hypnic jerks can lead to a vicious circle. “If you lose sleep because you constantly jerk awake, you will become fatigued and may develop anxiety or worry about falling asleep. The more worried and tired you are, the more likely you are to jerk awake. The more you jerk awake, the more sleep you lose.”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain has many different systems to do many different things. A lot of these systems turn off when you sleep, and one of the things that turns off is your consciousness' awareness of your body position which is why you can move around in your dreams rather than spending them lying down - almost like your brain goes into test simulation/developer mode for your movements.</p>
<p>Many things do not turn off however, and one of these is the subconscious awareness of sensation such as position and falling. The main theory for this is to prevent our ancestors from falling out of trees as it prompts a tension/grab response and wakes us up instantly.</p>
<p>Normally your dream consciousness is separate from your subconscious positional awareness, but if your brain turns off the info from your body before flipping the 'developer mode' switch it causes the subconscious bit to interpret the sudden lack of input as a worst case falling scenario, hence the instant jerk awake.</p>
<p>That's my layman's understanding of it anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
