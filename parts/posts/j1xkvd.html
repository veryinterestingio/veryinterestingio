		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain uses different parts and different amounts of energy to process words versus syllables. Processing a phrase as simply words takes more energy, so when you repeat a word or phrase over and over your brain gets tired and begins to process it as syllables, which has rhythm and musicality!</p>
<p>Then it’s much like when you have a song stuck in your head.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This particular bit might not be true for everyone, but ADHD and Autistic folks sometimes experience something called &quot;echolalia&quot; - repeating a phrase over and over and over as it's stuck in their heads</p>
<p>EDIT: A few people have commented to let me know that this isn't exactly echolalia, echolalia is more focused on the compulsion to repeat phrases you might here over and over, rather than it being stuck in your head.  I fear their replies have gotten lost among the comments so I wanted to make sure it was seen!</p>
<p>That said, I have heard neurodivergent people say that this stuck-in-your-head thing does still happen with them often, lots of people below even.  I urge you to do your own research, I am definitely not a professional!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain is criss-crossed with little fleshy wires called &quot;neurons&quot; that carry electricity all around to different parts of your brain that do different tasks. If your brain has to do a certain task very often, it tries to get better at it making those &quot;neuron&quot; wires for that task stronger and more connected.</p>
<p>When you decide to say something, first the words (&quot;verbal&quot;) part of your brain picks the right phrase, then the neurons send that information to the talking (&quot;motor&quot;) part of your brain.  In this way, the little neuron wires between your &quot;verbal&quot; and &quot;motor&quot; parts of your brain tend to pair up and get connected really well for words that you say all the time.  This can happen between other parts of your brain too.</p>
<p>Now, sometimes those really good strong connections go into a feedback loop, and in order to prevent your brain from getting stuck in that loop, each time it repeats your brain forces the electrical neuron wire signals to get weaker.  That means, the strong connection between &quot;verbal&quot; and &quot;motor&quot; get's weaker for a little while.  This makes you feel like you are saying that word or phrase, but you can think of what it means.  This is known as &quot;semantic satiation&quot;.</p>
<p>But then! ANOTHER part of your brain sometimes gets activated and sucked into the problem.  It's not really a 'part' of your brain, but more like a habit your brain has to want to finish tasks that it started.  Your brain doesn't want to leave a job half-done; it wants to finish.  Sometimes, when &quot;semantic satiation&quot; is happening, your brain thinks it is an unfinished task, but it can't finish because it can't connect to the &quot;verbal&quot; part of your brain to find the meaning of the phrase.  So, your brain tries to start the task over again, hoping that it can trigger those strong connection &quot;neuron&quot; wires by following the same pattern from the beginning.  But it keeps failing and so it starts over and over again.</p>
<p>Now, the CRAZY thing is that this can happen completely inside your head without you ever saying it out loud.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why can’t I relate to this???</p>
<p>I’ve only ever had words stuck on my head (if it’s not a song) when I try to not forget something and repeat it in my mind so I don’t forget. Also when I’m reading or writing and the last phrases I repeat in my mind sometimes to absorb the meaning of the words.</p>
<p>I’ve never had non musical words unintentionally stuck in my mind! Why is this?</p>
<p>It’s not like I have no sense of rhythm either...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
