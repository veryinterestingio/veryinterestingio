		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Reddit! I'm Kaeli Swift a behavioral ecologist specializing in crows and other corvids at the University of Washington.  Right now my work focuses on the foraging ecology of the <em>cutest</em> corvid, the Canda jay.  For the previous six years though, I studied the funeral behaviors of American crows. These studies involved trying to understand the adaptive motivations for why crows alarm call and gather near the bodies of deceased crows through both field techniques and non-lethal brain imaging techniques.  Along the way, I found some pretty surprising things out about how and when crows touch dead crows.  Let's just say sometimes they really put the crow in necrophilia! </p>
<p>You can find coverage of my funeral work at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/science/crows-necrophilia.html" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>, on the <a href="https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/ologies/e/56956025" target="_blank">Ologies</a> podcast, and PBS's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYVFZnNl6s" target="_blank">Deep Look</a>.  </p>
<p>For future crow questions, you can find me at my blog where I address common questions, novel research, myths, mythology, basically anything corvid related that people want to know about!  You can also find me here on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Corvidresearch" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/corvidresearch?lang=en" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, Instagram, and Facebook all at the corvidresearch handle.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When hiking this past May in Arizona there was some wind up-currents up on Wasson peak, and I think I saw a group of crows playing “pass and catch the feather “ as the winds kept the feather aloft.</p>
<p>Am I anthropomorphizing this? Or does this fit in with known corvid behavior?</p>
<p>I was so blown away by the display, I accidentally sat back in a cactus!</p>
<p>/to be fair, that cactus totally snuck up on me</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
