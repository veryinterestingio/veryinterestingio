		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don't feel heat but heat transfer. So things that are good at transferring heat will feel hotter or colder depending on their actual temperature. And things that suck at transferring heat like cloth or wood will feel more neutral regardless of how hot or cold they are. It's the same reason why you can sit down in a 90°C sauna on a wooden bench but you would burn your bottom if those benches were metal or stone. And the same why your bathroom rug feels nice after taking a shower but the tiles feel painfully cold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heat transfer is part of the answer. The other part is how much energy a material can hold.</p>
<p>So, in ELI5 terms: think about a very small snowflake and a big cube of ice. When you touch the snowflake, you don't feel a temperature change. It has very little thermal mass, and absorbs heat only momentarily before becoming the same temperature as you. The ice cube on the other hand has quite a lot of thermal mass, so it will absorb your finger's heat for a lot longer, which makes you feel colder. </p>
<p>Now, if instead of being the size of a snowflake, you have a material with a very low thermal mass but same size/mass as the ice cube. That object would feel completely indifferent to you, because it is incapable of absorbing much energy from you. Things like insulating foam have this property - it doesn't matter what temperature it is at, it is unable to absorb much energy from you.</p>
<p>This is true for things at room temperature, not just colder or hotter things. For instance, if you touch something like a sheet of paper, you don't really feel much of a difference. On the other hand, if you touch the paper on top of a metal desk, you feel it is much colder now. The desk is now absorbing your heat along with the paper, and the desk has a higher thermal mass.</p>
<p>Of course, this implies that you are at human temperature, which depending on your scale can be 10 to 30 degrees higher. In this case, you are hotter than room temp so everything around you will try to absorb your energy. </p>
<p>If you are at the same temperature as everything else (so everything else is at human temperature), you will not feel any temperature by touching things, because they are at the same temperature as you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A material has 2 important parameters when it comes to felt temperature.</p>
<ol>
<li>It's current temperature.</li>
<li>Rate of temperature equalization/heat transfer.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first is straightforward.
The second depends on how hard you push against it to make sure your not just near it but actually touching and some material characteristica.</p>
<p>Air for example does not transfer heat well and therefore feels rather warm. Unless it is windy of course in which case the wind conducts the heat.</p>
<p>Metal on the other hand conducts heat well and therefore rarely feels temperate. The range of temperatures that are neither hot nor cold is very small.</p>
<p>Crystal lattices (gems) are more complicated and sometimes are more metalic and sometimes more like air depending on what kind of lattice you are talking about.</p>
<p>Note that some things may feel too cold or hot at first but quickly normalize. They may have a small capacity when it comes to heat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The easy answer is that thermal conductivity is the reason. Metal feels cool to the touch because when you touch it it is able to take your heat energy away from you very quickly, wool, on the opposite end of the spectrum, isnt very good at taking thermal energy from something else, but the human body is pretty okay at it comparatively, which is why even if they have been in a cold room or outside it feels super comforting to put on a jacket. Stone is also a pretty good thermal conductor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>a common misconception about heat and  temperature is that temperature is interchangeable with heat. In actuality, heat is the transfer of energy and when you feel a cool object, what you're feeling is heat transfer into the object. How much you feel is a property dependent on the heat conductivity of the material, not the actual temperature of the objects in question. When I taught introductory physics, we used to do an experiment with students where we took equal temperature ice cubes and put one on a metal slab and one on a block of wood. the ice melted on the metal much faster than the one on the wood despite both being at room temperature because metallic objects conduct heat easier than wood, and this is consequently why it feels cooler to touch than wood. This is also the reason why when stirring a pot of hot soup, you'd be smart to use a wooden spoon rather than a metal one, as the metal one would conduct heat easier and be likely to burn your hand. So the short answer is that rocks like Jade just conduct heat better than others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
