		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For those types of services, it's all about new subscribers. If a show generates enough new subscriptions to please the stock holders, it's considered a success. Many shows on these services are not produced in house, locking them in for at least a 2 season run no matter how successful. Netflix does not release viewership numbers to the public, and I doubt they ever will</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>They are monitoring literally every second of every show that gets watched by everyone.</p>
<p>The more eyes on it, the more profitable it is.    </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd imagine exclusivity has its benefits in terms of subscribers. Other shows may come and go based on their agreements, and people still deciding whether or not to subscribe can reason that X show is also available on Y, so they don't need Netflix. But when they have an original show that gains media buzz and/or wins awards, it is THEIRS - not contingent on any future agreements. They've had some big ones that may have been deciding factors in new subscribers, which I'm sure they track. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most common metric is how many “first stream” views the show gets. “First stream” counts the first piece of content someone views after subscribing.</p>
<p>As with most services, the “cost of acquisition” for new customers is the most critical metric. How much do you have to spend to get someone to sign up? The lower that number, the sooner they are a profitable customer. </p>
<p>For example, let’s say a show’s production and marketing costs are $100mil, and it brings in 100,000 new subscribers. Again, that “new subs” is determined by how many people stream that show first after subscribing. So in that case, each new sub cost them $1,000. That’s a very high cost of acquisition. At $10 a month, it would take 8 years to become profitable on those customers. </p>
<p>Change it up and say $100mil cost and 2,000,000 new subs. Now you’re at $50 per customer and that is a far more reasonable acquisition cost. In a few months the subs will be profitable. </p>
<p>Now, this model ignores a number of other revenue streams and costs, but it effectively determines the “profitability” of a new show. </p>
<p>Different streaming companies will have different targets, I just used these numbers as an example. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
