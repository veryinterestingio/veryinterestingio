		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The real answer, in ELI5 fashion:</p>
<p>Companies like Coke switched from reusable glass to plastic because it was cheaper. When plastic waste became a big problem, they paid a lot of money to run ad campaigns that make it sound like it’s our fault for increasing plastic waste and not their fault for producing it all. </p>
<p>When big companies spend lots of money to push an agenda, it usually works.</p>
<p>Edit: Just to clarify: The OP didn’t ask “why is there litter” he/she asked “why is the emphasis just on consumers and not producers”. Plastic waste is a complex subject that isn’t easily ELI5. The OP’s actual question however has a pretty clear answer. For more information I suggest reading over this <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2006/05/origins-anti-litter-campaigns/" target="_blank">article</a>  that does a pretty thorough background on the origins of anti-littering campaigns.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simple answer: companies don't care, and you can't expect them to do so. Pollution is what we call an externality, something you do that affects other people without you receiving any impact of it. When externalities happen (good or bad), the market does not work well cause you are not considering what your actions cause on other people.</p>
<p>In this case, companies trash the environment and don't account for the fact that it harms other people. To fix this, they need to start accounting for it, by getting punished to do so. You can't expect them to turn down a bigger profit for the environment, corporations are rational, they don't have feelings. What we can expect is that if people are willing to punish them by consuming less of their product, they will start controlling themselves. Demand generates supply.</p>
<p>This is not really the final solution, it is more like a hotfix. The only real solution is to have an entity that oversees the efficient use of the environment, that punishes or forbids companies from misusing them. This is the role of the state. It is hard to imagine a final solution without a true democracy. Limitations to democracy like lobbies, lack of transparency and misinformed people are the real threat, not the companies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally it is easier to sway the consumer than the manufacturer as very few large scale manufacturers will willingly lose profits making a switch in their manufacturing lines and the materials used for purely environmental reasons. However if consumers stop buying plastics then manufacturers will notice that plastic products aren’t turning profits and will in turn switch to materials that consumers are willing to buy, getting the same result as pushing for manufacturers to change their products.</p>
<p>TL:DR it’s easier to tell everyone not to consume and will get the same result in the end</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
