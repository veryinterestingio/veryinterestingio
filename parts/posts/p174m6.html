		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually these very large denominations indicate a period of significant inflation in the past.  At some point an economic crisis made it necessary for the government to pump out currency to pay off debts or force investment, permanently devaluing the currency.</p>
<p>If you look back through South Korea’s economic history, you can see multiple inflation spikes in the 60’s, 70’s, and 80’s with rates hitting 30-70% - an already weak currency post-Korean War being further devalued.</p>
<p>Vietnam has a similar but more dramatic story: enormous triple digit inflation rates after the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>Sometimes nations do rebalance the devalued currency to reset the values.  A few years ago Venezuela scrapped the Bolivar currency and converted it to Bolivar <em>Fuerte</em> currency to knock some zeroes off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is actually the inflation's side effect.</p>
<p>The money worth less than the paper they paint it on. So, they use a higher number.</p>
<p>You can see how it begins (again) in Turkish Lira. In 2007, Turkey removed 6 zeroes from the money (ie 10 million TLs become 10 TLs). The $/TL was something like 1.20.</p>
<p>Now, $/TL is 8.65. TL loses it's worth. </p>
<p>To somewhat counter that, countries issue higher bills. So that the minimum wages can keep up against the inflation and people can afford basic stuff like electricity bills and such.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can't speak for Vietnam but in Korea, units used in money do not reset when going from coin to paper bills. In the US, coins are cents and paper bills are dollars. You have the 1, 5, 10, 25 cents then it transitions to bills where the numbering restarts so that the smallest bill is 1 dollar. In Korea, all currency is called won. Coins go 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 won and bills continue the numbering from there so the smallest bill denomination is 1,000 won and the highest is the 50,000 won.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A currency with &quot;large&quot; units would be (for example) Bitcoin, where lunch would cost like 0.0000001 Bitcoin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
