Does that mean i can fall 30ft on the moon without hurting myself if i fall correctly? Or are my legs broken?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, yes. </p>
<p>The math behind it is that your kinetic energy from the fall will be (mass)x(gravity)x(height of the fall). If you cut the gravity by 6, then you can 6x the height without changing the energy you have to absorb in the landing.</p>
<p>Edit: for simplicity’s sake, I ignored many unquantifiable or insignificant factors. Things like human reactions, landing proficiency, and thick moon dust landings needlessly complicate the situation in a way that can’t be measured. I ignored air resistance and other insignificant effects because the person’s ability to land (and a thousand other factors) will have a larger effect. Specifically for air resistance/terminal velocity on earth, if you’re going fast enough for air resistance to significantly slow your unaided fall, you were already going fast enough to break your legs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes.</p>
<p>The gravity on earth is 9.8 m/s\^2 and on moon it is 1.6m/s\^2. So after 1 second of falling on earth you reach a velocity of 9.8m per second. While failing on the moon for 6 seconds gives you a velocity of 9.72.</p>
<p>The Equation for distance traveled is d=½ * g * t\^2</p>
<p>Earth: ½ * 9.8 * 1\^2 = 4.9 meters</p>
<p>Moon: ½ * 1.6 * 6\^2 = 29.16 meters.</p>
<p>4.9 * 6 \~= 29.16, so yes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For relatively small distances like 30ft, technically yes, but not necessarily in general. For large heights here can be wind resistance at play too. You would not sustain injury if you jumped out of a plane at 10,000ft with a parachute on Earth, but you would if you tried it on the moon!</p>
<p>The moons surface is covered in about 2 inches of loose dust and so is relatively soft to what you might find on earth which could reduce the impulse force and therefor injury from impact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
