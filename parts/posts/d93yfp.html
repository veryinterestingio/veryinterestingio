I didn't mean glacial flood waters sculpted all of the American West. The erosion I'm speaking of is cause by huge releases of water from melting glaciers, not the erosion caused by the glacial advance. The talks that got me interested in this topic were <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sbxn94vLWM" target="_blank">these</a> videos. Try it out.</p></div></div>

There's also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island" target="_blank">Long Island</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island_Sound" target="_blank">Long Island Sound</a> which were created as a result of glaciation.</p>
<p>These are just a few examples of how glaciers shaped the northeastern USA. I'm sure there are many more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Where did you get the idea that the ice sheets covered the entire continent?  They barely covered 1/3 of it.  In the east, the melt from the glaciers found an easy way down to the sea. In the west, the mountains blocked a lot of the flow, so large deep lakes were formed. But when they overflowed, or when the ice blocking the exit melted, the exit was quickly (hours to days) eroded down so that the lake emptied in a flood.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have an answer to your question. I do, however, have some information you might enjoy looking at if you have an interest in geology, which apparently you do. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wKOVZKimwg" target="_blank">Here is a video</a> pertaining to the dating of the ice age floods. It's a long video, but this guy has almost turned me into a geology geek with some of his other vids. He teaches at Central Washington University, and that channel has things other than his lectures (which mostly concern the NW area geology) but I think he's got a playlist or two on there. Really good shit to be found there regardless. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQhjkemEyUo" target="_blank">One of my faves.</a> What <em>I</em> would love to find, is someone of the same caliber that discusses things of a similar nature for the east coast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, not the entire continent. But one big reason glacial dams failed so frequently and catastrophically in the west is because there is simply more topographic variation in the west allowing dams and glacial lakes to form more readily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
