		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different chemicals touch our tongue and the inside of our nose. Each chemical has a different shape, and so fits into different receptors in our tongues and noses. Every time a receptor gets a chemical in it, it sends a signal to the brain, a very simple &quot;yes/no&quot; signal. The brain receives lots of signals at once and interprets the specific combination as a flavor.</p>
<p>A sugar molecule goes in to a sugar receptor, and the brain says &quot;my sugar receptor just sent a message. I must be tasting something sweet!&quot; A salt molecule goes into a salt receptor and the brain says, &quot;my salt receptor just signalled. I must be tasting something salty!&quot; A sugar molecule <em>and</em> a salt molecule go to their receptors, and the brain says, &quot;both the sugar and salt receptors are signalling. I must be tasting something sweet AND salty! Neat!&quot; </p>
<p>There are lots of different chemicals and corresponding receptors, and the brain can read the different combinations, giving us the wide variety of flavors we experience.</p>
<p>As far as good and bad, that depends on a lot of factors. Some things are genetic, some cultural, and many depend on the situation.</p>
<p>Genetically, we're wired to crave things like fats and sugars, since these can give a lot of energy with little effort. Naturally sugary foods, like fruit, also have a lot of the other nutrients we need. Culturally, we can train ourselves to like some things that others would call bad, and vice versa. Situationally, some things taste better or worse in context. Which tastes better, the first Oreo of the pack, or the last?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, (at least in a natural setting) a lot of things that taste or smell appetizing are beneficial to you and edible. Fruits, cooked meat, stuff like that. Things that repel you are usually harmful. Rotting flesh, spoiled milk, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a very complicated question that got a lot of great answers.. but they also mostly missed your question.</p>
<p>Flavor itself is relatively simple. Flavor is the combination of scent and taste. Receptors are triggered by &quot;scent particles&quot; in your nose and mouth and you get a generally common response. Sugar tastes sweet. Salt tastes salty. etc..</p>
<p>And yes, some people have vagaries and mutations that make us genetically predisposed to feel a scent or taste as pleasant or unpleasant.. for example.. about 60% of people CANNOT smell asparagus in urine, and about 10% of people (myself included) find that parsley and oregano taste like soap. </p>
<p>However.. what makes something good or bad has less to do with your brain and more to do with your mind.</p>
<p>For example, are you a psychopath? If you are, statistically, you will better enjoy bitter flavor than most people will.</p>
<p>Do you have trauma or good memories associated with a flavor? If you were beaten with oranges half your life, they'll likely taste bad to you. But your mother's home cooking is usually the best you've had, assuming you like your mom. </p>
<p>Exposure and culture.. depending on where you live and your culture, you will be exposed to some things more and others less. This will STRONGLY affect what you enjoy. </p>
<p>And finally your own personality and free-will. There are foods you hate as a child but learn to enjoy as an adult once you have more experience... for example. </p>
<p>So what makes something tastes good is partly genetic, and mostly learned. Like.. did you know that cats are genetically predisposed to dislike citrus, like lemons and oranges, but Ive had cats steal those fruits from me and eat them because they were convinced it was good if i liked it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
