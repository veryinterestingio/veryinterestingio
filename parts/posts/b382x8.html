		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the necessary conditions for a battery to be rechargeable is that the underlying chemical changes that occur during an electrical discharge from the cell must be efficiently reversed when an opposite electrical potential is applied across the cell. In nickel-cadmium (NiCad) batteries, for example, the Cd(OH)2 and Ni(OH)2 that are formed during cell discharge are readily converted back to the original electrode materials (Cd and NiOOH), when the cell is recharged.</p>
<p>In the case of the rechargeable battery, the electrochemical oxidation- reduction reactions are reversible at both electrodes. In the case of the nonrechargeable battery, when one attempts to recharge the battery by reversing the direction of electron current flow, at least one of the electrochemical oxidation-reduction reactions is not reversible. When the battery is charged, the overall reduction reaction that proceeds at the negative electrode may not be the true reverse of the oxidation reaction that proceeded when the battery was discharged. For example, metal oxidation might be the sole oxidation reaction during battery discharge, whereas the formation of hydrogen (a highly inflammable and therefore dangerous gas) might be a significant reduction reaction during battery recharging.</p>
<p>In contrast, nonrechargeable, or primary, batteries can be based on irreversible chemical changes. For example, the carbon-fluoride- lithium primary batteries often used in cameras generate energy by converting (CF) n and Li metal to carbon and LiF. But the starting material at the battery' s cathode, (CF), is not reformed when a reverse potential is applied. Instead the cell electrolyte decomposes, and eventually the fluoride is oxidized to form fluorine gas.</p>
<p>A reversible chemical change is not the only requirement for rechargeable batteries. To be classified as rechargeable, the battery must be able to undergo the reverse reaction efficiently, so that hundreds or even thousands of recharging cycles are possible. In addition, there must often be provisions to ensure that the recharging process can occur safely.</p>
<p>An added requirement for a well-behaved (that is, long-lived) rechargeable battery is that not only must the electrochemical oxidation- reduction reactions be reversible, they must also return the electrode materials to their original physical state. For example, rough or filamentary structures may form in the battery after repeated charge- discharge cycles. These structures can result in unwanted growth of the electrode and subsequent electronic contact between the battery electrodes- -a short circuit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You <em>can</em> charge most batteries. The problem largely lies in electrical characteristics and physical processes that occur - the reverse reaction not occurring uniformly throughout the volume but localized (as ions distributed over the volume of the battery got concentrated on the electrodes during discharge). </p>
<p>Sometimes the battery will heat up dangerously and start outgassing, which may cause it to explode or leak - the electric current flows uniformly through the volume during discharge, but during charge channels of ions may form and act as thin, resistive wires heating up a lot. Sometimes it will just short and cease charging (protective circuits of the charger kicking in) as electrodes bend from heat and gas, then touch. Quite often it will charge a little bit and then stop - the ions concentrated around the electrodes having reacted and the rest of the volume sitting there inert. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My lord there is a lot of disinformation in this thread.  I am not a chemist, so if someone has a better explanation of the exact reaction mechanisms feel free to correct me.  Most explanations (including the top comment) focus on uncommon battery chemistries (such as carbon fluoride), so that's not a particularly helpful explanation.  </p>
<p>There are a few types of batteries you will encounter in everyday life: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Alkaline (most non-rechargable batteries on the market)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carbon zinc (aka. &quot;heavy duty&quot;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lithium metal (aka. camera batteries, very expensive)</p>
</li>
<li>Lithium ion (rechargable batteries - used in your phone, power tools, and pretty much anything that plugs into a usb socket)</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no such thing as a &quot;non-rechargable&quot; battery.  Almost all chemical reactions can be reversed, and consequently almost all batteries can be recharged.  The real question is <em>should you</em> recharge them, and what are the consequences if you do?  The problem with almost all batteries is dendrite growth.  Inside a battery you have an anode and cathode separated by a porous separator and in contact with an electrolyte.  This electrolyte carries ions between the anode and cathode but does NOT conduct electricity.  I'll get back to why that's important later.  Just know that some electrolytes will break down when the voltage per unit distance exceeds a certain value.  </p>
<p>So what happens when you recharge a &quot;non-rechargable&quot; battery:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Alkaline: These are composed and zinc and manganese with an alkaline electrolyte.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_battery#Recharging_of_alkaline_batteries" target="_blank">You can recharge these a few times, 1-10 at the most</a>.  After every discharge and recharge, the zinc metal surface becomes more and more irregular.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeisJvbASIg" target="_blank">Dendrites begin to form, which increases the localized electric field</a>, until breakdown occurs and you have a short.  The electrolyte, in this case an aqueous alkaline liquid will boil and release some mildly caustic liquid from the battery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carbon zinc: pretty much the same thing as alkaline except not only do you have dendrite problems, the carbon rod also begins to degrade since that's what graphite likes to do when it's cycled in an electrochemical cell.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lithium metal: Lithium dendrites begin to form - these are even more dangerous than alkaline because lithium is a reactive metal and a short will not release alkaline liquid.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m5QCoBG8CI" target="_blank">The lithium will heat, until a lithium fire starts</a>, and guess what, the electrolytes used in lithium batteries are usually not aqueous either, they're usually flammable which will contribute to the heat and combustion.  Bottom line: don't ever recharge lithium metal batteries - they are physically able to be recharged a couple times, but the consequences of dendrite formation are very hazardous.  </p>
</li>
<li>Lithium ion: Now Farnswirth, you've just told me that lithium batteries explode and catch fire when they're recharged!  How come I can recharge my LiIon batteries?  Well: lithium ion batteries don't actually have lithium metal, so dendrites are far less of a problem.  They have a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/NhgaMrR.jpg" target="_blank">different cell chemistry</a> where the lithium only exists in the form of ions, which travel between intercalcation sites on opposing anode and cathode.  There's a far lower chance of forming dendrites because there's no bulk metallic lithium to form dendrites off of.  These can be recharged for thousands of cycles.  However, just like I said earlier: carbon likes to degrade in electrochemical cells, so eventually the carbon will break down and your battery will have reduced capacity and will eventually not be able to hold a charge.  But under normal circumstances these should never catch fire.  So why do they?  Wellllllll..... unfortunately the electrolytes for lithium are still flammable.  So if you have an external short (i.e. you connect the + and - terminals with a wire or a low resistance path), the battery will begin to heat, this heat will cause the electrolyte to expand, possibly boil or release hydrogen, and sometimes even catch fire.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Hope this explain why some batteries are &quot;rechargable&quot; and some are not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some reactions, not all, are reversible. It depends on what chemicals are in your battery. Rechargeables have a different composition inside, usually using more expensive materials, hence the cost.  </p>
<p>Just to give you an example even burning wood is a reduction-oxidation reaction, but no one thinks 'I can get wood from ash'.  </p>
<p>Having said that, some 'unrechargable' batteries can be recharged with some downfall. Some cause a build up of pressure in the battery, some just don't charge as efficiently giving you only a tiny fraction of power back. In all cases it could lead either to excessive heat production or battery fluid coming out of the containment. Both of these cases are extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Therefore:  </p>
<p>DON'T EVER RECHARGE NON-RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES!!!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
