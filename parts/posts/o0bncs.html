<p>EDIT: Chetna Hareesh Kumar (CHK) is joining us, and unfortunately Hannah had a last minute thing so she can't make it. Chetna has been instrumental in working on the report we just released and is very knowledgeable about China's investment in coal, and she also wrote a great article on what <a href="https://www.ren21.net/net-zero-basics/" target="_blank">net zero actually means</a>.</p>
<p>EDIT2: Wow, we love how many questions there are - we are slowly getting to them in between our work - please bear with us!</p>
<p>EDIT3: After a super busy week, the team is completely zonked - thank you for all of your questions, we do apologise we couldn't get to all of them. If you're interested, please feel free to join our newsletter (sign up via <a href="http://ren21.net/" target="_blank">ren21.net</a>). We'll let you know about the events we host/take part in, many which have plenty of opportunities to ask questions.</p></div></div>

Certainly the decisions made today on things like mines have impacts that last decades, but the decisions are made using short term viewpoints… how does the world overcome this?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
