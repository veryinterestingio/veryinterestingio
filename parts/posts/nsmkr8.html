		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the same way you require muscle movement to breathe while sleeping, it takes minimal effort to keep your eyes closed during sleepy time because in a truly relaxed state, your eyes are almost totally closed already. It's very little muscle effort to close them, and although it's gross, they kinda suction shut a little to help with what <em>very little</em> muscle is required to keep them closed.</p>
<p>Your brain takes care of this stuff automatically. Well, it tries. Your eyes sometime remain partially open, but if your eye starts to dry out your body will react to it and during your automatic tossing and turning, will try to shut them again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The fatigue is not the exertion of muscles, your bones and muscles are levers and pulleys of proportion [hence why bending your wrist and bending your elbow are essentially the same amount of effort (not work)]. The fatigue is nervous system fatigue - hence why people fall asleep driving while full of caffeine, or get immediately sleepy when in a boring class.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Answer from former nurse: there are many muscles in your body that are relaxed when in the &quot;closed&quot; position. Your mouth. Your eyes. Your hands. Only done examples. When you're relaxed or sleep your mouth is closed, your eyes are closed and your hands are curled. When you're waking up, you're still very relaxed, almost still asleep so it takes some effort to use those muscles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
