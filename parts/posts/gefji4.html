		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay so basically trees (specifically) have a certain order to which they allocate their energy. It's common to assume that plants need things out of the soil to survive, and that's only a little true. Think of the things in the soil as vitamins to humans. We need them, and we won't be healthy without them, but for the most part we can live without them. The actual food comes from sunlight pretty much exclusively. So come winter, trees are able to shut down EVERYTHING except staying alive. That means no growth, no reproduction, no healing any wounds.
If you think about tree rings, this makes sense visually as those tiny dark lines are the growth of the tree in winter, versus the lighter parts in between which visualize spring and summer (This happens because the denser tissue turns dark).
Trees can actually sense the seasons by basically counting days above or below a certain temperature. The specifics depend on the tree, but it's a defense mechanism against coming out of dormancy early. So basically if we get one really warm winter day, they dont come out of hibernation, they have to have like 10 days above freezing or whatever. (Conifers ALSO go into hibernation, it's a common mistake that they dont! Conifers and deciduous trees are actually like, barely related. They evolved at different points in time, meaning that they both go dormant it just looks really different. Dormant for conifers means that the stop growing, but they dont lose their leaves).
Tl;dr: trees go dormant, which means they dont do ANYTHING expect essential functions. </p>
<p>With other plants there are some different ways they can stay alive. Dicots are plants that generally have tap roots (think carrots). The tap root works like a kind of long term supply of food. Here, the important thing to understand is that plants dont just EAT sunlight. They photosynthesize, which means they basically take water and the sunlight and turn it into sugar, then they eat the sugar. Some of that sugar goes into the root, which stay alive in the winter and feed them when there's no sunlight. You can think of it like a humans fat deposits, if you stop getting food, your body consumes the fat stores and keeps going.</p>
<p>The other kinds of plants are called Monocots, they have very fine and fibrous root systems. So they have no place to store that!  And as I started writing that, i realized I dont remember how monocots survive winter lol. My botany class was awhile ago, but my silviculture class was this winter. What I was gonna say was that monocots tend to reproduce via shooters and rhizomes, meaning that they basically send out specialized stems underground that have the ability to grow roots and a new plant (think mint and blackberries, that's how they grow soo out of control). I was thinking since they have the ability to be underground and produce new plants that would help them survive winter but I dont think that's right! Sorry!!</p>
<p>Edit:I love talking abt this so if you want me to break something down I'm super happy to do it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trees which shed their leaves use reserves of sugar to stay alive through the winter (incidentally this reserve is what we harvest to make maple syrup). </p>
<p>They store the sugars in sap, which not only serves as a reserve of energy during hibernation, but works like antifreeze to keep cold temperatures from harming the tree. </p>
<p>They lose their leaves because they have a very high surface area. That surface area causes a lot of water loss, which is hard to replenish with the soil being frozen.</p>
<p>Evergreens have evolved needle like leaves which are much more water efficient, so they do not need to hibernate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
