A newborn can distinguish it's mother's voice from a hundred other voices.</p>
<p>This was a matter of life and death. It's not as if human voices have a lot of distinguishing characteristics, it's just that, we have evolved to magnify those small differences, and recognize them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not happy with a lot of these answers. I’ll try and break it down as simply as possible, but it’s a fairly complex question at the end of the day. </p>
<p>Sure, the way that a person’s general physique affects the sound of their voice is a factor. But if you’re asking what the science is behind the sound of our voices, you have to look at the physics behind it. </p>
<p>All sounds in the world are determined by frequencies, which are vibrations of air. The higher the pitch, the more vibrations are occurring per second. The vibrations per second are measured in “hertz” or “Hz”. 1Hz is 1 vibration per second. (It’s not really important to understand what exactly vibrations are, but think of them as the “sound waves” which you’ve certainly seen before).</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, the human ear can hear between 20Hz to 20,000Hz. </p>
<p>Now, if you’re familiar with basic musical concepts, you’ve heard of notes like “C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C”. These notes refer to particular “pitches”, or points within the range of 20Hz to 20,000Hz. There are many different “A” notes throughout the spectrum, like how on a piano you can play an A at the very far left end and it’s very low and bassy, and the on the right end it can be high pitched. It’s also why a cello can play an A and flute can play an A and though they sound very different (more on why that is in a bit) </p>
<p>(In music, these are called octaves, because the distance from one A to the next is separated by eight other notes [or intervals], and “oct” means 8) </p>
<p>To go back to the range of human hearing, every note has its own pitch, which means that if you think of 20hz to 20khz as a graph, you can map a particular point along it and it will correspond to a particular note. </p>
<p>A common note for tuning is called “A400” which means that this particular A is 440hz (it’s also called the A above middle C, or A3). The A below this is A220.  The A above is A880. (Another principal of sound is that if you double or half the frequency, you’ll go the next octave). </p>
<p>You’re probably wondering what any of this has to do with the human voice. Well, the truth is that no sound in the entire world is ever composed of *<strong>just*</strong> one frequency. In fact, every “note” played on any instrument is actually a collection of many different frequencies happening at once. The way that these frequencies relate to one another is what gives a particular instrument its sound. This is called <em>timbre</em>. </p>
<p>To go back to a piano, when you hit the A above middle C (or A440), the 440Hz is called “the fundamental”. But what gives the piano its piano-y sound is the way other frequencies interact with the fundamental. Because when you’re hitting the A above middle C on a well-tuned to piano, as well as 440Hz, the sound also contains the A above it, the E above that, and many other different frequencies that correspond to other notes — all of which are at lower volumes.  </p>
<p>These other frequencies are called “overtones”. It’s not worth getting into the particulars of how the frequencies of a piano (or any other instrument) relate to one another, but it is a mathematical relationship. Musical engineers have grouped many of these kinds of timbres into broad groups, which is why you might have heard of things like “square waves” and “saw waves”, which are artificial ways of describing certain relationships. (Clarinets have a very square wave sound, e.g.) </p>
<p>The concept of timbre is why two pianos sound slightly different. </p>
<p>Each human voice has its own timbre, which means each voice has a different frequency relationship between the fundamental note her or she speaks/sings and the overtones around it. This is influenced by many different factors. </p>
<p>It’s also why nearly every human voice sounds slightly different. The way the vocal chords are shaped are like different strings, the way your throat, chest, and jaw are structured are like different boxes that house the piano strings. Your accent (which is the way you mouth and tongue vowels and consonants) is the particular way you “express” certain notes (like the way an accomplished piano player plays the piano). It’s why fathers and sons often sound quite similar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are probably many people who sound almost exactly like me or like you, in terms of pure vocal tone. You just haven't met them. And if you did, there's a good chance that they grew up speaking a different language - so even though their physical vocal apparatus is essentially the same, their <em>speech</em> will be different.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the many other excellent explanations regarding how different voices are generated, there is also an important role for how voices are PERCEIVED. </p>
<p>Many things affect our perception of a person's voice, including our relationship to them. </p>
<p>Our ears are incredibly capable of distinguishing minor differences in voice, because they are tuned from a young age to do so, and it is critical to or development as a social species.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
