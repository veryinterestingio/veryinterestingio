		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a recording, or in real life?</p>
<p>In a recording, this is caused by the spinning thing moving more than one half a &quot;step&quot; (if it's a wheel with 6 spokes, then more than 1/12th of a turn) every frame of the recording. When this happens, each frame puts the spoke closer to where the <em>next</em> spoke was in the previous frame, instead of itself. So if it's turning a little less than 1/6th of a turn each frame, then it'll look like it's moving backwards very slowly, as what looks to you like the spoke having moved backwards a little bit is actually the previous spoke having moved forwards almost a full step.</p>
<p>As the speed increases, it goes through a cycle: the movement speeds up, reverses direction, slows down, speeds up in the other direction, reverses direction, etc. forever if the frames are infinitely fast (they are really a perfect freeze frame). Real cameras aren't like that, so instead eventually everything blurs together into motion blur. How much the effect happens depends on camera settings, which usually also depend on lighting conditions. With some settings the effect does not happen at all (e.g. often in low light), while with other settings it is extremely crisp and clear (e.g. often when recording brightly lit scenes or outdoors in the sun).</p>
<p>With your own eyes this isn't really a thing the same way, but what <em>can</em> happen is that the object is moving so fast that you can't keep up with smoothly tracking your eyes on it. Then your eyes start &quot;jumping&quot; from spoke to spoke (the technical term for this is called saccades). You're basically blind when your eyes jump from one position to the next, so if you &quot;land&quot; on the next spoke, you can accidentally end up perceiving things to be going backwards, similar to the camera. But the rate at which your eyes move isn't constant, so this isn't as predictable as the camera situation.</p>
<p>Edit: Other than that, if all you're doing is staring at a moving object without moving your eyes, this effect does not occur, because your eyes do not have shutters. For the effect to happen, there needs to be something interrupting the light periodically, otherwise things just turn into motion blur once they get fast enough for you not to perceive the rotation. That something can be a flickering light: if you're watching a spinning object in artificial light, and it's the kind that flickers (as many cheap LEDs and fluorescents do), then that has exactly the same effect as watching through a camera, where every time the light flickers on your eyes get a snapshot of the scene, like a video frame.</p>
<p>For the camera issue, if you want to dig deeper (warning: ELI5 mode off), this is a really a form of (temporal) aliasing, and can be analyzed in terms of the frequency spectrum of the image in time. As the frequency of something exceeds one half of the sampling rate (frame rate), which is called the Nyquist frequency, the result no longer represents the original signal, but an aliased version that looks wrong. So if you have a 60FPS camera, that's a 30Hz Nyquist frequency. If you have 6 spokes, at 5 rotations per second, that's 30 spokes per second, and that's the fastest you can turn the wheel before it starts aliasing and &quot;spinning backwards&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, I know this one. Lets see if I can explain it.
Think of a paper flip book. You want to draw car accelerating. You draw first a car still, then the same car with the wheels a little turned, then a little more, etc... when you flip the book at max speed it looks like the car wheels are spinning, right? </p>
<p>Ok, now you notice the car wheels are not spinning fast enough so you start drawing the wheels each time further (more turned) than the previous image until they are so turned they look closer to their original position from the opposite side, so it begins to look like the wheels are going backwards instead of forward very very fast. </p>
<p>Then it goes even faster and it becomes a mess.</p>
<p>Does it makes sense?</p>
<p>Edit: this is a simplification, but it helps me understand it. </p>
<p>Edit 2: As some of you are commenting, I know that’s how a screen/projection works, not necessarily “real life”. <strong>Notice how my example, a flip book, is neither a screen or a projection</strong>, and yet we all know it works. Which makes me think there must be similarities in the way a screen shows animation and the way our brains read movement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Movement is just lots of still images played one after another, just like individual frames in a movie. Well, your brain and eyes basically work the same way.</p>
<p>Now, imagine the hands of a clock going around really fast. In the first frame the hand is at the 12. Then in the next frame at the 1. Then at the 2 etc. You see this as the hands spinning around clockwise really quickly.</p>
<p>Now double the speed, so it goes up by 2 each time. So it starts at 12, but in the next frame it is at 2, then the next at 4, then 6 etc. Now you see it going in the same direction but twice as fast.</p>
<p>If you keep increasing the speed, you can get it to the point where it is moving REALLY fast. Let's say it goes 11 spaces each frame. So it starts at 12, then it goes almost all the way around up to 11. Then the next it goes almost all the way around up to 10, then 9 etc. When you play these frames quickly, your brain will actually interpret this as going slowly backwards, rather than really quickly forwards. 12, 11, 10, 9, 8...</p>
<p>This is basically what happens when you watch a car wheel accelerate. It looks to get faster and faster until it starts to appear to go backwards.</p>
<p>You can also get a point where it goes around at exactly one revolution per frame and it will look like the wheel is just sitting perfectly still.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
