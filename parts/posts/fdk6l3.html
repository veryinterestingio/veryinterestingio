		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tbh the ELI5 answer to this is that it's basically what its name suggests: it's where your T-cells become exhausted and cease to work.</p>
<p>I suppose the first thing to address though is what a T-cell is, and the answer is that it's a type of white blood cell thats role lies in dealing with mutant cells - i.e. cancer cells and those infected with viruses. </p>
<p>In terms of what causes T-cell exhaustion, it's a complex and not fully understood phenomenon but essentially if a viral infection is chronic and persistent enough then the T-cell's receptors are constantly being bombarded both by viral antigens (i.e. parts of the virus to which the T-cell is programmed to respond to) <em>and</em> by cytokines (hormones your body produces to direct an immune response). In the end it cannot respond any more to the &quot;on&quot; signals, and at the same time the physical state of the body is likely to be weak (low oxygen levels, poor nutrition, deranged acid levels etc.) which further impairs T-cell function. A combination of the two can start to lead to T-cell death or dysfunction where they either stop working altogether or start responding to the wrong things, so in response the body produces &quot;off&quot; signals to limit T-cell activity to prevent an auto-immune reaction. The T-cells cannot respond any more to the positive signal but do respond to the negative one, which in combination with already impaired function serves to further dampen their activity.</p>
<p>This combination is known as T-cell exhaustion and leads to impaired immune function, cell death due to overstimulation, poor control of the infection/tumour and progressive loss of other T-cell functions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
