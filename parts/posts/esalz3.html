		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Firstly, they put the microphones a reasonable distance from the speakers. And, secondly, they use various techniques to reduce this feedback. Sometimes they design directional microphones, but they require space that phone and computer designs can't provide. But they can include two microphones, and sound coming from different locations will arrive at different times.</p>
<p>Often they assume that the microphone will pick up audio from the speakers, so they just subtract the signals sent from the speakers from the sound picked up by the microphones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone is making this way more complicated than it really is. Remember that this was a problem way back with old timey candlestick and rotary telephones well before the invention of computers, fancy directional microphones, or any kind of digital processing. They had this solved pretty solidly by even the 1950s.</p>
<p>There is a kind of simple audio circuit called an echo suppressor. It simply listens to the signal traveling one way on an analog circuit and subtracts it from the signal traveling in the opposite direction. In this way, the sound waves coming from the speaker can be removed from the sound going into the microphone, while leaving the rest of the sound intact. This was usually done by the telephone company on their end, because they held open the full circuit loop on their switches and so knew the exact timing delay to look for. This could all be done physically in analog, and required no special software analysis.</p>
<p>Now that almost all voice communication occurs digitally, this can be done in software a lot more effectively. But the general concept is still the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Go into the mountain, say &quot;EEECHOOO&quot;, the mountain will respond with &quot;eeechooo&quot;. Notice it is a little bit late and a lot less loud. Now say &quot;POTATOOOO&quot; and the mountain respond with &quot;potatoooo&quot; notice it is exactly as late and exactly as quiet as for the previous one, just with the different sound?</p>
<p>Well, the computer try to predict how much of what it emit comes back and when, and subtracts it. This cancel out feedback loop, and echo, and sometimes even reverb (aka. no cathedral effect if you are in a cathedral).</p>
<p>It does not like if you move the speaker and/or mike around, as it assume the response don't change too much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the sound being recorded through the microphone is not played back through the speakers. It's not like a microphone connected to a PA system a band might use.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the answers.  I was thinking about it in a Skype like situation.  I notice when chatting with someone and looking at the input meter, when they're talking through my speakers there's 0 input into my mic, but when I talk or make some other sound in the room it shows a mic input.  I couldn't figure out if that was because of mic/speaker positioning or because it subtracts out the speaker output...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
