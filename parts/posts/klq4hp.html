		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 3 factors here:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's not burning like a fire or a combustion engine or a lighter. There is no oxygen in the sun (ok there is a very small amount, but not enough to burn like that).</li>
<li>It is hot because of nuclear fusion, which requires insanely high temperature and pressure. Fusion only occurs in the core of the sun, which is the inner 1/4 radius. That means only 1/64, or less than 2% of the star's volume is actually participating in the fusion. And even then, of the 2% that can, doesn't mean it is at all times. Fusion is slow.</li>
<li>It is insanely big. The sun takes up 99.9% of the solar system's mass. The rest--all the planets, moons, asteroids, etc.--are the remaining 0.1% it's big, and has a LOT of fuel.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I assume your question about why it doesn't &quot;explode&quot; is rooted in an image where the Sun expands, blowing hot gas out like a bomb going off on Earth.  The reason this does not happen is because of gravity.  The gravitational pull of all the stuff (mostly hydrogen) in the Sun holds it together.  It's also the interaction that drives the &quot;burning&quot; of fuel.  </p>
<p>It isn't really burning in the sense we typically think of the word - chemically combining elements with oxygen producing a flame.  The primary thing happening is hydrogen nuclei (protons) are being converted to helium nuclei (two protons + two neutrons).  This is nuclear fusion.  Nuclear reactions are tremendously powerful when compared to chemical reactions.  A handy unit for measuring these reactions is the electron-volt (eV).  The actual size of 1 eV is irrelevant for this.  What matters is a comparison.  Chemical reactions are a few eV per molecule changed.  Nuclear reactions are a few 100,000 eV per nucleus changed.</p>
<p>There is also a lot of stuff in the Sun - about 10^(30)  kg.  That's a 1 followed by thirty 0s.  Humans are about 10^(1) or 10^(2) kg.  The Earth is about 10^(24) kg.  The mass of the Sun is about a million times that of the Earth and the Earth is about a million-billion-billion times that of a human.</p>
<p>Taking these two together (a huge amount of energy per nuclear reaction, and a tremendous amount of stuff to react) means it takes a very long time to go through it all - roughly 10 billion years, which we're about halfway through.</p>
<p>Does this help answer your questions?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Sun is said to be in 'hydrostatic equilibrium.' It is a balance between the inward squeeze of gravity and the outward 'push' of thermal gas pressure. I'm simplifying here, but this is basically how it works.</p>
<ul>
<li>The power output of the core is determined by the core's pressure and temperature. The higher the pressure and/or temperature, the greater the power output. Increasing the core power output would tend to make the Sun expand due to an increase in temperature, except it is held at a steady temperature as you will see.</li>
<li>If the Sun expands, it will tend to decrease the core temperature. It's like a refrigerant passed through an expansion valve; expanding gasses cool. Decreasing the temperature decreases the thermal gas pressure, allowing gravity to collapse the Sun back down to the original size. See how it is self correcting?</li>
<li>If the Sun shrinks, it will tend to increase the core temperature. It's like the piston in a combustion engine; compressing the gas heats it. Increasing the temperature increases the thermal gas pressure, overcoming gravity to expand the Sun back to the original size. Again, it's self correcting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Putting it all together, the mass of the Sun determines the strength of gravity squeezing it down, nuclear physics determines the power output of the core, depending on the temperature/pressure profile depending on the gas physics. The Sun is a self-regulating, self-gravitating ball of gas held up by nuclear fusion.</p>
<p>The Sun's size and core temperature are maintained at a point where gravity and thermal pressure are balanced. Any departure from that equilibrium point is naturally corrected by physics to maintain a steady size and core power output. Since hydrogen fusion is a very energy efficient form of power generation, and since the Sun has a whole lot of fuel, the Sun can continue this process for billions of years before it starts the run out of fuel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a constant tug-of-war between the sun's gravity trying to collapse itself, and the pressure of hot gasses trying to expand itself. A star is stable as long as no one wins.</p>
<p>In a lighter star, like our sun, this continues for longer - because there's lesser gravitational force at the core - so, slower rate of fusion (and only upto Helium fusion) - gaseous pressure eventually wins, creating a red giant -&gt; white dwarf. And in a heavier star, gravity wins - the star goes supernova - a neutron star or black hole is left behind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
