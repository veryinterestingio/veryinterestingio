		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thereâ€™s a really interesting 2008 study from Newcastle University suggesting that men actually inherit a genetic tendency to father more sons or daughters from their parents. That would make the X-Y sperm ratio different for each man. The study looked at 927 family trees in North America and Europe going back to 1600 to draw those conclusions.

TWH states that socioeconomic status influences sex ratios. Its introduction section points out papers that have previously examined this in human as well as non-human populations. </p>
<p>Other factors have been claimed to affect this (testicular temperature etc), though I have yet to see peer reviewed results substantiating such claims.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
