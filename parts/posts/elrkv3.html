		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd recommend checking out the <a href="https://cdn.britannica.com/46/6046-050-D533C3B3/energies-function-atomic-mass-number.jpg" target="_blank">graph of nuclear binding energies</a>. As you can see, there's a peak in that graph, approximately near iron (^(56)Fe). If you want to produce energy, you need to increase the binding energy in a nucleus. This is not very intuitive, but the reason for this is that the binding energy is a negative component in the total energy of the system. If it increases, the total energy decreases, and the difference in energy is released.</p>
<p>So, if you are on the left side of the peak, you can get to higher binding energies by fusing nuclei (i.e. moving to higher mass numbers). This is why fusion is generally performed with very light materials like hydrogen and helium. Meanwhile, if you're on the right side of the peak, you can get to higher binding energies by splitting nuclei (i.e. moving to lower mass numbers). Since uranium is much heavier than iron, you can get energy from it through fission.</p>
<p>This graph will also explain to you why people like nuclear fusion so much: there is a LOT more energy to be gained from hydrogen than from uranium, and hydrogen is easier to obtain as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR: It's a Goldilocks problem. Hydrogen is too small and Uranium is too big but Iron is juuust right, so doing something that gets you closer to Iron releases energy.</p>
<p>The center of atoms are made of protons and neutrons(collectively called nucleons), which are held together by &quot;pion bonds&quot;. </p>
<p>If you have a few nucleons, you get a few bonds between them. If you have more nucleons  you get more bonds. More bonds hold the nucleus together better and make it more stable. At first, the amount of new bonds you get increases with each additional nucleon. 2 nucleons have 1 pairing, 3 have 3, 4 have 10, 5 have 15, etc. So each additional nucleon adds more and more stability. </p>
<p>However, theres a limit to the  amount of bonds a nucleon can make with others in a given timeframe, so eventually you start to saturate and adding more nucleons starts helping less and less because you're not increasing the amount of bonds as much. </p>
<p>At the same time though, every time you add a new nucleon your atom gets bigger and &quot;heavier&quot; so to speak. The protons all repel away from eachother and strain against the bonds to try and escape, and the neutrons are inherently unstable and rely on the bonds with the protons to stabilize them. So the more nucleons you add the more unstable you get.</p>
<p>When you do fusion, you put two small atoms together to get a bigger atom. In this case adding more nucleons makes a lot more bonds,  and the added stability of that outweighs the instability of making the atom bigger. </p>
<p>When you do fission, you break a big atom into smaller atoms. In this case you gain a lot of stability from reducing the nucleon count, but you dont lose as much from breaking the pion bonds since you still have enough to keep all your protons and neutrons &quot;saturated&quot;.</p>
<p>Going from less to more stable releases energy, because you need less energy to hold together a stable atom, and the excess gets let go. Thats why fusion and fission both release energy. </p>
<p>If you tried to do fusion with big elements like Uranium, or fission on small elements like Helium, the opposite would happen, and you wouldn't release energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Releasing energy in this case means that the particles are moving faster afterwards. For both processes you have two competing forces. The strong force is attractive between the particles and there is electrostatic repulsion between the protons. For fission of large nuclei, the splitting involves a very large electrostatic repulsion so the particles fly away very quickly from each other. For fusion of small nuclei, there is repulsion but the attractive forces of the strong nuclear force cause a greater increase in speed than the decrease from the repulsion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Fission is energy-positive when done with heavy elements, whereas fusion is energy-positive when done with light elements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
