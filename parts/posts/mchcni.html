		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Allegations have come to light regarding the recently hired Reddit admin, who shall not be named, that she willingly associates with child abusers and rapists. Additionally, there is evidence that Reddit is abusing their platform to stifle legitimate discussion of these allegations. More information can be found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Blank-Cheque/comments/mbmthf/why_is_this_subreddit_private_see_here_for_answers/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Given the seriousness of this issue, we are joining other subreddits in asking for Reddit's administration to explain their justification for hiring her. We would also like to see her removed, as we feel that her employment with Reddit stands against the values that Reddit users believe in.</p>
<p>If Reddit does not remedy this situation and/or offer an adequate explanation for their actions by 2021/03/26 12:00 GMT, ELI5 will be set to Private in protest.</p>
<p>We hope our users will support our actions and stand in solidarity with us and the other subreddits that are looking for answers.</p>
<p>Edit: please do not award this post.</p></div></div>
