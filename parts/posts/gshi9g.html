		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I'm a quantum optician so hopefully I can answer In a bit more detail than the other answers. In the normal case, <strong>they do not interact at all!</strong>  This is actually the case for most waves. You can try it with a slinky if you want and you can see that if you fire two waves towards each other they just go straight past each other. The other commenters have talked about interference. This is actually a manifestation of their non-interaction, they simply add together without interacting. However, if the light is travelling through an object (in my experiment we use a ball of very cold atoms), then you can have a <strong>non-linearity.</strong>  If the system is non-linear, then your photons can be said to interact with each other, but this is normally not nearly as dramatic as bouncing off each other! </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But I think the crucial point is that interference isn't really interaction, it is just the result of two non-interacting photons being in the same place! Optical cavities as referred to by /u/iorgfeflkd is a great example of interference, but the photons in their still cannot be said to interact unless you add something to the optical cavity. (fun side note, this is what a laser is! It's an optical cavity with a non-linear medium  in it!)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On a macroscopic scale, you can shine two laser beams through each other and you'll get an interference pattern. You can in principle use a partially reflective mirrored cavity to fire in lasers from opposite sides and create what is essentially an electromagnetic standing wave.</p>
<p>At the particle level, high-energy photons can interact with each other by creating positron-electron pairs, having the pairs interact, and then annihilate back into photons that might have slightly different trajectories while still overall conserving momentum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the photon energy. If they have 511 keV each or more, they can either not interact, they can do an elastic collision or they turn into an electron-positron pair. So you need really hard X-rays for that. For even higher photon energy, the creation of heavier particles is possible. Lower energy photons are unlikely to collide at all, but if they do they just do an elastic collision. Theoretically some or all of their energy can be carried away by a creation of a neutrino pair, but this is so extremely unlikely that you would never see it in a lab.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The answer, to your question, according to quantum field theory is best understood by first considering a single photon on its own. It actually doesn't need to interact with any other particle in order to undergo some change - it can spontaneously split into a positron-electron pair.</p>
<p>Two photons can never actually 'interact' with one another in the way that two electrons could (because electrons interact via electromagnetism, the photons can't interact in that way or any other way because they carry no charge). </p>
<p>But, what happens is that if you do have two photons, then one of them can spontaneously split into a positron/electron pair - and meanwhile, the other one does the same, what you can then have happen is that those daughter positrons/electrons interact. Later on, they have a chance of 'recombining' again to turn back into photons.</p>
<p>An illustration of this process is seen in <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z7feH.png" target="_blank">this Feynman diagram</a> where the wavy lines coming in on the left hand side are incoming photons, the solid lines are positrons/electrons that they both sorta transform into during the interaction, and (sort of) recombine on the right hand side into photons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
