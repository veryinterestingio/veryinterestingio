		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I own many a snail- they move like this whenever they are attempting to conserve their mucus. </p>
<p>On a wet path, like a soaked piece of wood or moist soil, their slime trails will be continuous. On a surface like concrete, or even human skin, they will probably turn to their mucus-conserving mode of motion, arcing their bodies into an S shape. Both of these modes of moving involve the snail using waves of contractions of the muscles on the bottom of the foot; the conserving version involves lifting itself as well.</p>
<p>The consequences of failing to conserve mucus can be lethal for the snail; they can’t dry out before they can reach another source of moisture. Therefore, they’ll do this on dry, warm surfaces, especially if they’re in the sun.</p>
<p>Here’s a paper discussing their modes of locomotion and how it relates to the surface they’re on: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23493509/" target="_blank">link</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Edit* I guess it’s called jumping.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have a complete answer, but I just wanted to note that the mucus is used for stickiness more than slipperiness. A snail can move horizontally without mucus but it can't climb vertically without it. A snail moves by rapidly contracting the muscle on its underside in an undulating motion. I'm guessing this pattern is coming from where it makes the most contact with the ground on contractions and it does so in a regular pattern.</p>
<p>EDIT: mucus not mucous - thanks /u/Updatebjarni!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How does a one-legged animal walk on glue? Turns out that snail mucus has some super interesting properties. &quot;the mucus is a viscoelastic solid at small deformation and shows a sharp yield point; then, at greater strains, the mucus is a viscous liquid, although it will recover its solidity if allowed to heal for a certain period&quot;. So it is like glue and lubricant at the same time, depending on the pressure it's under from the snail's oscillating underside. Pretty cool. I read about this when I was a kid in the 80's, but here is link from 2014: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24631870/" target="_blank">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24631870/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
