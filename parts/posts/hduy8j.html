		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of a popsicle they get that frosty texture/look when you bite into it, that's all the sugar in between water molecules, if there was less sugar it would freeze more like ice and solid. Bananas have a lot of substrates in it compared to water content to prevent the water molecules from sticking to each other and freezing hard which is what happens in those other fruits like strawberry, blueberrys, etc. Also the more ripe it gets the more sugar and less fibers it has to help it from freezing solid. But that being said you can still freeze a banana solid, it just takes longer, I've definitely had bananas that have gone all black that I've frozen to save for banana bread</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bananas are more fibrous which keeps ice crystals small, which is how it stays creamy while frozen. Ice cream is churned during the manufacturing process which achieves this same result. Other fruits that are less fibrous will turn into slushes when frozen (like popsicles instead of ice cream)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you bite into a frozen fruit, you may not like the texture because all of the cell walls have been broken. Cell walls are something plants have that usually help them to stay rigid, and you can think of them like a water bottle. If you freeze a water bottle the water expands and may burst the bottle. Cell walls are like that too. Freezing the fruit causes many of those individual cells to freeze and break down, so the texture is weird and full of little ice crystals.</p>
<p>The change in texture and the way temperature affects flavor are why you may perceive the fruits as being flavorless. Fruits higher in water content may have more difference in texture before and after being frozen. Fruits higher in sugar are easier to taste after being frozen because sugar tastes similar cold.</p>
<p>Try this: blend your frozen fruit (particularly berries) with a few splashes of orange juice, just enough juice as you need to blend it up. You'll get a thick, creamy sorbet that tastes really good. That's because you're eliminating that weird, busted frozen cell texture and boosting the sour frutiness with the orange juice.</p>
<p>Alternatively, blend your fruit up and freeze it as ice pops. Also good!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
