		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The energy consumption of your brain is more or less constant, so it's meaningless to include it in most calculations. Thinking harder does not appreciably change the amount of energy your brain uses, but running harder dramatically increases the amount of energy your muscles are using.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Energy consumption by the brain is factored into your caloric needs, as part of your Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR). If you laid in bed all day doing absolutely nothing, an average sized person burns about 1300 calories. You can calculate your actual RMR using a formula that takes height, bodyweight, and gender into account. The calories your brain burns are included in that number, and amounts to approximately 300 calories. If you are up and active during the day, moving around and using your muscles, you burn a few hundred additional calories.  Vigorous exercise will burn more calories. So if you are counting calories, you will add up your RMR plus any additional exercises you did. For an average person, this should be close to 2000 calories per day.</p>
<p>So, why doesn't the brain burn more calories when we think harder, just like when you work your muscles harder? Well it does, it's just not a lot. Our brains are highly efficient--normally your brain burns 0.2 calories per minute. If you are thinking really, really hard (imagine doing a really difficult puzzle or a hard math problem), your brain can burn up to 1 calorie per minute. However, most of us don't spend that much time every day thinking as hard as we can. We get mental fatigue-- ever feel like you were in a daze after taking a hard test? Our brains are lazy. Even for people with challenging jobs and schoolwork, over time your brain gets used to the effort of thinking hard and doesnt need to use as much energy to accomplish the same tasks (just like if your muscles get stronger and it's easier to lift a weight up). </p>
<p>So if you were to spend an hour thinking as hard as you can and challenging your brain, you would only burn 60 extra calories, or 3% more calories than normal (based on a daily consumption of 2000 calories). Running and other intense exercise can burn up to 10 calories per minute, so you could burn the same number of calories in 6 minutes of vigorous exercise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain only uses sugars for fuel. Brain cells are like the Ferraris of human cells so they only want a certain type of fuel. Other cells can run off of other types of molecules. So if you’re counting tissue types that would use fat as fuel you wouldn’t include brain cells. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
