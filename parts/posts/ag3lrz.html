		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A good question. Why can you infect milk with bacteria and get yogurt instead of spoiled milk? Why does Italian dry salami keep without refrigeration even though it's inoculated with lactic bacteria for tartness? </p>
<p>The answer is &quot;competition&quot;. Food on the countertop is up for grabs by any bacteria, insects, fungus, or animals that can get to it. It can become a battleground as single celled organisms battle it out for who gets the food. Because the war starts with everybody on equal footing. Nobody has an initial advantage. </p>
<p>When you have food stuck between your teeth though, the bacteria in your mouth have a home field advantage, and can quickly coat the piece of food, similar to inoculating a petri dish with bacteria. Thus by the time other bacteria or fungus can finally make it into your mouth to find the food, there is already an entrenched army of mouth microbes dug in and ready to battle it out. You also have fungus growing in your mouth as well, but it's kept in check by the bacteria, which is kept in check by the fungus. Sometimes when someone takes antibiotics, it kills the bacteria, giving the fungus an advantage, and it reproduces so well you end up with a layer of thrush on your tongue. It's all about balance and playing one side off the other. </p>
<p>The same happens when you ferment beer or leaven bread. You introduce a preferred organism like yeast, and give it a good place to reproduce rapidly, and it in turn will defend the food from other microbes. </p>
<p>Don't forget that penicillin is a drug derived from a strain of fungus that had developed it in order to fight off bacteria that competed for the same food and habitat. Microorganisms fight each other all of the time for food and shelter. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your mouth and saliva have all kinds of enzymes and bacteria that inhibit the growth of other ‘germs’.</p>
<p>So while the piece of meat will continue to decompose between your teeth, the amount of potentially harmful bacteria that grow on it will be significantly less than the amount of bacteria that can grow on a piece of meat that is left on the counter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally, you won't. Food safety rules are extraordinarily conservative, for good reason, but violating them rarely leads to bad outcomes. It's a population-level thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best ELI5 answer would likely be because your body can fight that little bit of germs. If you left a piece of cooked meat on the counter that was small enough to fit between your teeth, you could eat that too and be fine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There could be a few reasons. </p>
<p><strong>NUMBER OF BACTERIA</strong></p>
<p>First let's keep in mind that the piece stuck in your teeth is tiny so probably doesn't have a lot of bacteria on it. Whereas the huge chunk of meat on the counter will probably have more bacteria that continue to grow and reproduce because they are sitting at a temperature that makes them happy.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that bacteria reproduce fast and each bacteria divides meaning 2 bacteria can become 1024 bacteria after 10 rounds of dividing. </p>
<p>The number of bacteria that you actually end up eating can be a big deciding factor in whether you get sick or not most of the time. There are some exceptional cases like <em>Shigella</em> though where you can get sick from eating justa couple of bacteria.</p>
<p><strong>NATURAL FLORA</strong></p>
<p>Your natural flora is basically all the other living organisms that are in your body. Your mouth and teeth have a lot of flora (mostly bacteria). These bacteria will already dominate the space of the mouth so will gobble up most of the nutrients meaning the bacteria on the meat don't get a chance to eat.</p>
<p>Your natural flora can also release certain things to kill other bacteria who are trying to invade the space. </p>
<p><strong>IMMUNE SYSTEM</strong></p>
<p>Your body is always preventing baddies from getting in and infecting you. Your skin (and the surfaces of your mouth) act as a barrier. Saliva has things in it that will help breakdown bacteria. </p>
<p>If the bacteria in your teeth meat tried to invade any cells</p>
<p>The bacteria on the meat on the counter however, get to happily divide with little risk so aren't kept in check.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
