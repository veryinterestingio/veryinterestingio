		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body needs energy. You get energy by eating food. Your body takes the energy from food, but it can't use all of it so you poop the waste out.</p>
<p>The different parts of your body are like little mini bodies. They take in energy but then make waste. If too much waste builds up too quickly then that part gets tired. You need time and rest to clear which part of your body you are using.</p>
<p>Your brain is what you use for thinking. When you think hard or have to focus, that means you use up more energy. If you use more energy you will make more waste. But the brain is a little different compared to other parts of your body. It can't clear up the waste very fast from resting alone, you need to sleep to clear the waste up faster. </p>
<p>And that's why you need to sleep. You make brain poop when you think and you need to sleep to make the poop get out of your brain. </p>
<p>For more detailed explanation, see this paper: <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6156/373" target="_blank">https://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6156/373</a></p>
<p>EDIT: Thank you all for the awards and the amusing comments. It's a good reception for my first ELI5 attempt.</p>
<p>I remembered that one of the co-authors of the paper actually gave a TED talk on this topic. He makes it fairly digestible: <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_iliff_one_more_reason_to_get_a_good_night_s_sleep" target="_blank">https://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_iliff_one_more_reason_to_get_a_good_night_s_sleep</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Constant stresses throughout the day can overwhelm a person's ability to process them, especially if left unattended. This is basically a mild form of &quot;Burnout.&quot; There is a lot of <a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/burnout-and-the-brain" target="_blank">scientific research for burnout</a> if you're interested.</p>
<p>Basically though, stress can make you tired. There's still a lot of research to do as to why, but here is the leading theory:</p>
<p>The brain needs to rest, but stress triggers constant fight/flight responses, so it is unable rest because it is constantly aroused at a neurochemical level. This is also why various forms of brain rest e.g. napping and meditation are often used to prevent mental fatigue and burnout.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm interested in this question.  I think OP is specifically talking about a &quot;long day&quot; mental fatigue, not a &quot;my life is in shambles&quot; because of a poor diet, mental illness, etc type of fatigue.  Really, the post begs the question: &quot;when working hard during the day, making lots of choices and decisions, what can I do to maintain strong performance?&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well like all brain chemistry its a complicated mess that we arent too sure of. However, the current idea is that your brain uses glucose in order to process new information, or when you are actively trying to learn something. So eventually you will run out of glucose when you use your brain too much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The brain just like your muscles has a mechanism to protect itself from damage. You can trick your brain and go beyond your normal capacity though, just like you can always push a lit bit harder physically, but the risk of damage or injury increases. </p>
<p>Here's a bit of detail: when your brain uses ATP molecules to power itself, the molecule is cleaved into 3 phosphate molecules and the adenosine part is leftover. This adenosine part then gets to receptor sites -- shaped to accommodate this specific molecule -- and activates them, and this causes the feeling of drowsiness and mental fatigue. So this is essentially a safety mechanism in your brain, similar to how your muscles will not be able to work over a certain threshold to prevent physical injury. It is always possible to go beyond your physical or mental capacity through external aides, but there is risk of damage. Things like caffeine just mimic the adenosine molecule, and block the receptor sites, allowing you to work for longer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
