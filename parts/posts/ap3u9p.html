		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The rather hand-waving explanation is this: When you go faster, the molecules hit you harder, so there is one factor of v. But also, your path per second is longer so you go through more air, which gives another proportionality to v. Hence v^2.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From Taylor's Classical Mechanics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The function <em>f(v)</em> that gives the magnitude of the air resistance varies with <em>v</em> in a complicated way, especially as the object's speed approaches the speed of sound. However, at lower speeds it is often a good approximation to write *f(v) = bv + cv*<em>^(2)</em> <em>= f_lin + f_quad</em>, where <em>f_lin</em> and <em>f_quad</em>  stand for the linear and quadratic terms respectively.  </p>
<p>...  </p>
<p>Mathematically, [this] equation is, in a sense, obvious. Any reasonable function is expected to have a Taylor series expansion, *f = a + bv + cv*<em>^(2)</em> <em>+ ...</em>. For low enough <em>v</em>, the first three terms should give a good approximation, and, since <em>f = 0</em> when <em>v = 0</em>, the constant term, <em>a</em>, has to be zero.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to explain that the quadratic term &quot;arises from the projectile's having to accelerate the mass of air with which it is continually colliding; <em>f_quad</em> is proportional to the density of the medium and the cross-sectional area of the projectile.&quot;</p>
<p>So to summarize, air resistance is non-linear, and the first two terms of the Taylor series expansion can be attributed to the viscosity (linear) and the density (quadratic) of the medium.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You could think of it this way (reasonably mathematical, but whatever)</p>
<p>The dimensions (ie. Units you measure with) of force (air resistance) are kg*m/(t^2) ie there is one over time squared. If you agree that the air resistance shouldn't depend on acceleration or higher derivatives of position, then the only way you get get dimensions of 1/time^2 is by having velocity squared (as this would be contributing (length^2)/(time^2). Hope that helps?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you're pushing an object through any gas. For the moment let's assume the gas is at low temperature (so that the molecules are all nearly stationary with respect to the object). What's the physics that creates a force on the object? Well, when the object collides with molecules, it pushes them away, and they push back, which causes the resistance to motion.</p>
<p>Let's put this slightly better: the force, which is the impulse per unit time, must be directly proportional to the number of collisions per unit time, multiplied by the impulse due to a single collision. Let's keep this in mind; we'll call it result (1).</p>
<p>Now, what's the number of collisions in time delta_t? Why, it's the density of the gas times the volume covered in that time delta_t; this is a cylinder-like object with its cross section equal to the cross-section of the object, and its length equal to the speed of the object times delta_t. With me so far? We'll call this result (2).</p>
<p>Now consider a collision of the large object with a single air molecule. If the collision is elastic (i.e. no energy is lost to heat etc.), it imparts an impulse that is directly proportional to the speed of the object. (Recall that impulse = change in momentum of the single air molecule.) Let's call this result (3).</p>
<p>Recall from (1) that the force is directly proportional to the product of two things. In (2) and (3), we have shown that each of these two things is proportional to the speed of the object. Thus it follows that the force should be proportional to the speed squared.</p>
<p>Of course, in a realistic scenario things are not nearly as straightforward. For instance, collisions are generally in more than one dimension; not all molecules &quot;bounce&quot; back in a straight line. Specifically, if you have laminar flow in a fluid, then the motion of molecules is not random, and the momentum imparted in a single &quot;collision&quot; is different. But that's a story for another time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gases work like billiard balls to a pretty good approximation. Since your mass is much larger than the air's, you can model air resistance as elastic collisions with a large mass. The velocity obtained by a stationary particle in your way will be 2v, twice your velocity.</p>
<p>The energy each particle gains is therefore 1/2 m(2v)^2 = 2mv^2 , i.e. it scales with your velocity squared. Since you have a bunch of particles in your path, you are going to have an increasing number of those collisions proportionally to your velocity. Thus the average power lost to collisions will be: P = k <em> 2mv^2 </em> v, where k is some constant giving the number of particles expected within a path per unit length. That gives P = 2k mv^3</p>
<p>Finally, we note that power is force times velocity: P = F * v ^[1] . So the force must be F = k.2.m v^2 , i.e. proportional to velocity squared. The factor k.2.m is a &quot;air resistance constant&quot; that is proportional to how large you are (your frontal area), how many particles per unit volume there are, and what is the mass of individual particle (i.e. the density of gas).</p>
