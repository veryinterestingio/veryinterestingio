		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Due to conservation of energy, you cannot do work without expending energy. Your brain uses upwards of 20% of the total energy demand of your bodies resting metabolism. Unfortunately for you, the simple act of thinking harder only appear to increase the brains demand on energy a tiny amount, as only the small portions of the brain that are activated during the task exhibit any increase in energy consumption. </p>
<p>Depending on the type of thinking, you may also stress yourself out, which would lead to additional energy costs. Think of an exam scenario, if you go in well prepared, you can come out feeling fine. Go in unsure and by the end you will feel like you just ran a marathon.</p>
<p>The latter has a much larger increase from base metabolism because you are activating muscle groups and creating more work (clenching your jaw, elevated heart rate, etc)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In an academic sense, yes—the very tiny amount of energy needed for activation has to come from somewhere, so if you compare &quot;sitting, idle, thinking&quot; to &quot;sitting, idle, not thinking,&quot; there <em>must</em> be some amount of extra energy.</p>
<p>But in a practical sense, with amounts being at all meaningful relative to your total energy expenditure? No, not at all. In fact, because we conflate mental fatigue and physical fatigue, we're likely to move less and thus end up using <em>less</em> net energy after a lot of hard thinking.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Almost all reactions and processes your body does require energy in the form of calories. For thinking, this involves sending electrical signals down through the cells in the form of charged ions. In order to move these to the correct positions, the cell needs to use energy (calories).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Every action burns calories. I don’t think it is measurable or differentiable from other basic calorie burning activities of the body, though. The body has a Basal Metabolic Rate (BML) which is the calories you burn by laying there doing absolutely nothing. Since your body is basically always thinking, the calories consumed by thinking would be part of your BML (along with your heart beating, breathing, sweating, and even things like nails growing). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
