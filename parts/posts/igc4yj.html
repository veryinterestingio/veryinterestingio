		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most bodily functions have a ‚Äúsatisfying‚Äù effect when they‚Äôre completed successfully, and a discomfort if they aren‚Äôt. In the case of sneezing it‚Äôs really noticeable because there‚Äôs a big buildup (ah ah ah as you‚Äôre breathing in) and a big ‚Äúpayoff‚Äù that happens over a short amount of time - you could compare it to an orgasm in that way. Plus, it‚Äôs pretty common for a sneeze to be interrupted. Imagine if you tried to swallow and your body began the process but didn‚Äôt finish it? It‚Äôd be pretty uncomfortable/unsatisfying, but it hardly ever happens.</p>
<p>Edit: wow thanks for the award and all the comments everyone! I don‚Äôt think I can answer all these, but I‚Äôm glad to see my explanation got some discussion started üòÖ edit again: I thought you were supposed to thank people for awards to be POLITE haha my bad</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>More than any other natural function, a sneeze approximates
an orgasm. It brings with it release, at least temporary</p>
<p>To sneeze is to scratch an itch... The release accorded by a sneeze goes far beyond the area most obviously affected, i.e., the nose. Like an orgasm, it is profound in its totality.  </p>

<p>Personally I have to agree with him on this.  The build up and release of a sneeze is orgasmic.  That's where the annoyance comes from, you are not getting the release.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
