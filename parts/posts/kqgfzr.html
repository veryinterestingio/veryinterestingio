		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the launcher and how its setup</p>
<p>For some games you're downloading an installer which has all the files packed down into a smaller size.  The installer opens its box and unpacks all the files into the right spots.  The update is meant to update an already unpacked set of files so you can't just run the updater on the installer and get a fresh file you have to rebuild the installer with the fully updated game files but this new installer would need to be tested which takes longer than just releasing and testing a single installer and then releasing and testing each update on the common installer.</p>
<p>After a while though the installer will be patched with the previous updates so downloading the installer a year after launch will generally include the majority of the updates until that point so you don't need to download the Day 0 and every friday patch for the last year.</p>
<p>Quickly releasing updates results in a clunkier user experience, and a smooth user experience inherently slows down the release schedule.  You have to pick one to prioritize.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Machine works on instructions, so imagine the game is a bowl of cereal. The instructions to &quot;install&quot; it is to get a bowl, put cereal in it, and milk. Making the installer, or the &quot;recipe&quot; takes time and effort, so when the developers want to add fruit in the recipe, they just append a new instruction to the installer: &quot;after making the bowl of cereal, put fruits in it&quot;. That new instruction is called a &quot;patch&quot;, and can have many instructions</p>
<p>That way, the team doing the game donesn't need to change the initial installer, but to append new &quot;patches&quot; to it.</p>
<p>Some could say this is lazy work, but it is a business decision, generally</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What game companies usually do it upload the finished game to the gamestore (stream, psn, or whatever u use) days or weeks before it's official release to make sure that the game can be released on time. </p>
<p>After it's uploaded there is still time until the release to fix bugs and add content so those will be uploaded afterwards as an update. There is usually not enough time to reupload the whole game with the patch applied because that would require the game to be recompiled completely, which takes a lot of time to do. </p>
<p>That's how you end up with day one patches and stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of these responses are in the right ballpark, but miss the major point:  Every variation on an install sequence introduces more ways in which the install can break.  And it makes debugging future problems harder to have multiple paths to your current state.  So for simplicity, the devs want to assume you are in state #0 (initial release) and then you transit in a controlled way from state #0 to state #1, and so on.  If it was all just data transfer, this would be simple.  But the installs involve sequences of executed instructions that depend, for instance, on your OS version and drivers, and itâ€™s much more error-prone to try and arrive at the same state along multiple routes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like driving directions.</p>
<p>The initial game is directions from Point A to Point B.  Subsequent patches are directions from Point B to C, point C to D and on and on.</p>
<p>Sure, the developer could create a brand new set of instructions directly from Point A to point D (or whatever we're on) ... but it requires extra work, and extra testing.</p>
<p>The path from A to B to C, etc. is already verified to work, so it's easier just to stick with it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
