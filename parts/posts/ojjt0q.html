		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is based on the capacitance of the finger. The technology is quite similar to modern touch screen technology which is only able to detect fingers but not gloves. Wood is usually too dry for the sensors to trigger and the metal is too small for it to trigger. This is of course something the designers have to take into consideration. Possibly the hardest thing you can put in them is soaking wet wood for example if you are sawing raw lumber out in the rain but they have apparently been able to set the sensors to handle this as well. However as the SawStop patent is about to expire and competing products have already been shown to the market as being much cheaper to trigger there might be some advantage to triggering on metal as well protecting the blade.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's an electric current running through them. Your body conducts electricity, wood kinda doesn't. As soon as it makes contact with you, the electric signal pulls the blade away. As fast as electricity can react, which is why in the ads you see people will barely have a scratch on them</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Contrary to most answers here. Devices like SawStop use captive sensing not resistive.</p>
<p>Simply touching the blade does not make you part of any circuit. Doing so would also be a safety risk since any malfunction of the device could send more current down your body than is safe. </p>
<p>Instead they use captive sensing. The circuit monitors the capacitance of the blade and when something with high capacitance is added to the blade it can be detected without any significant current passing. The blade has a known capacitance that is tested when powered up. If that changes say more than 10%, fire the safety mechanism. <a href="https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/CapacitiveSensor/" target="_blank">Here is a tutorial if you are curious.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
