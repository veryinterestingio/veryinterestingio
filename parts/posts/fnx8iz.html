Humans have a long history with plagues but I’ve never heard of marine life being effected by that.  Thanks for your time!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sea star wasting disease has been a big one the last few years in the PNW, <em>Pycnopodia helianthoides</em> (Sunflower star) have been especially hard hit, becoming functionally eliminated in many areas; other species (ie. <em>Pisaster ochraceous</em> and <em>brevispinus</em>) have also been significantly impacted, but to a lesser degreee. </p>
<p>Similar name, there is also a Seagrass wasting disease. It caused large scale die-offs of <em>Zostera marina</em>  beds on the Atlantic coast of the US in the early 1900s. </p>
<p>I’m sure there are many more, these are just the two I’m personally familiar with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another issue for freshwater has been didymo, or rock snot. Didymosphenia geminata is an invasive diatom that grows in low temperature,  low nutrient waters and can be spread through a single drop of water or by being stuck to a felt-soled water and brought from one waterbody to another. It can stick to recreational gear and be transferred easily from water to water. It causes a lot of difficulties for the native inhabitants of a body of water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There is a disease called Viral Hemorhaggic Septicemia caused by Piscine novirhabdovirus, and is present in the northern hemisphere. It is thought to have originated in western Europe, infecting salmonids. It has spread across the northern hemisphere and now there are various strains that infect both freshwater and marine fish species. </p>
<p>It causes the internal organs, muscles, and skin to hemorrhage. Other signs of the infection include open sores, bloating, discoloration of the eyes, skin, gills and fins. </p>
<p>It can be transmitted through water transfer, baitfish from infected waters, and contaminated eggs. Where I am, it is very easily spread through a baitfish species, the emerald shiner. That is why it is actually illegal to use uncertified baitfish (certified meaning that the fish are clean and free of known diseases, infections, and microinvasives, uncertified being the opposite).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I study diseases in coral, particularly in the Caribbean. We’ve been aware of disease outbreaks since at least the 1970s, but are still uncertain of the exact cause of many of them. The sea fan mortality event of the 1990s is a relatively well understood epidemic, caused by a fungal pathogen aspergillus. </p>
<p>Florida has recently been devastated by a disease known as Stoney Coral Tissue Loss Disease (SCTLD). More than half of the species of hard coral are susceptible, and colony morality rates are higher than 90% for some species. What’s also scary about SCTLD is that some types of coral that we have never seen getting sick are dying from this disease. Starting last year, other places outside of Florida are starting to report cases of the disease :(</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aside from the coral and sea star and various other diseases that have already been covered here, the very water itself of the open ocean is home to a  constantly raging pandemic battle between bacteria and bacteriophages. Here's a good PDF, which I'll summarize</p>
<p><a href="http://sihua.ivyunion.org/QT/Phage%20puppet%20masters%20of%20the%20marine%20microbial%20realm.pdf" target="_blank">http://sihua.ivyunion.org/QT/Phage%20puppet%20masters%20of%20the%20marine%20microbial%20realm.pdf</a></p>
<p>There are about ten million viruses per milliliter of ocean water.   They play an important role in something called the microbial loop.  Basically, at the very base of the food chain a big proportion of energy never gets passed up to larger organisms, but instead gets cycled around between microbes.  What happens is that viruses infect and lyse (explode) bacterial cells, and their guts spill out in to the water and become dissolved organic carbon (DOC).  This is taken up by other microbes.  Viruses are very important for DOC levels...about a quarter of all bacteria are infected and about a quarter of all bacterial production gets shunted out into DOC pool by viruses.  And even the virus particles themselves are important reservoirs for certain nutrients in certain situations.   </p>
<p>Aside from spilling bacterial guts everywhere, viruses also change how the bacteria they infect metabolize, which probably alters how the base of the food chain takes up various nutrients.  And they play a role in regulating the population dynamics of bacteria in the ocean.  If one species increases in numbers, the phages that infect it will increase in numbers.  This will decrease the bacterial numbers again.  This &quot;kill the winner&quot; process probably helps keep bacterial diversity higher by ensuring no species can really come to dominate and exclude all its competitors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
