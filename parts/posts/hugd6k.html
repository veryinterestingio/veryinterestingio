		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been reading that Neanderthal DNA is now found in all populations on Earth, including, as it was recently discovered, African populations. I'm confused about this wording.</p>
<p>Does that mean every single person you test on Earth will have Neanderthal DNA?</p>
<p>Or does this mean that Neanderthal DNA is found in all populations, but not everyone in those populations will necessarily have Neanderthal DNA?</p>
<p>Thanks</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I concur with meatpierogie. The latest evidence I have read shows that at some time between 381,000 and 473,000 (based on mitochondrial dna) the Denisovans and Neanderthal subspecies diverged. Also, Neanderthals and Homo sapiens diverged between 430,000 and 765,000 years ago. I do not know why this figure has not been updated to show a more accurate measure. Graham Hancock's book America Before talks about this on page 108. He has scores and scores of scientific sources cited in his bibliography.</p>
<p>Up until roughly 25,000 years ago (I think) when Neanderthals went extinct, all 3 of these sub species were interbreeding, producing viable offspring with all sorts of DNA mixes. So, as meatpierogie stated, some populations have more Neanderthal DNA and some have extremely little, based on geographical locations over the last many thousand years. For instance, modern day Polynesians have the most Denisovan DNA (again, America Before shows these citations).</p>
<p>One last thing to note. Some theories claim there are even more subspecies to be properly identified. I recently saw a statement where someone said a total of &quot;seven subspecies&quot; including homo sapiens.</p>
<p>TLDR: For a few hundred thousand years Denisovans, Neanderthals and humans interbred and mixed DNA. Different populations have differing amounts of that DNA.</p>
