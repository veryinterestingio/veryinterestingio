		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's actually a phenomenon called polar gigantism, where marine invertebrates (mostly arthropods) in the high oxygen-low temperature polar environment in tend to be quite a bit larger than their warm water counterparts. It's a really interesting subject! It's believed that the higher oxygen levels in the cold water plays a role in the size difference, but overall it's not 100% known as to why there is such a difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You also have to consider how much phenotypic plasticity there is in size. Some arthropods may grow larger in a higher O2 environment. But they probably wont grow larger indefinitely. A modern athropod raised at the oxygen and resource levels of the carboniferous probably wouldnt reach the size of a carboniferous species raised under those conditions.</p>
<p>Aquatic organisms dont have to support as much of their own weight, so that helps them in this context. Crusteceans are probably the closest relatives of terrestrial hexapods, so if any group shows a similar trend Id predict it to be them. (Edit: I bungled my crustacean hexapod relationship)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The size might also depend on the amount of resources/other factors available in their current environment (Food/Predator/Competitions/etc.)</p>
<p>For an experiment you can use different concentrations of oxygen in water, grow the subjects, and measure their size after.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Insects have holes called spiracles in the surface of their bodies to expose the interior of their bodies to oxygen. Therefore insects can't be very large because the smaller their surface area to volume ratio, the harder it is for a simple mechanism like that to allow all the interior parts of the body to receive adequate oxygen. Increasing the availability of oxygen in the environment will go some way to reducing the limiting factor of size.</p>
<p>Sea creatures exchange gases using entirely different systems because water is such a different medium, so not sure this same limiting factor of size would be an issue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a certain percentage of oxygenation water cannot go beyond. There's only so much oxygen water can hold and as a result I believe that would limit your ability to grow giant waterlife. However, that doesn't mean that the waterlife living oxygen rich water isn't thriving (larger than waterlife in water with less oxygen).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
