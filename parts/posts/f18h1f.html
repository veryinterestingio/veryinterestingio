		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several reasons. For one, people who break their hips tend to be quite elderly, and elderly people are at very high risk of dying for a lot of reasons. This is a correlation, not causation, as some people have pointed out.</p>
<p>But there ARE causational factors too. An elderly person who breaks their hip will often have to go into the hospital to get surgery or other kinds of treatment. Surgery is always risky and can cause infections and other complications, but especially in the elderly who have less well-functioning body systems in general. Prolonged hospital stays also increase the risk of infection by the nasty kind of bugs that tend to hang around in hospitals, like pneumonia, C difficile, or MRSA--and again, elderly people are more vulnerable.</p>
<p>Finally, being immobilized for along period of time (as <strong>[edit]</strong> CAN happen if you don’t get the right kind of recovery treatment) as well as the actual trauma of surgery puts you at huge risk of having blood clots that form in your legs, especially when you're elderly! These blood clots can then travel into your lungs and cause pulmonary embolisms. This is a HUGE cause of death in hospitals—it’s the most common reason why people die after surgery [Edit: I originally said it was 1/3 of all hospital deaths but that doesn’t seem to be correct. Apologies!]</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hip fractures are commonly associated with frequent falls. Falling a lot suggest a number of things - decreased strength, decreased balance, maybe decreased judgement, maybe impaired neurological function, remodeled bones from non-use, and overall poor function in general.  In a word: Frail.</p>
<p>After a major injury like a traumatic hip fracture, in order to recover there needs significant and concerted effort for rehab - which of course is a tall order in a person who is having falls to start. In memory patients, for instance, they can not remember enough to make any progress. Regardless, in that 6 weeks to a few months a lot more atrophy tends to set in. Function declines further. Bowels stop moving. Complications associated with immobility, UTI's, pneumonia, GI problems, problems from DVT prophylaxis (anticoagulation) are common.   There may not be a direct causation, but there are multiple inter-related issues along with initially poor function marking hip fracture as a frequent terminal event.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You have to break this into two groups. Low  energy hips fractures vs high energy hip fractures. Low energy hip fractures mean that the patient fell from a low height and broke their hip. That means their bones have failed. Just like any other organ system. You wouldn’t be surprised if you heard 50% of patients that presented with liver failure died.  </p>
<p>These patient have a high mortality rate. They are frail and their health is declining. In fact the only way to decrease said rate is operating and having them get up and walk as soon as possible. </p>
<p>High energy hip fractures happen in younger healthier patients and their mortality rate is based on other concomitant injuries. If they only have a hip fracture their mortality is quite low.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This correlation is part about what it says about your health if you break your hip and part about the consequences of a hip fracture.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
What having a hip fracture says about your health: there are two ingredients to a hip fracture, thin bones and a fall.  If you are missing either of these then you won't have a hip fracture.  Falls means you are frail - often less muscle mass, poorer nutrition and may have poor balance.  People with thin bones (osteoporosis or osteopenia) are also more likely to have multiple health issues causing this.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A hip fracture means a major surgery is needed which has a lot of potential complications: high risk of surgical complications, infection, blood clots, bedsores etc.  Given it's the frail people who have the fractures, they don't have much strength and are more likely to die from a complication. Elderly people have a significantly lower immune system.  For people who have major health issues such as heart or kidney problems the fracture and surgery can worsen these problems temporarily and not everyone it physically fit enough to get through that.<br />
