		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since Leptin deficiency is a thing, often leading towards obesity, where you're essentially always hungry, is there a situation, where, naturally, you'd have excess leptin? I know of the feedback loop where if you don't eat much, you get reduced leptin and always be hungry, and if you eat too much, you produce more leptin to signal that you're satiated. </p>
<p>Would there be a situation where, like leptin-deficient people, you'd have natural excess leptin, and never really be hungry? Is there any correlation between this and anorexia? There is definitely a correlation between not enough leptin and eating too much, but is there one for the opposite?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anorexia is a mental disorder where you have body dysmorphia and think you're fatter than you are. There are people who don't eat enough, but they usually don't starve to the point of danger, it takes a lot of deliberate starvation which would cause stomach pains among other symptoms, many associated with low blood sugar, even in the presence of a leptin deficiency.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey, do you remember where you got the information on Leptin? You’ve got some interesting ideas here and you’re correct that there’s an observable difference in Leptin concentration in AN patients. I’m just a bit confused what you mean by Leptin deficiency? If there’s research to suggest that obese or overweight people have low Leptin then I’m not familiar with it. From my understanding it’s more that they fail to respond appropriately to the elevated Leptin levels which I think is likely the consequence of previous behavior rather than any kind of biological failure off the bat. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
