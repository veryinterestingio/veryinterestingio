		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are pretty much constantly being exposed to viruses. We just fight them off easily, because we have immune systems on alert that take out the random virus invader.</p>
<p>Extreme temperature swings, though, can affect that. We usually notice it with cold. When it gets really cold out, and we don't adequately protect ourselves, we can lower that immune system's ability to fight. Basically, making your physical body weaker also makes your immune system weaker. When that happens, those random interlopers have a better chance at spreading through your body. That's when we &quot;get sick&quot;.</p>
<p>We associate this with cold and winter because those are the conditions under which we are most often affected. However, it does happen in high temperatures, too. And if you were working out, you were making yourself physically weak and putting it at higher risk. Keep going, though, because as you work out your body will get stronger over time, which will make your entire body healthier, including your immune system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your situation is just a coincidence; you contracted the illness a day or two BEFORE you exercised.</p>
<p>&quot;Sudden temperature differences&quot; have no meaningful effect on your immune system. Extreme temperatures can weaken your immune system, but that's not relevant unless you're experiencing hypothermia or baking in an oven.</p>
<p>The people who pointed out that cold weather dries out mucus membranes and causes humans to congregate in larger numbers in enclosed spaces are correct, but that has nothing to do with &quot;sudden temperature differences.&quot;</p>
<p>Everything else that everyone else wrote is complete bullshit. Changes in temperature don't weaken your immune system. Exercise does not weaken your immune system. That's not how human bodies function. If you think about it for just a second, you'll realize why this makes sense. What kind of organism would evolve the ridiculous limitation of not being able to physically move without getting sick?? And how does an external temperature difference weaken your immune system when your body maintains a constant internal temperature?? Furthermore, if temperature changes destroyed immune systems, how would cold-blooded animals survive!? Their *internal* temperature can swing tens of degrees every single day. Wouldn't their immune systems basically be non-functioning? reddit has failed you here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When cold outside, people tend to stay inside more. Thus, being around close proximity to more people. Therefore, you are more likely to come into contact with a virus that could affect you.</p>
<p>Also, add this factor into what others have said, and it's the perfect recipe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Common cold virus replicates better at low temperatures, which is why it does better in the airways. From animal studies, some scientists have concluded that it replicates better at 5ºC, so if you already have the virus, a temperature drop will be enough to kick start it. It's not just because people stay inside more.</p>
