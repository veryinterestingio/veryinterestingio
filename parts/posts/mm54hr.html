		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Photons or light waves can have a variety of energy levels, from very low (like those emitted by radio antennas) to medium (the light you can see) to high (the x-rays or gamma rays that can give you cancer).  When light hits a surface, it's hitting the electrons of the atoms in that surface, and either being absorbed by the electrons or bounced back off of them.  There can be other effects, like how hot surfaces actively emit light (like red-hot iron), or some surfaces absorb light at one color and emit it in another immediately (fluorescence) or over time (phosphorescence).</p>
<p>White light contains all the visible colors of light.  When white light strikes an object and the object appears to have a particular color, that means that most of the light hitting it was absorbed, but some colors of light were reflected or emitted from it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of light as a mixed bowl of candy. This bowl has jolly ranchers, it has starburst, it has packets of MnMs, it has mini snickers, and so on. These candies are the colors in our light - sunlight (and other white light) has all of these colors already in it. </p>
<p>Then you give this mixed bowl of candy to a classroom of kids. You know they like every candy except snickers, and sure enough, after that bowl of candy makes contact with the class, they eat everything in the bowl,  except the snickers. After the bowl leaves the classroom we only have one candy left, our snickers,  and everything else had been absorbed by the class to fuel their youthful energy. </p>
<p>Same thing with light. After hitting a material, most of the possible colors get absorbed, their energy staying in the material (usually as heat). All you get to see if the light enters your eyes afterwards - if you look at the bowl after the class got to eat - is the color that's left. You only get to see the snickers they left behind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What we see as color is all the light that wasn't absorbed by whatever it bounced off of. A rose is red because the matter that makes up the rose absorbs all the light except red.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>(Talking about chemical color only.) Roughly speaking, a given molecule has a number of different states that the electrons around that molecule can be in, each with a certain amount of energy, and a certain number of electrons to partially fill those states. Naturally, the electrons will almost always be found in the lowest energy states, but if light arrives of the right energy range it can temporarily bump an electron up to a higher energy state. This is what light absorption, so color, is.</p>
<p>Normally the difference in energy between the occupied and unoccupied states is very high, like ultraviolet level or higher, so most small molecules appear colorless. Visible color comes from an exceptionally small energy gap. For example, transition metal ions (say, copper or iron) often have both filled and unfilled &quot;d orbitals&quot;. If the ion was just floating out in space the different d orbitals would be the same energy, and so colorless. But in solution the various molecules surrounding the metal atom break the symmetry to make some orbitals slightly higher energy than others. Hence solutions of metals in various solvents tend to have bright colors. Similarly, if you look at a drawing of a colored organic compound (search for pictures of dye molecules), you will see an extended sequence of alternating double bonds. You should interpret this as giving room for complicated electronic behavior (some electron states get spread out over the whole molecule) that can allow for closely spaced energy states. (Actually telling what color, if any, the molecule will be is still serious chemistry.) Many pigments, like chlorophyll or heme, combine a transition metal core with a surrounding system of double bonds, for extra amusement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
