<p>Hi Reddit! I’m Lori Pennington-Gray, Director of the Eric Friedheim Tourism Institute at the University of Florida. Right now, we are working on a study that assesses travel related to concerns about COVID-19 with weekly trends. We are including variables like threat appraisal, future travel decisions, trusted sources and travel anxiety index.</p>
<p>I have completed numerous research projects in Florida as well in countries such as Canada, Mexico, Korea, South Africa, Russia, Peru and others throughout the Caribbean.</p>
<p>I focus on the following research topics at the University of Florida:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decision-making process related to travel during crises</li>
<li>Tourism crisis management</li>
<li>Environmental and social impacts to a host destination</li>
<li>Tourism marketing</li>
<li>Visitors behaviors with destination marketing organizations policy</li>
</ul>
<p>More about me:</p>
<p>I received my Ph.D. in Park, Recreation and Tourism Resources from Michigan State University in 1999, my M.S. in Leisure Studies from Pennsylvania State University in 1994 and my B.A. in Recreation and Leisure Studies from University of Waterloo in 1993. I have consulted with several destination marketing organizations to design research projects. </p>
<p>I lead the Tourism Crisis Management Initiative, established in 2007, where we aim to develop ways to manage the tourism industry during crises by implementing methods of crisis reduction, readiness, response and recovery. I am a member of the International Ecotourism Society, the Travel and Tourism Research Association, the World Travel and Tourism Council, and many other associations related to the tourism industry.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing that has come up in this pandemic is flaws or issues with cruises. Not only did COVID spread incredibly quickly among cruise staff and guests (which we’ve seen before with things like norovirus outbreaks), but multiple countries have turned cruise ships away if they have sick passengers. A bunch of cruises in the Americas have decided to head to Florida, to an area that is already dealing with a lot of COVID cases. </p>
<p>How do cruise lines typically prepare for large-scale medical emergencies? Do they normally have agreements for care in local ports if on-board care isn’t enough? You mention studying the impacts to destinations – does a situation like this get considered? Is the reaction expected or unexpected?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
