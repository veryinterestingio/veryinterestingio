After long periods of nothing to do and no way to entertain myself I get tired until I'm given a task to do then I'm wide awake.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body has needs.  You have to breathe, drink, eat, sleep, go to the bathroom.  Your body must do this before a certain amount of time elapses.  It really does not want to wait until the last minute in case it cannot do it then.  So your body tries to figure out when is a good time to do those things, then it triggers you to do them.</p>
<p>Your body determines importance based on emotions (this applies to memories and almost everything else as well).  So when you are bored, your body determines that nothing important is going on.  That makes it a good time to take care of routine things.</p>
<p>So when you are bored your body triggers you to eat and sleep.  Meaning you become hungry and tired.</p>
<p>It is not that you need to eat or sleep just then, it just seems like a convenient opportunity.  If something happens and you become excited or scared, the feelings of hunger and tiredness go away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Look at what animals do when all their needs are met and they have nothing they need to do. They sleep. Dogs and cats loaf on the porch, ruminants settle down to chew their cud and doze off. It conserves energy, something extremely valuable to animals that don't farm and store food. </p>
<p>It has been argued that sleep is actually the default mode for animals, and that being active is only something we do in order to eat and reproduce.</p>
<p>Humans are a very rare animal in that we usually keep ourselves busy preparing for the future, even when we don't have any needs in the present. However, when we are truly bored and can't think of anything to do, we can still slip into that energy conservation mode.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The 'tired' is a means of escape from the tedium of being awake and not creative.  It is also the symptom of the nursing home, retirees with no family about, and nothing to pass the day{been there, done that, forget that}</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
