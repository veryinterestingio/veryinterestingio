<p>I am sure Russia would have gladly let them live a life of luxery in trade for the plane. </p>

It would have been an intelligence goldmine for any other country (specifically, the Soviet Union).</p>
<p>Married men are much, much less likely to defect than pilots who wouldn't be leaving anything behind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
