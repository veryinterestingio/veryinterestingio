		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Radio signals are a single frequency.</p>
<p>TV signals contain(ed) multiple frequencies (for the video, RGB colors, and separately for the audio), so they made a dial with &quot;channels&quot; instead of having multiple frequency dials and forcing people to &quot;tune&quot; the image and then &quot;tune&quot; the audio separately.  That way you tune into the &quot;channel&quot; and the TV tunes into the sets of frequencies required to receive the video AND audio for that station.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both television and FM frequencies are allocated by channel. FM channels are small enough to be centered on a readily human decennale frequency. In imitation of earlier forms of radio, they use the center frequency as an identifier. Before 1989 they were typically more vague with an approximation of the  center frequency. &quot;Rock 96&quot; became &quot;Rock 95.7&quot; during the eighties in no small part due to the introduction of digital frequency counters or dials on consumer-grade receivers.</p>
<p>Television utilizes channels which are, in North America, 6 Mhz wide or obnoxious to common ears to discern through announcement. From 1947 forward, in lieu of 63 MHz or 60-66 MHz a more convenient identifier was simply &quot;Channel 3&quot; which also made the dials on TV receivers easier to discern.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just realized this is ELI5, so I'll add some more.</p>
<p>Radio and TV use the &quot;electromagnetic spectrum&quot; to reach you. That is a fancy word for stuff like light, and a small part of that is the rainbow.</p>
<p>Think of each color in the rainbow as a frequency like on a radio. You can just listen to red or blue or yellow for the radio, but TV has to send out pictures and sound so it can't fit on just one color. Instead of watching a show on Red-Orange-Yellow, we call that Channel 1. Green-Blue-Purple is Channel 2.</p>
<hr />
<p>More detail that is not ELI5:</p>
<p>A TV channel uses up a wider section of the spectrum in order to handle all of the video and audio content. <a href="http://otadtv.com/frequency/index.html" target="_blank">http://otadtv.com/frequency/index.html</a></p>
<p>It's like WiFi uses channels as a shorthand for the chunks of spectrum you are using.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Radio stations are much more spread out, over the spectrum. You might have 2 dozen radio stations in the same geographic area. You may also have someone on 100.3 and someone on 100.9</p>
<p>With television, particularly with VHF in the analog days, you only had a couple, so a fixed dial made more sense. My guess is UHF which had more channels just copied what was then the format everyone knew for VHF.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TV actually used to be tuned manually with a dial, same as radio, these days they're tuned automatically.<br />
Each TV (and Radio) station is assigned a bracket (or channel) with a small range of radio frequency to accommodate any signal disruption. In television it's usually several megahertz wide.<br />
Each of those brackets is numerically identified by its position along the radio spectrum and the stations themselves usually name themselves to match. Mostly it's a national/international convention.  </p>
<p>Side note: Modern TV broadcasting includes a lot of stuff like multiplexing which means that not all of the signal you're watching is in the same channel, but they continue using the original brackets for legacy reasons. you can still take an old TV from the 40s and watch modern shows on it without most of the extra features.  </p>
<p>In the US, radio stations are required by the FAA to identify themselves for legal reasons at the top of every hour, minimum requirement is the callsign and city of licence, but typically they include the frequency and the station ownership as well.</p>
<p>TV do something similar, but only have to do a callsign as a graphic on-screen each hour or so.  </p>
<p>Speculatively, by providing their exact frequency (as the middle and strongest part of their signal bracket) a radio station is assisting manual tuning because now you know whether you need to dial up or down the spectrum to get a better signal. TVs don't bother because you're not generally travelling, so stepping up and down the frequencies at fixed intervals will get consistent results once you've tuned initially.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
