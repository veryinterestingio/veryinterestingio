		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's really, really difficult to sequence RNA and really easy to sequence DNA. Most RNA sequences are made by first converting the RNA into DNA by using enzymes that are RNA-dependendent DNA polymerases, also called reverse transcriptases. </p>
<p>Once you've made the corresponding DNA (which is the reverse complement of the RNA, and is called cDNA), you just sequence that instead.</p>
<p>It's not perfect and it misses some stuff (like RNA editing), but it's generally really accurate and way the hell easier.</p>
<p>ETA: Thanks for the award. It's a bit...spooky, given the current time. But I guess cyber high-fives don't spread corona, right?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in sequencing. We sequence RNA and DNA, but in both cases what we report is what the equivalent change would be on the &quot;coding DNA strand&quot;. This is primarily just for simplicity of bioinformatics, as most databases store gene sequence information as DNA, making it much easier to find similar sequences in other organisms if you report your sequencing results as equivalent cDNA. And I would argue the most important reason for sequencing genetic information from new organisms is to match them up to the most similar known sequences and use the differences between the known and new sequence to try to understand the new genes' functions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the technique used in sequencing the virus was reverse transcription. Basically the virus RNA is converted into cDNA and conventional sequencing was carried out from that point. Publishing altered results from DNA sequencing might cause confusion ( replacing Thymine as uracil). Although direct RNA sequencing technique are available but perhaps they did not use that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an addendum to the great answer already given, RNA is defined in particular by the 2' hydroxyl on the ribose sugar backbone on each base, rather than the thymine; of course, a characteristic of RNA is the general replacement of thymine (5-methyluracil) with uracil. DNA lacks  the 2' hydroxyls on the sugar backbone, which gives it the name Deoxy Ribonucleic Acid. It is the presence of the hydroxyls that make RNA very delicate and easily degraded. They are more difficult to sequence, more difficult to synthesize, and just more difficul to work with in general.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is significantly easier to sequence DNA instead of RNA, so usually we add a reverse transcription step - which converts RNA to DNA - prior to PCR amplification. Then, what we really end up sequencing is their reverse-transcribed DNA genome, which is why it is shown in the DNA form in databases. Nevertheless, genetic information is the same regardless of the base used to store it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
