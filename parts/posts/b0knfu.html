		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Through the technology embedded in web-enabled devices, algorithms and the programs that power them make a staggering number of everyday decisions for us, from what products we buy, to where we decide to eat, to how we consume our news, to whom we date, and how we find a job. We've even delegated life-and-death decisions to algorithms-decisions once made by doctors, pilots, and judges.</p>
<p>In my new recently published book, ``A Human's Guide to Machine Intelligence: How Algorithms Are Shaping Our Lives and How We Can Stay in Control'', I have surveyed this brave new world and revealed the potentially dangerous biases they can give rise to as they increasingly run our lives. I make the compelling case that we need to arm ourselves with a better, deeper, more nuanced understanding of the phenomenon of artificial intelligence. I have examined episodes like Microsoft's chatbot Tay, (which was designed to converse on social media like a teenage girl, but instead turned sexist and racist), the fatal accidents of self-driving cars, and even our own common, and often frustrating, experiences on services like Netflix and Amazon.</p>
<p>I will be available fro 3-5PM ET (19-21 UT). Ask me anything!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello Professor, thanks for doing this. </p>
<p>I'm old enough to remember the internet before algorithms started determining everything and I lament the loss of that spontaneity. </p>
<p>For a brief time, there used to be a sense of adventure in surfing the net, and a genuine chance of stumbling across completely random things that you didn't realize you were interested in until you found them. </p>
<p>Nowadays I feel more like a prisoner being dragged from targeted ad to targeted ad. Do you foresee any future where algorithms become advanced enough to recapture some of that early spontaneity? What do you think about the possibility of people being able to customize their level of exposure to algorithms? A pipe dream? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the example of self-driving cars, even with accidents, we can start to prevent these in the future by improving the underlying algorithms. At some point, if self-driving cars take off, then we're giving more control to algorithms to run a big aspect of our lives. However, it is quite likely that the total number of accidents gets reduced compared to having human-only drivers. How do we then approach this ethical dilemma, giving up control to a &quot;black box&quot; (black box for most people who don't know what's gone into it), and potentially hurting individuals in exchange for improving the lives of people in general? I would naively argue it's worth convincing society that this is okay because it will save lives, but really is it?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello Professor Hosangar. I have some questions regarding the safety of General AI.</p>
<p>First off, what are your thoughts about the future of General AI? Are you generally skeptical of the demise of humanity like Steven Pinker? Or are you quite concerned for the human race like Elon Musk or Sam Harris? </p>
<p>If youâ€™re concerned for the human race, what would be your biggest concern? And how could that concern escalate and become a reality? </p>
<p>Would love to hear your response!
Thanks for your time!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
