		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a commonly held myth that the airflow on a sedan removes rainwater, but doesn't on a hatchback. </p>
<p>In reality it has more to do with the lack of a boot (trunk). This means dirt is thrown up from behind the car onto the back screen. </p>
<p>Also, tradition plays a part. Some sedans have rear wipers, some are optional etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not that flat windows need them and angled windows don't, because trucks don't need rear wipers. Instead, what's happening is that the wake that the car creates pulls moisture directly onto the rear window. Sedans and trucks don't need a rear wiper since their wake is further back from the window, but hatchbacks, SUV's, and vans need one since their rear window is at the rear of the car.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All cars create a vortex behind themselves as air comes over and from underneath the car to re-converge at the back of the car. The one from underneath pulls a lot of road grime with it. On a sedan, the distance from the rear glass to the edge of the trunk lid separates the glass from the swirl of grime and its only exposed to the relatively clean upper flow and doesn't get very dirty. On a hatch, its directly exposed to the dirty underflow vortex and it deposits a lot more grime on the window. Combine that with the fact that rear glass on hatchbacks is generally pretty vertical and therefore doesn't get washed by rain as easily, and many cars these days have overhanging spoilers for aero, and you have a window that can get grimy enough in one trip that you can't see out of it, which is a safety hazard. So, some clearing mechanism is necessary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
