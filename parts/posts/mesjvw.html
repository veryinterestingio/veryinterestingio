		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So no one knows for sure and there are several theories. One of these theories which is pretty much accepted is that it's bcs of our ancestors. Apes tend to make a similar high pitched sound when in danger. This trait has remained in our genes throughout the years and a sound of similar frequency tends to make us super uncomfortable. </p>
<p>I don't hv the exact source but I remember seeing this on TV several years ago. On History tv 18 there was this show abt Planet Earth or some thing.</p>
<p>Edit: Ig the episode was titled-&quot;How the earth made us Cringe &quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Whether your nerves are still stimulated long after it's gone or if you're just remembering it because it's so unpleasant, I don't think we know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
