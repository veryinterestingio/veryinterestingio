Does everybody find out what they got? Do they keep reporting in for a couple years? Do the placebo groups get a front of the line pass to the real vaccine? Are there still people who got the placebo walking around thinking they might be immune?</p>
<p>Seems to me that early data is best data, so the original vaccine group need to be monitored. If month 5 comes and suddenly a bunch of them get sick, it means the immunity didn't last long after all :(</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually being debated now. For the Pfizer vaccine (and the AstraZeneca, and I think the Moderna vaccine as well but am not certain), the original plan was indeed for the placebo recipients to receive the vaccine. But some of the regulatory bodies are concerned that this will affect the data from the trial. It means there’s no more placebo group after less than a year, making it much harder to ask questions like, How long does vaccine protection last?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some scientists agree with Ms. Munz that, if she indeed received a placebo, she should be moved toward the front of the line in exchange for her service for the greater good. “I think probably we owe them, as a consequence of their participation in the trial, some special priority in terms of access to the vaccine,” Dr. Francis S. Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, said at a meeting in July.</p>
<p>But on Wednesday, 18 leading vaccine experts — including a top regulator at the Food and Drug Administration — argued that vaccinating placebo groups early would be disastrous for the integrity of the trials. If all of the volunteers who received placebo shots were to suddenly get vaccinated, scientists would no longer be able to compare the health of those who were vaccinated with those who were not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/02/health/covid-vaccine-placebo-group.html" target="_blank">Many Trial Volunteers Got Placebo Vaccines. Do They Now Deserve the Real Ones?Some vaccine experts worry that “unblinding” the trials and giving all of the volunteers vaccines would tarnish the long-term results.</a></p>
<p>Both sides have good arguments - placebo recipients really do deserve to be rewarded to volunteering, but unblinding the trials really will mean they’re losing very important data. Various compromise plans have been put forward:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Fauci sketched out one possible way to balance the obligation owed to people who took the placebo against the need for more data from the trials. Vaccine makers could give everyone who got the placebo the vaccine — while also giving everyone who got the vaccine the placebo. None of the trial participants would know which order they got the doses. The trial could therefore continue to be blinded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But nothing has been definitely decided overall yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The trial theoretically was supposed to go on for 2 years to track longer term side effects and long term immunity. However, the FDA advisory group talked at length about this subject last Thursday at Moderna’s meeting and the Thursday before that at Pfizer’s.</p>
<p>What was discussed is the practical reality of having authorized vaccines that are 95 percent effective. Study subjects are going to drop out of the study if nothing is done. Clinical trial subjects are allowed to withdraw their consent and from the study at anytime for any reason. This is one of the ethical principles of clinical trials. What this would mean is we’d lose all long term follow up data.</p>
<p>So, the least bad option is to unblind the study and give the vaccine to the placebo group. It’s not ideal, but it is the reality. Future studies are going to need to take this into account, but the early</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
