		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>DNA will break down over time. The oldest DNA ever reliably recovered was a couple hundred thousand years old, so fantasies of recovering 100 million year old dinosaur DNA are not realistic.</p>
<p>Even in creatures that have stayed relatively unchanged over time (like crocodiles) their DNA continues to mutate and change slightly over time. </p>
<p>It is hypothesized that the primitive life-like cells used RNA. Thus quickly evolved to use DNA and has remained so for probably billions of years. It is really all just speculation, but the general idea is that primordial goop had RNA that started self replicating. This quickly led to variants that recruited or made proteins to make replication more efficient. This then recruited using DNA to stabilize the required information. Thus led to complexes that were able to protect themselves using a lipid and protein membrane...these would be considered the first real cells. DNA took over the role of encoding the plans for future cells while RNA controlled the actual construction of cells and proteins became the structure of cells inside a membrane.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like some people are missing the point of your question. Sure the oldest actual DNA we've recovered is only a few million years old. But we don't need to actually recover DNA to know that the exact same molecule (same 4 nucleotides) have been used for hundreds of millions of years. All we need is the fact that humans, bacteria, fungus, plants, and archaea all have the exact same DNA molecules. Our lineages don't combine until you go back hundreds of millions of years, that's the last time we had a common ancestor.</p>
<p>It's possible  (actually almost certain) that at the VERY beginning of life before the most recent common ancestor of the 5 kingdoms, different genetic molecules were used such as RNA or something else. It's very likely that natural selection forces worked on these early molecules to eventually end up on RNA and DNA. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We think they have stayed pretty much the same save one feature — RNA and DNA share three of four nucleobases, but differ in one: RNA has thymine while RNA has uracil.</p>
<p>As some theorize that DNA evolved from RNA, somewhere along the way the uracil would have gotten replaced by the thymine. </p>
<p>I’d look up the RNA World hypothesis if you’re interested in more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question. As was said in other posts, DNA is damaged over time, and for now our methods only manage to extract the almost undamaged parts. Maybe in a few years we'll be able to sequence the more badly damaged DNA, and then we'll be able to sequence older samples.</p>
<p>This also biases what we can sample. We can only sequence DNA that is like what we have now. We can reconstruct DNA sequences of much older samples, though. It probably would be possible to reconstruct the DNA sequence of ancestors that lived hundreds of millions of years ago. (This means that there could now be things living that don't use DNA and we wouldn't know. But most biologists don't think these exist. Note that some claim that some RNA viruses come from a time before DNA.)</p>
<p>As far as we know, the &quot;last common ancestors&quot; of all living cells used the same DNA (up to the genetic code, which is slightly different). But we think that the DNA did evolve, and that DNA is not as old as, for example, RNA. But we don't have much insight into that time, because as far as we know no information from that time made it into DNA - our main source of information today. All we can see is structure, which maybe did make it across, for example the structure of the ribozome.</p>
