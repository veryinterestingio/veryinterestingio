		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a fascinating question. There is evidence, which I assume you're aware of, that the barn swallow evolved alongside—but independently from—humans (<a href="https://phys.org/news/2018-11-barn-swallows-evolved-humans.html" target="_blank">source</a>). Arguably, the fact barn swallows build their nests almost exclusively on human-made structures is evidence for a behavioural adaptation involving humans. That said, I'm not certain what evidence exists that barn swallows in particular are more tolerant of humans than other species of swallow. The welcome swallow in Australia for example (the only variety I am very familiar with) is also very frequently seen around human habitation, but permanent structures of the kind they nest within only really appeared on the continent in the past 250 or so years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
