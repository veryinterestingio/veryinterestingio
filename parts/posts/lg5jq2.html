		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your skin can only regenerate from the bottom up (the deepest layer) so if the wound is deep enough that you lose the bottom layer it can’t regenerate. If that happens, the connective tissue that lives underneath the skin has to grow into that space to heal up the area. That tissue, what we call a scar, is made up of entirely different cells than your skin so it doesn’t look the same or function the same as the skin it’s replacing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of this thread has focused on scars and skin.</p>
<p>However, muscles can also scar. If you tear or badly strain a muscle, the damaged muscles will regrow, but muscle fibers may not regrow in the right pattern needed for movement and range of motion.</p>
<p>Think of muscle fibers as self contracting ropes that can pull joints to rotate them. If you cut a bunch of the ropes then randomly attach ropes haphazardly in different directions, then the ropes won't pull as well overall and the added ropes may actually hinder the desired pulling motion.</p>
<p>This muscular scar tissue is the correct cells but they are aligned badly for performing motion. Right type of replacement cells, bad alignment = muscular scar tissue.</p>
<p>While common advice is to rest a strained muscle until it heals, most athletes have learned to start moving (with minimal resistance at first) a strained muscle as soon as sharp pain subsides. This seems to encourage muscle fibers to grow back in the right pattern needed for motion rather than growing back as scar tissue.</p>
<p>So to directly answer your question: for muscles, moving the muscles relatively soon after injury seems to prevent muscular scar tissue from forming.</p>
<p>(Of course this is not meant to be medical advice consult your own doctor (preferably a sports medicine doctor) if you suffer a muscle strain. Also research the &quot;Starr Protocol&quot; for advice from weightlifters on what to do with a muscle strain.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, if you damage your skin to the depth below hair follicles, it forms scars. If you damage it above the level of hair follicles, it regenerates fully. This is pretty much the requirement you are asking about. And as to the mechanism, it has to do with different cells being at different levels of the tissues, different connections, different structures. There are a lot of mechanisms and reasons at place, and while you'll see some comment that it's &quot;fibrous tissue being formed instead of cells&quot;, that's like saying Sun transfers heat to Earth - it's not nearly enough of an explanation and doesn't at all show the reality of the mechanism.  In fact, the exact process of scar tissue formation and the exact criteria that alter it are still not well researched, so, sorry in that regard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
