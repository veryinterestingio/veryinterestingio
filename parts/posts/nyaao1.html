		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain recognises patterns and has an internal clock. If you set an alarm, it's probably because it's a continuous thing you need and or it's something that you consciously deem important. As your brain is cognisant of time, your brain will attempt to wake up in time to perform that task, which you have changed from &quot;meeting at 9&quot; to &quot;wake up at 7:30&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Selection Bias. When we wake up and go to sleep again after 1-2 minutes, we don't remember it in the morning. We only remember those episodes where we can't fall asleep again - either because the thing that woke us up actually demands our attention, or because the alarm happens to ring one minute later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There might be a non-psychological factor here, too. I noticed I was waking up a couple seconds before my alarm would go off pretty consistently.</p>
<p>Also when I would take naps and set my alarm for them, my dog liked to bark in excitement when the alarm would go off. But he would bark a couple seconds <em>before</em> the alarm went off.</p>
<p>I think my cell phone was turning the speaker on a bit before playing the alarm, and emitting a very quiet or high-pitched sound that wasn't perceivable with my ears, but was to my subconscious (and my dog).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
