		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So proton and neutrons are composed of even smaller particles called quarks that have a charge.</p>
<p>A proton is composed of two &quot;Up&quot; quarks and one &quot;down&quot; quark. An up quark has a charge of 2/3 and a down quark a charge of -1/3.</p>
<p>2/3+2/3-1/3 =1 so a proton has a charge of 1</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>A neutron is composed of two down quarks and one up quark: 2/3-1/3-1/3 = 0 no charge.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Antiparticles are actually composed of anti-quarks. The quarks themselves are what have the opposite charges.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So an antineutron is composed of two anti-down quarks and one anti-up. anti-down quarks have charge of +1/3 and anti-up quarks have a charge of -2/3 So you still end up with zero net charges.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: corrected charges for anti-quarks</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It isn't really about being composite. It is about other &quot;quantum numbers&quot; besides electric charge that are opposite between matter/anti-matter pairs. The best example of this is neutrinos, which have anti-particle partners. In fact a lot of neutrinos produced in experiments, with beta decay for instance, are <em>electron anti-neutrinos</em>.</p>
<p>What is the difference between a electrically neutral neutrino, and it's also electrically neutral anti-neutrino partner? Well the primary difference is simply lepton number (neutrinos and electrons are in a class of particles called leptons). It may seem silly at first glance, but in general the number of leptons and anti-leptons in a system of interacting particles is constant. So the electron lepton number of the electron and electron-neutrino is defined as +1, while positrons and anti-electron-neutrinos have lepton numbers of -1 (it is a little more complicated than this if you consider the other generations of leptons, but ignore that for now).</p>
<p>So let's say a neutron is undergoing beta decay into a proton and electron. It starts out with a lepton number of 0: there are no leptons. It would end up with a lepton number of +1: there is now an electron. That is not allowed, the lepton number of the system has to remain 0. So the neutron doesn't decay into a proton and electron, it decays into a proton, electron, and anti-electron-neutrino. Now the interaction maintains it's original lepton number of 0, +1 from the electron, and -1 from the anti-neutrino.</p>
<p>Neutrinos and anti-neutrinos also have opposite &quot;weak iso-spin&quot;, a quantum number that determines how they interact with the weak force, like how electric charge determines how a particle interacts with the electromagnetic force.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
