		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The efficiency limits how small the adaptor can be. Below 15W, it is not difficult to package the adaptor into a small form factor (as many have done) without a lot of cost penalty. However the newer power hungry adaptors that output 20W or more become problematic. </p>
<p>Also the up-down format for many US dual sockets is a bit hard to design around. Typically, the mfr tries to limit the width of the adaptors somewhat to accommodate the side to side placement of multi sockets. Also note that many countries use different plugs so making an adaptor too narrow makes it difficult to accommodate the different plug styles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>except that laptop chargers generally have the &quot;brick&quot; further away. they have a cable between the power outlet and the &quot;brick&quot; so as not to take up all the room on the power strip. One would hope that other vendors would do the same thing, for that very reason.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From reading some comments I understand they need to be big if they draw a lot of electricity but why canâ€™t they make it a brick in the middle of the wire (like Xbox) instead of a giant plug that blocks out the outlet?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
