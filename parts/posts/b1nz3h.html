		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Liver is an organ that is known for its regenerative ability and therefore able to take a lot of abuse before it's scarred beyond repair. </p>
<p>One of the reasons that your suggestion isn't a standard treatment is that liver is highly vascularized organ and even a small nick can cause severe bleeding. Also, liver scarring is diffuse -- all over the organ -- and so, it wouldn't be possible to just cut out a section.</p>
<p>However, there are instances of liver transplants where a piece of healthy liver is transplanted into someone else and it will grow in the new home (body).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Problem is the regrown portion isn't as effective, you can't do multiple transplants either, only one since the regrown section isn't great for transplanting. So treat as it should be, a last resort in dire straits. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
