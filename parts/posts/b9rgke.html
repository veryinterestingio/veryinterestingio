		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm reading one of the first hard science fiction novels written: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_of_Gravity" target="_blank">Mission of Gravity</a> by Hal Clement. In it a world called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesklin" target="_blank">Mesklin</a> is described with, among others, the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>supergiant,</li>
<li>highly oblate,</li>
<li>strong gravity (a gee force gradient, starting at 3 g on the equator, and ending at 665 g on the planet's poles).</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm very curious if this falls in the <em>technically possible</em> category or if we have actually found a planet that has the rough characteristics as described.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe, but not like in Mission of Gravity! Based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_of_Gravity#/media/File:MissionOfGravity(1stEd\).jpg" target="_blank">cover art</a>, that planet is just toooo squat to be real.</p>
<p>As fluid balls spin faster, they get more oblate, or flatter at the poles and wider in the middle. This is true for things like the Earth and the Sun, which are both slightly oblate, and it's also true for tiny things like <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.5023437" target="_blank">spinning droplets of water</a>.</p>
<p>However, there is a hard limit for how fast planets can spin and still remain oblate. Once planets reach a certain rotation speed, they stop getting more oblate and start getting more <em>prolate,</em> or long and skinny. (They turn from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maclaurin_spheroid" target="_blank">Maclaurin spheroids</a> into triaxial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_ellipsoid" target="_blank">Jacobi ellipsoids</a>. For these planets, the equator goes around the long skinny axis, so some parts of the equator can be much farther from the center of the planet than others.) The rotation speed where this happens is different for different sized planets, but in all cases it happens when the planet is about ~1.7 times wider than it is pole-to-pole. A planet cannot be more oblate than that.</p>
<p>This was just theory until 2004, when we found a real life prolate dwarf planet! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haumea" target="_blank">Haumea</a> is half as wide as the Moon and rotates every 3.9 hours, giving it a higher angular velocity than any other large object we know in the solar system. As a result, it's over twice as long through the equator as it is thick pole-to-pole. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Haumea_Rotation.gif" target="_blank">artist animations</a> it looks kinda like a spinning potato but, you know, huge. On Haumea, gravity would feel a lot lower at the tips of the equator than it would at the poles, both because you're farther away from the dense core and because of the centrifugal force of that fast spinning. With some back-of-the-envelope calculations <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_acceleration" target="_blank">using Newton's Laws</a>, you would weigh about four times more at the poles (0.015 vs 0.060 g).</p>
<p>A 4x gravity difference is <em>probably</em> about as large a difference as we're going to find on any planet. Already on Haumea, the spin is so fast that at the tips you're more than halfway to the escape velocity. Spin it much faster and the planet would just break apart entirely. <em>But</em> before it gets there, it passes though yet another equilibrium shape- the &quot;dumbbell&quot; with two round lobes connected by a narrow neck. We've seen dumbbell shaped objects in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep07660" target="_blank">meteorites and in the lab</a>, as well as in some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/216_Kleopatra" target="_blank">truly bizarre looking asteroids</a>. When binary stars get so close that they share their outer atmosphere, they form dumbbell shaped <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_binary" target="_blank">contact binaries</a>. For larger objects like stars and planets, this configuration is unstable and will eventually collapse (contact binaries by the stars merging, planets by being torn apart by tidal forces). But for that period, however brief it is, your weight at the tips will be a fraction of your weight near the center.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>Not exactly what you're looking for, but Saturn's moon Pan has a large ridge giving the moon a pretty oblate shape: <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/news/13005/cassini-reveals-strange-shape-of-saturns-moon-pan/" target="_blank">https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/news/13005/cassini-reveals-strange-shape-of-saturns-moon-pan/</a></li>
<li>But, it's obviosly much smaller than a planet and my understanding is as mass increases the shape gets &quot;normalized&quot; into a sphere</li>
<li>Also, the ridge is material collected from Saturns ring, so not the typical process for an object forming it's shape.</li>

<p>For those that haven't read the Mesking wiki article I supplied previously, here are some more relevant details about this (fictional) planet:</p>
<ul>
<li>its mass is 16 times that of Jupiter,</li>
<li>each Mesklin day is 17.75 minutes long given that the planet rotates approximately 20 degrees a minute,</li>
<li>equatorial diameter is 48,000 miles (77,250 km), </li>
<li>pole-to-pole along its axis of rotation it is 19,740 miles (31,770 km),</li>
</ul>
<p>This quote about the calculated G forces:</p>
<p><em>Then Clement attempted to calculate the polar gravity, finding it surprisingly difficult. He admits, &quot;To be perfectly frank, I don't know the exact value of the polar gravity; the planet is so oblate that the usual rule of spheres... would not even be a good approximation...&quot; &quot;Whirligig World&quot; reports his initial calculations of the pole gravity to be 655 g; the dust jacket of Heavy Planet reports it as 700 g. A later program created by Clement computed it as 275 g, as did a similar program written by the MIT Science Fiction Society. The MIT group also concluded that the planet would have had a sharp edge at the equator.[1] Clement also gave Mesklin a set of rings and massive moons. The inner moon is 90,000 miles (140,000 km) from the planet's center, with a period of 2 hours 8 minutes.[2]</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the gravity at the equator was more than 0, then it wouldn't automatically tear apart.</p>
<p>Something like Roche lobe overflow or tidal disruption happens when a portion of the planet overflows the point where the star has a stronger gravitational pull than the planet. That depends on the distance to the star mainly. But if it's far enough, it would presumably avoid that fate too. There are other reasons why it's unlikely to exist though.</p>
<p>We haven't found something like this so far, that would require a <em>very</em> high rate of rotation. Jupiter is quite fast, it rotates at about a nine hour period. This is quite fast considering it's so large, and it <em>is</em> somewhat oblate. But still far from the oblateness required in your planet.</p>
<p>I think it would be difficult to imagine a process that would produce such a fast rotating planet. I'm not an expert on this but I can't see how it could happen with core accretion. With gravitational collapse of a gas cloud, as you compress the cloud but maintain the total angular momentum, the rotation would spin up. However some things to consider:</p>
<p>- That's how stars form and I don't know of any stars that are so drastically oblate (not a stellar astrophysists). We're still unsure if planets can or do form this way in any case, though if they did they could potentially have high angular momentum.</p>
<p>- While a 3g gravitational pull might not be a problem for a cool body, for very hot planets and gaseous planets, it's likely that gas could escape. For example, envelopes can escape from gas giants at a thousand or more Kelvin, with rotational periods of the order of 1 day and more. These are gas giants that aren't too oblate, their gravity is much larger than 3g. Planets and gas giants reach very high temperatures while forming (more than a thousand Kelvin) due to the compression/shock heating of the infalling gas, which has to lose its gravitational potential energy somehow. So I can't see how a planet could come to rotate that fast during formation, since it would get hot and just eject most of its gaseous material.</p>
<p>- I also can't see how you would spin up a planet to such a degree. Even with collisions, you'd probably just lose tons of material way before you manage to get to such a high rotation rate.</p>
<p>It's not very realistic. It's fiction and all but even those, those numbers, 3g to 655g are pretty extreme.</p>
<p>EDIT: Actually 3g gravity at the equator is quite a lot I didn't check. Even that's more than Jupiter's gravity (2.5g). So for a body with 3g at the equator and 655g at the poles, you're talking about a very massive or dense object. There aren't any planets that get close to 655g, super earths are up to 15 times as massive as the earth yet have a larger radius so less than 15g, and same for any gas giants (a 13 Jupiter mass gas giant will have a radius of roughly 1 Jupiter radius, so again maximum 13*2.5 = \~30g). Above that you're talking about brown dwarfs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
