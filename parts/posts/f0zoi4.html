<p>Straightforward answer, I'd estimate around 200g-2kg per year.</p>
<p>A lot of comments are discussing micrometeors, which are an issue, but I think you're asking after the atmospheric erosion specifically, which is a big topic of discussion in satellite engineering at the moment.</p>
<p>Atomic oxygen (single, non-ion atoms) is the main constituent gas in the upper atmosphere. As it is both chemically reactive and kinetically active (travelling ~7.8km/s), satellites like the ISS see a small mass erosion from the outer surface of the vehicle over time. While initially, it's not a huge issue, its prone to a snowballing effect (See page 11 of the paper I linked).</p>
<p>As far as space research goes, atomic oxygen isn't particularly well understood, and your question is something that NASA are currently trying to get an accurate answer to, and mitigate.</p>

One of these reasons is because the small particles of space junk are hitting the solar panels degrading them little by little. The most recent StarTalk episode is about the future of NASA which they talk about this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physical erosion? Almost undetectable. It would vary across different parts based on a number of factors but regardless, the damage caused by micrometeorites would render a part unusable or derelict long before physical erosion from air would be a factor.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re talking about the erosion of orbit, the ISS is constantly working against an aerodynamic force equivalent to about a 1 pound. The station re-boosts about once a month as a result.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
