<p>Edit: clarifying. It's a widespread habit, even like browsing a catalog without any real need to.</p>
<p>It seems to me we enjoy pretending to be selecting through lists of options as we'd really need to.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because of the 2 things. Human brain is always looking for novelty, and social media feeds are full of it. Every time we learn something new, we get a bit hi because our brain will release a small amount of dopamine. Other thing is FOMA, fear of missing out. We keep scrolling because we fear we may miss something, I call this infomania, we get addicted to information because of the new info &gt; dopamine release &gt; more new info feedback..</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For that feel good Dopamine hits. Its like a drug sooner or later your Dopamine tolerance gets higher and higher that you just keep scrolling and scrolling to get that dopamine feeling again. In order for you to get that fix is to abstain from social media or as they call it digital fasting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
