		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not very familiar with that region but a quick look at the map shows that the forested zone is to the north of a mountain range and further north, there's the caspian sea.
So it's very likely that there's frequently a wind coming from the north which blows humid air(from the Caspian sea) to the south. When the humid air hits the windward side of the mountain, it gains height in order to surpass the mountain. However, this means that it cools down (because the higher, the cooler at least in that part of the atmosphere). And cooler air isn't able to contain as much water which means that it rains and hence, there's a lot of water for plants to grow.
When the winds reach the peaks of the mountains, they're pretty dry and when coming down on the other side they're even dryer and may even &quot;suck up&quot; water from the the floor.</p>
<p>If this is actually the case, I cannot tell you as I'm not familiar with the region. There's also a variety of other factors which could contribute.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
