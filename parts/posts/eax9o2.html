		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in nuclear fuel manufacturing as an engineer! The short answer is that spent nuclear fuel is way way more dangerous to handle. </p>
<p>As to why, I’ll give you an overview. Fresh nuclear fuel contains uranium 235 at a certain low % (current reactors use fuel enriched to about 5%). U-235 is what’s known as an alpha emitter. The particles it emits during decay are so large that they’ll get blocked and deflected by anything. When I first started my job in nuclear, I remember my engineering manager saying a piece of paper is enough to block the radiation from U235. Hell, even the molecules in air are enough at a certain short distance! Furthermore, the half life of uranium 235 is very long so it’s not emitting tons of alpha particles anyway. </p>
<p>During its time in a nuclear reactor, U-235 generates tons of byproducts that are beta and gamma emitters with short half lives compared to U-235. Beta and gamma radiation are the nasty ones that we are right to be afraid of. These byproducts also generate heat as part of their decay, so spent fuel rods are first put in pools of water that serve to cool the fuel. Once the heat generation slows down enough, the fuel can be either reprocessed or buried. </p>
<p>An interesting thing to note is the next generation of nuclear fuel is being developed to better contain fission byproducts. I’m working on something called TRISO fuel, and there’s plenty of general information on it online. Essentially you take tiny beads of uranium and cover them in several layers of carbon and ceramic. These layers serve to physically contain the byproducts. They’re still extremely dangerous to handle after being used, but significantly decreases the risk of any of those nasty byproducts from getting into the environment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, spent fuel is <strong>way</strong> more dangerous. After having been inside an operating reactor core, highly radioactive fission fragments have built up inside the fuel assemblies.</p>
<p>The specific activity of unused fuel is pretty low, but the specific activity of spent fuel is much higher.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fresh nuclear fuel is typically comprised of up to 5% Uranium 235 with the remaining being Uranium 238 (both as oxides in a ceramic pellet) and has very low radioactivity due to the extremely long half-life of those isotopes; also they both emit mostly alpha particles when decaying which is easily blocked by just your skin.</p>
<p>This means that fresh nuclear fuel can be manufactured, assembled and generally handled without any particular issues by the workers.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>However once put in a reactor and exposed to neutrons it will start doing its thing which is fissioning or absorbing those neutrons which will start producing a cascade of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fission_product" target="_blank">fission products</a> like Cesium 137 or Strontium 90 for example which have a much shorter half-life thus a much higher activity also emitting beta and gamma radiation which are harder to stop.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Note that spent nuclear fuel still is made for the vast majority of Uranium 238 with a tiny bit of Uranium 235 that hasn't been used with a significant percentage of mixed Plutonium isotopes. The very dangerous and more active isotopes represent a small percentage of the volume of the waste but are responsible for the majority of its activity and dangerousness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spent nuclear fuel is indeed extremely dangerous. Rods tend to be part of a continuous chain reaction for a year or so inside the reactor. This means their uranium content by % is reduced, making them less suitable to maintain a power reaction (hence the term 'spent' fuel) but uranium decays into several different elements and their unstable isotopes, including plutonium, xenon, iodine, in varying concentrations. These isotopes are intensely radioactive and have long half-lives. When spent rods are removed from the reactor, the decay heat produced by these isotopes is extreme and they are placed in a cooling pond for several years until the products decay sufficiently that they are cool enough to handle. The Fukushima accident in 2011 was made worse because most of the reactors had spent fuel ponds loaded with old fuel that needed constant cooling; the decay heat boiled the water and exposed the fuel elements at one point. The heat is enough to melt through the thin zirconium cladding that holds the fuel together and release the isotopes into the local environment, so cooling is critical. It also made the Chernobyl disaster worse because the explosion released all these isotopes, with wildly varying half-lives, straight into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Some isotopes in spent fuel have half-lives in the millions of years. They must be stored in strong casks far away from not only life, but nature - some of the isotopes, such as iodine, are water-soluable and would contaminate the water supply if their storage location developed a leak. Ongoing arguments in many countries including the US have prevented the opening of any long-term storage repository for nuclear waste; it's a problem we really don't know how to solve except burying it. Caves in tectonically stable areas with no known underground rivers are ideal.</p>
<p>By contrast, fresh fuel is generally uniformly uranium (both fissionable 235 and 'fertile' 238, ratios depend on the enrichment) together with 'burnable' poisons which prevent the natural decay of the isotopes from running away before they're loaded into the reactor. The idea is to limit nuclear decay outside the reactor, which is useless, so the reaction only starts when enough rods are brought together in the reactor. The poison element gradually burns away when installed in the reactor, making the rod performance predictable. The rods do produce mild radiation on their own, but several orders of magnitude less than when spent, and are quite predictable. Historically the rods were assembled by human workers so they are usually safe to handle (with protective gear); they are most likely assembled by machines now. No amount of protective clothing would let you hold a spent fuel rod for any sane length of time; they are exclusively handled by machines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Uranium is the base fuel. It has a special property that (one specific isotope) will undergo fission with a neutron absorption, and produce more neutrons in the process. </p>
<p>This Uranium has a very long half life. Measured in the billions of years. The longer the half life, the more stable something is. For example, the water in your body is &quot;stable&quot;, meaning it has an indefinite, if not infinite, half-life. </p>
<p>When Uranium undergoes fission, it breaks into two smaller atoms. </p>
<p>Now, the trick here is that Uranium originally has 92 protons. And like 143 neutrons. It needs all those neutrons to add enough nuclear strong force to keep all those protons together. </p>
<p>But, after it splits into two smaller atoms, the ratio of each of them is the same as before for neutron-to-proton. But, now it has way too many neutrons for the number of protons (that's because the neutron is heavier than the proton,). </p>
<p>This means the resulting atomic nuclei are radioactive, typically undergoing beta-minus decay, and typically with very short half-lives, measured in microseconds to hundreds of years. </p>
<p>However, this decay does.produce some heat, but not nearly as much as, or as controllable as, the fission it came from (it's called decay heat). The atoms are also of the wrong type to go through fission again.</p>
<p>&quot;Breeder reactors&quot; try to use the excess neutron flux to turn some of the more non-fissioning elements present is fuel construction into fissionable isotopes. But they aren't reassembling the fission products.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
