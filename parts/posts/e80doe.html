		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two of the important ways to shed heat in our atmosphere (conduction and convection) don't work in space. This leaves just a single heat transfer method: radiation. All objects emit electromagnetic radiation, with the amount (and wavelength) depending on the temperature of the object.</p>
<p>So your spaceship does have a way to get rid of heat, but it'll be far less effective than it would be sitting in your back garden. So despite space being very cold, heat can be a bigger issue than it is on Earth. So heat management is an important area of interest when it comes to designing satellites and other things that go into space.</p>
<p>One of the ways to help cooling is to create a system that moves the heat from the interior parts of the craft to the outer walls of the space craft. The hotter you can make the outer walls, the more cooling you get through radiation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Temperature management is a crucial aspect of spacecraft design, both manned and robotic.</p>
<p>While space itself is a vacuum and has no real &quot;temperature&quot; worth mentioning, radiation from the sun warms objects exposed to it, depending on distance. All objects radiate away heat through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation" target="_blank">black-body-radiation</a> depending on their temperature, however the equilibrium for this to balance out the heat added by sunlight would be a temperature uncomfortable for humans and even most electronics.</p>
<p>We can reduce this heat flux by reflecting this sunlight instead of absorbing it. We can increase the surface area of our spacecraft by adding radiators. If this surface area is kept shaded from the sun, we can use radiation to chill our spacecraft. This process can be enhanced by using <em>active</em> radiators instead of passive radiators. Active radiators use the heat from refrigeration to increase their temperature (and thus black-body radiation). By running at a higher temperature, these active radiators can get rid of far more energy for their size/mass then passive radiators.</p>
<p>Temperature is a balancing act. The more power going <em>into</em> the spacecraft (solar, electrical, etc), the more heat is generated. If more heat is being generated than being radiated away, your temperature will rise.</p>
<p>As a result spacecraft with large power requirements will often feature large deployable radiators. In this <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cpIBo.jpg" target="_blank">picture of the ISS</a> they are clearly visible as 10 large rectangular sections perpendicular to the larger and more distinguishable solar panels. Radiators are placed perpendicular to the sun to avoid absorbing additional heat from sunlight, while the solar panels are placed facing the sun to absorb as much as possible for conversion to electricity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many space probes actually use nuclear batteries (RTG - radio thermolelectric generators) which use the heat of radioactive decay to generate energy… <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope\_thermoelectric\_generator" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope\_thermoelectric\_generator</a></a></p>
<p>Also as others mentioned there are 2 ways to transfer heat… Conduction (touch) and radiation (via infrared for &quot;fairly cool&quot; objects)</p>
<p>The 2nd method is not very efficient to be honest, but since you are in space, there is nothing to touch and transfer the heat to (vacuum), so the only option left is to radiate the heat away. This is done via huge cooling surfaces.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Here is a nice example: <a href="http://21stcenturywaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/iss.2010.jpg" target="_blank"><a href="http://21stcenturywaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/iss.2010.jpg" target="_blank">http://21stcenturywaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/iss.2010.jpg</a></a></p>
<p>The solar panels are the darker object. They are aligned to the sun in order to catch the rays and generate energy. But you can also see the white panels in the middle of the picture. Those are NOT aligned to the sun, so they dont get hit and heat up. Also they are painted in white so they dont absorb light and heat up. The white panels are the cooling arrays of the IIS which radiate the heat out to the void.</p>
<p>Here is a much longer article that explain it (also mentions the need for GOOD insulation due to the extreme temperature ranges) : <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast21mar_1/" target="_blank"><a href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast21mar\_1/" target="_blank">https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast21mar\_1/</a></a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maximizing surface area is still an effective way to radiate heat away in space. This is done using thin metal fins in conjunction with highly reflective surfaces (e.g. the foil you frequently see on spacecraft) and pipes to transfer heat from the sun-facing sides of the craft to the non sun-facing side.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
