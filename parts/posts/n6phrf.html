		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Allergy shots contain the allergens one is allergic to.  Which somehow causes you to build up an immunity to the allergen.  But alot of the stuff you'd be allergic to, is all year round.   So how is it, that constantly being exposed to these allergens naturally, not causes you to not develop an immunity to them?  So I suppose im asking, what's the difference between taking allergy shots, and being exposed to the allergens naturally?  Seems like the exact same thing to me.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s less about immunity and more about desensitization. Immunity from my understanding is creating something in your body to protect you, like creating antibodies. Immunotherapy doesn’t create anything. It’s not creating antibodies. It’s just desensitizing you. Allergens in nature are large enough to easily trigger you. But immunotherapy uses a little bit of allergen at the time, and your body doesn’t see that small amount as much of a threat, so as you keep doing it, your body recognizes it as something commonly seen and normalized. Similar idea to if you saw an elf walk into your bar it’d be weird the first time but if they kept showing up you’d be chill with them fast, but if a horde of elves showed up to your bar you’d panic fast</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's all about the different kinds of antibodies the body produces to defend itself against invaders. They are the immunoglobulins, Ig for short.</p>
<p>When you get a vaccine the intent is to expose you to a bit of the agent of disease to cause your body to produce gamma globulin antibodies, IgG for short. This neat trick wiped out small pox. It is the means of our lifelong immunity to &quot;childhood illnesses&quot; after just one bout with the &quot;germs&quot; that are the causative agent. Gamma globulins collected from animal or human survivors of a disease are used to protect someone recently exposed from getting sick. This is the usual means of treating victims of exposure to the Hepatitis A virus </p>
<p>Mother's milk contains antibodies of the IgA class, they provide temporary immunity to the things Mom has been exposed to to the nursing infant.</p>
<p>There is a branch of our immune system that is directed at parasites that doesn't get nearly the workout that it once did in our modern highly sanitized and urbanized world. Immunity to parasites is mediated by antibodies of the IgE class. These don't directly attack an invader the way the IgG antibodies do, they signal the tissue being invaded by a parasite to become inflamed and go on the attack. Histamine is released to increase blood flow, and guide the movement of immune cells into the region. That is the heart of the problem with allergies.</p>
<p>You get pollen grains in your eyes and up your nose and the body produces IgA antibodies against the offending substances, itchy red eyes, runny nose and all of the other joys of allergy season follow.</p>
<p>The allergy shots are <em>injected</em> so that they expose the blood stream to the offenders to encourage the production of IgG mediated immunity that does not cause the tissue inflammation.</p>
<p>It is not so much a matter of &quot;desensitization&quot; to an allergen but a shift in the way the body deals with the onslaught of the offending substances.  You'll continue battle with <em>and win</em> over the invading allergens, you just do it in a way keeps the victories quiet and avoids the symptoms of allergies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the degree of exposure. An analogy would be, allergens are like people and your body is like a minefield, waiting to just explode. When you're exposed to them in a large amount, all the mines explode simultaneously and you get massive amount of destruction. That leads to you getting symptoms. Runny nose, cough, breathing problem.</p>
<p>When you take allergen shot, it's a small amount of allergen. That allergen only triggers a few mines at a time. They're so few you don't feel the symptoms as much. But they're still exploding. And when you're exposed to it in nature, it won't affect you as much since your mines are all exploded.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of sensitive systems react weirdly to stuff in <del>large</del> small amounts. Consider a massage therapist who is trained to use firm pressure to help people relax. Light pressure can feel tickly.  </p>
<p>That tickly sensarion is your nervous system freaking out because it’s not sure what is going on.   </p>
<p>Why would it freak out? Well, consider two scenarios: one where you’re playing a song and you can hear it just fine, and another where you hear just little quiet fragments of maybe music and they’re at the edge of your perception. What do you do in that second case? You crank up the volume to see if you can hear.  </p>
<p>When there is a clear detection, there’s no amplification of the input/detection signal. But if there’s a maybe detection, a slight hint of triggering the sensors, the system will amplify its input (edit: gain is a better word) to attempt to resolve whether there’s something to detect.  </p>
<p>Our bodies’ immune response works in a similar way. If there’s a shit ton of something coming in, your body learns to deal with it. But if there’s a tiny amount, it’s never really sure if its response is working so it keeps cranking up the response just in case the response so far wasn’t enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
