Gravitiy is a really weak force and small things with a big &quot;static charge&quot; will be affected more, by the forces involved in that, rather than gravity.</p>
<p>Or magic I dunno really.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surface area relative to volume/mass likely plays a role to some extent.</p>
<p>An electrical charge likes to spread out as much as it can, subject to other concerns like trying to equalize if possible. With a larger piece of styrofoam you can carry a much larger charge but the charge is spread out over a larger surface area. Meanwhile it has to contend with a much higher mass. So any given piece of surface has a smaller charge and more weight to hold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Styrofoam is very electrically insulating, so once random electrons get stuck on the surface, they don't want to move around, this combined with its surface roughness means that it is very difficult to get charges off Styrofoam.   </p>
<p>The reason smaller pieces stick to things so well is because as things get smaller they have increased surface area per volume. The static force is proportional to the amount of charges on the surface, which is proportional to the surface area of the piece, where as the force of gravity is dependent on the mass which is proportional to the volume.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Styrofoam is blue extruded polystyrene (not expanded), and is a trademark of Dow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two aspects which contribute to it.  The first is that the polymer is actually not very conductive to electron flow, so if charge is accumulated, it does not quickly dissipate (does not drain to ground).  Another aspect is that the structure is simple and includes a side benzene ring which allows for excess charge to be distributed in a cloud over a large area (in effect, adding a single electron sees the charge get shared among six carbon atoms so there is no big charge disparity at the atomic level but there is a charge disparity at the molecular level).  When several rings are aligned on the same side of the polymer chain, you can get a charge distortion, a negative zone at surface which isn't stable, really, but lacks enough energy to be forced to escape (flee, spark, go to ground).  It is similar, in some ways, to how clay minerals often behave (charge is unevenly distributed across the structure) and will flocculate (glom together from electrostatic forces).</p>
<p>It isn't really that it has an extraordinarily high charge so much as the mass of the styrofoam is small so the force caused by the presence of charge seems large for the volume.  There is a surface charge; it isn't huge (won't shock you when electrons jump) but it is &quot;Huge&quot; relative to the mass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
