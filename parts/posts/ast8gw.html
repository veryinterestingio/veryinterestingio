		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, pretty markedly. Alcohol use tends to be associated with increased levels of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=28925102" target="_blank">endotoxin-producing Enterobacteriaceae and a reduction in taxa that produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)</a>, amongst other changes. </p>
<p>In fact, the degree of gut microbiota upset is linked to the extent of the drinking and the severity of the alcoholic disease. For instance, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=24374295" target="_blank">in this study</a>, patients with alcohol-related cirrhosis had worse dysbiosis than those without alcoholic-related disease, despite abstinence and similar cirrhosis severity. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=24699327" target="_blank">In another study,</a> patients with cirrhosis who continue to drink have a more disrupted microbiota and increased levels of secondary bile acids compared with healthy individuals or abstinent patients with cirrhosis. Alcoholic patients with alcoholic liver disease also have a much higher risk of fungal infections, and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=28530644" target="_blank">alcohol promotes gut fungal overgrowth in animal models</a>.</p>
<p>There is also evidence that the gut microbiota can alter brain function, and thus influence risk of relapse, in animal models, and some association data in humans (eg, alcohol increases intestinal permeability, which enables gut bacteria to enter the bloodstream and correlates with cravings). Hepatic encephalopathy, a very dangerous condition of neurological impairment that occurs in patients with end-stage liver failure, is worse in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24690956?dopt=Abstract" target="_blank">patients with greater microbial perturbations, increased intestinal permeability and levels of bacterial toxins in the blood.</a></p>
<p>Given the role of the microbiota in alcohol-related disease, both in terms of exacerbating liver damage and in potentially influencing cravings, it's no surprise that treatments related to the microbiota are being investigated. The antibiotic rifaxamin is already standard treatment for hepatic encephalopathy, but more exciting is the use of faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). Current trials are non-blinded and small, but FMT seems to improve survival markedly versus other standards of care: 75% 90-day-survival for FMT versus 38% in the steroid group, 29% in the nutrition group and 30% in the pentoxifylline group <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs12664-018-0859-4" target="_blank">in this small trial</a>, and 87.5% overall survival with FMT versus 33.3% overall survival without FMT <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=27816755" target="_blank">in this pilot study.</a>. There are a number of large, ongoing clinical trials being conducted by expert centers in the US and EU. Some studies are also looking at the roles of probiotics, prebiotics or symbiotics - there's some good evidence in animal models but (as I understand it) the clinical evidence is less convincing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Alcohol kills be good bacteria and oftentimes pts/alcoholics can develop IBS. One condition secondary to alcoholism is Wernicke Syndrome, causes dementia like symptoms. And it’s from lack of B12 and B vitamins, which happens when the alcohol eats away at the gut bacteria and lining of the intestines and prevents absorption of them. We give people on alcohol withdrawal “Banana Bags”, which is basically IV infusion of fluid and vitamins since they are harder to be absorbed in the gut.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question. When I was suffering through a pretty marked period of alcoholism (sober now 2 1/2 years!) I always wondered if was 'sanitizing' my stomach's bacterial population, and then through repeated 'sanitizations' if I were created a population of bacterium that was basically suited to their environment, if that makes any sense. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
