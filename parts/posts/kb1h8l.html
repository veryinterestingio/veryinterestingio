		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s a description of the technology used in the <a href="https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/vaccines/uq-csl-v451-vaccine" target="_blank">UQ-CSL V451 Vaccine</a> in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7672035/" target="_blank">Rapid Response Subunit Vaccine Design in the Absence of Structural Information</a>. A simplified description is </p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have developed a proprietary recombinant protein expression approach, Molecular Clamp, comprising a highly stable trimerization domain, that when incorporated into viral fusion proteins effectively constrain them in their native pre-fusion conformation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What they’re doing is using protein modules to force vaccine targets into their optimal configuration for immunity. This general approach, using small segments of proteins to modify structures, is basically universal among molecular biology today, and there are thousands of ways of doing it. </p>
<p>In this case, the vaccine repurposed a small section of an HIV protein to stabilize the structure they wanted. Why HIV? Probably because HIV has been so well studied that the functional parts of its proteins are very clearly understood. The vaccine made use of two small parts of one HIV protein:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>To generate a soluble, secreted antigen the Molecular Clamp, comprising of hepad repeat (HR) regions 1 and 2 of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 glycoprotein 41 (gp41), is incorporated into recombinant viral glycoproteins in place of the C-terminal transmembrane/cytoplasmic region.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That may sound complicated to a non-molecular biologist but to those in the field it reads like “I went to Home Depot and grabbed a pack of #8 3/8 -inch screws”. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, it turns out apparently that some of the vaccine recipients generated an immune reaction to the little pieces of HIV in the modified protein. That’s slightly surprising but not a shock, because the pieces are, after all, there in the final protein. I gather that it was a minority of the recipients who made this response and that’s not surprising either. <em>edit</em> u/Archy99 pointed out this article, which has good explanations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every single participant who had been given the vaccine tested weakly positive on certain standard HIV tests that are built to look specifically for antibodies to the HIV wrapper protein – known as glycoprotein 41.</p>
<p>Many of the positives were weak. “We’re right on the cusp” of detection, said Professor Trent Munro, director of the university’s vaccine program. But they were there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—<a href="https://www.theage.com.au/national/how-crucial-was-the-uq-csl-vaccine-to-australia-and-what-options-do-we-now-have-20201211-p56mlj.html" target="_blank">Here's what went wrong with UQ's vaccine - and what we do now</a></p>
<p>I don’t know what standard HIV antibody tests look for (<em>edit</em> at least some if not all of the tests include screening for gp41, the source of the molecular clamp, but I don’t know if the molecular clamp regions are in all the tests), but apparently these little parts of the protein are in the test, so these antibodies made it look as if the recipients were positive on the test. It would be extremely easy to show that they weren’t truly positive, because only this one tiny region of the HIV would light up, but that’s extra labor and probably not a standard part of testing. Certainly it could cause confusion. </p>
<p>Abandoning the vaccine given that many other vaccines are already further ahead without this complication seems reasonable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For those wondering why it got cancelled, here’s what I’ve gleaned from the Australian press and releases.</p>
<p>The Australian Government withdrew its order for this vaccine due to concerns over public perception. The main reason is to remove any opportunity for the anti-vaxxers to link vaccines with HIV. </p>
<p>Unfortunately the Australian Government had to withdraw its order to maintain public confidence in covid vaccines. They couldn’t afford to link the vaccines to the stigma that unfortunately remains around HIV.</p>
<p>Our Prime Minister said in the presser “it would be stupid to get your medical advice from Facebook and I know that Australians aren’t stupid”.   I believe this to be an oblique reference to anti-vac crazies.</p>
<p>The technology likely works but will never go past Phase 1 trials.  A real shame since CSL and biotech is an important part of diversifying our economy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
