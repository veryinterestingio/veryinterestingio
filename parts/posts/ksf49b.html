But if you check a file size of an actual 10 minute video, it is only around 1GB. How can it be so small?</p></div></div>

<p>Periodically there will be a full frame, called a “key frame”, just to reset everything but most of the “frames” in the file are just a small list of changes from the prior frame. Unless there’s a jump cut, there is usually very little difference between adjacent frames. </p>
<p>Basically, the video file isn’t the video, it’s instructions to the software on how to recreate the video in real time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Videos generally don't store every single frame.</p>
<p>Since most frames in a video are only a little different from the one before it (either colours changing slightly or pixels moving slightly), you can instead include instructions on how to draw the next frame based on changing the previous one. This is a much smaller amount of data.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Multiple reasons.</p>
<p>A 5MB JPEG (compressed) image is probably 20 megapixels in resolution. While even 4K video is equivalent to an 8 megapixel image size.</p>
<p>That's automatically 2.5 times smaller of you choose, for want of a better common ground, the same 'compression rate' or loss of image quality. </p>
<p>But you actually can have different levels of compression and image quality. Also, video doesn't store individual frames for the whole le gth of the clip. The largest part of a video file is recording movements, and therefore almost no information is required for parts of the image that don't move.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Compression between frames</p>
<p>When you take a picture your phone compresses it before saving it, but it only has the data in that one frame to work with.  A picture of a deer running in front of a forest will get compressed really well in the area showing a clear blue sky but can't be compressed as much (without losing too much quality) in the detail rich areas showing the forest and the grass</p>
<p>Videos are compressed first <em>between frames</em> then within the frame.  Take a video of a deer running in front of a forest, how many times should you save the data showing the blue sky at the top?  Just once.  Compression between frames gives wayyyy better results because things tend to stay in roughly the same place in a video or just get shifted so you can just store &quot;take block 17, move 5 pixels left&quot; rather than having to store the entirety of block 17 for every single frame.</p>
<p>Ever encounter a GIF that's massive but the GIFV is really small?  That's because GIFs are compressed frame by frame, but have no compression between frames, they're effectively a series of full images like you're thinking of and can't benefit from the pixels staying the same over time which is why a GIF can be 10x bigger than the same file saved as a video</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
