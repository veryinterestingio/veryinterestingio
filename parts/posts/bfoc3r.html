		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Moisturizers supply a little bit of water to the skin and contain an oily substance that holds it in. </p>
<p>Years ago, most people used Vaseline (petroleum jelly)—often applied after bathing. Now we use fancier products that feel less greasy. Many also contain humectants (hyoo-MEK-tants), which absorb and retain water. Emollients fill in rough spots and make skin feel smooth but don't affect the water content.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are different types ingredients in moisturizers: mainly humectants, emollients, and occlusives.  The terms are not mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>Humectants work by drawing moisture into your skin layers. They can draw the water from the environment if its humid enough or deeper layers of your skin.</p>
<p>Emollients work by softening the skin and forming a barrier to water loss.  Emollients are occlusives but not all occlusives are emollients.</p>
<p>Occlusives are substances that form a physical barrier to water loss.</p>
<p>A good moisturizer will have different combinations of each.  The emollients and humectants will soften the skin and keep it soft and flush while the emollients and occlusives help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>So thinking that sticking your skin in water will help water retention is logical but it actually speeds up water loss because as the water evaporates, it pulls water out of your skin even faster.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The goal of a moisturizer is to _block_ the body's loss of water.  Typically, it's the fats in your skin (oils -the stuff you wash off) that keeps the water well contained within your skin.  Moisturizers fill this role.  If you put water on your skin you're likely decreasing this &quot;barrier&quot; by washing it away.</p>
<p>While some moisturizers are just for momentary effect, any that actually help you get back to equilibrium are keeping water from your body in, not actually adding water. The immediate feeling of smoother moisturized skin is topically other materials that either are or behave like fats.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Moisturisers tend to 'trap' moisture that's already on your skin or in the moisturiser preventing it from evaporating from the skin surface, and therfore keeping it moist. </p>
<p>It's one of the main reasons why people are told to apply moisturisers after a bath or shower, to trap the moisture provided by the bath or shower.</p>
<p>If you just get out of the bath (ie, your hands in hot water from your question) the water evaporates and then your skin is dry again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The moisture in your skin isn’t water. It’s fat (lipids). This is the same reason why dieticians and many moms say, “don’t eat the chicken skin, it’s got fat in it.” Fat makes skin flexible and healthy. Solvents such as alcohol, paint thinner, acetone, etc. can remove fat from skin, causing chapping—or worse, “defatting dermatitis.”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
