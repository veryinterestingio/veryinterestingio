		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simplest way I can think to describe it is not entirely accurate, but most people “get it” when I explain this way.  </p>
<p>Think of time itself as occurring at the speed of light. It’s then easy to see why, in a universe where nothing can move faster than light, traveling near the speed of light would make time appear to be slow, because you’re basically keeping pace with time itself.  </p>
<p>If a car is traveling at 100mph and it drives by while you’re standing still, that car seems really fast. But if you’re driving at 99mph and that same car passes you at 100mph, the relative speed of that car is only 1mph. The concept is similar to this, though as I said, not entirely accurate because with light and time, nothing <em>can</em> go any faster than light.  </p>
<p>For what it’s worth, light doesn’t have anything to do with the speed of light. The speed of light should really be called the speed of causality. Light is just the most common and apparent thing that moves at that speed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is the thought experiment that allowed Einstein to begin conceptualizing his work (or, at least this is the story that gets told)</p>
<p>Einstein was walking home from his job as a parent clerk, when he hopped on the trolley in his city (I forget which at this point in his life, forgive me)</p>
<p>As he was riding home from work he looked at the clocktower and imagined the hands being exactly where they were when he was looking at them, but then imagined his boxcar moving at the speed of light.</p>
<p>He realized that, if he was able to move at the speed of light in his boxcar, those hands on the clocktower would never move again, from his point of view. </p>
<p>He would be moving just as fast as the light that carries the information that tells us 'the minute hand just moved', therefore that information could never catch him and update him upon the current position of the hands. </p>
<p>They would basiclly be frozen in time until he slowed back down </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;If there was an easy way to explain this, it wouldn't be worth the Nobel Prize.&quot; -Richard Feynman.</p>
<p>But maybe this will help. First, let's lay a little groundwork.</p>
<p>Imagine you're standing in a field, and there are two people each exactly 40 feet away from you, one on your left and one on your right. Each has a dog on a leash! The dogs are super excited to see you and both people let their dogs off the leash at exactly the same time.</p>
<p>If both dogs run toward you at the same speed, they will both reach you at the same time. But you REALLY like dogs and don't want to wait! So you start running TOWARDS one of the dogs! What happens?</p>
<p>Well, you reach that dog earlier. Because you covered some of the distance yourself. And the other dog arrives LATER because, since you ran away from it (and toward the other dog) you ADDED some distance between you.</p>
<p>That should be relatively (lol) straightforward. So let's add a small wrinkle.</p>
<p>Imagine I'm standing at a train station. There's a train coming, but it doesn't stop here. You're on the train. The only thing special about this train is that it happens to be travelling close to the speed of light.</p>
<p>Then two bolts of lightning hit the platform, one to my left and one to my right. Both are exactly the same distance from me, so the light from each bolt arrives at my eyeballs at the same time, <strong>I see the two strikes happen simultaneously.</strong> Same as how, if you had stayed still, both dogs would have reached you at the same time.</p>
<p>But the lightning bolts strike JUST as you are passing by. So that, for a moment, we are exactly opposite each other. If I was looking straight ahead when the lightning bolts hit, I would see you across from me in the train.</p>
<p>What do YOU see when the lightning bolts hit? Well, the train is moving. It's moving TOWARD one bolt, and AWAY from the other. Just like in our example, you ran TOWARD one dog and AWAY from the other. So...like in our example, you are going to REACH the light from one lightning strike EARLIER than the other because the train moved toward it. Therefore <strong>you SEE the light from one bolt BEFORE you see the light from the other bolt.</strong></p>
<p>Which of us is correct? I saw two bolts of light hit the platform at the same time. You saw one bolt hit, then the other.</p>
<p>Einstein proved that...there is no test you can perform, no test you could EVER perform, that would resolve this contradiction. I saw a simultaneous event, you saw one bolt hit, and then the other. Because you were moving close to the speed of light when this happened.</p>
<p>In fact this means...<strong>there is no such thing as simultaneity</strong>. ANY TIME one person perceives two different events happening at the same time, another person in another frame of reference might see one happen before the other and there is NO WAY to tell which is &quot;correct.&quot; It's just that we don't notice this unless one of us is traveling very close to the speed of light. It's still true, it just almost impossible to measure in our normal lives.</p>
<p>The only solution is...time is different for us. We are experiencing time differently, and in fact we are experiencing space differently as well. Your train would appear shorter, to me, than it does to you. </p>
<p>At this point I fear my explanation would get very esoteric and not in the spirit of an ELI5 but hopefully this was at least interesting and not confusing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The illustration which impressed this upon me is this: imagine person A is standing in a train car with glass walls and bounces a rubber ball off the floor, and back into their hand. This is observed by person B standing stationary on the platform the train is rolling past. </p>
<p>Both observe the ball to travel down, bounce, travel up and be caught in the same time. However, person A observes a vertical motion down, then up, while person B observes a V-shaped trajectory. The vertical component is the same height for person B, but the ball also translates laterally while falling down, then further translates as it climbs back up. </p>
<p>Now, the time is the same, but the distance for person B is longer. Therefore the ball travels faster from the perspective of person B. Since B is stationary, let's flip the perspective: from the perspective of person A, the ball will travel slower since it covers less distance in the same timeframe. The same ball, doing the same thing, viewed from different perspectives travels at a different speed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a relevant  comment from /u/his_savagery which is <em>related</em> to your question, OP asked about relative speed of light. It is one of the easier explanations I've seen so I've saved it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wow, OP. You've asked the very same question that Einstein asked himself to come up with one of the most revolutionary ideas in physics!</p>
<p>You are correct that speed is relative. If I'm walking up an escalator at 2 m/s and the escalator is moving at 5m/s then my speed relative to a person standing still at the bottom of the escalator is 7 m/s, but to someone else on the escalator who is standing still and waiting patiently for the escalator to transport them to the next floor my speed is 2 m/s.</p>
<p>But light travels at the same speed from all perspectives. Say a spaceship is traveling at 90% the speed of light. If I shine a torch from the back of the spaceship to the front and someone on the ground can see through the spaceship's window, then the light from the torch will appear to move at the speed of light to both of us. But the escalator example would suggest that to the person on the ground, it should be traveling at 90% of the speed of light + the speed of light i.e. at 190% of the speed of light. So how can it appear to move at the speed of light to both of us? Well, if the person on the ground is looking through the window and everything in the ship (including not only the beam of light from the torch, but the people inside the ship) is moving in slow motion, then the beam of light can appear to move at the speed of light.</p>
<p>Mind blowing, eh? To solve the paradox, time must be relative! Time inside the ship appears to be slowed down to the person on the ground, and conversely everyone outside the ship looks like they're running around like ants to the people inside. Actually, there's a bit more to it than that, since distances are affected too. But thinking about it like this is a good starting point</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope it helped you understand it too, even if your question wasn't specifically aimed towards <em>speed</em> (directly).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
