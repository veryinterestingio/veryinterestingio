		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems like this virus is behaving like the previous coronavirus outbreak (SARS). <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3323399/" target="_blank">This paper</a> highlights how SARS could infect a variety of animals, including monkey, cat, ferret, mouse, and pig. <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.015347v1" target="_blank">Very recently</a>, similar findings were seen with covid-19. </p>
<p>I think a house cat has tested positive for covid-19. However, we do not know if there is animal to human transmission, nor how this virus replicates in animal hosts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both the HongKong dog and the New York Tiger have been <a href="https://nextstrain.org/ncov?c=host" target="_blank">sequenced</a>. Both had an infection and detectable RNA in the nose for several days, for the dog the viral load was low. </p>
<p>[A lab paper said]( <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.015347v1" target="_blank">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.015347v1</a>) &quot;SARS-CoV-2 replicates poorly in dogs, pigs, chickens, and ducks, but efficiently in ferrets and cats&quot;, in particular dogs can't transmit the disease efficiently. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.021196v1" target="_blank">A paper</a> found antibodies in several Hubei cats.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cell.com/pb-assets/journals/research/cell-host-microbe/PDFs/chom_2285_preproof.pdf" target="_blank">Another one</a> found that ferret are efficiently infected in lab and transmit the disease to each other, even if it is mainly upper respiratory tract (thus no severe pneumonia).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.939389v3" target="_blank">Mice are not succeptible</a> but human-ACE2 transgenic mice are and develop a mild pneumonia.
