		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's a great question and one that is actively being investigated. The vaccine trials excluded anyone with COVID so we don't know how the vaccine will affect people that have already been infected. Obviously, not everyone who has had COVID was tested so there are potentially tens of millions of people that would fall into this group.</p>
<p>Here's CDC guidance for now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is not enough information currently available to say if or for how long after infection someone is protected from getting COVID-19 again; this is called natural immunity. Early evidence suggests natural immunity from COVID-19 may not last very long, but more studies are needed to better understand this. Until we have a vaccine available and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices makes recommendations to CDC on how to best use COVID-19 vaccines, CDC cannot comment on whether people who had COVID-19 should get a COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am part of the team analyzing data for many clinical trials. An antibody test is being performed in many trials however a positive result won't exclude you from getting the vaccine as it takes too long to analyze. However, these individuals will be excluded from the efficacy results.</p>
<p>As far as I know Moderna actually requires a negative ab test at both doses in order to count. Again however, if you are positive they'll keep you in the study because it's important to know how the vaccine interacts with natural immunity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I currently work on the clinical research team for the AstraZeneca (Oxford Vaccine). We exclude those that have ever tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via lab testing. However, we absolutely do not exclude those who may have antibodies when we draw on their Day 1/Dose 1 visits. We draw those samples the same day they are dosed and the trial is completely blind so the clinicians do not see any lab results.</p>
<p>Edit for clarification: We exclude those who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 prior to enrollment and randomization. Those that happen to get sick on the trial are not kicked from the trial, they are moved to an illness visit schedule.</p>
<p>Edit2: I am trying to respond ASAP in between visits today. Keep the questions coming! :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I doubt it.  </p>
<p>(1) We will likely have more data on the vaccine's efficacy than we will on the strength and duration of natural immunity.  </p>
<p>(2) Not all antibodies are neutralizing antibodies, so the mere presence of antibodies does not necessarily mean that the person is protected.   </p>
<p>(3) For herd immunity to have a shot, we'll need to vaccinate the majority of the American public (I've seen numbers ranging from 60-80%).  A lot of places can barely get 40% or 50% uptake of annual flu vaccines.  There is no rapid point-of-care test for covid antibodies that can immediately tell you if someone has antibodies.  The antibody tests I've sent to the lab have taken 3-4 days to get results.  Sticking that sort of a barrier in front of vaccination when we want the populace to get vaccinated would not make sense.   Even for viruses where we do have rapid point-of-care antibody tests, they take about 25 minutes to get a result.  People coming to Walgreens or Wal-Mart for their covid shot probably don't want the extra wait and expense. </p>
<p>(4) There's likely very little harm in giving a covid-19 vaccine to someone who's already been infected.  When vaccine stocks are limited, giving someone a vaccine when they're already protected is a waste of a vaccine that could protect someone else.  But the early priorities for vaccination are the people who need protection the most, and there's no easy way to tell if a person is protected following natural infection, so it's probably just worth giving them the vaccine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
