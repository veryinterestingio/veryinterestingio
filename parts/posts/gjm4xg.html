		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Short answer:</strong> Lower orbits decay fastest. The ISS is relatively low and so it suffers relatively high losses to drag, but populated orbits go to high altitudes where atmospheric drag effectively becomes negligible. </p>
<p><strong>Long answer:</strong> Just because the ISS is 400 km up doesn't mean it's entirely out of the atmosphere. The thinnest, wispiest gas of the atmosphere is up there producing a tiny amount of drag. Ultimately, the drag slows the ISS enough to drop its orbit by about 2 km/month. If left unchecked, the ISS will sink deeper in its orbit into thicker atmosphere where the decay will accelerate. Likewise, the higher an object orbits, the thinner the atmosphere it finds itself in. As a result, higher orbits experience less friction meaning it takes far longer for them to decay. The density of the atmosphere drops roughly exponentially with altitude, and so to does atmospheric drag.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, a 1000 km orbit will decay in ~1000 years, a 400 km altitude orbit will decay in ~years, while a 200 km altitude orbit will decay in days. We say that these lowest orbits are 'self cleaning.' Space junk litters all orbital heights, whether they're spent rocket boosters, dead satellites, debris from collisions, or even just chips of paint. So, higher than 400-500 km, we get into a range where orbits don't decay in the timespan of human spaceflight, and that is where junk has been accumulating. If you check this <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/SpaceDebrisHistogram.png" target="_blank">plot</a> you'll see that the bulk of junk is in orbits higher than the quick self cleaning range, which makes sense. Junk accumulates there since there is no means to deorbit it quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some good detailed answers already, but the gist of it is: there's no precise boundary at which the atmosphere stops and the vacuum of space begins. The ISS still experiences drag being in such low altitude orbit, so they have to boost the orbital velocity, which in turn increases the orbital altitude. A lot of space junk does eventually succumb to the drag as well and re-enter the atmosphere to eventually burn off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Really Short Answer:</strong><br />
1 - ISS is in a very low orbit and it's the size of a football field, So it suffers from a lot of drag pulling it down.<br />
2- Space Junk is smaller and in all sorts of different orbits but usually higher up, so a lot less drag.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the reasons given. When they replaced the solar panels on the Hubble Space telescope they just pushed them off.</p>
<p>The idea was that because they were so light and so large that drag would make them re-enter the atmosphere in a few months.</p>
<p>Unfortunately they were pushed too gently and went into an edge on configuration, a low drag configuration, which meant it took years for them to deorbit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer comes in two parts: altitude, and mass-to-surface-area ratio.</p>
<p>The lower the altitude of the orbit, the more traces of atmosphere an object encounters to slow it down.  High stuff decays slower than low stuff.</p>
<p>The more surface area an object has for a given weight, the more air resistance it encounters.  A lump of something solid, like a chunk of aluminum, will be slowed down less than a hollow object with stuff like solar panels, booms and robot arms sticking out in every direction.</p>
<p>So the space station will be slowed down more by residual atmospheric drag than any lumps of metal in nearby orbits which might hit it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
