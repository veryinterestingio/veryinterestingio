		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are large areas in the middle of the major oceanic basins called the subtropical gyres. These could be considered the deserts of the ocean in that the biomass (total mass of all organisms) density and biodiversity are low. This is because the ocean circulation doesn't replenish the nutrients available in these areas for algae to live off, which are the base of the food-chain.</p>
<p>In general, you tend to find much more biomass and biodiversity closer to the coasts. But you can get hotspots of productivity in other places such as upwelling regions and also near seamounts <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661116300702" target="_blank">(shameless plug of my paper on this)</a>.</p>
<p>Vertically, there is much much more life in the surface 100 m or so as this is where algae can photosynthesise. But even in the ocean deserts (subtropical gyres) you can find all sorts of life in the deep ocean and buried in the mud at the bottom of the ocean. Just not as much as near coasts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neons is right the the most likely thing you would find in that slice of ocean is plankton or cyanobacteria or other microorganisms. The likelihood of you picking a random spot in the deep Pacific and finding a larger living creature there is pretty rare.
If you haven't checked out Blue Planet you should. Its a great series and has an episode specific to the deep open oceans. It talks about the vast expanses of nothing between pockets of dynamic life within the deep oceans. All driven by food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Teeming is a relative term. Typically terrestrial and marine biologists both use Chlorophyll-A concentrations as a proxy for measuring life abundance over a large scale area. This is because the producers in an environment fix carbon via photosynthesis, and the pigment Chlorophyll can be measured by satellites as a substitute for plant biomass. NASA satellite imagery of Chl-A can be seen <a href="https://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/4000/4097/S19972442003273_lrg.jpg" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>Notice, most open ocean areas have low Chl-A while coastal zones and select parts of open ocean have higher Chl-A. This is all due to the physical mixing properties of the ocean. Water is not unlike air, in that the warmest (aka least dense) water will float to the top, and the coldest, most dense water will sink to the bottom. Generally, in the open ocean this means the difference in density between the water upper layers and the icy depths is too great, and water can not upwell from the deep to the surface. To circle it back to the original question, when nutrient-rich water from the depths can not upwell, the top water columns of the ocean can not re-cycle nutrients, meaning the nutrient poor-water can not support high densities of primary producers (phytoplankton in the oceans, grass/trees/etc. on land). With low densities of phytoplankton, zooplankton growth will be limited, then small fish will be limited, then big fish, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Additional information edit:</strong></p>
<p>You may notice that the areas of high open ocean productivity coincide with the areas on this <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jochen_Kaempf/publication/307434835/figure/fig11/AS:601718358306830@1520472244610/Locations-of-significant-coastal-upwelling-regions-in-the-world-ocean.png" target="_blank">map</a>. These are major upwelling areas of the oceans, generally caused by the wind (although density-driven upwelling does occur in select places). In these areas, nutrient rich waters from the depths rise up to supply vast amounts of ocean life, a prime example being the fishing grounds of South America's West Coast. </p>
<p>As a side bit, I'm sure you are familiar with open ocean water generally being pretty clear and blue. This is in fact due to the low levels of phytoplankton, as high concentrations will cloud the water. Look at some of the famous examples of clear water beaches (Greece, parts of the Caribbean, Pacific Atolls). Even as coastal areas, they are still low in productivity and concentrations of phytoplankton and as a result their water is clear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
