<p>Why does it sometimes feel like starting a new thing or task is so much effort even if we know it'll make us happier or more relaxed?</p>
<p>Like when you're exhausted from a long day and you want to take a shower, but you feel too lazy to go through the whole process. If you manage to force yourself in, you frequently feel loads better and don't know why you ever felt like you didn't want to shower in the first place.</p></div></div>

<p>Change involves the possibility of negative risk, causing you to lose time or resources. When people evaluate their situation, they often feel safer avoiding negative risk entirely than pursuing a positive risk/opportunity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One reason may be because it's daunting. To start something new will mean you'll either commit time to it or buzzer off. To watch one movie or take a shower it seems less, but to start a book, series, or game could take hours. It's human to be hesitant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Shower, maybe because it involves actually doing something. There is some willpower involved with that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
