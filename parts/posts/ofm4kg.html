		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cold (above freezing) doesn't completely prevent bacteria from forming, it just slows down their reproduction. Since bacterial growth is exponential, eventually enough bacteria will have multiplied in refrigerated meat to pose a health risk.</p>
<p>Frozen meat is a bit different. It's quite difficult for any bacteria to actually reproduce in something that's fully frozen solid. In theory, a vacuum sealed frozen meat product has an indefinite deep frozen shelf life. However freezer temperatures can sometimes fluctuate and give bacteria an opportunity to multiply. The main reason that frozen food spoils is mainly due to freezer burn (dehydration and oxidation) in improperly stored items. And this spoilage isn't a health risk, it just makes the food taste awful and have an unpleasant texture. Plastic packaging also has its own expiry date, past which point it can't be guaranteed to prevent moisture loss or oxidation, or possibly offgassing of chemicals/deterioration of the plastic.</p>
<p>I have eaten meat that I properly stored frozen for years and it was perfectly fine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>also please consider there are two types of freezers. </p>
<p>chest freezer is very different to your normal freezer fridge in one regard, frost management.</p>
<p>fridge freezer defrosts because no one likes seeing ice buildup, now how does it defrost if it's kept constantly way under freezing temperature?</p>
<p>it stops cooling and heats the panel most likely to have ice build up to melt away the ice!</p>
<p>that's why stuff spoils in the freezer. also reason why not to get a chest freezer with auto defrost function, as it totally defies the purpose of a chest freezer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
