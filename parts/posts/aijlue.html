They are much lighter than a solid rock, sometimes even to the point of floating in water. So, if you are looking in an area where they are common, look along riverbeds and look in places where lighter rocks are likely to gather.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Geodes are formed in rocks that have enclosed cavities. These cavities form most often in igneous rock because lava has bubbles and also in sedimentary rock. Water is able to seep in and leave behind dissolved minerals, forming the crystals. Geodes are boring on the outside because I suppose the enclosure makes it easier for crystals to grow, as the outside of it is exposed to the elements and erosion. Geodes form frequently in places with volcanoes or limestone (like Iowa, the best place in the U.S. to find geodes). Since geodes are hollow (completely filled in ones are called nodules), they should be relatively less dense.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Magma at relatively shallow depths often contains gas bubbles as volatile compounds - such as water and carbon dioxide escape from the molten rock. If the magma solidifies before these bubbles can escape then a hollow, called a vesicle, is formed.</p>
<p>The crystals that make up the geode are known as secondary formations - because the form after the rock itself. They are precipitated out of fluids circulating through the rock, just like salt will crystallise out of seawater. They usually form at very high temperatures (several hundred Celsius)  and relatively high pressures (hundreds of atmospheres) where water has unusual properties such as being able to dissolve substances which are usually thought to be insoluble. By weight, water makes up several percent of magma. As the magma cools, the water partially reacts with minerals in the rock to form hydrated minerals, but part of it remains liquid flowing through pores and fissure in the rock, dissolving minerals as it does so.</p>
<p>Quartz is very common in geodes. Quartz, (silicon oxide) is a good example of a mineral that can be remobilised by  hydrothermal water because it is moderately soluble at high temperatures and pressures. When the water finds its way into a vesicle, silica can begin growing from the walls of the vesicle. If the flow of liquid continues over very long periods,  perfect crystals of quartz will form inside the vesicle to create a geode. If the water is very pure you will end up with white quartz or colourless rock crystal. Tiny concentrations of iron will produce reds and oranges and browns, manganese will create purples and a touch of radioactivity will create deep browns.</p>
<p>If the silica crystals are microscopic then you will get chalcedony (agates and onyx). Calcium carbonate (calcite) is also common as is dolomite (calcium, magnesium carbonate); more occasionally you will find fluorite (calcium fluoride), haematite (iron oxide) or gypsum (calcium sulfate).</p>
<p>The same hydrothermal water that creates geodes can also strip metals out of the cooling magma, especially if it is charged with acidic substances such as carbon dioxide, fluorides and sulfur. These tend to migrate out of the magma into the surrounding rocks where they cool and crystallise to form metal ore bodies. Many of the big ore deposits for substances such as tin and silver - such as those of Cornwall in the UK and the Andean mines formed this way.</p>
<p>HTH.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know a good way to spot one but I know a little bit of how they form.  Basically, minerals in water will seep into a hollow area, like an animal's burrow and deposit forming a shell.  That's the &quot;boring&quot; outer part of the geode, which will be hollow. Then, over time the crystals form as more minerals, usually quartz, get laid down at spots inside the shell.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
