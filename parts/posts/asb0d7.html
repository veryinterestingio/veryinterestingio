		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The major difference seems to be not only the digital aspect but the amount of plastic used as well. My wife used the dollar ones that she bought online, they are just a little stick of paper basically, and they seem to be just as accurate being she tested it quite a bit right after she found out she was pregnant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They all have to meet the same minimum requirements set forth by the government. So they all meet certain standards regarding accuracy and efficacy. Some of them exceed those standards. Some of them have more plastic, or a nice digital read out. Some boast earlier detection of pregnancy, before the first missed period even. But the bottom line is, they all work. If you are late, go to the dollar store. If you are trying to get pregnant, go to the dollar store. If your girlfriend is freaking out because she is two days late and she doesn't trust her birth control, well then dorp the $20 for a 3 pack of &quot;Nicer&quot; tests from the pharmacy to buy her some piece of mind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
