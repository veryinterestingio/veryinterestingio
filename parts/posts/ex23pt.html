		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You might not be aware that in the US and Europe, Microsoft was in trouble for the same thing. Microsoft had bundled Microsoft Internet Explorer with Windows to the detriment of other browsers, resulting in a near monopoly for Internet Explorer -- something hard to imagine now that Chrome is dominant.</p>
<p>But also keep in mind, it isn't <em>necessarily</em> illegal to bundle services and apps. Whether you have a monopoly, and whether you're abusing that monopoly, and whether your actions constitute predatory dealing (among other things) are nuances of law and seldom clear cut.</p>
<p>Part of the case against Google is that they were giving away Android to suppress operating system competitors while then <em>also</em> abusing that monopoly to push Google products. To EU regulators, that went over the line, but if Google had stronger competition in the mobile space, it may not have.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Honestly your question should have been why Google and Microsoft got fined while Apple is doing the same things but didn't get fined. Or why this is apparently an issue on desktop computers and laptops but not on smartphones, which come pre-installed with a load of software...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
