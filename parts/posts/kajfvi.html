		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI 5:
Your nerves are cells that specialize in sending signals throughout your body allowing you to feel and move.</p>
<p>They can be very long and they have special layers that let them transmit signals.</p>
<p>The fact that they are long and layered means that they are more delicate than other cells.</p>
<p>The vibrations knock around and damage many of the cells in your hands. The damage is kind of like a bruise on the cell. Other cells can deal with this because they are small, simpler, or easily replaced.  But nerves aren't small, simple, or easily replaced.</p>
<p>When they are damaged they can send weird messages. Sometimes pain, temperature, itchiness, numbness, or other weird feeling things.</p>
<p>Non ELI 5:
This paper has a great intro on the subject, but fair warning experiments on animals are also described:</p>

<p>Edit: I'm very glad many of you found this explanation helpful.  </p>
<p>I'm getting several replies asking about personal moments of potential exposure and lasting effects. So I'm going to try to start adding some links to the occupational resources I can find below. I'm not a medical doctor or treatment professional and so while I will try to reply with resources or advice, please see your real doctor about these issues for diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>Hand Arm Vibration Syndrome (HAVS) is the umbrella term for the condition that can include neurological, vascular, or musculoskeletal effects. Every body will respond differently to potential exposure levels. So duration and long term outcomes can differ. It's therefore important to consult a doctor about treatment.</p>
<p>The best way to reduce risk is to limit exposure. Using PPE like vibration gloves can also help. And keeping good and warm circulation to the fingers.</p>
