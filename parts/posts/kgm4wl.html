My understanding is that Covid spreads primarily through exhaled droplets. Could the new strain cause a higher viral load or make it hang in the air longer?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Things that make viruses more transmissible are usually related to their envelope proteins, replication speed, or fusion/entry mechanisms. </p>
<p>We don't have much info yet, but in the case of Coronavirus (a enveloped, single stranded, + sense RNA virus), that means that there was a slight mutation which A) helps the virus attach to more receptors than just the ones we're used to and enter cells more quickly, B) replicate more quickly C) Exit from the cell it infects more quickly D) hang out in cell types that are easier to exhale (higher up in the respiratory tract) or E) survive the environment (outside of a host) for a little longer.</p>
<p>It's unlikely that the new strain causes it to hang in the air longer (that would be a significant mutation as opposed to a smaller one we're expecting) and it could affect viral load through the aforementioned mechanism of replicating faster. But no one is quite sure yet, hopefully it's not a significant change to the spike protein (kinda unlikely but nothing is for certain with this wacky virus).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In this case it is more capable of infecting cells due to a change in the spike protein so it either makes victims produce more virus, perhaps by attacking more types of cell, or is more likely to cause infection at a lower exposure level, perhaps both.</p>

<p>“There are two notable sets of mutation - and I apologise for their hideous names.</p>
<p>Both are found in the crucial spike protein, which is the key the virus uses to unlock the doorway into our body's cells in order to hijack them.</p>
<p>The mutation N501 (I did warn you) alters the most important part of the spike, known as the &quot;receptor-binding domain&quot;.</p>
<p>This is where the spike makes first contact with the surface of our body's cells. Any changes that make it easier for the virus to get inside are likely to give it an edge.”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't know yet and there are several 'biological' possibilities already on the thread. But it could be something as simple as being less likely to cause symptoms, or a longer time to developing symptoms (incubation period). People who are a- or pre-symptomatic don't curl up in bed feeling sorry for themselves, they go about their normal lives not knowing anything is wrong, so they're more likely to encounter other people to infect.</p>
<p>Should add that, although there is some evidence that this new strain is more transmissible, it's an extremely difficult thing to study. The R number is an average over an entire population but the R for individual cases varies enormously with a large proportion of cases thought to infect no one at all and a very small proportion thought to infect hundreds or thousands. Higher/increasing prevalence could simply be down to chance. If, for example, the person this mutation arose in worked in a poorly ventilated factory, it would infect a lot of people with school-age children and (with all UK schools open since this mutation arose in September) who go to school with a lot of children whose parents have poorly-ventilated workplaces. That could easily spark off a chain of transmission that looks a lot like what we're seeing. Distinguishing between a chance chain of events and actual greater transmissibility is very difficult.</p>
<p>The good news is that it doesn't seem to be associated with more severe disease so the main worry is whether the vaccines protect as effectively against it. But the effectiveness of the vaccines is already an average over hundreds of variants and AFAIK there is no good reason to think this one is any different in that important respect. <a href="https://ccdd.hsph.harvard.edu/2020/12/17/covid-19-vaccines-and-herd-immunity/" target="_blank">We don't actually know if the vaccines prevent transmission yet</a>, it's possible that they prevent severe disease (which is what the trials measured) but not infection or transmission. We will know more about that soon, the new variant is just one small part of a much larger puzzle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>“The number—or density—of functional spikes on the virus is 4 or 5 times greater due to this mutation,” Choe says.&quot;</p>
