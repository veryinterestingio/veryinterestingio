		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The body produces waste not because it get too much energy, but because there are some things left over from the chemical reactions that we use to get energy that we can not put to use. So if you get exactly enough energy to run your body, you will still produce waste.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No it is not, that would mean that everything we intake we can use, but thats not the case for almost any food. And with water, we need water to flush certain parts of the body to carry away certain acids, minerals, etc, which is why even if youre dehydrated and you drink water, you'd pee.</p>
<p>Edit: also, 40% of poop is dead bloodcells, they die, new ones are made, you poop out the old ones, thats what makes poop generally brown! So you are also producing waste because the body has to shed itsself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a fairly simple question with a complex answer.</p>
<p>In a normal healthy human who hasn't been taking antibiotics, the typical composition of poop is as follows:</p>
<p>70+% water
Of the rest, 20-50% is dead gut bacteria
Remaining is bile (processed dead cells), undigested food and fiber</p>
<p>Now if you don't eat unnecessary food, first to die would be the gut bacteria (unless you eat enough to feed it too).  If you eat enough to feed it, it's volume would stay constant.</p>
<p>Your body would still breakdown and rebuild constantly, voiding bile - which also contributes to poop mass.</p>
<p>Please note I've simplified and not mentioned side effects of undereating to keep it ELI5.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
