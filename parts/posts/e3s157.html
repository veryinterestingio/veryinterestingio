<p>I don't have a specific technical answer because it could be a whole number of things making your wifi or data not work well in the first place, but in short, it's like when you're in a conversation with someone and you get confused and say &quot;woah woah hold on let's start over.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One potential cause can occur if you are on some sort of extended network system where many access points (APs) are all broadcasting the same SSID (that is, a bunch of antennas all pretending to be the same network that shows up on your device). You'll usually find these in large offices or school campuses. Even though these APs are all the same network, most basic configurations can only let you talk to one of these APs at a time, so your device can still tell them apart. To that end, when you connect your device to one of them, it will do everything in its ability to stay connected to <em>that</em> AP in particular, no matter how bad the signal gets, even if a better connection to a different AP is nearby. That is, if you're walking about and roam out of the zone of the first AP you connected to, your signal will get worse and worse, even if there are other APs in your area to cover you. Your device will only break the connection and start over on its own if the original connection outright times out. Cycling your network connectivity forces your device to drop the old connection and look again, which will presumably select the strongest signal in your area.</p>
<p>Newer network equipment is being made that can address this by giving the central router the ability to detect signal strengths of clients and dynamically route traffic through the best AP possible, making the switch seamless. These are marketed as &quot;WiFi mesh&quot; systems.</p>
<p>I'm not at all versed on how the cellular network system operates, but I think it has some parallels to a Wi-Fi mesh system, with towers dynamically trying to shift you between one another seamlessly as you roam, but due to their greater distances and higher volume of clients this can be unreliable. Turning data off and on can easily shift you to a new tower if you are in range of more than one. You can often verify that this has happened by checking your public IP address before and after cycling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are probably many more reasons, but maybe one is that the WiFi changes the channel being used which might have been being jammed by noise. </p>
<p>It's like if many people are speaking English in a room, so to make things a little clearer you switch to German. Sure, the noise remains the same but because you're talking a different language you don't get confused by the English words.</p>
<p>In the same way WiFi has different channels it uses, which are basically bands of frequency.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It drops the data connection and forces it to reset many of the background processes, which is effective for hung processes.</p>
<p>Many of these processes have a &quot;only once every 24 hrs&quot; or some other limiter on it so they don't reinitiate</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe someone can tell me why I can be sitting in my house in the same spot on the couch for 2 hours on my iphone and  lose all signal multiple times, but turning air plane mode on and then off will yield a good signal again. I never had to do this on my android phones but it happens all the time in all kinds of places on my iPhone in a major city. I’ve even switched carriers recently and it’s the same issue. Friends with iPhone report the same issue as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
