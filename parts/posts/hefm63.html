		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One reason is that they have already gathered the parts. For a new movie, you need to get a script, cast all the parts, find all the locations and create all the sets before you can film it. Each movie is pretty different and its likely that anything you build or any actor you cast is just for the purpose of shooting that movie.
Whereas in tv, once you have done all the same set up, you can just get filming without putting in the same effort for every episode. You have a base of sets that are likely to be re-used. The actors will be the same, the characters the same. It basically requires less work to keep something running, than it does to start from scratch every time.
I think thats a large part of it anyways. Theres probably a lot more to it that ive not even considered though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to pick a &quot;typical&quot; hour long TV show from the US.  Something like &quot;The Flash&quot;.</p>
<p>While there are a couple of new characters introduced throughout a season, typically any 10 episodes of the flash will feature the 6-8 show regulars, and a seasonal bad guy who will appear in some, but not all, the episodes.</p>
<p>The 6-8 show regulars have been on the show for 3-7 years. They have a regular schedule, they have an established wardrobe, they have experience working together.</p>
<p>Half of any given episode takes place in some combination of Star Labs (the home base), Barry's apartment, Joe's House or the Coffee Shop.  These are standing sets and each is used in almost every episode. They exist on the same studio lot, and like within the same sound stage.  Moving from one set to the next takes an hour, and any given set will have a minimum of 5 pages of script (usually more).</p>
<p>The shots used in the episodes will be fairly standard, with an occasional flourish. They will use the lighting system which has already been hooked up above the set, and there won't be anything too dramatic.</p>
<p>A given episode will take between 1 and 2 weeks to shoot, with a particularly hard episode maybe spilling over.</p>
<p>So, if we're talking about a 55 page script split over 10 working days, you're shooting about 5-6 pages a day.  That's doable.</p>
<p>If you're shooting a multicam sitcom you're talking a half hour script, and almost all of it takes place on a standing set (The apartments in &quot;Friends&quot; for example.)  You're filming with 3-4 cameras, and very likely getting the whole show done in 2 days.  One day for most of the stuff on set, and 1 day for little bits and pieces where needed.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about a pretty normal movie.</p>
<p>You've got 4-5 main characters in the movie, and about 8-10 secondary characters. Some of those people have worked together before, but odds are none of them are playing a character they've previously played.</p>
<p>The locations for the movie are either sets which have just been built, or are existing locations out in the world. Those sets will have to be lit, and the lighting choices will be more dynamic.  The camera angles and camera motion will be dynamic.</p>
<p>A move from a standing set to a location (assuming it's within driving distance) will take a day. Some of the sets may be great distances apart and will require a week.</p>
<p>The actors won't have a set schedule, and may only be available for certain periods of time, necessitating that those scenes get shot on those days.  That could mean that you have to make multiple moves to &quot;shoot out&quot; an actor, then re-visit those sets again to shoot scenes which don't feature that actor.</p>
<p>The director/actors/crew likely haven't worked together.</p>
<p>And, on top of all that, the movie will typically have some set pieces which are bigger than what you expect on TV.  A fight scene on top of a train, or a shot of a person stuck in a rowboat in the middle of the ocean, etc.</p>
<p>As a result, a movie may take 6 weeks to shoot.  Say the script is 100 pages, that's about 3-4 pages a day.  Realistically though, you'll have days where you are lucky to shoot 1 page, or 2-3 days where you are just getting everyone from LA to Kansas in order to start filming at the farm house.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know this isn't really an answer to your question, but I went to a taping of Big Bang Theory years ago. It took about 4 hours to film the entire episode. I think at most they re-did a scene 3 or 4 times. Also, they have screen up where you can see what the cameras are recording, and it literally looked perfect just like you'd see on TV as they were recording, so they probably have to do very little editing other than making sure all the different scenes flow together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because TV shows don't have to reinvent the wheel each episode.</p>
<p>Much of a movie is spent introducing a setting, characters, and plot and trying to make understand and care about their motivations, then trying to tie everything up in a neat bow at the end.</p>
<p>With a TV show, you already know about the hero, their trusty sidekick, wacky neighbor, and looming nemesis, all of that was set up three seasons ago.  And you don't have to resolve every little detail, you can figure out in the next episode.  That makes TV a lot easier to write and produce.</p>
<p>Also, TV has lower production values.  One bad episode doesn't ruin a series, but mess up a scene, and your audience can be lost for the rest of the movie.  And audiences are already vested in the characters, you can afford to have do-nothing episodes without explosions and car chases.  Audiences are ok with most of it happening in the same office or living room, and since there is usually a break between episodes, they don't get as bored when they see them repeatedly.  And like the characters and plots, they only have to build the sets once and reuse them over an over.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because a lot more money, time, and effort goes into every minute of a movie then goes into each minute of a television show. Television shows are designed to be cheaper in general because the goal is to make more content.</p>
<p>Of course, there are exceptions to that rule. Big HBO shows like game of thrones tend to be closer to movies in terms of the amount of money and time spent on every shot.  And every now and then a really cheaply made movie will catch on and hit it big, like The Blair witch project.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
