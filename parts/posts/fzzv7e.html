		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There isn't all that much incentive to 'cheat' on the Census and correcting the results of such 'cheating' is fairly easy.</p>
<p>While the Census is used for apportionment and funding, trying to add/subtract individuals from the Census in sufficient numbers to make a difference would trigger all sorts of red flags. Moreover, any subsequent investigation that uncovered malfeasance would be able to easily correct the figures before they had much (if any) impact.</p>
<p>Contrast this with an election, where you have a single winner and everyone else loses. Moreover, the results of an election are difficult to undo even if malfeasance is later discovered unless it can be directly tied to the candidate in question.</p>
<p>You can also change the results of an election with a relatively small number of votes - especially if those votes are properly timed (i.e. in response to information you have about the votes already cast). This makes such fraud harder to detect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am sure that your device is malware and virus free; but can you guarantee that for everyone in your street, in your voting district.  Imagine the sort of attack that could be put together by a well funded, not necessarily foreign, team that wants to influence the country for the next four years.</p>
<p>This attack on the vote will scale very easily, find a bug and exploit it.  It would require the same number of people to change 1000 votes as it would to change 1 vote </p>
<p>I will let <a href="https://youtu.be/LkH2r-sNjQs" target="_blank">Tom Scott</a> explain better (on line voting is from about 8 mins in)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because individual votes are supposed to be anonymous.</p>
<p>For the census, individuals get a unique keycode, which means you can identify who submitted a single specific response. The census bureau doesn't publish individually identified data, but they have it.</p>
<p>For an election, you don't want to be able to identify who submitted a single specific ballot (ideally you wouldn't even be able to know who voted and who didn't, but nobody has found a good way to do that). A digital ballot is just bits on a computer. If you couldn't see where it came from, you couldn't be sure that it was made by a person; it might be the software doing something wrong. So to know that the totals are right, you have to know who every vote came from, but we don't want to know who every vote came from because that's not anonymous. We can't use computers to vote because we can't have both things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well first I think you need to rephrase the question.  It isn't just a question of how reliable census-by-mail is in absolute terms; it's a question of how reliable census-by-mail is versus a door-to-door count.  A respondent can lie in person just as well as they can lie by mail.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if fraud is the concern, remember that voting must be anonymized.  That is: they can't keep records of who cast which ballots.  This makes it much easier for dead people to vote.  Investigating and prosecuting fraud is very difficult when you can't keep any records.  The same is not true for Census data.  Although the Census bureau is forbidden from publicly <strong>publishing</strong> certain details about individuals, they are not forbidden from <strong>keeping</strong> the data.  So as soon as fraud was suspected, it would be much easier to investigate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of the answer is because voting is optional, and the census, technically, is required.  ---  Thus, the census &quot;follow-up for those that don't respond in time.&quot;  --- If you don't vote, that is your prerogative.</p>
<p>I think the other part of the answer is that 'they' want a hard copy for your vote, so that is why some states (my state) allow the option for everyone to vote by mail.  If they print it out and mail it, and I send it back, then there is something to count, in a re-count.  That would not be the case with online voting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
