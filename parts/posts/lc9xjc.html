Most mammals and even lots of birds engage in <em>play</em>, just for the fun of it. (Especially when they're young, but some keep it up even as they mature.) The creatures that early humans developed from were certainly advanced enough to have play as a major pastime, and the things you're asking about probably came out of that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans stopped living for solely reproduction the moment we started communicating. Fundamentally, genes are nothing more than <em>replicators</em> - physical structures capable of reproducing themselves. But this is also true for <em>ideas</em> - they can be reproduced via communication in a manner not unlike genes.</p>
<p>So, gradually, our bodies have become more than just vehicles for spreading genes - and started turning into vehicles for spreading the ideas living inside our heads.</p>
<p>A lot of what triggers human passion is <em>ideology</em> - some dream, vision, or goal for the future. Some idea so profound that we want to shape the world into containing it. Some idea that has gotten very good at abusing human psychology into making us want to spread it.</p>
<p>As for hobbies/interests, I think they mostly just serve as warped proxies for things we used to enjoy merely for survival reasons. Like food, or sports.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a professor of art history and I really like doing the prehistoric segment in my classes which somewhat touches on this. It's not ELI5 but I'll try.</p>
<p>(TL;DR) Interests are fundaments of evolution and are &quot;modified&quot; only as a reaction to a humans environment (Which includes culture). The very concept of &quot;passions&quot; is a relatively new idea that we mistakenly separate from biology because we are so removed (mentally) from their &quot;usefulness&quot; in survival.</p>
<p>ELI21:</p>
<p>I think this question is a false dichotomy and could stand to be phrased in a different way. I might take the prompt of, &quot;what does interest have to do with evolution?&quot;</p>
<p>Survival and procreation depend expressly on passion and interests. If a creature is not interested in the things that make it successful, then the species it will not survive. This desire for genetic success can be expressed in many ways, both genetically and behaviorally. Although the ways in which we express this desire have changed drastically since our ape ancestors, the fundamental competition remains; reproduction.</p>
<p>Because we have evolved with social groups, our success, in many ways, is tied to the group we belong to. It is also generally understood that individuals of such a group consider group reproduction as an extension of self reproduction. But this does not nullify the individuals desire to reproduce. Therefore, individuals within a group compete against each other for genetic success (Mating rights, dominance, etc.) while still depending on the success of the group. A good example of this is wolves. Wolves have a relatively simple class system of dominance and reproduction but also maintain dependence on its members. That is why male wolves compete for dominance rather than outright killing their competition.(usually)</p>
<p>When this principal is applied to evolution of humans, whose complex society begot more and more narrow specializations, we see something like a superorganism form. Successful groups of humans had people of wide genetic and behavioral dispositions that all competed and coexisted. Dispositions that suited, for example, spear-making, might have a higher proclivity to enjoy the sensation of carving. While other dispositions promoted other certain behaviors. These proclivities that helped early humans were inevitably subjected to the increasingly complex culture and social standards that influence individuals of a group. This cultural pressure on the individuals is designed to continue the group, not necessarily the individual, and warps its members dispositions to its needs. Much like the evolution of animals, cultural wants to evolve efficiently. So dispositions will be promoted or suppressed by culture depending on their necessity.</p>
<p>Within this social structure and it's domains (or roles) there is also a competition for resources. And the general rule from biology is the more proficient you are in a domain, the more reproductive success an individual potentially has. So the desire of the individual is to compete in areas suited to their dispositions or create a new role to compete in. This mechanism is what promoted the grown of the society.</p>
<p>Today, we have become so successful and so removed from these axioms that underlying biological factors are really only a starting point for how &quot;interests&quot; are formed. And, we have to remember that each member of the group is also an individual with their own dispositions. So what this results in is the constant cycling of genetic expression through interpretations of individual experience, the family dynamic, the local culture, and now the global culture. Each exerting pressures that warp these innate dispositions into &quot;interests.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
