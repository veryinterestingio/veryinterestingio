		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Running very close to the elbow joint is a nerve called the &quot;ulnar nerve.&quot;</p>
<p>If you whack the bottom of your upper arm in a particular way, you'll jam the nerve up against the bone and cause a burst of sensation and motor impulse to run down your arm into part of your hand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ulnar nerve is between the bone of the elbow and the skin, when your elbow is bent, it removes any padding so when you strike it you're hitting that nerve and it causes the electric sensation up and down your arm and hand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because motor reflex arc,similar reflexes occur in other parts of the body as well for example when the doctor hits your knee with a hammer, we call that one as the &quot;Knee-jerk&quot; reflex, it is the result of the excitation of the ulnar nerve,which sends an electrical impulse down to the inter neurons which lie in the gray matter of your spinal cord through an afferent neuron,these signals do not go upto the brain to get a motor activity done because it takes too much time,it's like there's a fixed protocol to be followed and these should be done in the least amount of time which the spinal cord does but the brain takes more time to do,imagine having your hand on a hot vessel and taking more time to feel that it's hot and you need to take your hand off it,that's why it never goes to the brain,the reflex arc completes itself without the brain involved.After the spinal cord's interpreted what protocol is to be followed when you've hit your elbow (like getting a shock), it sends an electrical impulse conveying the message down to the effector  through an motor/efferent neuron, this electrical impulse is eventually converted to a chemical impulse at the end of the synaptic knob of the motor neuron into chemical messengers such as epinephrine and non-epinephrine which tell your body to give you the short circuit/immediate shock.</p>
<p>That's the diagram of how it works if you want to get more depth into it-</p>

<p>edit- the diagram shows you that the effector is a muscle but there can be other effectors as well</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I learned that you can cause damage to your ulner nerve or “funny bone” as I lost feeling in my arm for a few months when I had developed a habit of leaning on my work desk a certain way for too long. Feeling eventually came back but it taught me the importance of posture.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
