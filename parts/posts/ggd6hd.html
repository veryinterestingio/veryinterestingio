		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Explosions are of different types. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ones where you see a big fire ball... These are only used in movies mostly and only have cool looks on their side... They are the most harmless variety. Their fire only appears for a few seconds and quickly extinguished. They have low temperature flames so they don't set fire to anything around them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>incendiary explosions. They have persistent high temperature flames that cover a wide area of the explosion.. they set objects on fire and can be very lethal in closed places. They kill be inflicting high degree burns on the body.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anti personnel or shrapnel explosives.. they are what you generally find in military use. They are the deadliest when you compare the damage to explosive ratios.. they have inbuilt shrapnel inside them that gets launched by the explosion... They are nothing fancy to look at, you only get to see a flash and smoke raising.. but the sharpnel travels tens of thousands of feet per second and causes puncture wound across the body.. people very near to the point of origin will also be damaged by the shock wave..</p>
</li>
<li>Shock wave damage... This type usually requires a very large amount of explosives.. it has high damage that's very difficult to avoid but the explosion is highly inefficient at killing.. you need great amount of explosives to do significant damage.. they occur in gas line leakage, factory accidents or high explosives weapons and can launch a shock wave that can damage for miles.. the shockwave basically compresses and expands the internal organs in the body.. if the wave is strong enough, it ruptures the organs.. in this explosions you will often find that the body is intact or with severed limbs with seemingly no puncture injuries... However, we can find that most of the innards are turned into a mushy paste. They are particularly dangerous in enclosed spaces. They are some cases where people walk away from the explosion seemingly unharmed only to collapse and die a few minutes later. Common injuries among the survivors include hearing loss, ruptured intestine, cerebral hemorrhage and retinal detachment.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They kill in three phases; the initial shockwave which if powerful enough can liquify your internal organs, shrapnel/debris (penetrating trauma), and then finally hitting background objects when you get thrown (including your brain and your own skull). Burns are generally considered secondary injury and are not an immediate consideration when worrying about blast injuries. The number one killer is massive bleeding in situations that involve blasts.</p>
<p>Here is a nice little infographic for you.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 5 types of blast injuries. Some explosions will have all types, but others will only have a few from this list:</p>
<p><strong>Primary:</strong> Pressure injuries. Imagine filling a balloon very full until it pops right next to your ear, and your ear now hurts from the sound. This is a pressure injury. You would also feel a bit of wind from the balloon popping, while the wind is caused by the pressure, it is different than the pressure that hurt your ear. Any organs that are filled with air can be damaged by this type of injury -- death is usually caused when pressures are high enough to damage the lungs (Non-ELI5 note: humans can actually withstand very high pressures: threshold for lung damage is 15 psi and 99% of people will die from 60 psi).</p>
<p><strong>Secondary:</strong> Shrapnel injuries. Now imagine someone bedazzled the balloon. When the balloon pops, you will now be hit by the beads and gems that are carried by the wind generated by the balloon. In large blasts these little missiles the explosion creates can cut through the body the same way bullets from a gun can (often with higher speeds though), or they can hit the body without cutting it the same way a car can hit you. </p>
<p><strong>Tertiary:</strong> Injuries from being thrown. In the first example I said that the pressure injury to your ear is different than the wind you feel from the balloon popping. Very strong winds can be created from fairly low pressures, so now imagine a very large balloon popping and then creating hurricane-like winds that lift you off your feet and throw you against things. The injuries from your body being thrown are similar to if you didn't wear a seat belt and you were thrown out of a vehicle during a car crash. (Non-ELI5 note: 20 psi can create 800 kph winds, which will destroy heavy buildings and in populated areas will create 99% fatalities).</p>
<p><strong>Quaternary:</strong> Heat and toxic fume injuries. Some explosions will create fireballs. If you filled the balloon with propane gas from a BBQ and then used a lighter to pop it, it would create a fireball that can burn your skin. Also, fires give off toxic fumes, so you can also breath in these fumes and be poisoned by them while also burning your throat and lungs. </p>
<p><strong>Quinary:</strong> Weird chemical injuries and illnesses. Imagine when you filled your balloon with air that the air you used had a virus in it, like the flu. When the balloon pops now, it can also make you sick days later. Sometimes bombs are made with chemicals or other things that make you sick. These can be radioactive things, like you would find in a nuclear power plant, or other chemicals/biological things that would make you sick. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I talked to an EOD guy in the Army once and he said it's essentially the air blast that liquifies your insides. The blast is a vibration that rapidly compresses your body and different organs (based on density) may rupture.  <a href="https://youtu.be/CDLA4fAw5L4?t=213" target="_blank">Not even a bomb suit could save you from the overpressure.</a> ^((Yes it's Hollywood but that scene is sort've accurate representation, watch the front of his mask.))</p>
<p>The blast has 4 major components:</p>
<p><strong>Primary:</strong> The air blast wave</p>
<p><strong>Secondary:</strong> Shrapnel</p>
<p><strong>Tertiary:</strong> You getting scooped up by the blast/knocked off your feet and slamming into the ground/other objects</p>
<p><strong>Quaternary:</strong> Fire, heat, burns, chemicals, etc.</p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Types_of_blast_injuries-DOD.png" target="_blank">Here's a good image</a> from the DoD showing the effects of an explosion. Nasty stuff. Best thing you can do is get down low behind a solid barrier so the blast wave will break and wash over you. Never stand in the direct path of the blast wave.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
