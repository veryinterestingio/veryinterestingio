		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Semantic satiation! It’s when your brain’s neural pathways are firing over and over because you’re repeatedly doing the same action. This happens because the verbal cognitive part of your brain slows activity since you don’t have to keep recognizing the word as a new word, and is diverting brainpower to just the motor action of saying the word!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically it’s just your brain saving bandwidth because when the same neurons are fired over and over again in order to put together a word together. The brain eventually starts cutting off the neurons and neural pathways needed to recognize that word and it’s meaning until it basically just becomes a complex sound devoid of meaning to the person saying it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>let me try to give a very very simple explanation that doesn't involve neurons or anything fancy.</p>
<p>what is familiar and what is foreign depends on context.</p>
<p>a mug is perfectly normal on my desk, but if it is in the toilet it'll be odd, and it'll be incomprehensible if I find it floating in mid-air.</p>
<p>when I say the word &quot;for&quot;, it is going to be familiar for a certain word contexts, for instance, all the &quot;for&quot;s in this very sentence are familiar because it is exactly what the word is used for.</p>
<p>whereas a sentence &quot;for for for for for for for for&quot; never occurs in a natural sentence, it is &quot;out of context&quot; so to speak, like a mug in the toilet. so you find it foreign, not because the word itself is foreign, but because it occurred in a unfamiliar situation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
