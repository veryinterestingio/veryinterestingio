Or if Earth's mass was greater, such that the gravitational force allowed objects to accelerate to a similar terminal velocity?  How far away are Earth's current conditions from a state where this phenomena would occur?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is definitely possible for objects to fall at supersonic speeds.</p>
<p>Even an object with no drag would need to fall from almost 6 km to achieve a supersonic velocity before hitting the ground, so a building is not tall enough. The problem, more than aerodynamics, is simply that it takes a long time for gravity to accelerate you to the necessary speed. If you don't have enough room, you will run out of fall time.</p>
<p>But if you go up in a balloon, it's certainly possible. Felix Baumgartner famously exceeded the speed of sound in his skydive. And <a href="https://global.jaxa.jp/press/2015/07/20150727_dsend2.html" target="_blank">here's a press release</a> from JAXA (the Japanese air and space agency) about a &quot;drop test&quot; where they dropped an unpowered aircraft model from 30 km to measure the characteristics of the resulting sonic boom.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it is, as someone else pointed out.  In fact, everyone who comes back to earth from orbit does it, since we tend to rely on aero-braking which is not that quick.</p>
<p>Here's a video of two space-x boosters having a sonic boom as they come in to land.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a theoretical concept of a satellite based weapons system nicknamed 'Rods from God', which consists of several tungsten darts (edit: that are the size of telegraph poles) that are launched and essentially free fall from orbit.</p>
<p>The rods would impact at about 36,000 feet per second (\~32 Mach) , which would give them the same energy as a small nuclear weapon without that nasty fall out</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The British 'boffins' in World War 2 designed large bombs that would exceed the speed of sound, burying themselves deeply under railroad tracks. A fuse would burn down to the igniter, detonating the explosives, causing a huge 'hollow' beneath the tracks, making it unsafe to rebuild the track without first filling in the hollow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
