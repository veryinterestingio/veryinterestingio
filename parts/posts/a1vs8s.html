		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What people tend to forget (or perhaps be unaware of) is that animal fur is not really comparable to say human made fabrics. So stains on white linen or cotton is very much harder to get rid of. </p>
<p>Animal fur is actually most of the time covered in sebaceous secretions, eg oil from glands in the skin (which we notice if we dont wash our hair for a while, it gets greasy). This makes the fur alot easier to clean when the animal grooms itself, or when swimming or rolling through snow. Things just dont stick as easily. Compare to say a waxed fabric. That also repels water and dirt, and can often be cleaned just by brushing it.</p>
<p>Furthermore the individual hairs have no natural spaces or holes in them where foreign material can get stuck. Fabrics are usually made from intersoven threads, and these threads can absorb liquids and other impurities either inbetween the threads, or within the threads themselves (between the fibers). Hair or fur is made of dead cells which sit so closely together that nothing can really ”get in between” them.</p>
<p>And yes, like some others have noted the fur is also shed and renewed, making the dirty patches go away.</p>
<p>Tl:dr:
Fur is greasy and does not allow for dirt to be absorbed into it, it is also continually renewed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone is giving very good scientific explanation, and I'd like to add a little thing : you're filtering because you mostly see pictures of beautiful white animals, taken when they're as gorgeous as possible, but that's because it's the moment the photographer chose.
There are pictures out there of wolves, foxes or polar bears with hair matted by gore and blood. When they kill, or eat, they will get dirty. It's just less often the front cover.
Then they get clean, and everyone explained how easy that is. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
