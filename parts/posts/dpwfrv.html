		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I recently visited a location in Austin, Texas in which 100,000 bats live under a bridge. I could hear all of them squeaking at the same time but was wondering how they can use their echolocation without being confused by other bats squeaks. is there a way they can find their own squeak? </p>
<p>It seems comparable to trying to distinguish someone's voice in a room full of people talking, but maybe echolocation works completely different. thank you :)</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did a summer of bat research and you can basically think of it as each bat has their own voice. Different chirp lengths, frequencies, you name it. It’s the same way you can tell two people’s voices apart. I have recordings of a few of the bats we worked with and after awhile, it was easy to pick out which one we were talking about solely by the characteristics of their chirps and their own individual oddities in their echolocation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Their echolocation is more like vision than hearing. They have 3D sensing of other object's positions. Each bat sends out repeated chirps which will return with the same repetition frequency making them easier to identify. They also have minor differences in the chirps themselves, like voices. We can identify a familiar voice in a crowd and so can they.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>same ways modern air to air radars do it, by slightly altering the frequency, the modulation of the frequency or the PRF of the pulse.</p>
<p>Each of these will act like a distinct fingerprint which can be used to filter out pulses that aren't yours.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of the chirp as their voice. If you listened to your voice reflect off the walls all day do you think you could tell your voice apart from others? And if the room got crowded you could change it up. You could also listen to your buddy next to you. You could hear his chirp and it's reflection and it should give the same readout on the room.</p>
<p>Bats are a favorite study for those in the field of remote sensing; RADAR, LIDAR, SONAR, etc. There is a lot of deep science here but all that is unnecessary. Putting yourself in the mind of a bat answers this question. It's a lot like how we can predict where a frisbee will land. We watch it enough and start to see patterns. Before we know it we can throw in high winds and with reasonable dependability get it to go where we want. Bats don't have to get it all figured out in the first dozen chirps either. I'm sure they could build a pretty reasonable index of surface types from their experience also.</p>
<p>All that being said if your a bat you would likely know a hundred varients of your kids voices and with reasonable effort learn how to figure out where they are by hearing their voice and it's reflection. Especially since you got a lay of the land with your own echoes. I think it's the neural net that is their brain that is the most powerful tool here. It's just trial and error and playing around until you get walking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Keep in mind that the bats spread out over miles to feed - they don't hunt in the massive swarm you see and thus have a reduced need for echolocation. They also have decent vision.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
