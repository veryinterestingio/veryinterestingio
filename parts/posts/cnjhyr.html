		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our body is constantly breaking down and regrowing cells in a lot of our body systems. Healing superficial, smaller wounds is just turning up the regrowing part. However you need cells that are already there to grow more cells. Your body doesn’t form skin or even liver cells somewhere else and then send them to the location they are supposed to go. The ability for the body to grow entirely new organs pretty much only exists when your body is first going from one cell to a ball of cells to a recognizable human form.</p>
<p>Our bodies have some stem cells remaining that could theoretically do some of this, but there’s no way to naturally send them to where they are needed. Our cells become specialized in the location where they’re going to be fairly early on in the process of fetal development, we don’t have a way to truly grow new organs. </p>
<p>Scars are just an extension of this. They’re like the body’s duct tape, partially because the things that help form scars can be sent through the blood. But scar tissue in any organ doesn’t work the way the organ is supposed to work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! I'm a biologist. I study how embryos know how to shape themselves into a whole creature. There's a lot of overlaps with regeneration, so I know a fair bit about it. </p>
<p>Skin is one kind of body-stuff. When there's damage to skin, your body just has to make more skin - it doesn't really care too much about placing it correctly, it just plugs the hole.</p>
<p>With a little hole, you won't notice the difference. With a big hole, since the skin has been made kinda fast and cheap, you will notice a difference - this is a scar.</p>
<p>Making a finger, or plugging a hole that goes through more than one type of body stuff (eg skin, muscle,  and bone) is much more complicated than just plugging a hole. Your body has to look up the instruction booklet on how to make a finger, that it used when you were in your mom's womb - when you were an 'embryo'. It then has to de-age the stuff around the hole, so that it all acts like embryo stuff instead of adult body stuff. And then it can start to rebuild.</p>
<p>This is important, because embryo stuff is really good at making a person, but isn't good at all at being part of a person. Embryo eye stuff can't see until it 'grows up', for example. Embryo skin stuff is very fragile and bad at protecting you. So, body stuff is generally either good at making more body stuff, or doing a job. If you have body stuff that can do both, that usually means you have cancer. </p>
<p>Most of the time, your body doesn't bother rebuilding. It doesn't have the instruction manual for rebuilding a finger where it needs it, and it's too difficult to make the adult body stuff that's still there rewind and become like embryo finger stuff. Instead it'll just plug up the hole with whatever it can.</p>
<p>However, this isn't true for all of your body.
Underneath the bottom part of your finger nail, there's special stuff called Stem Cells. This is finger stuff that stayed like embryo stuff, and kept its instruction manuals, just in case. It only has a few chapters of the how-to-make-a-finger instruction booklet available, but it can still do something. So if you badly hurt the tip of your finger, but don't hurt the bottom part of your finger nail, then there's a chance your body will be able to rebuild what you lost, instead of just plugging the hole. The area that can be rebuilt is quite small though. </p>
<p>Some animals do this much more than we do. Salamanders are famous for it - they can regrow an entire arm if they lose it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Skin has a made layer of “stem cells” at the base  that constantly grow and divide into new skin cells. Cuts superficial to this layer will heal without a scar because the stem cells at the bottom will just divide and fill the gap and you will have skin that is virtually identical to the skin before the cut. </p>
<p>If you cut deeper and damage the stem cells, the skin will not grow back the same because you lost the building blocks from which new skin is made. Scar tissue will form by other cells to fill in the gap. Since  the neighboring skin is still next to the scar, it will look fairly normal and like it grew back correctly.</p>
<p>There isn’t a “stem cell layer” for large parts of the body like fingers, though, so removing a finger will just cause you to heal over it. Like the scar tissue filling in the deeper cut in the skin. Your limbs and bones are formed by stem cells when you are a fetus that are directed by very specific signals to form normal body parts. After the formation happens, there is no going back and making more, because neither the stem cells, nor the signaling molecules, are there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short n sweet: All the genes necessary for limb morphogenesis are turned on during fetal development; they are not all turned on during wound healing. Only some genes turn on and in a different order. </p>
<p>A simplified example: </p>
<p>A fetus growing a limb may turn on a sequence with the genes shh -&gt; lim -&gt; gremlin -&gt; fgf </p>
<p>During wound healing, only fgf is turned on. </p>
<p>We don't know all the components / pathways involved in either process, which is why we can't regenerate limbs just yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
