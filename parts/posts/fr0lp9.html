		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Looking at diagrams demonstrating the concept of &quot;flattening the curve&quot; it looks like it turns the growth from a tall/skinny curve to a short/fat curve but the total area of the curves is about the same, meaning the same number of people still get the disease, just over a longer period of time. Is this true, are we flattening just to delay the inevitable so health care can handle the load? Or are we actually reducing the number of people contracting the disease?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The point of &quot;flattening the curve&quot; is to reduce the total number of infections at any one time so the system can handle the sick.  If you don't flatten then you end up overloading the health Care system and likely increasing mortality and ancillary deaths due to resources being depleted.  Ie ventilators, drugs, hospital beds, etc.</p>
<p>Napkin math... If 2% of COVID-19 patients need to be on ventilators in ICU and the estimate (on the low side) is that 30% of Americans will become infected that means that approximately 2.28MM ventilators are needed.  The current estimate is that there are only 62k ventilators available in the US.  </p>
<p>The goal (in this example) is to flatten the curve so that you can handle the 2% of infections that need with ventilators you have to ensure you have enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The pandemic will end one of two ways:  </p>
<ol>
<li>Enough people get infected that they develop an immunity to it</li>
<li>People artificially develop an immunity to it through the implementation of a vaccine</li>
</ol>
<p>Barring the invention of a vaccine that does not currently exist, flattening the curve will result in the same number of people that get the disease.  The point of flattening the curve is a tall skinny curve means healthcare workers will have to pick and choose who gets medical care and who to save because there's only 2 more ventilators left and 12 people that need them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Here's a video with a simple model that explains it. You can skip to 13:00 if you don't want to see the model being built.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think  you get the gist of why flattening the curve is necessary - it is to prevent the overload of the healthcare system. </p>
<p>The answer to your question is about the degree of flattening achieved. The reason the curve flattens is the spread of the disease is slowed down. At some point, if the disease spread is sufficiently low, a larger part of the population will probably never get the disease (it dies out). Sort of like the flu - not everyone gets it. If the slowing of spread is insufficient, then it is still likely (as a prediction) that perhaps most of the population will eventually contract it. Nonetheless, it gives time for both the healthcare system to fully care for those who get it and a larger time window for a vaccine to be developed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
