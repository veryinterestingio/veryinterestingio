		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the time of writing the mortality rate in Germany is 0.15% (2 out of 1296 confirmed cases) with the rate in Italy about 6% (with a similar age structure) and the worldwide rate around 2% - 3%.</p>
<p>Is this because</p>
<ul>
<li>Germany is in an early phase of the epidemic</li>
<li>better healthcare (management)</li>
<li>outlier because of low sample size</li>
<li>some other factor that didn't come to my mind</li>
<li>all of the above?</li>
</ul>
<p>tl;dr: Is Germany early, lucky or better?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: I was off in the mortality rate for Italy by an order of magnitude, because obviously I can't math.  </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of what (seems) to make this a nasty disease for hospitals is that the severe cases force people to take up a bed for a long time. Quote from recent <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2236846-coronavirus-risk-of-death-rises-with-age-diabetes-and-heart-disease/" target="_blank">NewScientist article</a>, emphasis mine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The average time from the onset of the illness to discharge from hospital was <strong>22 days</strong>, the team say. Those who didnâ€™t survive the virus died an average of <strong>18.5 days</strong> after symptoms began.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>China and Italy told the story of these two data points. Once someone needs a hospital bed, they must stay for a <em>long time</em>. If your hospital only has 50 beds and 51 COVID patients show up this week, you have to start making compromises.</p>
<p>After experiencing the crisis firsthand, a surgeon named Daniele Macchini <a href="https://mronline.org/2020/03/10/testimony-of-a-surgeon-working-in-bergamo-in-the-heart-of-italys-coronavirus-outbreak/" target="_blank">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each ventilator is like gold: those in the operating rooms that have now suspended their non-urgent activity are used[,] and the OR [becomes] an ICU.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So for any countries that are seeing exponential growth of cases, the question is: how many hospital beds do we have? How many ventilators?</p>
<p>At a national scale, Japan, South Korea, Russia, and Germany have <a href="https://data.oecd.org/healtheqt/hospital-beds.htm" target="_blank">the most beds available per capita.</a> The United States, apparently, has fewer beds than Italy per capita. I imagine that the number of ventilators that each hospital has in storage is of huge importance, too, but I'm not sure if that data exists publicly. </p>
<p>By analogy, this year might be like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100-year_flood" target="_blank">100 year flood</a> for hospital capacity, where we draw the line on the side of the building and say &quot;the water level was here in 2020.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Posted it above, will post it again:</p>
<p>The RKI is conducting random sample testing to keep track of Influenza in Germany. These tests now also test on COVID-19. So far, not a single prior undetected case of COVID-19 has shown up in these samples. It is thus highly likely that the extensive early tracking and testing means that Germany has, in comparison to other countries, a very low rate of undetected cases, which would obviously lead to a lower mortality rate. That's what the President of the RKI also said in todays press conference together with Angela Merkel.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It might just be that Germany (together with South Korea) simply shows the &quot;true&quot; mortality rate in western health care systems which were somewhat prepared for a pandemic outbreak. We will have to wait and see.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
