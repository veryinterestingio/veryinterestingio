<p>Is it active or passive meaning do the molecules just link back together because of their physical qualities (polarity between water molecules and such) or do cells/Eukaryotes/prokaryotes/Archaebacteria  have ways of actively repairing themselves?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two major aspects to unicellular repair: wound healing and regeneration. Wound healing are the mechanisms for putting a stop to a wound itself, the thing that is causing cellular destabilization. For example, a cell stabbed with a needle, or bitten and partly swallowed by a predator. Regeneration is differentiated from wound healing in that it is building back up to equilibrium before the wound ever occurred.</p>
<p>All of it involves complex chemical signalling pathways. There are ways to detect wounds in a single cell (change in the intracellular environment, such as the intracellular environment is filling up with molecules from the intercellular environment). If wounds are detected, genes and protein translation can be activated for wound healing. Pathways can also detect the loss of equilibrium in the intracellular environment, and through the use of these repair mechanisms, rebuild what was lost.</p>
<p>As with all things it is a matter of thresholds. There's a point even for model organisms with good repair mechanisms where enough damage is just death. At the same time, a certain amount of leakage between the intra- and inter-cellular environment is normal and necessary. Wounds lie in the middle, and across species, there is likely variance in what each species &quot;can handle.&quot;</p>
<p>Some organisms can even split into two separate organisms from damage, almost like an externally activated cell division. This is possible if the given organism has enough nucleoplasm in both pieces, and the damage is moderate enough that both pieces can heal and regenerate into distinct organisms.</p>
<p>Through layers of abstraction, you can see it's not all that different from how an earthworm, person, or (crewed) sailboat would heal wounds/damage. Those different examples have different tolerances, but it comes down to wound detection and acting on those detections with repair measures. With a single cell, it's just happening at the cellular and molecular scale.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the oragnism and how big the injury is, but the luxury of being so simple is that wound healing depends almost completely on closing of the cell membrane before too much damage is done. The phospolipid bilayer is mostly self repairing so no work on the cells part there.</p>
<p>The issue comes in when worrying about how much of the inside changed. Is the pH managable now or did vital proteins already get denatured? Did the DNA/Nucleus get damaged? Is the osmolarity too far out of balance to recover? And does it still have the capability to produce energy? If yes, than it will go ahead and continue homeostasis and re-regulate all functions. Ion and H+ pumps will correct hydrogen/ion levels to normal parameters, synthesis of carbohydrates to rebuild the cell wall will start, and etc.</p>
<p>It all depends how bad the injury was</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a really good short video that has a depiction of how the cell layer functions. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqsf_UJcfBc" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqsf_UJcfBc</a> </p>
<p>Think of it like oil on water and how it forms discs - but instead this would be a oil layer that can sit covered in water. This helps repair if the wound is small. If it big enough that the cell 'lyses' and loses it's contents before being able to repair the wound it will die: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>right so after being severed in half, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stentor_(ciliate)" target="_blank">stentor</a> cell, a single-celled organism that filter-feeds, will have material form a new mouth moved into place. Then, the nucleus itself also changes. Afterward, a new stentor cell will be in place of the damaged one. This is very similar to how many-celled organisms have their cells undergo mitosis and replace other cells that have been damaged, except for the fact it's like the cell splits itself and only changing one part, to replace its &quot;old self&quot;.</p>
<p>also this is only one type of single-celled organism, keep in mind that most will not be able to repair like Stentor cells can.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly,  there's basically a &quot;spectrum of death&quot; for microbes. Depending on how intact their plasma membrane is and whether or not they can sporulate and remain dormant, microbes can't easily be declared &quot;dead&quot;. Some are even non culturable in lab settings so our perception of dead and alive is really hard to define and apply in those situations.</p>
<p>And yes, &quot;spectrum of death&quot; would be a sick band name.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
