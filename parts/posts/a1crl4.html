		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the UK we just make the old ones invalid after a point, the new Â£5 came in 13 September 2016 and the old one stopped being valid 5 May 2017. But what if you find some old ones in the back of a drawer or something? You can send them in to the Bank of England and get a cheque sent back, oddly most counterfeiters don't try to con the organisation that makes the real ones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the UK when a new style bank note is introduced, after a period where both old and new are in circulation, the old style is withdrawn from circulation and no longer recognised as legal tender. For a time ordinary banks will exchange them for you, but after a while even they stop, and you have to go to the Bank of England if you want to exchange them for newer ones (the Bank of England itself will honour any note, even ones 300+ years old, but really old ones are probably worth more as collectors' items).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
