<p>Iâ€™ll keep this short. In certain other animals, the baring of teeth symbolises aggression and a warning to cease your current behaviour or not come any closer. My question is, why do humans treat this act as a symbol of friendliness and compassion, and is this behaviour exclusive to humans or do other primates share this behaviour? Thanks in advance.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In macaques, displaying the teeth can mean a lot of different things.<br />
If the mouth is completely opened, giving perfect view of the canines (almost like a strong yawn) it's usually aggressive. Displays of just the front teeth are often submissive or fearful. The teeth can also be visible during lip smacking (which is a soothing behaviour) or playface.</p>
<p>For examples see here: <a href="https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/macaques/macaques/behaviour-and-communication/" target="_blank">NC3Rs Macaque website</a> -&gt; expressions.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Excuse me for not providing any sources, but a theory I read about 5-6 years ago stated that long before inventing vocabulary, smiling was the best way of communicating something like &quot;Ahhh, it may took me a while but now I understand what you are trying to say&quot;. The theory was based on experiments in which participants' reactions were recorded when they were requested to cooperate on solving complex-problem games without speaking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
