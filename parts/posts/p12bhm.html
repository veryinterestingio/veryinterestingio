<p>Basically when you are infected by a different strain of a disease than you were the first time the antibodies you built up attach to the virus but aren't able to kill it so your body thinks it's fighting off the infection but actually doing nothing while it spreads.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dengue has four strains and modern vaccines are made to cover all four.  An infection of a person by a single strain will protect that person from that strain only.  A subsequent infection by one of the other three strains is much more dangerous.  The antibodies recognize the new strain, but can't neutralize it.  The non-neutralizing antibodies facilitate the entry of virus into the host cell which results in a more severe infection than would have otherwise happened.  This can also happen when maternal antibodies are passed to a newborn, so a baby can have this problem without ever having had Dengue itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Getting infected the first time with one strain of dengue gives you the antibodies you need to resist that strain. But when another strain comes in, slightly different than the first, the antibodies are not specific enough to completely neutralize the new version of the virus. Instead the virus is essentially camouflaged in antibodies, tricking the body into thinking the virus is being kept under control and allowing the new strain to replicate uncontrollably. This leads to more severe symptoms with an immune system that can't keep up. Interestingly there is research that suggest Zika and dengue are similar enough to each other that the same effect can occur if you were infected with Zika then dengue. The antibodies for zika will bind to dengue but not neutralize the virus. This is a big public health problem in South America where many people were infected with zika a couple years ago</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Medical student here. Not sure about this virus specifically but to pathogens in general this can apply. </p>
<p>When you get infected to a pathogen the first time, you develop antibodies which are made by B cells specifically with help from something called T cells. This can take several days before you make antibodies against the pathogen. So what your body does is that it basically saves them in case that pathogens come across them by making something called memory B and T cells. Essentially so your body doesn’t have to wait several days to make the antibodies. </p>
<p>Now the problem is that some pathogens are just similar enough that the memory b and T cells activate to make antibodies. When this happens, the body thinks “hey we already have this taken care of before and have these memory cells let’s not start from scratch making B and T cells to take care of this infection again” So you don’t make a new variation of the antibody for the second infection. The problem arises when the pathogen is just similar enough to activate this memory cells/turning off new production of antibodies and different enough to not be taken care of by them. This is why the second infection can be a lot worse in certain strains in repeat infections. Hope this helps a little bit scientifically. Sorry if it wasn’t exactly how dengue fever works. Another thing is that pathogens can do something called camouflage where they use the antibodies inside you to basically attach to their outer walls and evade the immune system. It’s literally just as it sounds lol.  </p>
<p>If you want to read more about this in depth it’s called original antigenic sin. That exam gave me nightmares so enjoy the read haha</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
