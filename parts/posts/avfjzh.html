		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so plenty of people have explained how salt lowers the freezing point of water and how that affects the roads, but they havent been explaining why salt makes ice colder.</p>
<p>The most complicated part of this is the fact that it takes energy to melt ice. At 32 degrees Fahrenheit ice can be either a solid or a liquid. Imagine that you have an ice cube on the counter. The ice cube will slowly heat up until it hits 32 degrees. At 32 degrees, it stops heating up and starts melting. The water that is melting off of the ice cube is still 32 degrees, and that water wont get warmer past 32 degrees until all of the ice is melted. It is only after all of the ice is melted that the water can continue heating up to room temperature.</p>
<p>Now you flip the scenario around (sort of). You have ice that is at 32 degrees. When you add salt to the ice, the freezing point is lowered. Because the freezing point of the salty ice is below the current temperature of the ice, it starts to melt. But melting the salty ice <em>still requires energy</em>. Where does that energy come from? It comes from the heat energy of the salty ice. The temperature of the salty ice falls as it melts, as that heat is being used as energy to turn the salty ice from a solid into a liquid. The temperature of the salty ice will continue to fall and the salty ice will continue to melt until either all of the salty ice is melted, or until the salty ice is at the temperature of its melting point.</p>
<p>I know it isnt very ELI5, but thats the best I can do at answering your question OP.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The ice in your freezer is closer to 0 F than to 32 F. The salt water /ice mixture around ice cream can be colder than 32 F. The water helps transfer the ‘heat’ from the ice cream mix to the ice</p>
<p>The ice on the road does a similar thing, except the ice on the road is closer to 32 F (depending on outside temp) so the salt makes it a liquid that can flow off the road. If it’s too cold, salting the road doesn’t help. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To pile onto what others have said about salt lowering the freezing point, keep in mind that making ice colder for ice cream and melting ice on the road is literally the exact same thing in both cases.</p>
<p>When you make ice cream, the cream is in a sealed container floating in a watery ice bath.  The salt melts the ice before it normally would, making the water colder than freezing.  This in turn helps to freeze the cream in its tub, since it's now floating in icy water that is below freezing.</p>
<p>In the case of salting the road, it's doing the same thing.  It melts the ice before it normally would, but that's it.  The colder than normal water just runs off the road.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>If ice melts at 32, and salted ice melts at about 28.4 the ice on roads can melt if the temperature is under 32...</p>
<p>For Ice cream, water that comes off the ice is colder (28.4 instead of 32) this colder water has good contact with the metal container, and is colder than non salted ice (water) the ice cream can freeze.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The salt lowers the freezing point. Imagine a bunch of people jumping on a trampoline, and if they ever jump higher than 5 feet then they float away. Most of the people will stay on the trampoline, but a few who try hard enough will escape.</p>
<p>Now imagine there are also a bunch of people floating around, and if they come within 5 feet of the tramp they fall onto it.</p>
<p>The trampoline represents the solid ice and the space above is liquid water. If you add salt, that is like adding a bunch of people to the tramp that can not escape no matter how high they jump. They effectively block all the people in space from landing on the tramp, I.e. They prevent water from solidifyiing on the surface.</p>
<p>So for ice cream, the salt allows the water to get colder, it does the same thing on the roads, it &quot;allows&quot; water to be colder than 32 F without freezing. So if its 30 degrees and the roads covered in ice, you can add salt and the freezing point may become say 20 degrees, and the ice will melt because its warmer than that. But if its cold enough, the ice will never melt no matter how much salt you add.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
