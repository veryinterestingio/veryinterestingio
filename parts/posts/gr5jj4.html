		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't always the case but when that's the plan, it goes as follows:</p>
<pre><code>- Borrow money and buyout the company.

- Have the company massively go into debt and use the money to pay yourself an enormous dividend. 

- Use the dividend to pay back the money you (not the company) borrowed.

- The company is way over leveraged, defaults on the debt and declares bankruptcy.</code></pre>
<p>Here's where it gets interesting, the bankrupt company now sells off it's assets (brand name, plant, etc.) and defaults on its union contracts, pension obligations (which screws the retirees and the taxpayer funded PBGC), etc. The corporate lenders are now basically the owners of a new unencumbered company with a much higher profit margin. Hostess Bakeries is a good example of this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Made an account just to answer this question due to how insanely wrong the existing answers were below.</p>
<p>The real answer is complex and I don't have the time to explain the difference between a restructuring bankruptcy vs a liquidation bankruptcy, dividend recapitalizations, why debt decreases cash flows etc. But I'll try keep it simple by just focusing on PE funds because they are usually the ones to buy entire companies. PE funds exist by raising money from third party investors, who would like you to go out and buy entire stakes in companies. After buying companies, PE funds typically own them for \~5 years, before either selling the Company to a new investor (sometimes a competitor or another PE fund), taking the Company public through an IPO, or selling the Company back to management. </p>
<p>Onto your question - PE funds use debt to buy a company for the same reasons homeowners take out a mortgage to buy a house. A lot of people can't afford to pay for their house upfront with cash, so they borrow money from the bank to buy the house. Some people can just barely afford to buy the house upfront with cash, but then they will be left with no money remaining to improve the house. Perhaps a person could afford to buy the house with all cash, but they get a mortgage so they can buy more than one home. A fourth, more technical point is that debt boosts returns to the homeowner / PE fund. If I buy a house for $10 of my cash and then sell it 5 years later for $11, I will have made $1 on my $10 investment, or 10%. Now let's say I buy the same $10 house with $4 of my own money and $6 from the bank, and sell the house 5 years later for $11. I will pay back the bank the $6 they are owed, which leaves $5 for me. My original investment was just $4 this time, so I will have just made $1 but it was on a $4 investment - poof - I made a 25% (1/4) return. (For context, successful PE funds shoot for returns in the high teens / low twenties.)</p>
<p>A <em>crucial</em> point in the example above where we borrowed money from the bank is that the bank got paid their money first when the house was sold. Imagine a hose filling water into a series of cascading buckets where only after the first bucket is filled up, water can then trickle onto the next bucket. When the homeowner/PE fund borrows money from the bank, the bank become the first bucket in line to get paid back after the business is sold. Only after the bank's debt is totally paid back can the PE fund get their money back. So when there is a liquidation such as in the case of Sears, and the debt holders only get paid back a fraction of what they are owed, it is safe to assume the PE fund gets NOTHING. </p>
<p>Clearly PE funds do not want their investments to go bankrupt and lose their entire investment. Besides losing a ton of money, it will become much harder to raise money from investors in the future if you have a record of your investments resulting in bankruptcy. The truth is, a very small minority of PE investments result in bankruptcy. PE suffers from a framing bias where the only PE investments the average person hears about are the few you mentioned above - big name retail companies that could never overcome the Amazon revolution. The fact is, the overwhelming majority of PE investments are successful, but the media would never (and have no reason to) report on the tens of successful PE investments made every day in smaller companies or in non-consumer facing industries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially, what they usually do is have another company that &quot;manages&quot; part of the acquired businesses assets, and then charges the acquired company fees.  That way they can transfer assets and cash to the new company that they control 100%, while loading up the company they acquire with debt. </p>
<p>Sometimes, the acquired company has more value in assets like land, then they have value as a business.  What they want to do is keep the company alive as long as possible, while investing very little in the company, and transferring out assets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say you have a fruit tree. You have to take care of it for it to grow fruits, and it grows just limited number of fruits every year. Let's say 100$ worth of fruit per year.</p>
<p>Someone comes and offers you 2000$ for a tree. That's 20 years worth of fruits, so you agree. What you don't know is he borrowed those money from someone else, who expects to be repaid 200$ a year, but a tree can only produce 100$ worth of fruit every year.</p>
<p>So then he starts cutting branches and selling them as fire wood. For few years he makes much better money then selling fruits, even 300$ a year, and on the branches he does not cut down, there are still fruits, in fact initially cutting branches results in bigger and better fruits.</p>
<p>Unfortunately few years down the line, there are no fruit branches left.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
