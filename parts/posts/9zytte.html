One is sparse gas cloud on it's way to collapsing into a galaxy, if you consider that a single object, then that has actually existed.  The other is a truly gigantic black hole with an event horizon the size of a galaxy, which isn't possible, as the expansion of the universe has already (and continues to) spread out the required mass too much for it to come together again to form such a monster black hole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>But wouldn't something that massive just collapse on itself under it's own gravity and make the mother of all black holes? </p>
<p>I think the limit here would be ability of anything that massive to survive it's own gravity. </p>
<p>Please correct me if I'm wrong. I want to know too! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A single celestial body could not be nearly as large as a galaxy. The empty space between stars in the Milky Way or any galaxy is unfathomable, it would take an absurd amount of matter for a single object to be that large. The hugest of stars are completely dwarfed when compared to a galaxy, matter in space is just too spread out for the relatively weak force of gravity to pull enough together to make anything so large</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
