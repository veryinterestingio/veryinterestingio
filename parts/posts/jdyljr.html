		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s actually a pretty cool thing of engineering.</p>
<p>The zapper itself contained a light sensor at the tip. When you pressed the trigger the next frame of the TV would become all black. The frame after that would be mostly black except for a white box in the hit box of the target. If the gun detected light during this moment, it sent a signal to the NES which meant it was a hit. If you didn’t aim at the right place on the screen, then the light sensor wouldn’t have detected light well enough. Using a lens you can get it’s “pointing accuracy” to be a little better as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Along with the actual answer, I'll add in why it doesn't work on modern tvs:  input lag.  Signal processing has added a delay to modern flat screen tvs that wasn't present in old CRTs, which synced with the console to display properly, allowing precise timing required. this delay means the sensor doesn't see the proper frames and the game cannot work.  There has been work on zappers designed to work with modern TVs using camera imaging:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a sensor on the zapper that detects the light level where you point it. So it knows if you are pointing it at a dark or light pixel of the screen. When you push the trigger button the screen flashes for one frame with white where the duck hitbox is on a black background. Due to the high refresh rate it is very hard to spot this by the human eye and can easily be interpreted as simulated muzzle flash. But this quick flash is enough for the NES to read from the sensor if you are pointing the zapper at the hitbox of the duck or not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
