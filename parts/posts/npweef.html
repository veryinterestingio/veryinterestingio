		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi there! I work with mosquitoes right now for my research and I get this question a lot from curious folks. First, thinking that an animal needs to be &quot;good for something&quot; is not how we should view another living thing. Animals and plants evolved to suit their environment, they are very good at that though it may not be useful to us. Everything also has a role to play within their ecosystem and mosquitoes are no different. So here is my love letter to mosquitoes:</p>
<p>If you are asking do they benefit the ecosystem, then yes absolutely. Mosquitoes are an important source of food for many animals as both larvae and adults. Mosquito larvae are aquatic, they feed fish, dragonfly larvae, damsefly larvae, diving beetles, water scavenging beetles, turtles (red-eared sliders love mosqutio larvae!), and some frogs (if you're in the NE U.S. our leopard frogs love mosquito larvae) (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17853601/" target="_blank">Quiroz-Martínez and Rodríguez-Castro, 2007</a>; <a href="https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.1139/Z08-097" target="_blank">DuRant and Hopkins, 2008</a>; <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1049964412001089?casa_token=bUGZsd6M8wcAAAAA:v6G8N2pnW9x0kZSjCUPVZoMIuBJ6YDjWlqYtDqn96XvnmdqpjsewR-ekDdL9THNK6ZAZzD4IOg" target="_blank">Saha et al., 2012</a>; <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1049964413002351?casa_token=08hx3X_epjUAAAAA:ysUBpb39ytrsuvIfeUaxwHC3GaG24GRLXqQ-p0td1LugqWmEs9_ydjGGLmIXHn4X0tCzVAcDmA" target="_blank">Bowatte et al., 2013</a>; <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Reducing-Dengue-Fever-Through-Biological-Control-of-Sarwar/59886f65c07216111b39adcd62b1e2cd4091a5c5?p2df" target="_blank">Sarwar, 2015</a>; <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10750-018-3765-y" target="_blank">Bofill and Yee, 2019</a>). There is also a mosquito genus (<em>Toxorhynchites</em>) that does not bite humans but feeds on other mosquito larvae (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2480946/" target="_blank">Trpis, 1973</a>). Adult mosquitoes feed birds (blue birds, purple martins, cardinals, etc.), bats, and spiders (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4083372?casa_token=Myh3Tw985cQAAAAA%3AFZray17yJhNpWaCn0elaWoZrfA_GTcuZbmnwwqvu1XAjkSfLrFpoTU7z7r-1m0ls6dXEHWszVwv5ZcGm3SgzLUSf8tLjSLUt9RGG5afE5fEGDiwaP3k&amp;seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents" target="_blank">Kale, 1968</a>; <a href="https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/14/5/736/187073?login=true" target="_blank">Roitberg et al., 2003</a>; <a href="http://e-m-b.org/sites/e-m-b.org/files/EMB25_1.pdf" target="_blank">Medlock and Snow, 2008</a>; <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jme/article/46/5/1037/903409?login=true" target="_blank">Reiskind and Wund, 2009</a>).</p>
<p>Additionally, mosquitoes pollinate flowers (<a href="https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/j.1537-2197.1969.tb07528.x" target="_blank">Thien, 1969</a>; <a href="https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/j.1537-2197.1970.tb09905.x" target="_blank">Thien and Utech, 1970</a>; <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11829-016-9445-9" target="_blank">Peach and Gries, 2016</a>). Most of a mosquito's diet is nectar. Only females drink blood and that is only when they need the extra protein to create eggs. Many mosquitoes are very important pollinators to smaller flowering plants that live in wetter environments. For example, the snow pool mosqutio (<em>Aedes communis)</em> in my home state of NJ is the primary pollinator for the blunt-leaf orchid (<em>Platanthera obtusata</em>) (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2424249?casa_token=y8zaqNKC_Y8AAAAA%3AW0IYPn5k0WF2_BJi8BnNntd0MzbBLADsfrMvm2WhuI3DkDPJ0x5pYi5PwNRxGVAjS3XFvTqtVs0RRlxcInTVoU1YouLYQGllk_Y7i6xqmJTx_K1U_XA&amp;seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents" target="_blank">Gorham, 1976</a>). The role moquitoes play all over the world as pollinators is actually grossly understudied by scientists. Most of the focus on their biology/ecology is as vectors but there is so much more going on in this taxon than disease.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about disease and protecting humans, I hear you on that, but out of the 3,500 or so species of mosquito out there we really only worry about mosquitoes of three genera; <em>Aedes</em>, <em>Anopheles</em>, and <em>Culex</em> as far as disease goes (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.0269-283X.2004.00513.x" target="_blank">Gratz, 2004</a>; <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jme/article/45/1/125/874364?login=true" target="_blank">Hamer et al., 2008</a>; <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000209" target="_blank">Hay et al., 2010</a>). That leaves I think 35+ or so other genera, some of which would never bite a human let alone transmit disease to us. Of the species that prefer mammals humans are not even really their first choice, they tend to prefer livestock over us. Many species don't bite mammals at all! For example,  <em>Culiseta melanura</em> feeds almost exclusively on birds and <em>Uranotaenia rutherfordi</em> feed on frogs (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jme/article/43/5/1088/883091" target="_blank">Molai and Andreadis, 2005</a>; <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/een.12874" target="_blank">Priyanka et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p>So wiping out every mosquito species would be overkill. Could we remove the species that are harmful to humans and not have any issues within the ecosystems they are apart of? That is a difficult ethical question that has long been debated within the entomology/ecology community. You will find scientists on both sides of the fence. There was a study that came out a few years ago saying it would be fine, but that study is hotly debated. Personally, I'd say if it were possible to at least remove the invasive species that cause disease, such as <em>Aedes albopictus</em> in the U.S., then I am okay with that (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2627635/" target="_blank">Moore and Mitchell, 1997</a>). They shouldn't be here anyway. But it could be very difficult to remove all invaders without also harming native mosquito populations. And, for some species that have been here in the U.S. for hundreds of years (<em>Aedes aegypti</em>) what would removing them from local populations do to the ecosystem? Perhaps it would allow for a bounceback of native species they have been outcompeteing, or perhaps they are so abundant and woven within the fabric of the ecosystem it would cause an issue. I honestly don't have an answer for this. Even if there is low to no impact ecologically by eradicating all mosquitoes, is it the ethical choice to make? Ask 10 scientists, get 15 answers.</p>
<p>Should we eradicate <em>Aedes albopictus</em> in their native homes of Japan, Korea, China, and a few islands? Personally, I would be against it. I'd rather use control methods and keep populations low where they intersect with humans. We are also making incredible strides with genetic engineering! Perhaps one day we could use gene editting to make these troublesome species poor vectors for the diseases we fear. If their bodies are no longer an effective home for the disease then we don't have to worry about them.</p>
<p>Edit - I completely forgot to mention this - but if we remove an entire species or several species that may not impact the ecosystem in a &quot;make it or break it way&quot;, and then something happens to other species that have similar roles, we have no backups. It's not is this species a huge or sole food source it's this species along with other species are filling a role in the ecosystem and if we lose too many species within a particular role we could have a catastrophe on our hands. Another example, mosquito larvae eat plant detritus in ponds. They are not the only organism that does this, but if we remove all of them and there is a similar collapse in say frogs (as we know amphibians are currently in trouble) then we are out two detritivores within a system.</p>
<p>I'll leave you with this quote from Aldo Leopolds's <em>Land Ethic</em>:</p>
