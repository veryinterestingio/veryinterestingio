		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The easiest way to think about it is solid vs gas state. The closer you are to either one, the more you can make an analogy to the actions of particles with their neighbor. In a solid state, high cohesiveness and bonds with the neighbor ~ high surface tension. In your gaseous/high temperature state, the opposite</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Thats why you can throw boiling water into freezing air and have it turn to snow while cold water wouldnâ€™t. The surface tension is much weaker in hot water, so it achieves better atomization in the air, and thus has more area, allowing it to freeze incredibly quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surface tension itself is a measure of the strength and sum of all intermolecular forces at an interface. A molecule of water in the bulk phase of a solution is experiencing a uniform attraction to all other water molecules around it. This is a highly favourable state and the molecule is of 'low energy'. In contrast, a molecule of water at the interface is no longer experiencing a uniform attraction and is being 'pulled' towards the bulk phase - the system is trying to reduce the number of molecules at the interface. The stronger this pull (intermolecular attraction), the higher the surface tension. When we raise the temperature of a system, the molecules gain kinetic energy and as a result spend less time at the interface and the intermolecular attraction is weakened, which in turn reduces the surface tension.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the temperature of water decreases, the molecules have less kinetic energy. A solid (in this case, ice) has particles which do not have enough kinetic energy to overcome the forces of intermolecular forces (hydrogen bonding, for example).</p>
<p>As liquid water cools, the kinetic energy of the water molecules have a harder time overcoming those hydrogen bonding forces, and so the surface tension increases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That explains why the way I clean my glasses works, maybe.</p>
<p>I prefer washing the lenses with water and dish soap at the sink, rather than using microfibre cloths and some sort of alcohol cleaning fluid.</p>
<p>The challenge comes in how to rinse the soap off without leaving water droplets. Part of the solution is adjusting the tap/faucet until you get nice smooth laminar flow, that really helps the water to slide off.</p>
<p>The other factor I had found was temperature. I find that if I get the lenses nice and hot before hand, by running hot water over them and then rinse with hot water if you catch the angle just right 100% of the water slides off the glass leaving them complete droplet free*.</p>
<p>It results in totally clean lenses, in a way that I never managed to achieve using a cloth.</p>
<p>I'd always wondered whether this was due to surface tension being lower if the water was warmer, but I'd never bothered to check.</p>
<p>* I do tend to have to dry the bottom of the frame against my shirt, while water clears the glass you don get a few droplets sat along the bottom edge of the frame</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
