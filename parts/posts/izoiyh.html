		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every egg can become a queen (in most bee species).  When a hive needs a new queen, a larvae is selected (sometimes more than one and they'll slug it out later) and fed nothing but &quot;royal jelly.&quot;  Royal jelly is made by workers (it's secreted by some gland on their heads), and while all larvae start on a diet of royal jelly, queens get nothing but that, while all other bees are fed &quot;bee bread&quot; after a few days of royal jelly (a mixture of nectar and pollen).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They just pick any of the cells that has an egg in it and then proceed to feed it royal jelly instead of the food the drones and workers get. If they are re-queening the hive they will usually do this to several cells so that they have several queens growing at once. Then, the first queen to emerge goes around and kills the other potential queens to establish her as the heir to the throne. Quite interesting process actually.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are three kinds of bees in the hive.There is the Queen bee She is if course a female there is only one Queen in the hive her job is to lay eggs. She is the only female with developed ovaries. Queens are created by feeding the larva from a fertilized egg a diet of Royal Jelly. This will cause it's ovaries to develope. It will emerge as a fully developed queen bee. If the old queen is still healthy and virial she will leave the hive and a swarm of a significant % of the hives will leave with her to develope a new hive. The Virgin queen will depart the hive on her mating flight of which there maybe from 1 to 4 flights. If the old queen has used up all the sperm from her mating flight(s) 3 or 4 years previous she will be laying unfertilized eggs which will all be drones. The workers will raise a new quern when it hatches it will seek out the old queen (which will not swarm) . The new queen will kill the old queen. Then will proceed with her mating flight(s).</p>
<p>Worker bees. This is the type of bee that makes up the main population. Worker bees are all females. However worker bees ovaries are not developed. They are fed a diet of Royal Jelly for the first 3 days after hatching from a fetilized egg and then the diet is switched to honey and pollen for the rest of its larval period.</p>
<p>Drones. These are the male bees. There only purpose is to find a virgin queen to mate with They do not mate with a queen from thier own hive. Drones are incapable of stinging. They do not have a stinger. Drones do no work in the hive. They do not even have the ability to feed themselves. Drones are the result of an unfertilized egg.</p>
<p>When the hive wants to swarm or if it needs a new queen it will feed a fertile egg a diet of Royal Jelly.</p>
<p>Mating. Drones depart the hive daily at about noon. They just go out and fly about . When a virgin queen goes on a mating flight it also departs at about high noon. But when it does it flys away staying very close to the ground. This is to avoid mating with any drones (her brothers) from its own hive . When she has gone about a km or more from the hive she will fly up higher and higher. As she does any drone in the area will detect her smell (pheromone) and try to catch her. She will continue to fly higher and higher followed by a number of drones only the strongest will get to the queen and mate. When that occurs his genitailia will be ripped from his body with an audible pop. The queen will return to the hive while the drones gear continues to inseminate her. Workers will remove his kit and toss it away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
