<p>You change out the water in the bucket periodically as it becomes too dirty. Mopping the floor with really dirty water isn’t very helpful.</p>
<p>But also modern mopping usually involves a press to remove water from the mop head. You take water from the bucket and spread it on the floor to bring up the dirt, then dry the head with the press and soak up the water back into the bucket. It takes the majority of the dirt with it, and it doesn’t really matter how dirty the water is because you aren’t putting the head into the water at that stage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The mop and water got dirtier, therefore the floor got cleaner.   Dirty can neither be created nor destroyed.   at the end of the day, you dump dirty water and you wash out that mop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So for one, we know it works because the mop water gets dirtier.</p>
<p>How it works is basically how you described it, get the mop wet, (usually with a mix of soap, water, and bleach). Squeeze most of the water out of the mop (you don’t want it to be sopping wet). Using that top attachment on the bucket.</p>
<p>Sweep the mop back and forth over the ground, dirt and oil will get Picked up by the mop head</p>
<p>Then dunk that back into the water, releasing the dirt into the water In the bucket. And start the process over again.</p>
<p>It’s really that simple, and we know it works because the bucket water gets dirty.</p>
<p>The kicker is, you can’t keep doing this infinitely, you will reach a point where the water in the bucket is so dirty that the mop head isn’t really releasing more dirt than it’s soaking in.</p>
<p>Imagine it like a T-shirt that you got muddy, just putting the T-shirt in some water and rubbing it a bit will get most that mud off.</p>
<p>But if you tried to do that with a T-shirt and super muddy water. Then it doesn’t work very well at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So you start with dirt that is stuck to the floor. Hot soapy water from mop releases that dirt so now you have slightly dirty water on the floor. Then the mop wipes up most of the dirty water. Voilá...clean floor!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
