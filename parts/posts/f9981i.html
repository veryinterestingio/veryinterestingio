		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Reddit!</p>
<p>I'm a physicists who works with with electron microscopes, particularly transmission electron microscopes (or TEMs), to look at the nanoworld and/or play around with the wave functions of electrons.</p>
<p>I'm originally from Italy and I work in EMAT, an electron microscopy laboratory in Antwerp, Belgium. Here ~<a href="https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/emat/about-us/members/group-photo/" target="_blank">70 researchers</a> can use 6 TEMs study a wide variety of materials science topics, from the cathodes of Li ion batteries to the mechanics of shape memory alloys, from magnetic ceramic oxides to nanoparticle catalysts.</p>
<p>Why do we need electrons to image the nanoscale?
The resolution of conventional optical microscopes is limited by the wavelength of the light used (0.4 Âµm for blue light).
Electrons however are also waves, and fast electrons (i.e. accelerated with a tension above, say, 30000 Volts) have an extremely short wavelength, of only a few picometers.
Using electromagnetic fields we can steer and focus these electrons beams just like we do on light by using glass lenses.
We get resolutions all the way down to 0.05 nm, that is a twentieth of a millionth of a millimeter (or 2 billionths of an inch in freedom units).
This is such a good resolution, that it allows us to even look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanthanum_strontium_manganite#/media/File:Scanning_transmission_electron_microscopy_la07sr03mno.jpg" target="_blank">atoms that make up solid materials</a>!
(No, seriously, how cool is that??)
We use these capabilities to study the link between the microscopic structure and shape of materials and their macroscopic properties.</p>
<p>My personal focus is on the development of methodologies, that is I try to find ways to use or misuse electron microscopes to measure the proporties of the samples with better precision, clarity or even study things that we couldn't before.
For instance, I recently demonstrated a <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5114926" target="_blank">new method</a> to measure deformations (strain) in materials with nanometer resolution with a precision of up to 1 part in 5000, which is very important when prototyping or producing semiconductor devices.
A more exotic interest of mine is that of wave function manipulation.
Since the state and properties of the electrons are defined by their wavefunction, we can give them new and interesting properties intentionally changing the wavefunction. It's a bit like having a quantum sandbox.
I did plenty of research on <a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/holography-puts-electrons-in-a-twist/" target="_blank">electron vortex beams</a>, a weird type of beam rotating around its own axis which therefore possesses it's own <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06879" target="_blank">magnetic moment</a>, and interacts with mangnetic fields in a peculiar way, but also others such as the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11840" target="_blank">Airy waves</a>, which possess freakish properties such as accelerating in absence of external forces.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about my research, here is my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oAz-QkUAAAAJ" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a> profile, all of my articles on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/?searchtype=author&amp;query=Guzzinati%2C+G" target="_blank">arXiv</a>.</p>
<p>I will be here between 12:00 EST (17:00 UTC, 18:00 CET) and 16:00 EST (21:00 UTC, 22:00 CET) to answer your questions.</p>
<p>Giulio</p>
<p>EDIT: <strong> 23:00 CET Finally checking out, my fingers can't type anymore. I'll try to pass by tomorrow and answer a couple follow ups. This was really fun, thank you all for the great questions! </strong></p></div></div>

What is the most surprising thing you've found out about Electron microscopes? In terms of another use or something no one really realised you could do with them?  </p>
<p>Whats the coolest object you've had in the firing range? (Not tempreture wise! :P)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
