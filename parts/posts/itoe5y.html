Basically, you take a high spot, figure out two other spots, measure the distance and angle between them, and calculate the area of that triangle. Repeat over an entire country.</p>
<p>Also, maps were not really super accurate as to what an aerial view would look like, they were just accurate as to the distances between objects, and lengths of roads and such.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Geometry.</p>
<p>There’s one example of a mapmamker (and his son, and his grandson, and his great grandson) being hired to make an accurate map of France being during the reign of Louis 14th. </p>
<p>He did it using triangles, he would would pick two points he knew the distance between, and then measure the angle between those two points and a spot way off in the distance respectively. He could then use geometry to know how far away that point in the distance was by making triangles. </p>
<p>He then linked triangle after triangle after triangle going all around France until he had a pretty accurate map:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/g5830.ct001183/?r=0.055,-0.476,1.064,1.59,0" target="_blank">https://www.loc.gov/resource/g5830.ct001183/?r=0.055,-0.476,1.064,1.59,0</a></p>
<p>(He didn’t actually live to see it completed, his son carried on with the triangles, and then further defendants carried on with filling the map with village and town names.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There were a lot of methods of measurement, combined with geometry. Really once you have one known distance by good ol' fashioned measuring sticks/chains/wheels, the rest can be inferred with math with some crazy accuracy just by measuring the angles on either side of your known distance. Even the circumference of the earth was estimated in ancient times and it was eerily accurate when you think about how they didn't even have electricity. That all kinda falls apart in ocean navigation though because you have no earthly landmarks in the middle of the ocean.  </p>
<p>For ocean navigation there was the sextant and the clock. Using the sextant you could figure out latitude by measuring the angle at highest point the Sun/stars reached, at the equator the sun would be a straight 90 degrees and going north/south it would descend south/north. You can figure out longitude by when the sun would reach it's highest point, sundown, or sunrise (or via certain stars). Basically using timezones to estimate how east/west you are.  </p>
<p>The latter was only possible with the spring-loaded clock though. There were lots of early methods of measuring time, but they usually fell apart at sea due to the unstable rocking of sea vessels, pendulum and water clocks were right out. Anything that did work like rope or wick clocks required you to burn through rope for weeks at a time and if they ever went out, there goes your only method of measuring longitude. Sun dials also were not feasible because the gnomon (pointy bit that sticks out of the disk) needs to be at a different angle depending on latitude so it becomes useless unless you're traveling *exactly* along a specific latitude.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Triangles.</strong> A <strong>lot</strong> of them. Like, for example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Trigonometrical_Survey#/media/File:1870_Index_Chart_to_GTS_India-1.jpg" target="_blank">Great Trigonometrical Survey of India</a>.</p>
<p>And basic mathematics. You could probably do it yourself, with time.</p>
<p>Start with two points  well apart (A and B, say) that can be seen from each other. On top of a couple of hills is good. Measure the distance between them the hard way - measure it by walking it with, e.g., a chain of known length. Now you know how far it is from A to B in a straight line - you have a baseline.</p>
<p>Now find a third point (C, say) well to one side, that can be seen from both A and B.  Stand at A, and measure the angle between the line to B and the line to C. Go to B, and do the same thing - the angle between the line to A and the line to C.</p>
<p>You now have three points (A, B, C) in a triangle. Maths time. You know the length of one of the sides (the baseline). You don't know the lengths of the other two sides yet, but you know the angles they make at each end - and that's enough to work the lengths out using nothing more than the sort of maths you get taught at about 15. And now you know exactly where C is, relative to A and B.</p>
<p>Now you just do the same thing again, but this time using a new point, D, and one of the new lines (the one between A and C, for example). You've already worked out how long it is; you can measure the angle at each end to D. So now you have a new triangle joined on to the first one - and again you can work out how long the two new sides are, and exactly where the new point is, relative to the others.</p>
<p>Now you just keep going for months, or years, adding more and more triangles to the sides of lines that you already know. Eventually you've covered the whole country in triangles joining points you chose. And you know where all the points are, relative to each other, and you can plot them on a map to a high degree of accuracy.</p>
<p>(Just in case you were wondering - yes, every measurement you make is imperfect. And you'd think that, after a while, all the errors would add up, and make the result useless. Fortunately, it doesn't happen like that in practice - errors tend to cancel each other out, and the result is likely to be extremely accurate. It takes a little more than high school maths to show that, but it's the case.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Early on, they had to use very crude measures like travel time to measure distances. Three days' sail, at what feels like <em>about</em> so-and-so a speed, means these two coasts are so-and-so distance apart. A day's travel by horse over clear land is such-and-such miles. People relied on loose rules like that, and as people crossed the land and sea in different ways in different directions, you could sort of deduce that things are shaped this way or that way.</p>
<p>Later, maps were tightened up using surveying. By standing on a high vantage point and getting some friends to stand in other spots where you have a line of sight to them, you can record the compass bearings and altitudes and azimuths, and by combining a bunch of these measurements you can do some math to figure out the relative positions much more precisely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
