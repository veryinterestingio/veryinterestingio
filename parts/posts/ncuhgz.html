<p>Good actors and a strong script will generate fear and emotion in the actors during the scene, but because you rehearse everything so many times over and over - starting from everyone messing up cues and missing marks so it's more funny/annoying than scary - and because you're hanging out for weeks with the other cast members outside of the scenes it's really not remotely as impactful on the actors as the audience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is always with parent permission, no matter what movie it is. Parents are allowed to veto scenes, and most movies use editing and camera work to make the filming as untroubling as possible for the kids. You can film the child’s part separately and edit them into scenes, for example</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

During the sex scene, his mom was in the room.  During the scene where there is a flashback of Seth’s penis drawing addiction, the hand you see holding the drawings is actually a very small adult’s hand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Watch how things are edited. In most cases it is fairly obvious anything too adult (even language) is filmed when the child is not in the room. The scenes are then edited in a way to make it look like it was all done in a single shot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In most cases, the children aren’t exposed to anything TOO bad. Unless you’re a messed up person, the directors wouldn’t really be allowing the younger cast members to witness any sort of sex scenes unless they’re old enough to know about it, and the curses are probably permitted by their parents</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
