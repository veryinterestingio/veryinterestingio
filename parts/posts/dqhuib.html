<p>And thank you for all those concerned about my safety. As others have pointed out, there's safety mechanisms in the boiler to stop my flat filling with gas. Growing up we had a gas boiler at home which sometimes required the pilot to be switched back on so it's nothing new for me. You just need to push in a button for 15 seconds and let the flame reignite. In fact there's instructions on the front of the boiler telling you how to relight the pilot and not to do it within 3 minutes of the pilot going out.</p>
<p>The boilers been looked at a couple of times since I moved into the flat for regular safety inspections and has always passed. Granted with the pilot going out a few times recently it may require me to contact my landlord just to have someone check it.</p></div></div>

Simply, insulation. Depending on your units tempature settings, it will heat up the water to.. let's say 140f. When it drops to 115 the unit turns on and warms the water back to 140... Does this dozens of times a day.... No matter if you're home or not. </p>
<p>Also, pilot lights aren't supposed to go out. Their job is to stay on and reignite the gas heating element. Unless your unit is electric and then it just uses a spark to ignite. </p>
<p>Mechanical Insulator by trade.</p>

<p>Edit1: I reread your post and I either didn't read it right or you may have edited it.
Some water heaters are like a big pot of water and it takes a while to heat up. Some water heaters are filled with coils... Which allows the fire to warm more  surface area.. hence how tankless water heaters work.</p>
<hr />
<p>Edit 2:
Everyone is getting way off topic.
The question was how does a water heater get water warm so quickly.</p>
<p>Not about gas leaks or pilot lights.
Gas leaks rarely happen to a untampered unit. It's an urban legend that a pilot light going out will cause a house to explode.</p>
<p>There are some good answers here by other tradesmen, in a field a lot closer to this answer than mine. We're all right here, just about different aspects of the situation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m a hvac tech by trade and a journeyman gas fitter so I’m going to try chime in here,</p>
<p>I’ve read replies about gas filling your home if the pilot goes out, even the oldest boilers I service do not have standing pilots, they have a thermocouple attached to them in the “pilot assembly” that, when heated will provide the tiny little solenoid in the gas valve with a tiny little bit of voltage to open the solenoid, releasing gas through the pilot tubing to the pilot assembly, where your pilot flame is. Once the flame goes out the thermocouple stops producing voltage and closes the solenoid, no flame=no gas. </p>
<p>Most common issue is a bad or dirty thermocouple. Have a licensed gas fitter replace the assembly and adjust the pilot, you can adjust the amount of gas that will be fed to the pilot light on the gas valve. </p>
<p>To answer your question regarding the pilot light being out and having no hot water, the pilot needs to be lit to provide the gas valve a signal that proves there is flame present for the main valve to open. It’s not your pilot light heating the water, it’s the flame that is substantially larger that comes on after. A typically pilot light is like 400 btu/h. A 40 gallon hot water tank is typically 40,000 btu/h.</p>
<p>Hope this clears things up. Cheers</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like you have an “on demand” boiler. The water goes through a heat exchanger to get hot. Think of the heat exchanger as an old fashioned radiator for heating a room. Water passes through the inside of the radiator and fire is passing on the outside. This is done in an efficient way so that the water enters cold on one side and leaves hot on the other. It’s a wonderful system! :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question to this, I've tried to research but always hit a wall. How EFFICIENT are on demand hot water heaters? I get it heats up the water faster and less gas or whatever they are using, BUT it takes a lot of energy to heat up water ON DEMAND to the temperature you want it to be. That seems like there might be some inefficiency there, no? Anyone know?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The heaters are designed to extract as much heat from the gas as possible before it escapes upwards. This means the inside of the GWH (Gas Water Heater) is basically a donut. The air heats the water as it passes by.</p>
<p>Add in the delivery of cold water is done by the dip tube. It deposits water at the bottom of the heater, and hot water is extracted at the top. This ensures the output is relatively consistent as the cold water rises and mixes up to the extraction point.</p>
<p>Lastly is the heat output. As another post mentioned, you get 40,000BTU out of the heater assembly itself. Stoves are 3000-7000 for a single burner. So imagine a 6 burner stove all on high; that's the output not over a whole stovetop but by a ~10&quot; burner focused by the GWH to heating water.</p>
<p>So a combination of delivery, design, and tons of BTU means quickly heating water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
