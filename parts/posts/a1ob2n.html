		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1) Lions lived in parts of Southern and Eastern Europe until the 300s AD. So in many regions there was cultural memory of the beasts even if they died out several generations previously. </p>
<p>2) The Romans took their gladiatorial fighting traditions wherever they conquered and a major part of that was importing exotic animals for people to fight. So lions would be known in Romanized Europe. </p>
<p>3) They had trade routes to the Middle East and to Africa which would allow for the wealthy Nobles and Royalty to import exotic animals for menageries which were popular in the middle ages. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few reasons. Lions did exist in parts of Europe (largely Southern) until \~300 AD, possibly longer in small numbers. Lions also were culturally adopted from the Ancient Greeks onward and many of these subsequent peoples would have had physical access to lions via expanded trade routes etc. Finally, Lions are featured in the Judaeo-Christian tradition, which in tandem with the lion's reputation as the &quot;King of Beasts&quot; would have influenced their desirability for heraldry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because lions existed in Europe, as well as seals. Descriptions of such animals can be found in several of Aristotle's Biology works.</p>
<p>EDIT: For all the confused Redditors, I meant Southern Europe. My bad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>
<p>Lions did exist in Europe at one time.</p>
</li>
<li>Dragons and unicorns did not exist but were still part of heraldry. Overall people would pick creatures they knew were imposing in many instances even if they haven't seen them.</li>
