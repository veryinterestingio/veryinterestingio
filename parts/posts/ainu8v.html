		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don't move through the spectrum, but how much it affects you can change over time, mainly due to the development (or lack of development) of coping mechanisms; the more experience you have the easier it is to cope.
On the reverse, if you do not learn how to, the added stress as you age and become more reliant on social interaction can make you less likely to cope, especially if you have ASD alongside some form of mental illness (depression, OCD etc.), and your reactions/symptoms (for lack of a better word) more pronounced. </p>
<p>National Autistic Society has some more info on it: <a href="https://www.autism.org.uk/about/adult-life/ageing.aspx" target="_blank">https://www.autism.org.uk/about/adult-life/ageing.aspx</a></p>
<p>TLDR; You don't move along the spectrum but you can cope better or worse depending on experiences and are likely to have more issues as you get older if you have co-existing conditions</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://the-art-of-autism.com/understanding-the-spectrum-a-comic-strip-explanation/" target="_blank">Firstly the spectrum isn't a line as such</a></p>
<p>It isn't a lineair progression.</p>
<p>As to the 'as time goes on' : </p>
<p>One problem in later life is that where in 'normal' people cognitive decline is just one problem, for people with ASD it is 2. Their coping skills rely on their cognitive function to some extent. Loss of cognitive function can cause loss in coping skills, causing you to show more signs of autism.</p>
<p>Just something to look forward to I guess. Growing old sucks.</p>
<p>edit: Um darn I didn't realise I answered on askscience. If I had realised I would've probably let experts answer, I am just parroting a few books I read and my inexpert understanding of the subject.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm on the spectrum, late diagnosis at 44, am a few weeks shy of 49 now - the late diagnosis means I've always had good intuitively-built coping mechanisms in place, but that at some point they broke down sufficiently to prompt seeking help. </p>
<p>Over the years my coping mechanisms have gotten refined enough most people can't tell unless I freak out. I can't sustain eye contact for long but I will generally tell people about the spectrum and the eye contact as soon as I feel sufficiently comfortable, which is usually before the lack of eye contact becomes too obvious, at which point people will say &quot;huh, I'd never have noticed&quot; and will then stick with that even if they surely must later notice. I've learned to be very picky about what company socials to go to. I've declined a small-scale celebration of my company anniversary because I don't deal well with being the center of attention. I consider being deliberate about what social situations I put myself in to be part of my coping mechanisms, along with the usual stuff like internalized procedures to analyse and prototype responses in social settings. But over time, I've gotten lots better at integrating. Getting diagnosed helped here, even if it didn't change much about me. </p>
<p>Where my coping mechanisms break down: I tend to take spoken and written words as true and will be pretty upset if it later turns out to be hyperbole. If I'm very relaxed I can spot this happening in me and interrupt myself. If I'm not, I'm apt to get very combative about things that most neurotypicals would just shrug off. This has gotten worse for me as time passed. I tend to value getting a detailed analysis of any situation (especially conflict situations) over reconciliation, which is something about myself I wish would just disappear. I've had this as long as I can remember, but the stakes were a little different on the playground than they are in the office, or in adult relations. </p>
<p>So, in response to your question, in some aspects I have gotten more high-functioning through refinement of my mechanisms. In other ways I'm lower-functioning because I'm getting more and more set in my ways. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
