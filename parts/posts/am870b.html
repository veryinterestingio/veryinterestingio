<p>I copied this directly from a worksheet found on a .gov domain:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Background:  The East coast of the United States has barrier islands extending from Maine all the way to Texas.  The West coast has virtually no barrier islands.  This is due to plate tectonics.  The United States is on the North American plate which is moving in a Northwesterly direction.  The West coast is the leading edge and the East coast is the trailing edge.  Barrier islands form on the trailing edge.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The Pacific plate (mainly under the Pacific Ocean) and the North American plate meet on the West coast at what is called a subduction zone.  This is where one plate is sliding under the other.  Any sediments that are carried to the ocean move across the narrow continental shelf (approximately 20 miles wide) and fall into this area.  There is no accumulation and therefore no barrier islands.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>On the trailing edge (the East coast) sediments carried to the ocean have a broad plain to accumulate on.  New land is being formed at the mid-oceanic ridge as the plate moves and a wide continental shelf is created.  The continental shelf off the coast of Georgia is approximately 80 miles wide.  Thus, barrier islands have space and sand supply to form.</p>
<p>The wave action is determined in part by the width of the continental shelf.  As the waves hit shallow water at the edge of the shelf, friction along the bottom slows them down.  High energy waves reach the West coast because of the narrower shelf.  This creates great surfing and big breakers out West but few sandy beaches.  After moving over 80 miles of gently sloping shelf (a decline of 1-2 feet per mile), the waves on the East coast have lost a lot of energy and are more gentle.  There is very little surfing here in Georgia but nice sandy beaches.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with plate tectonics, on the west coast you have a subduction zone which means that one plate is diving under the other. Where that happens you generally have a steep slope and not a lot of a plate boundary so any offshore islands have to be very high.
On the east coast you have very shallow beaches and you can walk out very far, generally, on the west coast  you can't walk into the ocean very far, the beaches are much steeper.
The Atlantic is where the tectonic plates are pulling apart. That is called a divergent boundary. That means that the eastern coast has had a lot more time for silt and sand to get washed off the land and create very shallow beaches. So the barrier islands don't have to be very tall.
I generalized a bit in this answer, there is a lot more to it, it's a fascinating field of study.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see a lot of tectonic responses but no wind related ones. The overall wind direction is offshore on the east coast and onshore on the west coast. So sand and sediment is more likely to build up in areas in the east coast. Also, the west coast shelf is super short and steep, the east coast ocean shelf is gradual and long, so sediment can build up in it. And like others said itâ€™s a passive margin not an active tectonic margin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
