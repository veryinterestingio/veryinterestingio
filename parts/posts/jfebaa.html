<p>Even single-celled organisms have organs (special structures that do tasks like digest things, like our stomachs). They also have senses, using special proteins, which can detect things like light and chemicals. These proteins signal other special proteins in the organism, and a chain of these proteins leads to activities like movement, eating, etc., kind of like how our nerves talk to one another.</p>
<p>But how this all comes together to create complex behaviors is a very difficult task, and is still mysterious to scientists.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>“Single-celled organisms” is a very large pool of many unrelated species. I will mostly focus on bacteria because that is what I know best. </p>
<p>Bacteria are pretty much the most basic form of life. They “eat” small molecules that diffuse through channels in their cell walls. Some bacteria secrete acids and enzymes which “digest” solid food sources and free up smaller molecules that can be used by the cells. To find food, some bacteria have receptors on the outside which allow them to “smell” their food source and little propellers, called flagella, that help them swim towards their food source.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>
<p>A lot more happens in a cell than you'd think is possible, until you realize the scale of how much space is inside a single cell. If a cell were the size of Cincinnati, a single water molecule would be about the size of a piece of paper. DNA would be as wide as a person is tall, and most proteins would be the size of a house (with lots of variance). Now, the difference between cities and cells is that cities are built along the (mostly) flat ground, while cells fill the whole volume of space above and below them. That's plenty of space for amazingly complex activities to happen!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even single-celled organisms work together, sometimes in very complicated ways. That means one cell doesn't have to do everything.</p>
</li>
<li>Much of what complex multicellular organisms do is not on the list of things single-celled organisms have to do. Think of single celled organisms like scavengers. They wait around like vultures for food to happen by. Sometimes they can swim a little, though usually less than the length of a sheet of paper for a long journey.</li>
</ol>
<p>But they can't walk across town (muscles). They don't store a bunch of food (fat), make complicated plans to find food and bring it to them (brain), and they don't build and maintain a river of nutrients that they then have to protect (blood).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In multi celled organisms those functions are split up but they don't have to be.  In a single cell it's all just squished into one cell.</p>
<p>Like you have tiny fibers that can squish the cell into shape,  to move, or little tail things mounted on the outside. There might be digestive enzymes inside that break down simple things, and little sense receptors that detect specific chemicals so that it can track food or light sources.</p>
<p>The trade-off is that they can't do as much as a multi cell organisim like sensing images instead of just bright vs dark, or digesting lots of different things vs only a few things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spin off question - could single cell organisms ever evolve larger, and their internal chemical machinery adapt to be larger with them so we had large single cell organisms with totally different set up of biology? Or is there a good reason that this hasn’t happened?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
