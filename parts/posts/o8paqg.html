		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I heard somewhere gazelle are so fast, they are quite cocky and will taunt cheetahs by displays of athleticism, kind of like saying “try me; I am fast.”</p>
<p>Or how some zebras may display an aloof or cool nature while looking directly at lions, and then you learn that some zebras have actually killed lions by kicking or ganging up on them. </p>
<p>How did this happen, evolution wise? When does a prey determine when to run and when to fight and why? </p>
<p>And how is it smart to make a predator angry by taunting them? Wouldn’t that lessen your chance of survival if he picks you out?</p>
<p>Edit: Thqnk you for all these great answers! I didn’t know predators had it this hard lol</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honest hard to fake signals are common in nature. One example is stotting, the deliberate jumping by antelopes in front of lions. This behaviour signals two things: I've seen you. I'm really fast (so don't bother). This saves both species time and trouble and thus the signal and it's reception can be selected for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stotting is a thing.</p>
<p>The idea is by showing how much energy and speed they have, even in the face of death (EG a charging tiger) they may convince the animal not to even try, to break off the pursuit.</p>
<p>Then again I wonder if it's like a super-fast cat stretch; an instant way to prep the muscles for extreme action.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some species of birds intentionally draw a predator’s attention to lure them away from their nest or mate. This can (obviously) be an evolutionary advantage if it helps protect offspring while still allowing the taunting bird to escape.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
