		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ice cores. Where you drill a big hole in the ice and pull out samples.</p>
<p>When Ice freezes, it traps tons of little air bubbles in it. These little air bubbles have the same composition of the overall atmosphere when that sections of ice froze.</p>
<p>So, if you were to go somewhere like Antarctica, and drill down hundreds of feet, you would get to ice that formed a long long time ago, thousands and even hundreds of thousands of years for the deepest cores.</p>
<p>You now have ice that froze a long time ago, and trapped a sample of the atmosphere from that time in it. You have a sample literally frozen in time.</p>
<p>You can then take that to a lab and do an analysis of how much CO2, Methane, O2, and other gasses are present and compare that to levels we see today and from other younger or older ice cores.</p>
<p>Edit: as for exactly how accurate they are I cannot say what the margin of error is. Each scientific study should report their own margin of error. But when you take an overall view over hundreds of studies and thousands of samples taken, this data is accurate enough and the best option we have to make the models and predictions we need.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It happened</p>
<p>My area of specialty!!!</p>
<p>I see lots of ice cores mentioned here. Definitely a method deemed reliable.</p>
<p>There are other methods, such as tree cores! Uses very similar measurements and all that. It has to do with molecular processes and enzymatic favoring of different isotopes (C, O,  others). Those isotopic signatures remain in the molecular structure and can be quantified, along with other environmental factors, to build a fairly accurate representation of a “moment (grow season) in time”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Now that you've done that completely irrelevant thing, think about snow. Specifically, think about what happens when you walk on snow - you sink. This is because snow is a bunch of tiny ice crystals layered gently on top of each other with lots of air between them. When you stand on it, the air gets pushed out and the ice crystals get compacted. The reason this happens is simply because you are heavy - any other heavy thing put on the snow will also cause this to happen, including more snow. </p>
<p>When you put a bunch of snow on top of snow, the snow at the bottom gets compressed. Some of the air gets forced out of it, and the ice fuses into one big sheet of ice. Some air gets trapped inside the sheet when this happens. In some places, like Antarctica, it snows pretty often, so you keep getting new layers of snow deposited on top of older layers, resulting in the snow at the bottom becoming compressed. This process happens regularly over hundreds of years, creating a thick layer of ice called a glacier or ice sheet. The ice at the bottom of this sheet is older than the ice at the top because of the way snow always falls down from the sky, and not up from under the ground. </p>
<p>You could take a segment out of this ice sheet, a long thin one from top to bottom, and if you did the ice at the top would be very recent and the ice at the bottom very old. All of this ice has air trapped in it, which was trapped when the ice turned from snow to ice, so it's essentially a time capsule of what the atmosphere was like when that ice was formed. If you open up one of those air bubbles, you can measure the CO2 in it, and you can estimate the age of the ice based on various things like how much snow gets deposited in a given length of time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One method is to analyze ice. They drill deep holes in very thick glaciers. So the ice from down below is very old, even thousand of years and hast small bubbles of gas included. This gas is very old air which can then be analyzed.
Almost a million years ago, the ratio of heavy and light isotopes of oxygen (O 16/ O 18, H / D or hydrogen to deuterium) provides us with information about temperature. It is crucial that in the process of evaporation of the ocean water, i.e. the phase transition from liquid to gaseous, the isotopes of the constituents of the molecule water (H2O), i.e. O 18 or D compared to the &quot;normal&quot; atoms O 16 or H, depending on the the temperature of the ocean water changes into the gaseous phase at different speeds. Isotope physicists speak of temperature-dependent defraction</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the age of the time frame under discussion.  Ice cores preserve bubbles of air that existed at the time of capture, so are good witnesses of air composition, but ice has a limited age (rare to get ice more than a couple hundred thousand years old although there are a few locations where older ice has been recovered). Precision is relatively high as far as such things go.  The measurements can be pretty precise, but is the air bubble actually the same now as it was at the time the bubble formed?  uncertainty enters from that. </p>
<p>Source material itself (the air) is not homogeneous so you need a good number of analyses to define a statistical population or you cannot really say anything about how well a single measurement is a representation of the real world (works for all analyses not just bubbles).  The more data you have, the more confidence you can have.</p>
<p>Other methods vary from stable isotopes (carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, sulfur isotopic variations all provide clues about the nature of ocean-atmosphere chemistry), global carbonate sediment production, weathering rates of rock (CO2 is a weak acid and main source of rock weathering), and lots of other chemical or physical methods of questionable certainty but still decently useful for more ballpark understanding.  Obviously, when you get into larger scale processes covering wider time frames, precision is lost.  I even knew one line of thought that relied on examination of paleosoils going back well into the Proterozoic. How much should we accept the conclusions?  Hard to say.  Generally speaking, the changes with/over time are clear and repeatable, but how they translate into actual numbers is a harder thing to declare.  High CO2 periods over low CO2 periods can be identified.  Is a &quot;high&quot; period at 1000 ppm, 2000 ppm? or what?  That is part of the interpretation and it is open to discussion, if one is honest.  Trends are fairly easy to identify, but putting hard numbers to the different points in trends is a lot more challenging.</p>
<p>The BIG HEADS like Robert Berner and Dick Holland (both long departed from this world) were the ones who got into this sort of thing in a big way back when I was a student in the 80s.  Don't keep up so don't know who is doing all the hot work now. Mandatory reading back then though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
