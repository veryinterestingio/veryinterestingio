Way more than anything else I have ever put on Reddit. Also, thank you to the anonymous kind stranger for both the coins and the award. That was also unexpected and another first for me.</p>
<p>Just to quickly clarify where my head was with the question, I simply couldn't understand how all the math I'd been taught at school that told me the area of a circle is pi x r^2. I kept thinking that if pi cannot be accurately derived, then how can any formula result that depends on it be accurate either. I just started to think that it would be just a very precise estimate but as a kid I always thought math was an accurate pursuit. Thank you all for an enjoyable debate!</p></div></div>

<p>I think you are confused between what it means to know a number exactly and what it means to have a terminating decimal representation of that number. In fact, a lot of undeserved attention is paid to base representations, when they really don't affect any of the most useful and interesting properties of a number, e.g., rationality. How we write or represent numbers doesn't actually affect or change what the number is. It's like how what a chair is is not affected by what you call it, whether it's &quot;chair&quot; or &quot;silla&quot; or &quot;Sessel&quot; or something else.</p>
<p>The number π is known exactly. It's just ... π. That's it. We can even <em>define</em> it as the ratio of a disk's area to its radius-squared.</p>
<p>Since π is irrational, its representation in <em>any</em> rational number base must be infinite and non-periodic. So we cannot write down a finite digit representation of π. But there are plenty of <em>irrational</em> bases in which π has a finite representation. Trivially, in base-π, the number π has representation &quot;10&quot; (but also the infinite, non-periodic representation &quot;3.011021110020....&quot;)</p>
<p>In base <em>b</em>, there will always be numbers that cannot be uniquely represented (e.g., 0.499... = 0.5 in base-10 and 0.111... = 1 in base-2) and there will always be numbers that have infinite representations (e.g., 0.333... = 1/3 in base 10 and 0.010101... = 1/3 in base-2). That doesn't mean we don't know those number exactly. For instance, the number 1/3 is the unique number <em>x</em> such that 3x = 1. That's the definition of 1/3. But if we choose an integer base <em>b</em> for which <em>b</em> is not divisible by 3, then 1/3 will have an infinite digit representation.</p>
<p>(The only feature about 1/3 that really separates it from π in this context is that 1/3 is rational, but π is not. So in any integer base, 1/3 always has at least one eventually periodic representation.)</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>edit</strong>: Copy-pasting a response of mine below for more clarity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This doesn't &quot;sidestep&quot; the question. If you know <em>r</em> exactly, then you know πr^(2) exactly. &quot;How big is that disk with radius 1 meter? Its circumference is 2π meters and its area is π square-meters.&quot; All of that is exact and, yes, those are the exact numbers in base-10. That has nothing to do with how we represent numbers, and that's really the only reasonable sense in which &quot;know&quot; should be interpreted.</p>
<p>The problem is that many people confuse knowing a number with being able to write it down with finitely many decimal digits (so we don't know 1/3?), or at least being able to write it down with finitely many decimal digits and some periodic pattern (so we don't know sqrt(2)?). Too much attention is paid to base representation and too many properties of a number are conflated with its base representation.</p>
<p>Let's look at some other ways you might &quot;know&quot; a number...</p>
<p>If you have some other convoluted definition of &quot;know&quot;, then you have to specify exactly what you mean. If by &quot;know&quot; you mean that...</p>
<ul>
<li>... you can represent the number with a finite digit representation in base-10, then you can't know the number 1/3 but you can know the number 1/4.</li>
<li>... you can represent the number with a finite digit representation in base-3, then you can't know the number 1/4 but you can know the number 1/3.</li>
<li>... you can represent the number with an eventually periodic digit representation in base-10, then you can't know the number sqrt(2) but you can know the number 89102/2123901.</li>
<li>... you can represent the number by constructing a segment of that length with a compass and unmarked ruler, then you can't know the numbers 2^(1/3) and cos(2π/7), but you <em>can</em> know numbers 2^(1/4) and cos(2π/85).</li>
<li>... you can represent the number by constructing a segment of that length with a compass and <em>markable</em> ruler, then you can't know the number 2^(1/5), but you <em>can</em> know the number 2^(1/6). (Both of these numbers were also unknowable in the previous bullet point.)</li>
<li>... you can measure such a length exactly, then you can know 0 and precisely one nonzero number of your choosing <em>but no other number</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that with any of these definitions (except the last), you can't know any transcendental number like π or <em>e</em>. Some transcendental numbers even have base-10 representations with very easily described patterns, although they are not periodic. For instance, the number</p>
<blockquote>
<p>0.110001000000000000000001000...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is transcendental. Under any of the above concepts of &quot;know&quot;, you don't know this number. But its base-10 representation is actually very easy to describe: &quot;the digits are all 0, except where this is a 1 in each <em>N</em>th place, where <em>N</em> is a factorial&quot;. So there is a 1 in places 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, etc.</p>
<p>You will find that with these other definitions of &quot;know&quot;, they don't even all agree about what you can &quot;know&quot;. It's all just so arbitrary, and there's just way too much emphasis on knowledge of the number depending on some physical reality. The implicit definition of &quot;know&quot; that I used in my original post is really the only reasonable interpretation of &quot;know&quot;. Do you even &quot;know&quot; the number 1? Why? Mathematically, it's just this thing we define to have certain properties, just as we do with pi. There's really no difference.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We talking abstract or physical object here?</p>
<p>Abstract - a perfect circle of radius 2, say, has an area of exactly 4pi. That is an exact area, and a perfectly good number. The fact that it's a non repeating decimal doesn't actually matter until you try to make it physical and so have to measure things. </p>
<p>Physical - any accuracy issues will be more related to instrument accuracy than numerical accuracy. If a perfect circle somehow did exist, the issue would be measuring its radius. That measurement will be done to within some accuracy, then we're back in the situation above: that squared times pi. Similarly for creating one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would argue Yes, just not in decimal form.  All of the infinite decimal places are contained in the singular symbol of Pi, so the equation A=Pi*r^2 is perfectly accurate.
For any practical application, ex: car engine parts manufacturing, I  would still say yes.... and you can truncate pi to whatever gets you within your desired margin of error.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
