		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends entirely on the type of insect but here are the common strategies: </p>
<p>1) Leave. Monarchs are probably the best known example of this. When it gets cold they just get the hell out and go south like birds.</p>
<p>2) Overwinter as adults. Some bugs, in their adult form, burrow into bark, under leaves, etc. and go into a sort of suspended-animation like state until the temperatures rise in the spring. </p>
<p>3) Overwinter in a developmental state. Tons of insects <em>don't</em> survive the winter, but their offspring do. Whether they survive as eggs, or partially develop and then dig into the soil, or whatever, one of the biggest trends in insect survival is that mom and dad don't make it, but all the kids they have each season do. </p>
<p>4) Bunker down. This one is pretty rare, but some insects actually stay awake (albeit not as active) all winter. Wild honey bees stay active in their hive in the winter, sort of like we go inside and ride out the winter with stores of food and heat. They consume tons of honey and work to keep their hive warm using body heat and their wings to move the heated air (and fresh air) around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
