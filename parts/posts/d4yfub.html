<p>Also there is some research to suggest we prefer those roboty voices because that way you know it's a machine and it's less creepy.

<p>Making a digital assistant sound too human could be uncomfortable for some according to a lot of market research. There is still a lot of trust issues abound when it comes to interactive technology so they risk alienating their client base by making the voice too human.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Next to 'uncanny valley' and processing time, ethics also play a role.</p>
<p>It can make people feel uncomfortable, betrayed or even unsafe about future interactions if they were convinced they have been talking to a real human but it turns out to have been a robot. Not in the same way as the uncanny valley, but in a way of &quot;what if this [real human in a callcenter] is a robot too?!&quot; combined with all the negative thoughts (non-tech) people have about robots and automatization. </p>
<p>While not everyone would be bothered by it, big tech companies have to consider this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
