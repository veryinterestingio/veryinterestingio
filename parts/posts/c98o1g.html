<p>You basically just run chemicals through it and/or spray things.</p>
<p>They would either not actually be working 24/7 or would have different assembly lines/stages that get shut down for cleaning periodically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have stated, most machines get shut down periodically to be cleaned in place.  To add to this, most factories will have multiple machines so that production can continue while one line is down.</p>
<p>I was helping wire up unrelated electrical equipment in a bottling plant once.  They would shut one line down and flush cleaners through the pipes and nozzles that carried beverages.  Meanwhile, workers would spray, hose, and wipe down external surfaces.  All the while 9 other lines are bottling, and once this machine is clean and running again, another will be taken offline for the same process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of those are not ‘constant run’ but are, in fact, run by batches.  And the same system can be used fore different products.<br />
Cleaning/disinfecting can be done between batches,  a more intense cleaning is done if changing products,
In some instances, disinfecting os part of the process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
