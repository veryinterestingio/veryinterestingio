<p>I love well prepared broc, but I still hate it the way my mum cooked it as a child (boiled for so long it becomes a tasteless chewy mass).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Taste buds mature over time.</p>
<p>Things like vegetables taste bitter to children (as a poisonous plant defence iirc) which is why they often make a fuss about not liking broccoli etc.</p>
<p>Somethings I think we have to train ourselves to like eg. Beer / coffee. No one really likes the taste, but you drink it out of nesecity until the taste doesn't really bother you any more.</p>
<p>I say I can't be old yet because I don't like red wine, coffee or olives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apart from preferences, culture, expectation, etc. Some vegetables have actually gotten better recently. For example in the 90's commercial cultivation of Brussels sprouts changed from an older plant that was very bitter to the much more palatable  Brussels sprout we have today.</p>
<p>So people change but so does food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
