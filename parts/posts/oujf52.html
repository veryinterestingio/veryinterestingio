		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a large forest.  </p>
<p>You have a few favourite trees so you keep visiting those particular trees and in the process paths form. Those paths are well trodden so they get maintained naturally. Something happens and you stop visiting a particular tree. After a while the path gets overgrown and eventually it can't be seen at all. The tree is still there, but the path is gone.<br />
There might still be some little references to the tree but it would be difficult or even impossible to find the previous path.<br />
Eventually you might find that tree again and rebuild the path allowing you to quickly access it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We do. We can conciously keep things in our memories with awareness and repetition. We subconciously remember stuff too, often if something triggers us emotionally it stays with us because that is more likely to be important than minor details (hence things like depression can stunt memories). And remember we don't always remember things accurately, because our biases affect how we respond to our senses, so sometimes we create false memories or block them to protect ourselves because of emotional trauma. There are lots of factors involved with remembering and the brain can be trained and strengthened just like muscles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Memories are experiences that retain an emotional charge, especially if it impacts you deeply enough to affect your behavior, decisions and choices. Likewise you can go back through memories of childhood experiences with adult eyes and help you grow into something different</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The importance of the thing to you.. For example your birthday, you would remember it cause it's important to you. But what did you dream about 4 days ago, what did you eat last week, etc have no effect on your life. It's only the important and useful things that u mostly remember</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>(repost) Your brain in a network of interconnected neurons. The more often a particular cluster of neurons is activated the stronger the pathway. So when you are in love and you are constantly thinking about that person that repetition makes far stronger memories.</p>
<p>Neurons are able to achieve extra ordinary feats of interconnectedness and the more ways that a particular memory is interconnected - like if you see a crash and then hear someone else's version of events and then look at a recording of the event - the more potential triggers you have for that memory cluster.</p>
<p>Many similar but distinctive memories - like brushing your teeth everyday - are so similar that they fail to trigger specific recall. Hence unique memories - like witnessing a car crash - stand out a lot more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
