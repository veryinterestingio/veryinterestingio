With 'split' I mean create some space between blocks where fire has nothing to travel to the next block to spread.</p>
<p>I imagine that actions like dropping water with helicopters would also be unnecessary since we could 'give up' a burning block and then the fire would be over.</p>
<p>Or am I too naive about it?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're describing <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firebreak" target="_blank">firebreaks</a>. The issues as I understand them are:</p>
<p>With wind fires can jump the gap or burning embers from one side can blow across. Embers can jump firebreaks of 600-800 feet on occasion.</p>
<p>They are not always practical to create given the shape of the land - hills, mountains etc </p>
<p>They are hard to maintain given you need to keep them free of most vegetation across a large area.</p>
<p>People own land and so you can't just cut firebreaks on a perfect grid across the countryside.</p>
<p>Edit: Because a lot of people are commenting on the numbers I gave for 6-800 feet. I'm referencing one of the numbers given in Wikipedia of a 600 feet wide firebreak which was actually jumped. But it also mentions that embers can fly further and start fires further afield.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have made good points that maintaining such a network of fire breaks would be expensive and resource-intensive. </p>
<p>Dividing forest habitat like this also creates what are known as <em>edge effects</em>, which can be ecologically devastating for some species. Many large animal and tree species require large tracts of dense forest to thrive. These forest edges create small, but potentially critical differences in climate and environment that can be detrimental to those &quot;deep forest&quot; species: for example, light, wind, and temperature can enter the forest horizontally, new species can establish themselves along the new edges and start to encroach into the forest and outcompete established species, and the breaks can hinder migration throughout the forest. </p>
<p>Lastly, fire is quite a beneficial process in many of Earth's ecosystems. Humans have managed landscapes in a healthy way via fire for millennia. Over the last couple centuries, imported colonial forest management theories have called for an unhealthy level of fire suppression. As a result, fires in recent decades have been far more intense than they have been historically. Additionally, drought events are occurring with greater frequency, causing more frequent and intense fires than probably occurred historically, at least in North America.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These splits are called &quot;Fire Breaks&quot;, and that's one of the main things which forest fire fighting crews do.  Building them, and maintaining them, is too expensive to do all the time.  They also have to be quite large to protect against spread of large fires, which makes them unattractive.  They can also lead to erosion and other environmental damage.</p>
<p>A far better strategy is more frequent, smaller, fires as nature intended.  This could lead to burning down more homes, but perhaps that would send the message &quot;Don't build if a forest that burns regularly or your house will get burned down regularly.&quot;  More people need to get that message.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every small patch you make from a large patch of forest creates more edges. Edges of vegetation patches tend to have more light, weeds and invasive species, which can compete with local native plants and animals (research &quot;edge effects&quot; and &quot;habitat fragmentation&quot;). However, you can have a large patch of forest that is periodically burned in small patches (mosaic burning) over time to reduce fuel loads and allow access to intact forest adjacent for movement of animals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
