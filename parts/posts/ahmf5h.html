<p>Edit: wow, didn't expect this to blow up like this, ty all for your explanations, this is much clearer now. I didn't get why we would use a unit that describes a quantity when we already have a quantity related unit that is the mass, especially when we know how to weight things. Thank you again for your help, I really didn't expect the reddit community to be so supportive.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We use moles instead of mass since it accurately shows how many molecules of a substance we have. The chemistry behind reactions is dependent on the number of molecules present, not their mass.
To put more simply, it's more important to know many ingredients you have for making a hamburger, then it is to know how much the ingredients weigh. It's more important to have two buns instead of just knowing you have 100g of buns.</p>
<p>Edit: Forgot to mention that the OPs question is not stupid, and is completely reasonable. As some others pointed it, it would be a good opportunity for the teacher to emphasize the importance of moles vs mass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You did not ask a stupid question. When trying to understand these conventions of science, you pretty much can't ask a stupid question. In fact, I would argue it was an <strong>important</strong> question, and the teacher wasted an opportunity to stress the usage of the mole to the class. </p>
<p>The mole refers to a number of things, just like a dozen. You can have a dozen eggs, but also you could have a dozen molecules of caffeine. You could have a mole of caffeine, but you also could have a mole of eggs. This is important because chemistry cares more about the <em>number</em> of molecules than the weight of those molecules. </p>
<p>Furthermore, consider the following balanced equation: 2(H2) + (O2) -&gt; 2(H2O). Given 2 moles of H2 and excess oxygen, you know you can produce 2 moles of H2O. Using moles allows us to compare the actual quantity of molecules, whereas with weight it would be difficult to compare in such a neat fashion. Given 200g of H2 and excess oxygen, you have to do some annoying math to first convert to moles, then convert back to grams. </p>
<p>Mass is, like you noted, more useful because it's easier to measure. You weigh chemicals with mass because it's easier, and because we're capable of converting to moles. That said, it's not uncommon to have percentages which are based on weight. Mass by mass, mass by volume, and volume by volume (m/m, m/v, and v/v respectively) are all common, with the first being solids in solids (e.g. alloys), the second being solids in liquids (e.g. solutions), and the third being liquids in liquids (mixtures and some solutions). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your teacher is a dick. It's a great question to ask.</p>
<p>Moles allows you to do calculations with the actual number of molecules.</p>
<p>There's a reason why people don't go around saying &quot;I need 200 kg worth of guys to help me out here!&quot; It wouldn't be very practical to use mass in that situation. However, saying &quot;I need three guys here!&quot; makes total sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not stupid at all. This is a concept which should be drilled a billion times in high school. Its not that obvious a thing to know moles make sense over mass. Teacher should be happy a student wants to understand the concept. </p>
<p>But like others explained, in chemistry, it's more important to know the amount of molecules you have in hand rather than the mass. Hence the need to use moles. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
