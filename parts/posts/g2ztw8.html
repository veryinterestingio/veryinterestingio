		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m <strong>Ed Damiano</strong>, and for nearly 20 years I’ve been developing bionic pancreas technology to automate blood-sugar control.</p>
<p>When my infant son, David, was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, my wife and I learned quickly how hard it was to get insulin dosing right in managing his blood-sugar levels, especially in such a small child. I began to imagine a wearable bionic pancreas that would automatically manage his blood-sugar levels without our intervention or his, when he grew up and became responsible for his own care.</p>
<p>Inspired by David’s diagnosis, I began developing, testing, and refining bionic pancreas technology. My students, postdocs, and I began conducting experiments at Boston University testing an early version of the device running on a laptop computer in 2005. Together with our clinical collaborators at the Massachusetts General Hospital, we progressed to in-patient trials in adults and adolescents with type 1 diabetes in 2008. Between 2013 and 2018, my team at BU and our clinical collaborators conducted over a dozen outpatient and home-use clinical trials in adults and children with type 1 diabetes, testing various mobile versions of our bionic pancreas technology, which was developed and refined in my lab at BU.</p>
<p>In 2015, I co-founded Beta Bionics®, Inc., a Massachusetts Public Benefit Corporation that is committed to the singular mission of commercializing a bionic pancreas for people with diabetes and other disorders of blood sugar regulation. Beta Bionics licensed the bionic pancreas technology from BU in 2015. Since then, Beta Bionics has developed a purpose-built, fully integrated, wearable, closed-loop device - referred to as the iLet® bionic pancreas - that is designed to automate blood glucose control in people with type 1 diabetes. Over the past two years, the iLet® bionic pancreas has been tested in several home-use clinical trials in adults and children with type 1 diabetes. 440 adults and children with type 1 diabetes are currently being screened for enrollment into a phase 3 clinical trial testing the iLet bionic pancreas at 16 clinical sites across the US. The clinical data from this study will support a market application for the iLet bionic pancreas to the US FDA.</p>
<p>My story is featured in the new PBS documentary &quot;Blood Sugar Rising,&quot; which premiered Wednesday night. You can stream the film on pbs.org or on the PBS Video App on your Smart TV. <a href="http://pbs.org/bloodsugarrising" target="_blank"><a href="http://pbs.org/bloodsugarrising" target="_blank">http://pbs.org/bloodsugarrising</a></a></p>

Here’s a short video from the documentary, about my story: <a href="https://youtu.be/1j6rmx0De7A" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/1j6rmx0De7A</a></p>
<p>Because &quot;Blood Sugar Rising&quot; is partnering with PBS series NOVA for outreach around the film, I'll be posting under NOVA's account: u/novapbs. I am looking forward to answering your questions about my family, my work, and about the latest medical technology being created to address the diabetes epidemic in America. I'll be answering your questions beginning at noon EDT on Friday, April 17.</p>

<p>It seems that even still, &quot;artificial pancreas&quot; systems just mean a CGM tied to an insulin pump for automatic basal adjustment up or down to get the rates right.</p>
<p>It still requires the user to input good consumed, calibrate, etc.</p>
<p>Do you see a day when a true artificial pancreas is available, one that can regulate sugar with zero input, for both up and down?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
