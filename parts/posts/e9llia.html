		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Intonation and association of polarity by inflection, mostly. There is an association of upwards inflection with positive response( or yes) and downwards with negative response. It’s like thumbs down and thumbs up, but with voice. Usually upwards means good/yes, and downwards is bad/no. But upwards intonation can also mean questioning, and tonal languages like Mandarin or Vietnamese are a whole other deal.
If you say “uh huh” but with downwards inflection, it’s like “riiight, sure, I believe you.” “uh uh” with upwards inflection doesn’t really exist except when training dogs or something</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Intonation and inflection helps conveying the meaning. But I think it's not the actual reason. You can say &quot;hu hu&quot; with an downward inflection and it stills sounds like &quot;yes&quot;, and you can say &quot;uh uh&quot; with an upward inflection and it still is a flavor of &quot;no&quot;.</p>
<p>The actual reason is that one feels natural and the other forced.</p>
<p>Pronouncing &quot;uh hu&quot; or &quot;hu hu&quot; is easy. Going from the &quot;uh&quot; to the &quot;hu&quot; is natural and nice on the throat. It flows well, which invites a continuation. It means agreement.</p>
<p>Pronouncing &quot;uh uh&quot; on the other hand, takes more effort. You have to block the sound of the first &quot;uh&quot; to say the second &quot;uh&quot;. This blocking is a dissenting sound, it has friction, resistance. It feels like conflict. So it means disagreement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
