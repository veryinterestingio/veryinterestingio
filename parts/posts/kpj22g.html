		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most important factor is the manufacturing process. It's called &quot;photolit<em>h</em>ography&quot;- which means &quot;writing <em>in stone</em> with light&quot; (edit: Thanks for the correction). Basically, they're using a fancy Xerox to print electronic circuits onto a slice of silicon. </p>
<p>Over the years, they have found ways to print circuits in finer details, which allows them to cram more stuff onto a piece of silicon. So they're improving the shape of the individual transistors to work better in small sizes and they're also using light with smaller wavelength, which is basically like getting a smaller brush size. In the past few years, they have started to work with a technology called &quot;EUV&quot;, that is extreme-ultra-violet. Its &quot;brush size&quot;  is 30 times smaller than the UV-light that causes tan and skin cancer. This is extremely difficult and expensive to work with, but it allows to cram billions of transistors onto a single chip: NVidias top chip, the GA100 used for their &quot;Tesla&quot; cards, has more than 50 billion transistors, compared to 20 billion on its predecessor that was made without EUV.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since none of the comments seem to talk about architectural improvements(in terms of cpu design),here you go.</p>
<p>CPUs are basically just switches interconnected with teeny tiny &quot;wires&quot; that carry data.The other comments tell how we add more switches every year.</p>
<p>Assume a huge factory(cpu)with an attached warehouse(cache) and hallways with conveyer belts stretching out to 8 different doorways carrying items(instructions)that are further to be loaded onto a truck.What nvidia,amd and apple do is that they,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>add more cache</strong>(sort of a very <em>quickly accesible warehouse</em> that cpu can ram around and fetch instructions)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Better and wider pipelines</strong>(The conveyer belts where the next set of orders that are to be moved to the truck are kept.We make this belts <em>wider and increase their carrying capacity</em> )In cpu terms,this is where the next set of instructions that are to be carried out are kept/operated on(for faster execution).Pipelining is basically moving 2 conveyer belts at the same time so as not to waste time with just bare belts with no items(instructions) to pick up.</p>
</li>
<li>Better <strong>branch
predictions</strong>(<em>predicting which doorway the items need to go</em>).This cache thingy, mentioned earlier is very costly and takes up a lot of die space,hence it is very important to get the perf benefits/cache area used tradeoff right.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you cannot add as much cache as you want,you need to keep,only the ones that you're sure,will be needed <em>inside the cache</em> or else the precious die space is wasted.Hence it is important to know if package #263 will go to belt #4 or #6 before the manager tells you.(In cpu terms,predicting which way the program is gonna go and what instruction is going to be needed next)i.e better branch prediction can somewhat compensate for less cache. </p>
<ul>
<li>They add dedicated <strong>Hardware accelerators</strong>(Nvidia NVENC,ISPs in mobile socs).<em>Small outlets with experts</em> for very popular items so you don't have to search and move them the conventional way which takes a lot more time.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few years ago,NPUs weren't even a thing,when it came to mobile computing,but as soon as AI and ML became ubiquitous,from recognising the faces in your groupies to getting the scenary right so the ISP knows where and when to turn the HDR/Night mode,on and off.These things are starting to command die spaces on their own.</p>
<p>This is a one off since I don't really have a good analogy and this is only true for a GPU</p>
<ul>
<li>Better <strong>memory</strong>(GDDR6X,HBM2).GPUs have dedicated memory,so that the gpu doesn't have to access the farther and hence slower system RAM and also don't need to compete for resources.</li>
</ul>
<h5>*As is the case with all eli5s,this is nowhere near an accurate representation of how cpus/gpus work and is drawn to give a basic outlook.</h5></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Besides just getting more transistors on a card as mentioned by others, you have to consider that expensive state of the art components made for one high industry become high end consumer products the next year when they can be produced cheaper. </p>
<p>They don't include today's best chips in the world on a computer graphics card because it may cost $100,000, but next year, as they get better at making the product, as industries like render farms, military, healthcare imaging have covered the RD costs,  it's now possible to price it for the consumer market.  Even if it isn't the chips themselves, the chip forges are funded by many different imdistries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Graphics cards rely on transistors to do work. Over time, we’ve figured out how to make transistors smaller and smaller (moving to a smaller “process node”). This lets you put more of them in the same space.</p>
<p>There are other ways to improve your chip, too. Improving some aspects of the transistor itself without changing their size much can help. You can also change how these transistors are arranged on the chip. Another option is to add specialized clusters of transistors that are really good at one thing that would normally require more processing power, such as machine learning or ray tracing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
