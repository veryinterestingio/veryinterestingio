		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the situation. IV meds that go directly into the blood act faster and the dose can be changed easily. These are typically useful for inpatient care.</p>
<p>IM injections can be long acting medicines that stay in the muscle and slowly gets released over time. Or it could be something like Haldol where someone is acutely psychotic and it is easier to hit a muscle than it would be to setup an IV on someone who is trying to fight you off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some drugs are either destroyed by the chemical environment in a muscle, or the drug actually harms the muscle. These drugs can't be given intramuscularly. If seconds matter, we need drugs to act very quickly, and for those we'd also prefer intravenous administration. Sometimes we need a slow release of drug into the system, and for those an intramuscular injection is preferable. Sometimes the drug contains chemicals that can react unfavourably with things in the blood, and they need to take an indirect route - for those an im. injection is also preferred. Sometimes the dosage you need to get an effect is too small/large for one or the other route of administration to be safe. Sometimes the drug is simply too big to pass over into the bloodstream from a muscle, and so we need to get it directly into the bloodstream ourselves.</p>
<p>The list goes on. The TL;DR answer is that it depends on <strong>what we want to achieve with the drug</strong> (how fast should it act, how long should it act, etc.), <strong>how much of the drug do we need to give</strong>, <strong>how does the drug interact with the chemical environment into which it is injected</strong> (does it destroy the muscle? does the muscle destroy the drug?), and <strong>many more</strong>.</p>
<p>Lucky for us, most medications have more than one possible route of administration, so doctors and nurses can be flexible when the situation requires it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is multiple routes medications can be introduced through.  Sublingual (under the tounge), inhalation (through the lungs), IV, ingested (through the stomach), and intermuscular).  Most medications can be taken in all of the various different routes but depending on the situation some routes are preferable to others.    Innergastral / ingested and intermuscular are the slowest routes in which the situation doesn't warrant fast onset unless you are talking local anesthetic reasons.  In fact the opposite, you want long lasting distribution through the body over a period of time.</p>
<p>The fastest is of course direct IV access and it's also the easiest to control and titration how much medication is going through the system but the Sublingual and Inhalation are just about as fast.  Sublingal of course has the issue of limited surface contact area and it isn't really great for liquids so it's used for the need of fast acting agents such as Nitro.</p>
<p>Inhalation is most of the time used for treatment of lung issues such as COPD and asthma but also to deliver anesthetics but in certain emergency situations when you cannot get an IV for some reason or other (usually extreme dehydration or severe blood loss) we will take life saving medications such as adrenaline and dump them directly into the lungs.</p>
<p>There is also one last method which is through the bone marrow.  Basically, they take this thick screw like big ass needle and will screw it into the leg bone and shove medications in that way.  It's been a while since I've been in the Healthcare industry so screwing the needle into the bone that way might have changed.  It would be painful as fuck but most people in that position aren't going to complain about it.</p>
<p>Best explanation I can give.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
