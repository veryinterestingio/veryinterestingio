		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is mainly due the the density of nerve fibres we have in certain areas of our body and the thinness of skin covering them.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are more sensitive nerve endings in facial skin than say, the middle of your back. But both the nose and ears have an added potential: skin stretched tightly over cartilage. Cartilage is covered by a fine layer of &quot;skin&quot;, the perichondrium, which is very sensitive. There isn't much space for the inflammation swelling of a pimple to go without pressing painfully on the cartilage. A bit like getting kicked in the shin, the skin gets bruised and the sensitive layer around the bone too, without a meaty buffer. Much more painful than getting kicked in a squishy spot. Inflamed perichondrium is super painful too, if things proceed that far.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, all to do with proximity to nerve endings. </p>
<p>Don't pull out nose hairs or you'll get pimples inside your nose and they are painful AF.</p>
<p>The ultimate pimple (infection) is tooth ache - but I don't think we know why teeth have so many nerve endings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
