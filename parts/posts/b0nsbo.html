		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few ways to do it.</p>
<p>u/duck1024 described what is usually called a Suspended Particle approach. Its a straight forward approach that can be tuned but needs constant voltage.</p>
<p>However, on top of that, there is the electrochromic approach. Electrochromics work by a burst of electricity through a material that physically changes colour when it is exposed to electricity (its similar to react-to-light lenses in a pair of glasses, except rather than reacting to light, they react to electricity). Once the pigment changes, it stays changed until another burst is applied. They also darken to a grey shade, don't got completely opaque, and can sometimes take minutes to change.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see this has been answered but I wanted to chime in since I own a company that installs a lot of this product.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The technology is called &quot;PDLC&quot; or polymer dispersed liquid crystal, commonly referred to as &quot;Smart Film&quot; or &quot;Smart Glass&quot;. There are a ton of liquid crystals suspended in a polymer solution which is laminated between a PET coating. When electricity is applied the liquid crystals all orient into the same direction, allowing transparency. When electricity is removed, the crystals disperse back into a mixed state. The film works opposite from what most people assume, with electricity making the film clear. Most people assume you are turning the film &quot;On&quot; when it is frosted, so we typically install the switch upside down. That way, when a client wants to add privacy for their office, boardroom, etc, they flip the switch &quot;on&quot; but are actually turning the product off.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The film (we install the film version, there is glass as well, same technology) uses about 0.4 watts a square foot, so even a large installation, if left powered constantly, draws very little power.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Although the film looks very clear when powered, there can be quite a bit of haze when clear. Cheaper products have more haze. Even the best products have an optimal viewing angle of 90 degrees, so viewing from the side, or from top down or bottom up you will notice haze. You are literally looking at the side of the crystals when out of optimal viewing angles. Lighting can also play a part in the amount of haze, as light will reflect of the crystals.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It is expensive, expect to pay between $75-$100 a square foot for product and installation. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Let me know if you have more questions! I play with this stuff all day!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
