I am just going to state my thinking and help me point out the problem. At the equator your body is traveling fast in a circle and the inertia of your body makes you continue to move out-word, this is the centrifugal force. At the poles you are moving not at all or much slower in a circle so your inertia has less effect. With less out-word force the normal force, or your wieght, would have to compensate so you would weigh more. At the equator the centrifugal force lessons your weight ( not mass ) because it helps counteract gravity.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, if the Earth were a perfectly rigid sphere (so ignoring the fact that the Earth itself bulges at the equator, also due to the centrifugal force), then your “effective weight” at the equator would be a little bit (less than 1%) smaller than your effective weight at the poles. And it is due to the centrifugal force of the Earths rotation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Lots of people are! </p>
<ul>
<li>One possible point of confusion: &quot;centrifugal&quot; and &quot;centripetal&quot; are just descriptions of the <em>direction</em> of a force.  E.g., when you're standing on the surface of the earth, gravity is centripetal.</li>
<li>In an inertial reference frame (one where F = ma), there's no such thing as centrifugal forces.  Centripetal forces are those that pull toward some center point in a direction perpendicular to the direction you're moving, which means they change your direction, but not your speed.  If we define the Earth as stationary and turning around an axis about once a day, we approximately get an inertial reference frame.  Someone standing on the equator is moving around 1600 kph in a circle; the difference between gravity pulling down and the ground pushing up on the person is a centripetal force that keeps the person on that circular path.</li>
<li>Centrifugal forces appear when you're not in a Newtonian reference frame.  If you look down at people on a merry-go-round from above (from a Newtonian reference frame), you see that they are pulling themselves in toward the center of the merry-go-round (i.e., creating a centripetal force) to maintain their curved path in space (i.e., to stay on the merry-go-round).  If you're sitting on the merry-go-round and thinking of it as stationary, then it feels like there's a force pulling you outward (centrifugal) that you have to counter.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You must also consider variations in gravity. The earth does not have a uniform crust. There are different elevations, density  of materials, and other factors.</p>
<p>Your relative “weight” is more a factor of these than anything else. Look up a gravity map of the earth for reference. For example</p>
