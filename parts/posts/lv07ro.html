		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One interesting reason is that the crystalline formations of minerals can be &quot;contagious&quot; - i.e, as a crystal starts forming, more and more oxylate gets &quot;locked&quot; into position and forms a bigger stone. When it finally breaks off, some might be left behind, serving as the &quot;seed&quot; for the next stone.</p>
<p>Since the conditions that gave rise to the first stone probably haven't changed, the second one is an inevitability.</p>
<p>Drink more water! That means more dilute urine and less free-floating calcium oxylate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There will be certain conditions that led to the original stones formation. So if those conditions continue, there will be a high probability of it resulting in more stones forming. If you want to stop further stones, you need to work out what was causing them and try to change things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Really depends on the cause of the stone. Contrary to popular belief there are many different types of kidney stones. For some it could be a malfunctioning endocrine system, for some it’s diet, for some processing of certain foods isn’t happening. There are even cases of people who take a certain antibiotic and consume certain food preservatives causes stone to form. The recurrence is dependent on the cause.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s a lot of misconception about what it means to “get” a kidney stone. Kidney stones often develop inside the kidney in units more than 1. While in the kidney, they are painless (there are no pain receptors <em>inside</em> the kidney). When the stone exits the kidney, it will cause LOTS of pain as it travels down the ureters and into the bladder. </p>
<p>It’s this extreme pain that leads to the initial diagnosis of kidney stones (they are sometimes detected inside the kidney incidentally, via a renal ultrasound or CT the patient got for some other reason). </p>
<p>Now that the doctor knows you passed 1 stone, there is a high likelihood that more of them already exist inside your kidney, and these will eventually also pass. Thus you have a <em>clinically</em> higher risk of having more kidney stones, after your first one. It is simply having the knowledge of the first stone that increases your risk of having more stones pass later on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So it seems that a lot of these answers are close, but not quite there. Let's say you develop a single kidney stone, pass it, and change your diet/lifestyle to try to prevent them from recurring. The underlying reason that you may develop more kidney stones is scar tissue. This scar tissue provides a prime location for new crystal growth. Since that's how kidney stones form and grow, it makes it more likely to reoccur because you have more available crystal growth sites for stone formation to start.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
