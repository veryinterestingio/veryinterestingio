		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Botanical dietary supplements, sometimes called herbals or herbal dietary supplements, and essential oils are products made from plants, plant parts, or plant extracts. One study found that natural products, including botanical dietary supplements, are used by approximately <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29211315" target="_blank">15% of adults</a> and are widely available in the United States. In fact, according to the <a href="http://cms.herbalgram.org/press/2019/2018HerbMarketReport.html" target="_blank">American Botanical Council</a>, Americans spent a total of $8.8 billion on botanical dietary supplements in 2018.</p>
<p>But, just because a product is from a plant source and sold in stores or online, doesntt mean it's safe. The safety of a botanical or essential oil depends on many things, such as its chemical makeup, how it works in the body, how it is prepared, and the dose used.</p>
<p>The amount of scientific evidence available for various botanical supplement ingredients varies widely, in part, because product safety is not tested by FDA and federal law does not require dietary supplements be tested for effectiveness before they are marketed.</p>
<p>Studying the potential effects of botanical dietary supplements has several unique challenges. For example, all botanical dietary supplements contain a complex mixture of ingredients, making it difficult to identify and link active ingredients to health effects. Growing, harvesting, and processing conditions can also affect the chemical makeup of a botanical supplement, leading to challenges in manufacturing identical products batch after batch. Possible contaminants - either accidental or intentional via adulteration - in botanical dietary supplements (e.g. heavy metals, microbes, undeclared ingredients, or pesticides) needs to be
determined as part of routine quality control since these can affect its safety.</p>
<p>Our hosts today are all experts on studying the quality, safety, and/or efficacy of botanical dietary supplements and essential oils to better understand how to use them more safely and effectively.</p>

In other words, do the health issues of essential oils come from using them instead of &quot;real&quot; medicine, or do they raise concerns in their own right?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some essential oils brands (I'm looking at you, doTerra) provide their marketing teams with &quot;recipes&quot; for various mixtures of oils to alleviate symptoms of various illnesses from gout to leukemia. This misleading marketing scheme could have dire circumstances for patients who discard traditional, evidence based approaches to treatment in favor of a &quot;natural&quot; treatment. How do you respond when patients or even acquaintances mention the use of essential oils for treatment of serious medical problems? And is there any work being done to legislate this misleading marketing out of existence that you are aware of?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
