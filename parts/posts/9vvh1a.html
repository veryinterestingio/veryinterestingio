		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It really started with the &quot;Ultraviolet Catastrophe&quot;: classical physics predicted that black bodies should emit light at all frequencies, with the intensity going up for higher-frequency light. However, around the ultraviolet range, the classical prediction broke down and didn't explain the black body spectra observed. Max Planck showed this could be explained by a quantized form of light - light energy being carried in individual &quot;packets&quot; of energy. Einstein would go on to propose the photon (although he did not give it its name) when he described the photoelectric effect, for which he won the Nobel Prize in Physics. In the photoelectric effect, light shines on a metal and electrons in that metal are ejected. Einstein noted that if photons were discrete particles, then the intensity of photons (number per area) should control the number of electrons being ejected, and the energy of the photons should determine if electrons are ejected at all. Specifically, if light below a certain frequency shines on a particular metal, no electrons would be ejected. These properties of the photoelectric effect were demonstrated and this was taken by the scientific community as proof that light must exist in discretized particles - the photon was discovered.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If you read the history of the photon section. It gives a great overview of the process. I would want to put it into my own words but im short on time. Hope it helps. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
