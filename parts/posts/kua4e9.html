Is it the material that it is reflecting off of, is it the fact that me holding it isn't stable enough to keep the light consistent, or is that a property of laser beams? Thanks!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like you are describing laser speckle, which is a result of what the laser reflects off of and not the laser source itself. Essentially, the laser beam interferes with itself upon reflection. The rough surface of the ceiling cause some parts to constructively interfere while others destructively interfere. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Speckle.  It is the same reason synthetic aperture radar images look grainy.  Since you are illuminating with a single wavelength of light, wavelength scale roughness of the surface can cause reflected light to interfere with itself, either constructively or destructively.  The process is deterministic, and for a should form a negative exponential intensity distribution assuming the surface fluctuations are evenly distributed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answers seem to miss a crucial point - I have not read all of the comments deep down, just skimmed, so I apologize if it's addressed - it's not just the laser light is monochromatic, but it's extremely <em>coherent</em>. Normal light is produced in a way that it's composed from a random waves that start at random moments. The laser light is emitted in way that it's basically <em>all</em> one synchronized wave, or at least this holds over much larger spatial and temporal scales than for other light. That's why it interferes with itself so efficiently - once it's reflected, it's all still synchronized, so  when it meets &quot;itself&quot;, it's at a phase shift given only by the difference in paths.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are describing laser speckle. It occurs basically because the light of the laser interferes with itself due to incoherence (Therefore you see brighter and darker spots). Also, the roughness of the surface you are shining the laser on plays a role. This video explains it in detail: </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you project a laser onto a moving surface, the speckles  move. If you're focus is farsighted, they move in one direction, if you're nearsighted they reverse direction.</p>
<p>Refraction (eyeglass prescriptions) can be determined very precisely this way but you have to identify and correct the major astigmatism meridians independently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
