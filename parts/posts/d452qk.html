		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The current produced would have to be strong enough to overcome our neuron's threshold for activation. All neurons have a base level of electric activity called a resting  membrane potential, which is about -70 millivolts (mV). In order to cause that neuron to send an electrical impulse we must depolarize that same neuron to about -55 mV. This can either be done internally, with the release or intake of various electrically charged ions in and out of the neuron, or externally by inducing a current strong enough to penetrate the skull, depolarize the neuron, and be focused to be specific enough to hit just one neuron or a cluster of geographically associated neurons. This can be achieved with very strong and local electromagnetic transducers, such as with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Although an MRI produces a powerful electromagnetic field, the current it produces in the human body is not typically enough (strong enough, specific enough, or possibly even at the correct angle enough) to cause specific or generalized depolarization of the neurons resulting in activation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electrical current doesn’t flow through nerves like it does in wires, where a magnetic field <em>would</em> induce a current. Instead, it’s an active process involving the movement of ions across the cell membrane that occurs in a moving gradient down the length of the nerve, which a magnetic field does not affect in the same way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>MRI scientist here, the magnetic flux can cause muscle twitching or discomfort/pain called peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS). This is not an effect of the main magnetic field (called B0) but rather the gradient coils, which are electromagnets that are rapidly switched in order to perform image encoding. The dB/dt of standard clinical gradients maxes around 20 Gauss per cm per millisecond, but PNS typically occurs around 15/17. The challenge is then when we need high gradient amplitude, we're limited by dB/dt (slew rate).</p>
<p>An interesting project out of GE right now is something called the MAGNUS coil which essentially confines the extent of the gradient fields to your head, so you can slew much faster than a whole body system. Since your head doesn't contain as many large muscle or nerve groups, much higher slew rates and amplitudes can be used. This is useful for things like diffusion imaging.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>>  The move from 3T to 7 T presented some challenges. Biological side effects, although temporary, are more pronounced: people can experience dizziness and vertigo when they move in and out of the scanner, researchers say. When people move inside the machine, they can sometimes taste metal, see white flashes or experience involuntary eye movements called nystagmus. </p>
<p>Imagine what an 11.7 Tesla machine would do to you.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People seem to be forgetting that voltage potentials are only created by movement through a magnetic field (or movement of a magnetic field through a material) Even as strong as the magnet is in a MRI is (1.5T), it's a static field. The only time voltage potentials that could effect nerves is when moving into or out of the MRI machine. Given the slow movement into and out of the field, the potentials remain pretty negilable. </p>
<p>Magnetic pulses can be used to stimulate the brain. It uses a magnetic field with a strength comparable to an MRI, but it delivers it as a pulse (effectively moving the magnetic field very quickly through the parts of the body (brain) directly under the coils). You can read more about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
