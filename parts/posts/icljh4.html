		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ahhhh finally my time to shine.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I actually sell fuel level sensors to the major OEMS.</p>
<p>The 3 main sensing technologies are ultrasonic (super super accurate), Float + reed switch (most commonly used), and capacitive .</p>
<p>For your question regarding sloshing - software is used to filter the rapidly changing signal (due to sloshing). Its able to smooth out the output and give you a good idea of the real level.</p>
<p>Float and reed switch is essentially a float with a magnet it in that rides up and down a vertical shaft with the fuel level. As the magnet in the float passes reed switches at various levels on the vertical shaft, they become triggered.</p>
<p>Edit as requested: A float and reed switch assembly is essentially foam donut with a magnet inside of it. That foam donut rides up and down on a vertical shaft inside the tank as the fluid level rises and falls. Inside the vertical shaft is a switch technology called reed switches. These reed switches either make or break an electrical connection - they are actuated magnetically by the float as it passes by. Hope that helps clear it up for those still confused.</p>
<p>Edit: a word.</p>
<p>To be clear, this is ONE form of technology. There is also a Resistive sensor that functions like the float switch in the back of your toilet - as float rises, it rotates a sensor that changes the resistance value.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>Last edit: Suppose I should take the moment to shamelessly plug my company. If there are any engineers out there looking for a liquid level sensor (doesnt have to be automotive), let a brotha know. Happy to connect via LinkedIn and set up a conference call. Already had one awesome redditor reach out. Next time my boss gives me crap about cruising reddit.......</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>One more edit: Common question - how does ultrasonics work?</p>
<p>Ultrasonic operating principal is all based on TOF (Time of flight). Ultrasonics generate a sound wave (by hitting a ceramic disc with a crap ton of voltage causing it to vibrate). Sound wave bounce off the surface of the fuel and returns to sensor face. As Speed of Sound (SoS) is a fixed value, you can tell how far away the fuel is (level) based on how long the sound wave took to get back to the sensor.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Last edit, PROMISE: As many have pointed out, float on a swing arm + resistive (like a potentiometer) is the dominant solution in the passenger car world - Ive worked most recently with on-road tractors (semi-trucks) which use much larger fuel tanks that would destroy the little mechanical float arm. This is why they use reed switchs + float vs what on-road cars use.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This float is the reason why when we fill the tank all the way it seems like it gets better gas mileage in the first half of the tank than the bottom half. At full it takes longer for the float to start going down because it’s fully submerged in gasoline and it won’t move until it you have used enough gas for the float to “float”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a little ball that floats in there. This is attached to an electrical component whose resistance changes depending on the height of the ball. By passing a current through that electrical component, the car can tell how high up the ball is and thus how full the fuel gauge is. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You'd need to be doing some absolution crazy flips for it to register meaningfully on the fuel gauge, though parking on a steep hill can still give you an incorrect reading as the angle of the tank causes the ball to appear higher or lower, depending on which way you're pointing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to the others, there are also little walls inside your fuel tank called baffles. They sort of make a little maze inside the fuel tank, which reduces sloshing. It's not a complicated passage way or anything. Usually just a big X in the middle of the tank, or sometimes a snake pattern back and forth, from to back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In modern cars, the fuel level sensor looks like a variation of <a href="https://images.carid.com/standard/items/k07017.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>. The white part attaches to the same housing that holds your fuel pump, and the black part floats.</p>
<p>The float moving up and down changes the electrical resistance, telling the computer how much fuel there is.</p>
<p>The computer isn’t constantly looking at the sensor. It does so when the key is turned on, and then every few seconds. If it gets several readings saying the fuel level is going down, it moves the needle down...if it gets a few down readings with some up readings mixed in, it ignores the whole batch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
