		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When England was ruled by the Normans, their version of French was the language of nobles and (what would become) English was the language of the commoners. </p>
<p>Thus, noble things (like eating a fine meal) have Norman French names, and peasant things (like farming) have English names. </p>
<p>Mutton (sheep meat) comes from the Norman word for “sheep.” Beef comes from the Norman word for “cow.” And so on. </p>
<p>This extends to lots more vocabulary, too, like the Norman word for “house” comes to mean “rich man’s house” (mansion).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have pointed out, after the Norman Inavsion of 1066, the nobles and land owners from Normandy spoke a different language than the local Saxon peasants.</p>
<p>So the cooks would describe to their masters (and guests) the meat dishes using the Norman names for the animals - words we today know as &quot;beef&quot;, &quot;pork&quot;, and &quot;mutton&quot;.  In the local marketplaces, the cooks would discuss the animals with farmers and butchers using the Saxon names for the animals - words we today know as &quot;cow&quot;, &quot;pig&quot;, and &quot;sheep&quot;.  Over time, the language as a whole retained the Saxon names to refer to the animals and gained the Norman names to refer to the meats from those animals prepared as food.</p>
<p>Why didn't this happen for chicken and fish?  The nobles considered those to be peasant foods and didn't eat them.  (Or so said the TV show where I learned the above)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because France. As the commenter before me mentioned, William the Conquerer, the first real king of England, hailed from a region called Normandy. Although not French, this region spoke a language that would eventually evolve into French. When old Will invaded England, he brought over his Norman buddies and made them all nobles. In the feudal system of the middle ages, nobles didn't do the farming, they just did the eating. As far as they were concerned, beef starts and ends its life as a slab of meat. Meanwhile, the Saxons - the peasant classes - were much closer to the animal part of the eating process, and also ate these meats less often too. The language spoken by the nobles and that of the peasants would remain pretty separate for a long time, but societal shifts towards the end of the feudal system saw peasants having the wealth to begin paying attention to what the upper classes were doing. Peasants <em>love</em> to emulate rich people (you need only look at how people today adore the Kardashians to see this), and among the many pieces of nobility that made its way to the peasants was having different words for the animal and the meat that comes from it. This same trickle-down culture is also the reason why upper class etiquette in Europe is quite so pompous and silly - because the peasants kept copying the rich people, and the rich people didn't like that so they kept making up more and more ridiculous rules to help differentiate themselves from the poor people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great question! I have a follow on question relating to this:</p>
<p>Why is it &quot;William the Conqueror&quot; in English, and &quot;Guillaume&quot; in French?</p>
<p>You'd think that his name would have been 'basterdized' like the Norman words that found their way into English vocabulary wouldn't you? So then why William and not something like Gwee-yome? </p>
<p>I've tried to read up on it but all I get is that both names come from the German &quot;Wilhelm&quot;. That's fine, and it makes sense, but I just don't understand how both names are pronounced so differently then, unless already at the time people understood it was different pronunciations of the same name?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
