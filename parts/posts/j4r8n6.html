		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>they <em>are</em> freaking out! lol there are certain ants who are the designated builders/workers in the colony and their job is to rebuild the tunnels and structure of the anthill. they immediately begin to fix whatever was disturbed. also, they seem to go crazy because suddenly they are exposed from their little hidden pathways. it might seem like chaos but every ant has a job :)</p>
<p>edit: i would assume some of the ants are prepared to bite and ward off predators too</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
