In this scenario does the penis move the intestines around, or does the penis “bend” through the intestines? Or is it different entirely?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your rectum is actually about the same size as your average penis and goes straight up into your abdomen.  If someone is getting rammed by a particularly large cock the rectum can stretch a bit to accommodate that.</p>
<p>There are limitations as to how far it can stretch, but having anal sex regularly will naturally stretch it out.  Alternatively, if you know that you're going to be taking a particularly large cock then you can increase that by stretching it with progressively larger dildos or penises over a few months.  </p>
<p>Assuming that the dude in your video had a 9 inch cock or something, then either the girl's anus is just naturally stretched out from a long anal sex porn career or she spent the weeks before the porn shoot deliberately stretching her rectum.  </p>
<p>While I don't know about the particular video you're talking about, typically when people are taking really large cocks up their ass you can see an impression of the cock in the person's stomach, which is the result of the rectum stretching and causing the intestines to move around it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is basically a right corner in the intestine just above the rectum. It generally straightens out a bit over time if you put things up there. If you can get past it you can fit pretty huge things up there, something like 18 inches for most people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a lot of good answers here. Surgeon here.</p>
<p>During anal sex, the penis goes through the anal canal/sphincter complex and into the rectum. The average length of the rectum is about 15 cm or about 6 inches or so. Past that is the sigmoid colon.</p>
<p>The anal canal and sphincter complex can stretch pretty impressively, but stretch it too much and it doesn't work all that well anymore. The rectum is pretty fixed in size and shape due to anatomy and attachments to surrounding structures in the pelvis. It can balloon up for sure but not lengthen. The sigmoid colon has relatively loose attachments in the abdominal cavity and can move around. The junction between the rectum and the sigmoid colon is where a lot of people have a sharp turn, right where your sacrum is. This is the most common area that rectal foreign bodies get stuck and where we have to go and fish stuff out. Some people have a sharp turn and others are pretty straight.</p>
<p>ELI5: The intestines straighten out like moving a relatively firm hotdog through a curvy slightly moveable slinky.</p>
<p>PSA: If anyone is planning on sticking up your rectum, make sure it has a flared based or you might need my services to get it out. Strings and leashes fall off. Also, make sure whatever you put up there can't come apart, or it will and leave a soldier behind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The rectum leads to the sigmoid colon, which is definitely not a straight shot (‘S’ shaped). The penis never enters the ‘stomach, unless it is 30’ long. The rectum stretches to accept the penis. The sigmoid colon, and descending colon move in the abdomen to meet the rigidity of the penis. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
