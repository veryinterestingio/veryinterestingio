Say for example they locate a really good area rich in food and other mates. After transformation is it possible for then to remember that location? Or are they completely born new and fresh and rely on instinct alone?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not an answer to the question. But monarchs migrate both north and south when the seasons change. They travel upto 3000 miles, but it takes 3 to 4 generations to compete the trip. Somehow the generations in the middle of the migration know they need to continue thier journey. So there's at least some communication there telling them to continue and where to stop.</p>
