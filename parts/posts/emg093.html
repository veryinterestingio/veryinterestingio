		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work with aircraft telemetry. On a test aircraft, we telemeter only a small portion of the parameters we record, because there isn't enough bandwidth to send everything in real time. It's probably not feasible to live stream all the parameters a black box records, and its easier to just make them really hard to destroy and recover the data later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In some cases, data is already streamed live. For example, some aircraft engines stream data to the engine manufacturer during flight, so the manufacturer sometimes knows about potential problems before the flight crew do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A black box is two data recorders, one that's recording real-time information about plane and one that's recording voice. </p>
<p>The information is useful after a crash, or after a near miss/emergency, but it's not particularly useful any other time. </p>
<p>It's hard to estimate how many planes fly a day, but based on FAA information on <a href="https://faa.gov" target="_blank">faa.gov</a>, just the US FAA handles: 16,100,000 flights a year (including international flights that enter FAA areas). That's 44,000+ daily flights. There are 5000 planes in the sky at any time at peak travel just in the US alone. </p>
<p>In 2019 there were 14 fatal crashes <em>globally.</em> </p>
<p>The amount of real-time data streaming you'd need to track even just the domestic commercial flights, plus cargo flights would be staggering. Streaming telemetry and voice from the entirety of a flight's transit would require massive amounts of data, storage and processing. And it's only needed those 14 times a year. </p>
<p>There are limited ways to transmit data from a plane, you've got terrestrial and satellite. Terrestrial wouldn't work, there are too many hops between towers. Satellite would be available, but someone would have to put the satellites up just to record flight data. If you've ever seen how crappy in-flight WiFi is, imagine how bad having to move the data from 16 million flights would be. </p>
<p>You couldn't rely on that transmission either, because it's another system to go down, satellites lose communication etc. </p>
<p>The flight data recorders and cockpit voice recoders are designed to survive 3400Gs and temperatures exceeding 1000º C (1830º F). </p>
<p>The NTSB has proposed cockpit image recorders as well, because control panels are now electronic—when a plane crashed with an analog gauge it usually stayed on the last position at impact. LCD screens just break.   </p>
<p>(A good overview is here <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_recorder" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight\_recorder" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight\_recorder</a></a>)</p>
<p>In 2014 after the Malaysia flight vanished, there were pushes to make planes transmit their data or to eject from planes before crashes. </p>
<p>House Rep David Price called for black boxes that would eject after Malaysia Flight 370 vanished. </p>
<p>&quot;But he said the 9/11 Commission recommended after the terrorist hijackings in 2001 that planes carry ejectable &quot;black boxes&quot; to make them easier to find. Navy planes have carried them for years, and Transportation Security Administration was given $3.5 million in 2008 to study and test the proposal.&quot;</p>
<p>Which is good except, it's not moving along very well. The same article from that quote points out that F/A 18 Navy jets have black boxes that eject on impact detection, or when the ejection seat is triggered, and they float at well. </p>
<p>In many cases, you don't need a FDR and CVR to figure out what happened, though of course they're always helpful as they show you exactly how the crew and the plane reacted. In the 14 2019 incidents, one was an attempted hijacking . There was no crash, the hijacker was killed, so that's considered a flight-based fatality for some reason. Three were planes that overshot the runways. The reason for those crashes is almost always pilot error. </p>
<p>There was one bird strike (cause of crash, birds), one was a collision between two planes (cause of crash, collision), one plane hit the runway twice, banked, and hit a building. Passengers who evacuated via the wing-exits slipped on ice on the wing. (cause of crash, ice). One had a plane flying through thunderstorms.</p>
<p>In a few of them the cause of the crash was determined via FDR or CVR, and several were crew error. </p>
<p>So to answer your question, there haven't been a lot of researchers thrown at this because it's a problem that would cost an astronomical amount to implement and would only matter in those cases where the black boxes were not retrievable anyhow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are now satellites which receive ADS-B data over oceanic and other sparsely populated areas. Each aircraft transmits location and various flight parameters every few seconds. In the United States, the FAA made ADS-B transmitters a requirement for all aircraft in most U.S. airspace on January 1st, 2020. FlightAware has ADS-B satellite data, but currently charges a fee for access to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
