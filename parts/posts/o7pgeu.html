		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know there has been some research done around unintended name discrimination, especially in hiring practices, but I was wondering if there is any data on more general familiarity bias?</p>
<p>A recent example that made me think of this - I'm in sales and I've been having kind of a stressful morning, feeling a little cranky. You know how it is. I had a customer I'm not familiar with reach out and ask me for free accessory product with their purchase. This is at my discretion since I manage my own P/L - this particular customer had a name very similar to a close friend of mine who I'm looking forward to seeing this weekend and recalling that made me feel a little happier. I immediately approved the request. I'm not 100% sure I would have done that if they had a name I didn't feel connected to.</p>
<p>So is there a measurable amount of favoritism that people give to strangers who have names similar to those they are close with. In contrast, could there be negative bias? If you hate your boss and then meet a friend of a friend with a similar name, are you more likely to have a negative first impression? How could you even measure this? </p>
<p>Thanks, looking forward to the discussion!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Names can be pretty important for making decisions about people you have minimal information about. People prefer strangers with <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103111002927" target="_blank">easy-to-pronounce names</a>. Names which indicate <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2605853" target="_blank">racial identity</a> are triggers for discrimination. Someone who has a more <a href="https://myscp.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327663jcp1502_3" target="_blank">similar name to yours</a> is perceived as more similar and likeable; same with <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0079039" target="_blank">sharing initials</a>. Names of close friends and romantic partners also <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02699930126251" target="_blank">prime you to feel more positive</a>.</p>
<p>Whether all of that is due to <em>just</em> familiarity of the name or other factors is still an open question, and it gets complicated pretty quickly depending on the specifics of the scenario.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
