<p>Wikipedia says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most major moons in the Solar System, the gravitationally rounded satellites, are tidally locked with their primaries, because they orbit very closely and tidal force increases rapidly (as a cubic function) with decreasing distance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I don't honestly have any idea what any of this means.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tides are a small bulge induced by gravity differences when two astronomical bodies interact. You can see that with the sea, but it also works on rocks. It is less noticeable, but has been detected on earth (most notably with the large hadron collider).</p>
<p>When the smaller body is not tidally locked with the larger one, the bulge is not always in the same place (as are our sea tides). The rotation of those moons induce a small shift on where the bulge is compared to where it would be if the moon was tidally locked (as much as sea takes time to go up and down, so do the rocks). Gravity pulls on the misaligned bulge, acting as a break on the small body's rotation until it is in step with its rotation around the bigger one.</p>
<p>The closer you are to the bigger body, the stronger its influence on the smaller one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>

<p>This is an important keyword here. The big moons tend to be tidally locked. They formed with the planet and close to it, they experience large tidal forces if they are not locked which makes them tidally locked over time. But most moons are small and in distant and irregular orbits around the gas or ice giants, these are not tidally locked.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of the other comments are close, but dancing around what actually causes the rotation to slow. To change the rate of rotation there must be a net torque (moment if you're an engineer) acting on the object. A torque occurs whenever a force is exerted at some distance from the axis of rotation with the force directed not exactly toward or away from the axis. </p>
<p>So how do we get a torque from gravity? First of all, gravity exerts a stronger force on the near side of the moon than the far side, because it's closer to the planet and gravity decreases with distance. This difference in force, as others have said, is known as a tidal force and it stretches the moon into a bit of a bulged shape, known as an ellipsoid, sort of like an egg.</p>
<p>However, because the egg shaped moon is rotating and it takes time for this deformation of the moon to move around the moon as it rotates, the result is that the long axis of the ellipsoid doesn't point directly at the planet, but ends up rotated slightly ahead of a line pointing directly at the planet.   </p>
<p>Now, the moon is rotating about its center of mass, which is in the geometric center of the moon. However, the net effect of gravity is exerted, not at the center of mass, but at the center of gravity, which is the average lcoation of all the gravitational pulls on all the bits of mass that make up the moon. On earth, where the gravitational field is basically constant, your center of mass and center of gravity are pretty much in the same place, but remember gravity is stronger on the near side of the moon than the far side, because the moon is much larger than you. This means that the center of gravity of the moon is moved from the geometric center a bit closer to earth along the long axis o fthe ellipsoid. Which means that the net pull of gravity is at this point, which is in a different location than the axis the moon rotates around as it runs through the center of mass. </p>
<p>So we have met the first condition for a torque, in that the net force isn't at the axis of rotation. And since there is the time delay for the bulge to move around, making the long axis of our ellipsoid/egg-shaped moon not directly aligned toward the planet, that means that net gravitational pull isn't quite directed out from the geometric center of the moon either. Thus we have also met the second condition for torque, creating a torque caused by gravity that acts to slow the moon's rate of rotation.</p>
