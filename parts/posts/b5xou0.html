		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm thinking in terms of people who grew up with not a lot of food. As adults when they eat they might tend to scarf it down or hoard it for later. Even though they have plenty to eat now, they are still psychologically effected from not having much when they were growing up. Would behaviorisms like that occur from sleep deprivation?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is (1) the science is still out on this, but mostly because (2) sleep deprivation during adolescence is linked to a number of other consequences that are much more influential on sleep such as depression and obesity. Adding in other factors including genetics and physique which determine how much sleep you need, it's difficult to control for a purely behavioral study such as the one you're describing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
