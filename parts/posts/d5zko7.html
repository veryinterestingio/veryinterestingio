		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to vastly oversimplify how it works, but: </p>
<p>Me: shows up to therapy as a simmering cauldron of low self-esteem and negative self-talk</p>
<p>Therapist: gets me to talk about these things </p>
<p>Therapist: helps me explore where these things probably came from (i.e., formative years with fucked-up parents)</p>
<p>Therapist: validates that things were severely fucked-up; provides thoughts on how it could have been handled better (if you really trust and respect your shrink, this voice will eventually replace the shitty-parent voice in your head)</p>
<p>Me: continues week-by-week to report new stimulus from my life and how I am handling these things </p>
<p>Therapist: understands current course of action based on deep understanding of my past, continues to validate current feelings, but also suggests different ways to handle and interpret these things going forward </p>
<p>Me: very slowly learns a different way of thinking about life and about myself, and of handling the things the world throws at me</p>
<p>I really believe in therapy as a long-term iterative process.  It doesn't happen in a weekend workshop; you have to keep experiencing the world and give your brain the chance to assimilate the possibility of doing things differently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The psychiatry/psychology distinction is taken care of, so I’ll weigh in on therapy a little bit. Counselors typically have less formal training than psychologists, who carry doctoral degrees, but I’m not aware of conclusive research to suggest that one is necessarily always a better therapist than the other. </p>
<p>The most important aspect of therapy is feeling that you have a strong fit with your therapist. This person needs to understand you and see the big picture of your life. You may not find this fit with your first therapist, but I encourage you to give it a few sessions to figure that out. It’s also completely normal not to be able to explain why the fit is or isn’t there. A lot of that stuff is beyond words. Once you find a good fit, you can focus on what is of secondary importance, which is the type of therapy you do with the therapist. One type of therapy that I like a lot is called Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). You can look up “The happiness trap” on YouTube for some short videos that explain some of the core concepts. Again, therapy type (ACT or whatever else) is secondary to fit. Feel free to message me for more info or resources.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of misinformation in this thread. Clinical psychologist here. Sometimes these terms depend on state and date of license issuance, but generally:</p>
<p>A therapist is someone who does therapy, this can be done by individuals with masters or doctorates. It is a catch all term.</p>
<p>Psychologist is a legal term for someone with a doctoral degree in psychology. This could be in a research field (ex cognitive psychologist) or a clinical field (ex clinical psychologist, neuropsychologist).</p>
<p>Psychiatrist is an individual who went to medical school and then chose to specialize in psychiatry, a blend of medicine and therapeutic skills. Some psychiatrist do therapy, some do more therapy (edit: provide medication), many do both. </p>
<p>A general difference between psychologists and psychiatrists is that psychiatrists can prescribe medication and deliver psychotherapy. Clinical psychologists can do psychological testing (IQ, personality, etc) and deliver psychotherapy.</p>
<p>Counseling and therapy are essentially synonymous, though sometimes counseling is used to refer to therapy for individuals without a severe mental health diagnosis. </p>
<p>One way to find a psychologist is to call your insurance and ask them to recommend providers in network to you. You can also use a resource like Psychologytoday.com to search in your area. You can also just google the above terms in google maps. </p>
<p>Very briefly, therapy/counseling works by using psychological principles like insight, behavior, and relationships in order to help a person change both their intrapsychic and interpsychic behavior.</p>
<p>There are exceptions to the above, and obviously a lot more detail. Please feel free to ask more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What each role does is answered elsewhere in the thread. The best way to get a mental health professional is to ask your general practitioner for a referral to either a psychiatrist or a therapist, whichever you feel you need more. They can help you find someone in-network and get in to see them within a month or two, instead of having to search for one who’s accepting new patients. If you don’t like them you can say you don’t think they’re a good fit for your needs and a good one will give you a referral to a different one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not really an answer to the question, but Thank You.</p>
<p>I’m struggling right now, both with the idea of going to a therapist and finding one (why does it have to be so difficult??). This thread has been very informative, helpful, and terribly coincidental!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
