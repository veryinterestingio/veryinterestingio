		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know how to properly phrase this question so bare with me.</p>
<p>In an exercise about problem solving techniques this question arose.</p>
<p>Is the number of current human beings alive higher or lower than the total number of humans that have died since the human race exist (or some early point in history)? It's hard to define the boundaries but let's say we base our case in registered or estimated child mortality, perhaps?</p>
<p>Of course it's a highly speculative question but id love to know if someone approached this matter before, and how.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you define the current species as having emerged 50,000 years ago, then there have been about 100 billion people who have been born.
Since there are 7-8 billion people alive now, that means that there are about 8% of all people who have ever lived are alive now. Which quite frankly is a huge proportion.</p>
<p>This data doesnt count stillbirths. Only live births.

<ol>
<li>
<p>How far back do.we.have to go to have had 7-8bn people alive (that are dead now)?</p>
</li>
<li>If we express lives in number of years lived, noting lives 50,000 teras ago were much shorter than our expected lives now, how does the 8% (given in the current top response) compare?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, there are a range of different estimates, but all the well researched ones come to 'more have died already than are alive right now'. Even ones based on biblical time frames instead of scientifically determined timelines come to similar conclusions. The other poster gives 100 billion, but estimates range +/-50ish billion from there, I believe the religious based ones are around 36 billion iirc from last time i looked this up a month or so ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
