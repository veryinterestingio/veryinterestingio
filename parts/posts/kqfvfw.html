<p>Is each engine just a different form of coding software akin to using Microsoft Word vs. Libre Office? </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Engines are essentially kits of tools that can be used to create a video game that include pre-programmed elements such as the coding required to mimic real world physics, water flow, reflections as well as technical computing (crunching the numbers to determine how the game reacts to the player) and integrating the software to the physical computer hardware. </p>
<p>A meatspace example would be Lego vs. K'nex vs. Lincoln logs. Each tool has it's abilities and limitations that set it apart from the others, some are cheaper, some are easier to use, some are more robust with integration to aftermarket/3rd party toys. In any case, assuming the target market is an 8 year old wanting to build a castle, it's invariably cheaper, faster, and easier to buy one of the above toys than to buy a mill and plastic extruder to create my own toys from scratch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Imagine you want to create a  Jump ’n’ Run game. So your character probably needs to fall downwards. But programs have no idea what &quot;down&quot; really is. So you can start telling the game every second the character should accelerate in the direction of the bottom with roughly 10 m/s for simplification. Now you would have to somehow implement what is a meter and what is a second? All this can get pretty complex real quick. Game engines are developed to ease that workload. Someone else was probably a bit smarter on how to implement gravity into a game in a way that it is convincing. So in a game engine you just use that part.</p>
<p>Different engines now have different specialties. Some have some awesome implementations to create beautiful 3D animations. Others are great for 2D games and others maybe have figured out some great code to get just a little bit more FPS for competitive games. There is no one engine to rule them all, you would choose the one best for your game.</p>
<p>Some are coming with IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) helping you to create the code needed to work with their engine. Others even create their own programming languages. Many studios will also create their own engine optimized for their type of game.</p>
<p>EDIT: typo</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think of it like this. They're a toolbox. Different handy men will have different things in their toolbox. A plumber's toolbox will have different tools than an electrician, or roofer.</p>
<p>Rather than hammers and knives, and screwdrivers, game engines have different game features: multiple save slots, third person vs first person camera, swordplay mechanics, gunplay mechanics, rpg elements, physics, stuff like that.</p>
<p>The engine does dictate what kind of stuff is in the game, but it also not really. You can do a lot of things with a hammer. You could build a birdhouse, a doghouse, even frame an entire building (tho a nailgun would be far more efficient), but without the hammer you can't build any of those. Same thing here, the game engine doesn't necessarily limit what you can build, because you can build a lot of different things with those tools.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A long time ago when video games were just starting out it was pretty common to have to write the entire code from scratch for every game. Most games need to have code that helps draw everything you see, figure out if things in the game are touching, keep track of time, manage levels and enemies, etc. In other words, a lot of games all have code that does the same thing. </p>
<p>After awhile programmers figured out it was easier to have a basic set of code that they could reuse over and over to make a bunch of different games out of. That reusable code is what we call a gaming engine today. It's basically a set of reusable code that can power almost any type of game you can think of. Some engines are better suited to making 2D games, some are better for 3D first person games, some are better at mobile, so while there are clearly differences between engines the idea is basically the same: the most basic building blocks that are commonly needed for making a certain type of game are included in the engine and then developers build the actual game on top of that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<li>Think of it like a literal engine.</li>
<li>You can put the same engine in different cars.</li>
<li>One car might have heated leather seats and a moon-roof.</li>
<li>Another car might...not.</li>
<li>But the engine works the same regardless of what car it's in.</li>
<li>You feed it fuel and air, and it spits out toxic smoke and motion. </li>
<li>Game engines do the same, you can change all the details about how the characters look and sound like, the visuals that make up the world they exist in, but the engine still does the work of taking the player's input and doing the math to figure out how the game reacts to that input.</li>
