		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Falcon Heavy (and Falcon 9) launch from Florida towards the east, flying over the Atlantic. This isn't a particularly busy part of the airspace, so the impact is limited. But even so, for launches like this, aviation authorities (the FAA in this case) clear a section of the airspace for some time, requiring airlines to fly around the section that is restricted.</p>
<p>In the case of SpaceX launches, the restricted airspace is a thin, but long slice that starts at the launch site and extends far into the Atlantic Ocean. This restriction primarily affects flights from the US east coast towards the Caribbean and vice versa.</p>
<p>Right now, the combination of low frequency of launches and launch sites that are away from busy airspace means that the impact on air travel is quite small. However, in a future where rocket launches become more frequent and with additional launch sites closer to population centers (for example for space tourism), the impact may increase.</p>
<p>See also this <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/business/spacex-falcon-heavy-launch-faa-air-traffic" target="_blank">Washington Post article</a> for more on the impact of the Falcon Heavy launch (last year) and rocket launches in general on air travel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there's an exclusion zone. This will be published in a NOTAM - Notice To Airmen. Pilots are expected to be aware of relevant NOTAMs before they fly. Should a pilot enter the exclusion zone, the launch will be delayed or cancelled (&quot;scrubbed&quot;). Though once the rocket is in flight, not much can be done. Similar applies at sea, for safety in case the rocket fails and crashes into the ocean.</p>
<p>In 2014 an Antares rocket launch was scrubbed due to a boat in the exclusion zone, and the rocket failed during the next launch attempt the day after. In 2017 another Antares launch was scrubbed, 90 seconds before liftoff, due to an aircraft.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Florida pilot here. Any time there is a launch a TFR (temporary flight restriction) is issued, normally a few days in advance, over an airspace for a specific block of time. These TFRs rarely, if ever, impact travel or even recreational flights since they are relatively small and getting vectored around them would only add 10-15 minutes to an overall flight time. TFRs are issued for all sorts of things: large sporting events, VIPs flying into an area or in this case, rocket launches.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a model rocket enthusiast. If I want to launch a model rocket that weighs more than 0.5 KG at take off, I have to contact the nearest air traffic control / airport and ask for a launch window. My rockets only go up a KM at best. There are clubs that have models that go up several miles. By law, you have to be in contact with local air traffic control.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had a payload on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_CRS-5" target="_blank">CRS-5</a>, so I got to see how a little bit of how this works. Launches from Florida's Space Coast are coordinated between NASA, which operates Kennedy Space Center, and the Air Force, which operates Cape Canaveral, the launch operator (SpaceX in this case), the Coast Guard, the FAA, NOAA and local agencies (I may be forgetting a few). During the launch, all of these entities are constantly in contact with each other using a couple of different nets. A &quot;net&quot; is what radio operators call a radio channel being used in a coordinated way by several people, though they're not necessarily *literal* radio channels. Think of them like a party line or a conference call with a bunch of very specific rules of etiquette.</p>
<p>When you watch a launch on NASA TV or one of the SpaceX webcasts, the chatter you are hearing is one of these nets. In the broadcasts meant for the public, they usually don't patch in the nets that include that USCG, FAA, or USAF, so you usually only hear from the Range Safety Officer indirectly.</p>
<p>During both our first launch attempt which got scrubbed due to a mechanical issue and the second (successful) attempt, a couple of small boats and planes came pretty close to the restricted area. Not close enough to cause an incident, but close enough that their presence was mentioned on the nets we could hear from inside the launch center.</p>
<p>Temporary restricted areas are commonplace in aviation and maritime navigation, and a large component of the training and licensing for pilots and skippers is about identifying, classifying and respecting these restrictions. If you are mostly familiar with driving a car, it's a very weird idea. Legally speaking, the ocean and sky are covered with the equivalent of stop signs and traffic lights, but they aren't <em>physically</em> there. It's your responsibility as a pilot or skipper to look up (or ask) where they are and what they mean, and to obey them.</p>
<p>It sounds like it shouldn't work. Who would obey an imaginary traffic light? If you ignore an imaginary traffic light floating in the middle of the sky thousands of miles from anyone, who would even know? However, consider that if you are in a boat or an airplane, you are being constantly tracked by radar and satellite, often by multiple countries at once. The traffic light might be imaginary, but the traffic <em>cops</em> are absolutely real, and they watch every very boat and aircraft carefully, and they will <em>definitely</em> get in your face if you don't obey the imaginary traffic light.</p>
<p>Personally, I think modern international aviation and maritime navigation is one of the most beautiful things human beings have ever done. Every day, hundreds of thousands of vehicles zip around between nations representing every culture, language, religion and history. That includes every conflict, every war, every ugly thing that happens among nations. It's the sum total of all humanity. Our whole planet. Intuitively, I would expect chaos. Instead, international navigation is orderly and <em>astonishingly</em> safe, and the only thing that keeps it that way is politeness and compassion. It is an elaborate, highly technical sort of politeness and a very legalistic sort of compassion, but that is what it is. Individual nations control their individual zones, but nobody is in charge of the whole system. Pretty much every nation on earth negotiated and <em>agreed</em> to a detailed and surprisingly egalitarian set of rules for how to safely fly and sail to and from literally anywhere on the surface of our planet, and it <em>freaking works</em>.</p>
<p>If you think humanity is doomed to conflict forever, here is irrefutable proof that it doesn't have to be that way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
