		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A hydrogen bomb works by having at least two &quot;stages.&quot; The first, the &quot;primary&quot; stage, is basically the same kind of &quot;atomic&quot; bomb dropped on Nagasaki: a fission bomb that works by splitting a <em>fissile</em> isotope (like U-235 or Pu-239) and releasing a bunch of energy. Fissile isotopes are defined as isotopes that can sustain a nuclear chain reaction, and in practice that means that they are heavy atoms that can be easily split by neutrons of basically any energy level, including the same energy level as those that are produced by fission reactions. This is a tricky but core concept here: splitting U-235 or Pu-239 produces neutrons, and the same neutrons that are produced can split other atoms of U-235 and Pu-239, hence they can create self-sustaining reactions.</p>
<p>The &quot;secondary&quot; stage in a hydrogen bomb takes the energy from the primary stage and uses it to compress and then heat a bunch of light atoms, the fusion fuel. The fusion fuel is usually lithium-deuteride, which undergoes reactions that turn it into isotopes of hydrogen that get fused together. This releases a <em>lot</em> of energy. The tamper is the part of the secondary that helps squeeze the hydrogen atoms — it's something heavy that can be pushed, and will stay pushed for a few nanoseconds even when the fusion reactions start pushing back on the other direction. So for a design like the Tsar Bomba, you need a heavy tamper no matter what.</p>
<p>Hydrogen fusion reactions release neutrons that are 10X more energetic than the ones released by fission reactions. Remember how I said that U-235 and Pu-239 were fissile, because they could be split by neutrons of basically any energy level? Well, there are some isotopes that are <em>fissionable</em> but not <em>fissile</em>: they can be split by neutrons of certain energy levels, but they can't sustain a self-sustaining reaction because the energy levels of neutrons they need are higher than those that are released by their own splitting. U-238, for example, will split from high-energy neutrons, but not the lower-energy neutrons that come from fission. So if you had, say, a source of a massive number of neutrons that were, say, 10X the power of fission neutrons, you could split a LOT of U-238 atoms. </p>
<p>So the trick the weapons designers of the world realized very immediately when thinking about H-bombs was this: you already need a heavy tamper, so why not make it out of U-238? If you do, then the high-energy neutrons from the fusion reactions will cause it to split, and you'll get a HUGE yield increase. And even better: U-238 is basically a &quot;waste&quot; product of the U-235 enrichment process, so it's extra explosive power for basically &quot;free.&quot; You're taking something that you have large amounts of anyway and turning it into a way to multiply the power of your bomb very dramatically. Win-win... except that the splitting of heavy elements is the part of the nuclear explosion that creates most of the radioactive fallout problem. </p>
<p>So the Tsar Bomba, as tested, had 97% of its energy from fusion. That means that 1.5 Mt came from fission (the primary and some other fission elements that are used to get the fusion working), and 48.5 Mt came from fusion. That's a very &quot;clean&quot; bomb for its yield: only 1.5 Mt of fission products, which is to say, about 10X less fissioning than the Castle Bravo bomb. They accomplished this by <em>not</em> using U-238 in the tamper, and by using lead instead — and lead will not fission (it is an extremely stable element). They used the lead, rather than the U-238, to cut down on the fallout problem. </p>
<p>If they had used U-238 as the tamper of the secondary of the weapon (or secondaries — there may have been multiple in this particular weapon), then the yield would have been around 100 Mt. So, again, 1.5 Mt would have been from the fissioning needed to start the fusion reaction, 48.5 Mt from the fusion reaction, and then another 50 Mt from the U-238 tamper fissioning. So the total fission products would have been 51.5 Mt... which is a <em>lot</em> of radioactivity from a single test.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of how much the fission product aspect of the radioactivity matters, you can use the <a href="https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/" target="_blank">NUKEMAP</a>. Here's <a href="http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fallout-comparisons.jpg" target="_blank">a chart</a> showing three surface burst weapons: the top is Castle Bravo (15 Mt, 68% fission), then the Tsar Bomba as tested (50 Mt, 3% fission), and then the Tsar Bomba as designed (100 Mt, 52% fission). You can see that the Tsar Bomba as tested could have (if it was a surface burst) spread radioactivity over an area as large as Castle Bravo, but it would have been less intense. The Tsar Bomba as designed, however, would have spread intense radioactivity over a much larger area.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing to add that I think was only touched on is what is a tamper. The tamper is some structure or mass or whatever that holds back the explosion. This is very important in what makes an explosion so powerful. Without a tamper on explosion will build up enough pressure in order to break whatever containing vessel it is and expands in every direction with the minimum needed pressure it takes to break that barrier. Add in a tamper that is able to contain the explosion to allow it to build to a higher pressure before releasing and you will create a bigger bomb which is clearly the objective of the atom bomb. There is no possible material or structure on Earth they could use to contain a hydrogen bomb so there is nothing we can build to fully surround a bomb to make it explode with the maximal force. What they've done is they've picked literally the heaviest element on Earth, which has the added bonus of being used as fuel itself, and used the property of inertia to build up as much pressure as possible before and while the bomb is exploding. because uranium is so heavy it takes more energy to push it away then a lighter material thus causing the bomb to build up a higher pressure when it explodes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thermonuclear weapons have 3 stages. Stage 1 is an ordinary fission, to heat things up. Stage 2 touches off tritium fusion, which lets off a flurry of neutrons. Stage 3 is where the lion's share of the energy comes from, the fission of the tamper. This fission is not self-sustaining like you would think of for conventional critical or supercritical fission chain reactions. Rather, it is force-fed neutrons by the fusion in the secondary stage. To understand the difference, we must carefully define the words &quot;fissile&quot; and &quot;fissionable,&quot; which you need to know to understand this. U-235 and Pu-239 are fissile, which means they release enough neutrons to (on average) fission 1 or more other fissile atoms, even if the neutrons are moderated to a slower speed. Slower neutrons are much easier to catch, but they have a lower chance to fission once captured; the fact that they fission relatively readily makes fissile isotopes special. This stands in contrast to the word &quot;fissionable&quot; which roughly translates in plain English to &quot;if I manage to smash this atom with a super fast neutron it will probably split and release energy.&quot; Pretty much all actinides are fissionable in a neutron flux, what makes fissile isotopes special is the fact that they can sustain that neutron flux. You have to be careful how much fissile material you put in once place, and in what shape, or it might go critical, so there are limits on how much you can use. So, to recap: 1 Thermonuclear bombs use fusion, but not the same fusion as we see in the sun. The term &quot;fusion-boosted fission&quot; is probably most appropriate. 2 Early fission bombs had a static yield; modern weapons can be dialed up and down. The tritium in the second stage decays rather quickly, so nations are already obliged to keep a constant flow of fresh tritium handy anyway. By adding more or less tritium, more or less of the fissionable tamper will fission, giving users some control over payload. 3 The less fission in the tamper, the higher percentage of the bombs energy that comes from the second stage, fusion. Fusion is relatively &quot;clean&quot; from a fallout perspective, so dialing a thermonuclear weapon's yield down to a minimum is the best way to test them.  That way you irradiate the smallest part of your testing grounds possible while still proving the viability of the design. 4 Depleted uranium is used as a tamper because nuclear weapons programs produce more than they know what to do with as a byproduct of uranium enrichment. Since no mass of depleted uranium will ever reach criticality, you can use as much of it as you want. It's lack of criticality concerns and ready cost-effective availability made it the fissionable material of choice for tampers. However, I suspect that other primordial actinides (such as Th-232) could also be used as a tamper, in theory.  TL;DR Most actinides will fission if exposed to an external neutron flux, nuclear fusion is used to provide a neutron source to fission the tamper</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Believe it or not, Tom Clancy's <em>The Sum of All Fears</em> gives an amazingly accurate description of these types of nuclear weapons in action.  </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>I may not agree with Clancy on a philosophical basis, but good goddam, if that man couldn't write a gripping, technologically accurate story. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
