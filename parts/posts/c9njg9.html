Reducing the number of transitions of care reduces the likely hood of errors. So instead of 3 transitions in a 24 hour period, you're looking at 2. 33% reductions by that intervention alone. Also, most hospitals consider working 3, 12 hour shifts (36 hrs) a week as full time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>We don’t work shifts. Very few doctors actually do shift work. ER docs and Hospitalist do but nearly all specialists take call and it can be for weeks at a time. For my specialty, there may only be one or two neurosurgeons in a smaller city or that work for a hospital. If we aren’t on call, there simply isn’t coverage.</p>
<p>I typically come in to work, round on my patients and go to the OR. I go home when the work is done, not when my shift is over. If there are enough sick patients that I need to spend 18 hours at the hospital, I’ll spend that much time. I can’t just clock out and hope that someone else will relieve me. There often is nobody else.</p>
<p>Edit: Wow!  Thanks for all the upvotes.  I wrote this as I was falling asleep last night.  What a great surprise this morning!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because in a hospital as a doctor or nurse you can't leave something on your desk until tomorrow morning. You need to handover to someone else, which takes about 30 mins and is probably the riskiest part of any shift as information is lost or miscommunicated. If you have a patient in for months its like a very long game of Chinese whispers but very complex and dire consequences if one piece of information is missed.</p>
<p>Also here (UK NHS) they rely heavily on overtime. Doing long days means your shifts are done in 3 days and its easier to convince someone to work a 4th and 5th day overtime than it is 6th and 7th.</p>
<p>There are drawbacks in terms of fatigue but every profession has its quirks. With hospitals it has just always been done this way - in fact in the past nurses used to live in the hospital and were given a rota when they were allowed to leave, not turn up - so people are used to it. Shifts pass quickly anyway as they are always busy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Also, the way they staff nurses, there's no way we can get our work done in 8 hours. Charting my work for one patient can take 45 minutes to 1 hour and 15 minutes total throughout the shift.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People will say the big thing is about reducing errors, there is probably some merit to it. But the big reason most of your doctors work such long shifts is because there is a ton of paperwork that needs to be written each day. For every patient you see, you need to write a progress note. For every new patient your service takes on, you need to write a whole history and physical. You can get pretty good at writing them, but they still take time. Depending on your seniority, you might get away with stuff like writing them later at home or the next day, but they need to get written. There just isnt enough time in 8 hours to see 10-20 patients, put in orders for the day's treatments/med changes/etc., and then to write notes for each patient.</p>
<p>If you want to reduce doctor's shift to reasonable times, there need to either be ways to offload work, either in the form of fewer patients per doctor or more admin staff like scribes that unburden doctors from paperwork and let them focus more on patient treatment. I personally am more in favor of the second as its much easier to train a good scribe than a good doctor. But both would probably increase patient care as any time you can take away from having to write notes would mean more potential time actually seeing patients.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
