		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With the right software that is true. In fact people have made simulators of the actual Apollo Guidance Computer which will allow your iPhone to not only orchestrate a moon landing but doing so by simulating the original computer. The statement is a bit outdated now. The updated statement is that your phone charger have more computing power then the computers that got Apollo 11 to the moon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically your phone, or possibly <a href="https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/306119-your-phone-charger-is-probably-smarter-than-the-apollo-guidance-computer" target="_blank">even just its charger</a>, would in theory be able to land something on the moon - your phone would be able to do it without even noticing the effort.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, there are important differences and caveats;</p>
<p>The Apollo computers were specialised hardware with real-time operating systems - that means they were designed, built, and programmed in such a way that if you need to fire a rocket for EXACTLY 152 milliseconds, the computer can do that absolutely bang on every time even though it's a million times slower than your iPhone.</p>
<p>Your iPhone, as it is out of the box with its non-realtime operating system, can TRY to do that, but because the OS doesn't guarantee that sort of real-time performance, you might fire the rocket for 152ms or, if at that exact moment an app decides to pop up and use a load of processing power, the rocket might stay on for a whole second... or if the app crashed the phone while the rocket was lit it might stay lit for 5 minutes while a little coloured whirly thing went round and you smashed into the moon at a thousand miles per hour.</p>
<p>This is the difference between operating systems like you find in your phone or laptop, and embedded systems that have to control real-world things that might hurt people or burn your toast.</p>
<p>Now, <em>theoretically</em>, it's possible to create an OS like that for any system, but Apple like to lock their shit down so good luck with that one.</p>
<p>The various other <em>smaller</em> computers inside your phone (most of which are also capable of landing on the moon) which control things like the various sensors, the cellular radio, wifi, bluetooth, battery charging, etc. etc. etc. are more realtime and might be a reasonable prospect but are often somewhat single-purpose, so don't have enough IO (inputs and outputs) to do the job - in short, not enough legs on the chip to wire all the things to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. You have more number calculating power than there's was on board at the time.    They didn't need or able to have that much computer power.   They weren't going to a random place that needed real-time calculations.   Those were done months ahead of time on Earth and needed to be loaded in and the burn sequences executed by the computer.   </p>
<p>Your cell phone has 1000x capabilities of your high school TI-85 calculator.  Which is already a complex computer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not only could your phone guide a rocket to the moon, it could also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYjsSLrY4U4" target="_blank">simulate the rocket, the moon, and the Earth and draw a real-time 3D view of them</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, the math for orbital mechanics is surprisingly simple.  Spacecraft basically fly in ovals around planets, and you can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patched_conic_approximation" target="_blank">high-school geometry to chart a pretty accurate course</a> that's good enough for most space missions.  Space travel takes so long you could probably even do the math by hand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
