		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone who is giving a very specific answer with physiological/anatomy explanation is likely not using anything solidly based in available science.</p>
<p>There are theories including adhered or constantly contracted muscle or fascial tissue, but this is not proven and would fail to explain why this &quot;knotted&quot; tissue is more tender than muscular tissue at maximal contraction.</p>
<p>There are theories that it may be an inflamed superficial nerve that is either overly sensitized or causing the underlying muscle to guard (involuntarily contract).</p>
<p>The real answer is we don't know exactly what they are or why they exist.  There was a study performed with experts on muscle knots, including one of the original theory authors, where they were blinded to subjective reporting and had to palpate and attempt to locate muscle knots on patients without gathering feedback outside of palpation.  The degree of accuracy was astonishingly low, around 18% (you can read more about this in <a href="http://www.fmperplex.com/2013/02/14/travell-simons-and-cargo-cult-science/" target="_blank">this article</a>).</p>
<p>There are multiple studies that have shown extremely poor interrater reliability in ability to diagnose and &quot;find&quot; muscle knots or trigger points.  You can look at those <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Hsieh+2000+trigger+points" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Myburgh+2008+trigger+points" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Lucas+2009+trigger+points" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>As far as treatment, rubbing these &quot;knots&quot; can be relieving for some and exacerbating for others.  Massage can decrease muscle guarding (involuntary mild contractions) and feel relieving, but there is also not a lot of evidence for what type of massage works best outside of what type of massage the patient believes will be best.</p>
<p>Some people advocate for other treatments, such as dry needling, but once again, the evidence is unreliable.  Dry needling is supposed to increase blood flow, massage is ischemic in nature and cuts off blood flow, but both can work to relieve symptoms.</p>
<p>I know this isn't exactly five year old level, but I do hope it helps people understand that this is a really complex issue in rehabilitative medicine and the real answer is &quot;we don't know&quot;.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Muscles are like strings. they only pull in one direction. We have lots of muscles so we have lots of freedom of motion. When muscles are repeatedly needed to pull, the unsconscious brain decides to send signals so that some of the muscles are already pulling. This makes the whole action easier.</p>
<p>Muscles pull their ends closer to the middle which means the middle &quot;bunches up.&quot; Knots are the bunches of your muscles that your unconscious brain has told to remain clenched.</p>
<p>Massage fixes this by literally squishing that clenched knot so the muscles can go back to their resting position. Since the clench was caused by our unconscious brain, we cant just think &quot;release&quot; but rather need some external pressure to squish the knots.</p>
<p>I am a LMBT and have worked independently as a stretch therapist helping people develop better neuromuscular connections to fix their posture and any resulting pain from it. I've found that the exhale is very helpful when trying to release knotted muscles. I also am constantly leaning against a lacrosse ball on the wall to help release muscles that my hands cant reach.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good question with no proven answer. The explaination that makes most sense to me and that I tell people (I'm a sports massage therapist) is that it's like a micro cramp where a small number of fibres are stuck in the contracted position due to various reasons including overuse, nourishment, injury, ect ect. This in term causes pain signaling and for the rest of that muscle to exhibit hyperalgesia (increased pain sensation). Massage helps by improving blood flow to nourish that muscle and help the muscle relax in term releasing any contracted fibres.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I could be wrong but as far as I'm aware there aren't any 100% conclusions on this. Would love to be corrected with peer reviewed evidence if I'm wrong though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELIF:
Localized poor circulation causes a buildup of cellular waste byproducts that cause the muscle fibers to contract which causes stress which increases it in a vicious cycle.  Massage seems to cause the knot to relax via reducing the local contraction mechanism though mechanical action.</p>
<p>Explain Like I'm a Grad Student:
It is surprising how poor the biological info on muscle knots is.  Best I can come up with is that it is a bundle of muscle fibers that are locked in a contracted state and won't relax.  Under pathological or high-stress conditions you have reactive oxygen species (e.g. superoxide) that build up.  The cells' sarcoplasmic reticulum continue to release calcium which keeps them in a contracted state, this may lead to increased metabolic stress and reduced blood flow which encourages this state to continue.  Cell stress triggers the increased release of myokines, inflammatory cytokines, and neurotransmitters which leads to pain.</p>
<p>Why massage seems to help is not definite.  It has not been proven to aid in circulation in the affected spots.  Stretching actually can reduce circulation as longitudinal elongation of the muscles compresses the blood vessels.  Massage may work via reduction of focal adhesions through activation of the FAK (focal adhesion kinase) pathway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
