<p>If the blood goes down to my knee, how is it going to come back up if the veins just suddenly stop, it’s like blocking the circulation at that point right?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aside from all the good answers linked to, it's important to remember that blood doesn't flow in a &quot;loop&quot; through the big blood vessels.</p>
<p>It goes from one set of big arteries into smaller and smaller vessels to supply oxygen to all the individual cells. The oxygen-less blood then flows into veins that re-combine into larger and larger veins for the way back to the heart.  (the blood vessels going _from_ the heart are arteries, the vessels coming back to the heart are veins).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Don't look at it as a big high-way going looping through the city (your body), branching off into smaller side streets, as you might expect.</p>
<p>See it as two highways on either side of a city, with one highway only having off ramps that split into smaller roads into the city, while the other highway only has on ramps where all the small roads of the city merge together again.</p>
<p>As long as every part of the city can be visited by going off the one highway, through the city and out the other side, you can cut off parts of the city without it breaking access of other parts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body isn't exactly like an engine. The fuel (blood) doesn't pool in one place to keep you alive. Rather it needs to disperse to every cell in your body to fuel them. Essentially a billion tiny engines. It does this through capalaries. These tiny blood vessels are often times no bigger than a single red blood cell wide. They travel into all the tissues and area thay the arteries or veins can't reach. Meaning that even if you lose a portion of your limbs the blood still flows from artery to vein. Allowing your circulatory system to function as normal.</p>
<p>Though the size of capalaries can lead to some minor complications for amputations far from the heart. Without the major blood vessels there to maintain blood pressure, the flow rate of the blood can decrease. The lack of blood flow isn't fatal, but it cause some serious pain. Think of the severe pins and needles feeling you get when your leg falls asleep.  So the patient will need to regularly wear a compression garment to gently and artificially increase the blood pressure in that area and help blood flow faster through the vessels and restore good circulation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simplest way I can put it visually for 5y.o. is like this:</p>
<p>Make all of your fingertips touch together, but keep your palms apart.
Pretend your arm, hand, and fingers are hollow, and your left arm has blood coming from the heart, giving blood to the tiny vessels of your arteries (fingers), the blood visits all your cells then goes into the other tiny vessels (veins) when the blood gets to your right fingertips. The blood then goes all the way up your arm and back to your heart and goes around again.  Now if you cut off your pinky fingers (by accident!) the blood would still go around everywhere else, but you would not have your pinky fingers or the blood going through that area. Now pretend that’s your leg.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've explained this previously to people in terms of an electrical. In most electrical systems, you'll have two busses. On DC, these are labeled + and -. (On AC, these are hot and neutral in the US, but this analogy works best with DC.)</p>
<p>At no point do the + and - busses connect to each other, save for through some kind of device or appliance, and even then, only when it's turned on.</p>
<p>So replace bus with blood vessel and replace + with veins and - with arteries. You with me so far? Now replace device or appliance with capillary.</p>
<p>So when an amputation happens, the length of the blood vessel (bus) is shortened and a bunch of capillaries (appliances) are removed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
