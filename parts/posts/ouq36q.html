		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A Reverse Repo is where the Federal Reserve effectively drains liquidity or cash out of the banking system by exchanging cash for short term treasuries (T-bills).  Banks don't do this because interest paid on those T-bills, they do it because the larger their balance sheet, the more regulatory capital requirements they must meet.  Think of regulatory capital as collateral that the banks must hold onto as a pct of their overall balance sheet.  The banks don't want to hold onto that regulatory capital because they can't generate income from it. Getting their balance sheets lower means they have lower regulatory capital requirements.  This issue is amplified because there was a pandemic crisis rule that allowed for banks to relax these regulatory capital requirements, but those exceptions expired in March of this year.</p>
<p>Banks view cash deposits as liabilities for several reasons including what I mentioned above regarding cash deposits requiring an associated amount of regulatory assets.  If you look at a bank's balance sheet, cash and regulatory capital assets do not generate a profit.  However, extending loans which generates interest does.  The ideal scenario would be for commercial banks to take in deposits of cash and then lend that to people as loans that generate profit.  The problem is that there is more cash on hand at commercial banks than there are people wanting to take out loans.</p>
<p>There is yet another dimension to the rise in reverse repos; I mentioned earlier those banks don't want cash on their balance sheet and so they are encouraging their commercial business accounts to not keep cash but instead invest that cash in a money market account.  (There is also the concern around inflation for retail investors that is causing them to move their cash into money market accounts as well as equities which is a whole other topic - <strong>STONKS</strong>) </p>
<p>The thing is that money market accounts are largely holding short term treasuries/T-bills because of the security of those assets.  This means that the banks that offer these money market accounts need to buy T-bills.  But there is a problem, there are not enough T-bills to buy because the Treasury is trying to secure the record low interest rates by issuing longer term bonds and notes instead of T-bills to make federal spending cheaper in the future.  But the Federal Reserve has a bunch of T-bills to sell and so we see the number of overnight reverse repurchase agreements continuously increase to meet the aforementioned demand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they have no where else to put it.</p>
<p>A bank's fundamental job is to take money where it is extra and put it where it is wanted, but no one wants the money right now. Reverse repos do give a small amount of money to the banks. Currently even at very low interest rates, it doesn't seem like there are that many takers for loans or anything else that money can be invested in. So they put it in the only place they can, reverse repo.</p>
<p>An argument currently being made is that too much money was printed recently due to this spike in the RR amount.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The FED plan is to give it an overnight sleepover so it can try to find new outlets the next day. Unable to find an outlet each day more dollars find more friends and return each night. No one has witnessed such a large sleepover and itâ€™s making the parents nervous.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
