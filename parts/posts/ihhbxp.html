<p>We've only mapped like less than 1% of the ocean floor</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there are multiple problems with this statement. If we're talking about relatively high resolution strip maps of the ocean floor from ship soundings and sonar, we've mapped ~18% (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2019.00283/full" target="_blank">Wolfl et al, 2019</a>) of the ocean floor. For the rest of the ocean, we also have reasonably accurate bathymetry from altimetric methods. In short, we can use satellite radar altimetry data which measures the height of the ocean surface, along with satellite gravity data to derive the bathymetry of the oceans, (e.g. this review from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1631071306001246" target="_blank">Sandwell et al, 2006</a>). These data are combined with shipboard data to produce global, continuous gridded bathymetric maps (e.g. <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015EA000107" target="_blank">Weatherall et al, 2015</a>). Because of the nature of the satellite data, these have a relatively coarse horizontal spatial resolution (i.e. the gridded GEBCO product discussed in Weatherall has a grid spacing of 30 arc seconds, so ~ 1 km depending on where you are on the Earth). In detail ability for the altimetric techniques to resolve a feature depend on the radius of the feature and its depth and the resolution limit is ~ pi x the water depth, so features smaller than ~10-12 km are going to be hard to resolve (though this gets better at shallower depths). However, as I'll elaborate on later, the probability of extremely deep chasms that are extremely narrow (i.e. below the resolution of the altimetric bathymetry, even considering the extra depth) are geologically unlikely/unreasonable, so in terms of extant bathymetry, the key question is the vertical accuracy of the altimetric bathymetry.</p>

<p>so the chances of a deeper area than Challenger's Deep</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In terms of the vertical resolution (which is the most relevant for the question at hand), a variety of global (e.g. <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/94JB00988" target="_blank">Smith &amp; Sandwell, 1994</a> or <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019EA000658" target="_blank">Tozer et al, 2019</a>) and spot checks of individual features (e.g. <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2004GC000833" target="_blank">Etnoyer, 2005</a>) have shown the altimetric bathymetry to be accurate within 150-200 meters. Thus, it is actually extremely unlikely that there is anywhere deeper than Challenger Deep currently, even more so if we consider the geologic context of extremely deep areas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is that potential depth?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_trench#Deepest_oceanic_trenches" target="_blank">deepest portions of the ocean</a> are oceanic trenches associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction" target="_blank">subduction zones</a> where an oceanic portion of a tectonic plate sinks into the mantle, beneath another plate. The controls on how deep a portion of the ocean floor can be are dictated by the details of subduction zones. Subduction of old, thick, cold oceanic lithosphere tends to produce rapid subduction that occurs at a steep angle and which produces deep trenches (e.g. <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/94JB00809" target="_blank">Zhong &amp; Gurnis, 1994</a>, <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/lithosphere/article/1/2/121/99494" target="_blank">Giuseppe et al, 2009</a>) because subduction is largely a density driven process and the older a section of oceanic lithosphere it is, the colder it is, and thus the denser it is, so it sinks faster and at a steeper angle (generally). There are some potential influences from the nature of the overriding plate, i.e. what the subducting lithosphere is sinking below, which can influence things like whether a trench is 'advancing' or 'retreating' and the angle of the slab, which will feed into trench depth, but these are largely secondary to the details of the slab itself (e.g. <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014JB011163" target="_blank">Sharples et al, 2014</a>). All of these parameters control basically the size of the hole generated at the subduction zone, but the last major control is how much sediment is present to fill the hole, which will largely be dictated by the proximity to a major sediment source, i.e. a continent vs a small volcanic island chain (e.g. <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2011GL050712" target="_blank">Heuret et al, 2012</a>). </p>
<p>Now, if we consider the Challenger Deep (part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_Trench" target="_blank">Mariana trench</a>), we can see that this lies in pretty much the sweet spot for super deep trenches, i.e. its subducting <a href="http://www2.ocean.washington.edu/oc540/lec01-1/agemap.gif" target="_blank">some of the oldest oceanic crust</a> on Earth and there is virtually no sediment sources nearby so if you look at the map of sediment thickness in Heuret et al, you'll see that there is almost no trench sediment. <strong>Thus, knowing the controls on trench depth that we've just laid out, even if we didn't already have reasonable confidence that we haven't missed any major bathymetric features (which we do, see above), we would expect the deepest area to basically be the Mariana trench.</strong> </p>
<p>For the final, theoretical aspect of your question, for a deeper trench to exist sometime else geologically, there would need to be an area subducting older oceanic lithosphere (assuming a simple relationship between subducting plate age and trench depth, which is not totally far fetched based on the Zhong &amp; Gurnis modeling, though this is admittedly simplistic and there is a lot of scatter in the relationships they show). While the oceanic lithosphere being subducted in the Mariana trench is likely not the theoretical maximum age (I'm not sure if such a calculation exists, EDIT, but efforts like this from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X06002263" target="_blank">Cogne et al, 2006</a> suggest limited change in mean oceanic lithospheric age for at least the last few hundred million years and support 200 million years as a reasonable estimate of maximum age), because of the way plate tectonics works, it's hard for oceanic lithopshere to exist much longer than ~200 million years, so we could imagine something slightly deeper but likely not that much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This mostly seems to be a question of how deep can a trench be so water is still water, basically, is there a limit where a phase change would occur so to pressure, temp?</p>
<p>The answer is yes, there's a limit.  At around 1 GPa of pressure, water will turn to solid ice.  The Marianas trench is only around 1/10th this pressure, so we have quite a ways deeper to go.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the assumption in the question is wrong.   We have mapped the ENTIRE ocean.    But different parts of the ocean are mapped to different degrees of detail.</p>
<p>But &quot;How deep could the ocean be?&quot; is a good question.   We know it's current depth but maybe 200 million years ago or 200M years from now the depth could be different.  Is there a maximum.</p>
<p>My guess is the maximum depth is determined by the maximum speed that two tectonic plates can diverge</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another limit to this is due to istostacy, or the boyance of the crust ontop of the mantle. Right now, both the Marianas trench and mt Everest are in the ballpark of how deep/tall structures can be, as if you make the mountain larger, the plate it is on wants to sink, and if you make a trench deeper, the mantle around it will want to push up on and make it &quot;float&quot;. </p>
<p>Two edge cases to illustrate this are that you could never pile a mountain to outer space, or dig a hole to the core. So there must be a limit somewhere, and these two are in the ballpark of that. </p>
<p>This is one of the reasons olympus mons on mars can be so tall. There is less gravity, so a larger mass can be boyantly suported, all things being equal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
