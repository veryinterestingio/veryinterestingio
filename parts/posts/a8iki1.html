		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chimps and gorillas have a gestational period just under humans which implies that ~9 months was a commonality likely shared with early hominids.</p>
<p>As has been mentioned in order to stand upright our pelvis has rotated and shortened to accommodate the range of motion needed in our legs as well as narrowing which better supports our weight. This is the reason childbirth is such a problem for us, female pelvises being unfused so that they can flex in labour and baby's skull plates unfused so that they can move and squish a bit.
When compared even to our closest great ape cousins we are born spectacularly immature and under developed, some say that's an advantage because we have more time to learn which is uncertain. But for sure we would be unable to walk upright without it or major changes in reproduction.</p>
<p>So it's probably fair to assume that with the trend from quadraped to biped follows difficulty in labour and premature young.</p>
<p>More recently we know that several other subspecies of homosapiens interbred, including Neanderthal and Denisovan man as we can still find remnants of Thier DNA in the current Human population. So it's reasonable to assume that they had nearly identical reproductive habits to us although we don't KNOW.</p>
<p>One of the big issues with studying this field is a real lack of data, we can study our own genetics and discover our familial links with sub species of homo but this was still relatively recently.
Fossilisation being a rare process anyway we do not have complete fossil records of all hominids and homo though all stages of development. Enough to comfortably decuce common ancestry but lacking the detail to easily study subtle changes in how young develop and are born.</p>
<p>Even after the consolidation of homosapiens sapiens from earlier sub species our earliest written languages are only a few thousand years old and aren't detailed records of pregnancy and childbirth. This how much ideas about it have changed since then and vary even now around the globe. We can be fairly sure that pregnancy had a higher mortality rate and infant deaths were higher but how high they were we don't know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gestation periods are something we have in common with our living ape relatives, and haven't changed (that we know of). The shift to bipedal motion changed alignment of many elements in the body, and as a result our birthing process is now more difficult, and in order to facilitate this our babies are born very immature and underdeveloped compared to apes.</p>
<p>Advances in medical technology have greatly decreased the number of complications encountered during pregnancy and childbirth, however, depending on the era, medical practices of the time may have caused said complications to begin with. Generally now things are a lot safer, with mother and child both expected to survive, and many heartbreaking deliveries (still born, deformities) detected early enough on that they can be safely terminated.</p>
<p>Really, nothing has changed to human bodies themselves, just in our understanding of how, and when, to treat the body during pregnancy. In the past 100 years we've come from pregnant women and young children in soot-filled homes breathing all kinds of noxious air without a thought, to a time when handling kitty litter/scat is known to be particularly harmful and should be avoided at all costs. As our understanding grows, we find new ways (like c-sections) to assist the process, but the process is now as it always was.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've always struggled with child birth. Until modern medicine, the mother and/or infant would not survive if there were severe complications. Surely, that would mean that the genetics of women who had complications would eradicate themselves whilst those of women who were very proficient as child birth would be passed on. </p>
<p>Over thousands of generations, surely childbirth has become a little easier for modern mothers over their ancestors?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
