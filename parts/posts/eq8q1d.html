		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They go soft because they are absorbing moisture from the air. When out in the open, there's an infinite (for all intents and purposes) amount of moisture for them to absorb, but when closed in a container, they can only absorb the moisture in the small amount of air in the container with them. At some point, the moisture level in the air reaches an equilibrium with the cookies/crackers and they don't absorb any more. The same thing happens with things that go stale, like bread, but in the opposite direction. They want to dry out, but when in a closed container the air inside can only hold so much moisture. The rest is forced to stay in the bread so it stays soft.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally it’s because it doesn’t let in any new moisture.  They get soft because of moisture in the air being absorbed, but when it’s sealed you don’t get that new air refreshed with new moisture.</p>
<p>Works the same way in reverse with keeping bread soft.  Doesn’t let the moisture out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
