<p>Pretty much what the tittle asks. I recently fracture my ankle and did some severe ligament damage, my foot has swollen like a balloon, and my doctors have me elevating and wrapping to reduce swelling. Just curious what the reason is for wanting to reduce the swelling, does it aid in recovery ?or is just for comfort/pain reduction ?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Swelling results from capillary leakage, which itself results from the release of inflammatory compounds at the site of injury.  The fluid can become what's called organized, in which proteins in the fluid, like fibrin, accumulate, and this can make the swelling permanent to some degree.  Does the swelling serve any purpose?  The capillary leakage also lets white blood cells into the damaged area, and these control infection and gobble up debris (by Pac Man-type cells called macrophages) from the injury, so I think the answer is yes.  But getting rid of the swelling within a week is a good idea, as the infection control and gobbling up of debris is done by that time as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Swelling is the bodies reaction to increase bloodflow to the affected area to help with healing.  Evolution is not perfect and usually the swelling can be too much and cause additional damage or interfere with applying modern medicine.  We reduce the swelling to avoid additional damage and inspect // apply proper healing techniques.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the body gets injured, it wants to do two things: minimise the risk of infection, and make healing happen as fast as possible.  Both of those things benefit from increased local blood flow.  Increased local blood flow also produces swelling as a side effect.  If the injury is small, this is no problem, and the process works well enough for, say, a small cut or bruise. The problem is if the injury is large, the swelling that results from the increased blood flow can have bad effects on the surrounding uninjured parts of the body, by stretching tissue, putting pressure on nerves and other blood vessels and things like that.  The body's internal mechanisms are not smart enough to be able to determine when a good response (more blood flow) can have harmful side effects (too much swelling).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The swelling, inflammation, is what hurts. It's what hurts with a headache, or a sprain. Ice slows down and reverses the inflammation, hopefully to where you can tolerate it, so they can have a good look at what's wrong without you screaming. You also can't set a leg/arm while it's swollen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
