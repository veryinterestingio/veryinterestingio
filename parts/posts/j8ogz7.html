<p>I'm sorry I'm not very good at describing it but how can a musician just start a duet without talking. It seems like magic.</p></div></div>

Like a conversation has sentence structure, cadence, a back and forth, and a purpose - music has those same scaffolds. Once you know a song’s key (like the topic of a conversation) you can work within that framework as a musician. Certain notes/chords work, where others don’t</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>No, there are years of preparation that goes into this, same as with language, sports, construction. Generally, you learn how to handle your own instrument, then you learn how to play in time and in tune with others, then you come to understand how popular music is structured, and how far you can wander while still remaining inside the framework.</p>
<p>There's plenty of room for improvisation given just a key signature (which notes are considered in-key or out-of-key), tempo and time signature (underlying rhythm). There are also plenty of well-known songs to start from: anthems, jazz standards, carols, etc.</p>
<p>It's just like balancing on a wire—easy to stay in place, easy to fall off entirely, but challenging to move about, play, and recover while remaining aloft.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every musician starts out with the very basics. Chords, scales, even fingering holds. You practice these until you can play complex music, but at the end of the day, two musicians both know the same basic chords, rhythms, and probably some songs. When one person plays, the other can match their rhythm and general sound because they know enough similarities to do so.</p>
<p>It's a lot like a rapper asking for a beat: one person beatboxes and the other feels the rhythm and joins in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Music is a language, so it's sort of like asking how to ELI5 how a person can just go and speak to someone they don't know. The answer is incredibly complex, yet we all (with some exceptions yes) just intrinsically experience it as a part of being human.</p>
<p>Music is decorating time with sound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are you able to have random conversations with people without planning?  Its the same. Us musicians play like we speak... notes are like words. We know how to use them together and in sequence to speak to and with eachother...  you listen to the rythm and the key and watch the other artist for physical cues that changes are coming and there you have it. Music.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
