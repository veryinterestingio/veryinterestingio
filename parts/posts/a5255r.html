		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>AM waves are big and heavy, like a bowling ball. If you launch it (transmit) it travels for a long distance but doesn’t bounce around that much when it hits something. FM waves are like small rubber balls. They bounce around a lot and so look like they can go around/through obstacles like buildings and tunnels. But they run out of energy quickly so have a shorter range. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>AM radio waves have wavelengths of 70 to 200 meters while FM is closer to 3 meters. The shorter waves can enter the tunnel and bounce around for a greater distance than AM. Neither will continue through a long tunnel. Some tunnels have AM or FM repeaters which carry the signal throughout the tunnel.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To build upon what others have said regarding AM and FM, as many have pointed out, the AM <em>broadcast band</em> is very low frequency and thus long wavelength, while the FM <em>broadcast band</em> is comparatively high frequency and short wavelength.</p>
<p>A typical FM antenna is a single element that is several feet or perhaps tens of feet long, typically mounted on top of a long tower and often on a hill.  With AM on the other hand, the actual tower itself is the antenna, typically many tens of feet tall, along with lots of cables buried underground coming out radially from the mast(s).</p>
<p>If you're driving around and you see several tall towers near each other, in a line, box, or cross type formation, often with little to nothing mounted on the towers, it's a good chance you're seeing an AM station.  The shape of the tower layout is often used to direct which way the signal goes, and electronics will often turn the various towers &quot;on or off&quot; (or adjust phase) as the sun rises/sets to change the power or radiation shape.</p>
<p>Finally broadcast AM is typically super efficient compared to FM; a 5kw AM transmitter could reasonably cover the same area as a 50kw FM broadcast transmitter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>AM stands for amplitude modulation, so imagine it as the brightness of the radio waves (light). FM stands for frequency modulation so imagine that as changes in the frequency of that light (color). Now imagine you are around a bend in a tunnel where at the other end someone is dimming and undimming a normal flashlight. You can probably perceive the brightest moments but once it dims not notice it, that’s what happens with AM. Now they turn on a different flashlight which instead of dimming, changes color while staying bright, you would be able to notice the light since it remains bright and see the color changes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I dispute the question, because both AM and FM will cut out if the tunnel is any longer than a very, very short distance. I drive through 5+ km long tunnels on a regular basis and FM radio is no good further than a couple of dozen metres from the entrances. Some tunnels have boosters/retransmitters inside them though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
