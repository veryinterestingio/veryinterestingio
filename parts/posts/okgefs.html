<p>If you have and organ transplant, will that organ always have the donors DNA because the donor heart cells, create more donor heart cells which create more donor heart cells? </p>
<p>Or will other systems in your body working with the organ 'infect' it with your DNA somehow?</p></div></div>

<p>Cells are not replaced, they multiply. One cell becomes two, two become 4. This is inhibited by the cells own mechanics and the mechanics of nearby cells to prevent them from infinitely multiplying. If a cell multiplies it'll first multiply it's own DNA. So if a cell from a transplanted organ multiplies it will multiply it's own DNA beforehand. Therefore the transplants DNA remains the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The rate of cell replacement depends on the tissue type.  You get a brand new epithelial layer in the intestines every 5-7 days.  However, by the time you die, over half of the cells in your heart will have been the same cells you were born with, having never replicated even once in your lifetime.</p>
<p>That being said, transplanted organs retain their DNA, which is why immunosuppressants are necessary to prevent the organ from being rejected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>the every cell is replaced is a misstated fact.   </p>
<p>The total number or cells in your body is replaced about every 7 years. Short living cells sway that number radically. There are a number of cell types that you live your whole life with the same cells.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The body has 3 types of cells ultimately if you classify them by 'age of death'</p>
<p>- Cells that get replaced very often (Labile Cells)</p>
<p>- Cells that get replaced only if they are dying / have died (Stable Cells)</p>
<p>- Cells that almost never get replaced (Permanent Cells)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/human-disease/The-immune-response#ref63216" target="_blank">Source1</a></p>
<p>A prime example of the first category are the cells of your skin. They continuously proliferate, the ones from the bottom pushing the ones on the top away (until they break away from your skin). This is one of the mechanisms with which we keep microorganisms away, they dig, we keep adding the ground.</p>
<p>A good example are for example your liver cells. If you have a wild night of partying and drinking alcohol, rest assured that some of your liver cells will die. In that moment some special cells, we call 'Stem Cells', come to the place. There they split/divide themselves (multiplying the number of cells) in a polarised way. Making one copy of themselves as a Stem Cell and one other copy which is destined to differentiate (technical term for become different from other types of cells) into a liver cell.</p>
<p>The last category are cells from tissues that rarely or never repair themselves. A great example of such a tissue is your nervous tissue. Once you damage your brain it will never  (with some minor exceptions) repair itself. All the progress you see people with brain damage make during recovery, is mainly due to the brain 'modifying' itself to adapt to the new situation.</p>
<p>To go into more detail, these Stem Cells belong to different categories. There are those that can potentially become any cell you have or <strong>have ever had.</strong> I emphasise the last part since what you currently possess is merely a subset of the cells your DNA can give life to. Many of these cells you don't really produce anymore belong to simpler times, fetal times. <del>Some such cells are those that we nowadays, so carefully collect from the umbilical cord of our newborns.</del></p>
<p>The other category of Stem Cells, can become pretty much anything you have in your body, again these cells are very rare and not subject to our discussion. Lastly we have a group of stem cells that pretty much specialise into becoming cells for a type of tissue. These cells usually reside in the vicinity of the tissue they are responsible for.</p>
<p>In the case of a transplant, these cells being found within the tissue they are associated with, are also transplanted. There is always the question of whether there are cells that come from a different area of the body, but I have not read anything on the topic.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>So to conclude, no, the cells of the transplanted organ retain their DNA.</p>

<p>Edit: thanks to /u/Tiny_Rat for pointing out that umbilical cord blood is collected for hematopoietic stem cells instead of pluripotent stem cells.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
