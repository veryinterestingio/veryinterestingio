		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I was a kid I had light skin. I tanned easily and always stayed in the sun without sunscreen. Fast forward to being near 20 I have a lot darker skin (brown) although its gotten lighter slowly since I stopped tanning. Is my dark skin a result of staying in the sun for my whole childhood or would it have happened regardless, and will it return to my natural colour, I've just been curious about this for a while.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You probably know that skin tanning is a defensive mechanism against UV radiation. This type of radiation has a lot of energy - enough to kick electrons out of atoms, therefore high-energy radiation is also called ionizing.</p>
<p>This can wreak havoc within the cell, creating free radicals and damaging cellular machinery and DNA. This could lead to mutations and, eventually, cancer.</p>
<p>So specialised cells (melanocytes) start producing melanin which is reasily absorbed by surrounding skin cells. Melanin is a shield that helps prevent UV radiation from doing damage. This protection is effective, but far from impenetrable.</p>
<p>A study examined the effects of exposure to UV light at different time points. Here is what they found, in short:</p>
<p>Firstly, they noticed immediate darkening within minutes of exposure which only lasts a few hours. This is thought to be caused by the UV light oxidising already existing melanin, not new melanin being produced.</p>
<p>Secondly, over the span of a few hours, melanin production becomes noticable. This remains for a few days.</p>
<p>Then there is pigmentation which takes a few days to develop, but stays for several weeks.</p>
<p>Finally, this can lead to long-term switching on of melanin production, leading to darkening which lasts upwards of 9 months.</p>
<p>Interestingly, some people retained pigmentation for very long periods of time - even without further UV exposure of any significance. It's not yet clear why only some people experience this, but it is definitely possible.</p>
