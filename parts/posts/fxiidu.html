<p>With more sophisticated ways to go hunting for genomes, it's now even possible to analyze the calculus of bog bodies to find out what bacteria lived in their mouths and what they ate. </p>
<p>But many times we don't know. There are plagues described in ancient texts where you can guess what it might have been, but there's no actual answer to the puzzle yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have pointed out, some known viruses and bacterias are extremely old, and it's likely that many long extinct species had their share of diseases. An interesting note, however, is that most modern infectious diseases that affect humans weren't always there through our own history. They spread to humans starting 10000 years ago when we started domesticating animals: measles from cattle, the common cold from horses, the flu from ducks, etc.</p>
<p>Also interesting is that, in some cases, the original infectious agents start relatively or completely benign (like the flu, which in ducks was a quite innocuous intestinal virus), and then evolve their virulence as they jump species and adapt to survive in different organisms.</p>
