		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it as a language. If you'd jump back in time to a year around 1500 a.d. and try to talk to a person speaking the English language, you'd likely have quite some problems because the language changed a lot since then. Ways computers do stuff evolves too, and UT2004 simply doesn't know the latest vocabulary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most likely reason is software incompatibilities. Even if your hardware can easily handle the program, troubles arise if the game can't &quot;talk&quot; to your computer. </p>
<p>You see, as computers get better, their software changes. However, when a program is produced, it is made to interact with the software of the day. Sometimes there comes a point where the newer software is using language the older game can't decipher properly, or the game language that is too old for the computer. Often this makes older games unstable, and - after a certain point - unusable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Older games were written to be supported by older technologies. As a newer technology becomes more affordable and therefore more popular and more common across the board, the older technology stops getting as much attention and eventually stops receiving as much support. As a really basic example, old software used to ship on 3.5&quot; floppy discs. As discs became more popular, computer manufacturers stopped including 3.5&quot; floppy disc readers on their computers and included CD and then DVD readers/writers. And now that streaming media has become as popular as it is, and you can buy movies and games and music online without ever touching any physical media, they've stopped including even these CD / DVD readers on many of their products.</p>
<p>That's not to say that CD's and DVD's don't exist, or that 3.5&quot; floppy discs don't exist. But if you want to use them, you have to go out of your way to find the solution to get your computer to read them (ie., buying a reader).</p>
<p>Software is kind of similar in this case. In order to help keep program sizes smaller and keep programs running efficiently, and to avoid the potential for accumulating bugs and glitches, developers over time start trimming out the older stuff that isn't used as much. Or, maybe they develop something completely new and don't see a need to include native support for the older stuff to begin with because there's very, very little market for it since everyone's already moved on.</p>
<p>In the case of computer games, 99.9% of the time there is a way to make it work, it just takes looking around online for the solution. There's actually a website, the PC Gaming Wiki, that seeks to document known glitches and their fixes with all computer games, so that there's always a way to get them to run. And the storefront GOG tries to implement as many patches as they can to make sure whatever older game they're selling works &quot;out of the box&quot; on your modern computer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Older games are not optimised for newer operating systems. Basically you gave to trick a PC into running them for one reason or another. This can work for a great deal of time but sometimes you will simply encounter something that the game wants that is no longer used. Like a certain driver for playing videos.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answers in this thread are probably a bit more ELI5, but older PC games were generally made for computers with a certain speed and technology in mind. The first dual-core processor was only JUST released in July of 2004, so Unreal Tournament back then almost certainly wasn't designed to run on multi-core processors, and there is also the likelihood that there are certain kinds of bugs, many of which are what's called race conditions where threads of computation become &quot;stuck&quot; because they are each waiting for some condition to change in the other, that happens because the hardware we use now is so much faster than the hardware it was originally developed and tested on. A lot of games even older than that would get around some of these problems by syncing game play with the speed of the processor, so these games would basically become unplayable after a few years because they're just too fast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
