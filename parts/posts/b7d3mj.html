<p>How fine-tuned are the current maps for predicted regional changes? </p>
<p>Are there any models that let you feed in weather data (from a local airport for example) and get out predicted changes? </p>
<p>Are there any that would let me feed in temperature and humidity readings from my backyard and get super fine scale predictions?</p>
<p>The reason I'm asking is because I want to if my area will be able to support certain crops in 25 years. I want to match up the conditions of my spot 25 years from now with the conditions of where that crop is grown currently.</p>
<p>Edit: I've gotten a lot of great replies but they all require some thought and reading. I won't be able to reply to everyone but I wanted to thank this great community for all the info</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The world of climate change projections is not an easy one to just dip your toes into.</p>
<p>Because the results depend on the way the model is built, the community has settled on a &quot;model intercomparison&quot; framework in which different research groups build and release their models separately, using agreed upon formats and emissions scenarios. Researchers who use these projections usually analyze the entire set of models (or at least a representative subset), which allows the analyses to integrate over the variation in models rather than assuming that any single model is best.</p>
<p>Then there's also a series of agreed upon climate forcing estimates that all models within this framework use that additionally allow researchers to integrate over uncertainty in how much CO2 we will continue to emit and the rate of change in emissions.</p>
<p>To get a quick overview of these complexities, take a look at this page: <a href="http://www.worldclim.org/cmip5_5m" target="_blank">http://www.worldclim.org/cmip5_5m</a></p>
<p>These data are split into two climate periods, 2041-2060 and 2061-2080. Then, within each of those climate periods you have a list of 19 different models (GCMs, Global Circulation Models) as rows and 4 different emissions scenarios, RCP2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5, which basically represent increasing amounts of CO2 released into the atmosphere, though to really understand their differences, you should do more research on them. Finally, you also have to decide which climate variables you want to view, on the WorldClim page you can get monthly minimum or maximum temperatures, precipitation, or a set of variables called &quot;bioclim&quot; variables that derive things like temperature or precipitation seasonality or interactions between temperature and precipitation.</p>
<p>So, it's not quite as easy as using Google Maps, right? You don't just open up a map and click on your location and see what it will be. This is just the nature of trying to predict the future in a scientific context. It's more about narrowing down the range of variation and uncertainty than just getting a single value.</p>
<p>However, if you're aware of these complexities, there actually is an online viewer that's a bit easier to use: <a href="http://regclim.coas.oregonstate.edu/visualization/index.html" target="_blank">http://regclim.coas.oregonstate.edu/visualization/index.html</a></p>
<p>That tool allows you to see either county-level data for the U.S. or nation-level data for the world in an online app (requires Flash). It's certainly easier for most people than using the GeoTIFFs on the other page I linked, which would requires some Python or R scripting to query. The thing here is just to keep track of the differences between different models and different emissions scenarios.</p>
<p>Note that both of these data sets are based on the CMIP5 data and modeling framework, which is now a generation behind. A more complex set of CMIP6 models have been out for a couple years, but I don't know of any easy to use tools for viewing their projections.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Regional climate modeler here. </p>
<p>Regional climate models can be incredibly precise, down to grid points of 1 square km or less, but at a certain point modeling changes in temperature and humidity (or anything) at that scale becomes a) unimportant, as changes would be incredibly small across those distances, and b) computationally/time expensive, to the point of futility. That said there are plenty of models which run at 3-9 km grid point resolution (for limited areas of the Earth, not the entire thing) all the time and help weather forecasters forecast the weather. </p>
<p>However, predicting changes at that scale say 25-30 years out requires a global climate model, which generally has grid point resolution closer to 50 km. This isn't bad, you'd still get meaningful data for your application, but not down to differences between say small towns a few miles apart. In general, when predicting climate like this we're looking at long-term averages and large areas, and when we say that &quot;it'll be more humid&quot; for example, that doesn't mean every day or even every month, it means averaged over years, there'd be an increase. Same as weather vs. climate, snow doesn't mean global warming is wrong, etc. That should answer question 1.</p>
<p>Q2: No, you'd need to feed in data from nearby as well. The amount/resolution of that data depends on what you want for your output. Generally, said data is produced by another climate model, since we don't just have climate sensors out in the wild every few km.</p>
<p>Q3: Definitely no</p>
<p>You should be able to get some info from your state climate office or some regional reports that will give you a better picture for your area, as opposed to a giant global picture from an IPCC report. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer (as others have said) is no, climate models currently do not have have the resolution to realistically estimate climate conditions at a farm-scale level in coming decades. The current generation of models (i.e. <a href="https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/889476.pdf" target="_blank">CMIP6</a> models) have resolutions on the order of 100km (I think, I mostly still work with the older CMIP5 data, which tends to be 100-250km grid sizes). This means that there is 100km between each grid point of the models. As a general rule, atmospheric phenomena (storms, fronts, etc) aren't well resolved unless they're larger than about 7x the grid size, so these models wouldn't be resolving many features smaller than about 700km across (approximately). This makes a determination of something like what crops will work well in an area difficult, since many precipitation events are much smaller that this scale (i.e. typical thunderstorms in the midwest US)</p>
<p>There are efforts to do what's called downscaling, where you take the outputs from coarse resolution models, and tries to better approximate the local conditions, either by running a high resolution model over a small area (dynamical downscaling), or by creating a statistical model to use the historical relationships between the large scale (synoptic) features and the local weather (statistical downscaling). Both approaches have their downsides, dynamic downscaling is computationally expensive, taking boundary conditions from a larger model resolution brings a whole set of problems. Statistical downscaling assumes the relationships over the past 30+ years between the large scale features and the local weather will be the same in the future, which is unlikely to be fully true, and requires a good record of observations from anywhere you want to downscale for. Your best bet would probably be to look at downscaled projections, if they exist for your area. You can find some for the US here: <a href="https://gdo-dcp.ucllnl.org/downscaled_cmip_projections/#Projections:%20Complete%20Archives" target="_blank">https://gdo-dcp.ucllnl.org/downscaled_cmip_projections/#Projections:%20Complete%20Archives</a>, but take them with a grain of salt. Also, those are just the data files (netCDF format), but I don't know where to find processed products with nice graphics. </p>
<p>As a side note, the <a href="https://climatemodeling.science.energy.gov/projects/energy-exascale-earth-system-model" target="_blank">DOE has a project</a> developing a climate model for use on their new super computers (summit and the upcoming frontier) with the goal to be able to run climate simulations on a ~15-25km grid, similar to the scale of current global weather models. That will help with regional representations, and should help with a lot of the potentially consequential impacts of climate change, especially changes in precipitation that are very dependent on processes that are currently sub-grid scale. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
