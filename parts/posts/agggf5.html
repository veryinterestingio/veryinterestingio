		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>mostly semantics, but there is pulsed dc, variable frequency ac (trap or sine), polyphase ac, some motors even run on polyphase pulsed dc.  And if you have a dc motor/generator, is it &quot;AC&quot; when the current reverses direction (but the voltage doesn't)?  Plus probably lots of things I'm not considering.</p>
<p>edit, i.e. what would you consider a cathode ray tube?  The electrons don't completely reverse but they are still going in many directions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surprisingly complicated question. It's important how you are defining electricity. I believe you are talking about the stuff that powers our machines which is basically us manipulating the electromagnetic force in clever ways. Two of those main ways are AC and DC which both deal with the direction of the flow of electrons through some conductive, usually solid medium. Others in this thread have given good examples of some other manipulations.</p>
<p>But there are forms of electrical activity that don't necessarily fit either definition. A great example: neurons and other electrogenic cells. Let's take the specific example of aural signal transduction in the cochlea. You have little hairs in your cochlea which bend in response to pressure waves generated when sound enters the ear. When they bend, it deforms a protein embedded in the cell membrane, and because of the large amount of potassium in the fluid there, potassium ions rush into the cell through the hole. Like electrons in a wire, potassium ions carry a charge (positive though, not negative). The rest of the cell membrane is insulative, so the cell works a little like a capacitor, with the charges collecting and generating a potential difference. With all this new potassium, the cell in this region becomes depolarized (at a higher potential) than the surrounding fluid. </p>
<p>This signal gets to the brain via projection neurons on the auditory nerve which have long axons traveling from the peripheral systems to the central nervous system. Here, one end of the neuron is depolarized, presumably from interactions with the hair cell described above. This field is initially local, but the potential difference exerts a force on nearby voltage-gated sodium channels (more proteins embedded in the membrane) which twists them open. This causes sodium to rush in, depolarizing that next section of the neuron. This process repeats all the way down to the central nervous system, where the projection neuron dumps some neurotransmitters onto the signal's destination in the brain.</p>
<p>So here is an example of an electrically mediated signalling system which doesn't really fit either definition. The main point about all this is that &quot;electricity&quot; is just our manipulation of some fundamental forces, and there could be other, better, more efficient methods out there. It just depends on your goal. But yeah AC and DC are currently our main ways of providing power to our machinery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spin current could be considered a different form of electric current, depending on your definition, since it involves the transfer of electron spin orientation rather than charge.</p>
<p>The field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spintronics" target="_blank">spintronics</a> has been around for decades but is now starting to produce real-world technologies. As spintronic devices do not have the speed, power and efficiency limitations of today's DC electronics, they could-- eventually--lead to a new computing revolution. Or at least improvements of 1-2 orders of magnitude over 'conventional' devices.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That depends on how you define AC and DC, which are really just convenient <em>practical</em> terms for common ways in which we use electricity (and sometimes other things!). There is no hard universal definition.</p>
<p>AC and DC strictly speaking stand for &quot;Alternating Current&quot; and &quot;Direct Current&quot;, but these days we use them to mean alternating or direct (constant) <em>anything</em>. They somewhat nebulously mean &quot;changes or reverses in time&quot; and &quot;does not change or reverse in time&quot;. Thus, we often speak of &quot;AC current&quot; (ATM machine anyone?) but also &quot;AC voltage&quot;.</p>
<p>Can you have a DC voltage and an AC current at the same time? Absolutely. For example, take a rechargeable battery that is half-way charged, and connect it to an AC current source. In this silly contraption, the voltage across the battery would stay roughly constant, as the battery is being slightly charged and discharged every cycle of the AC current, staying at about the same overall level. Thus, DC voltage. The current would be properly AC, as it flows in and out of the battery, alternating every half cycle.</p>
<p>We also often consider AC and DC as two <em>components</em> that go together. Consider an AC voltage that varies between -1V and 1V. Now take a 1V DC voltage. What happens when you add them together? You get an AC voltage between 0V and 2V. We might call that <em>2V peak-to-peak AC with a 1V DC component</em>. Often, the distinction between an AC component and a DC component is very important in engineering - e.g. in some systems you might want to reduce the AC component, while in others you might want to reduce the DC component. Other times you might interpret it differently; for example, some people might call that 0V-to-2V waveform &quot;pulsed DC&quot;, not &quot;AC&quot;. And of course we haven't mentioned exactly what <em>shape</em> that AC component might have - is it a sine wave, a square wave, or something else? Some people might categorize those differently as AC or DC.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is just how constant does a voltage or current have to be to be called &quot;DC&quot;? For example, when you put a battery in a device, its voltage slowly but steadily decreases. Is that truly just DC? Some would say there is a slight, very low frequency AC component. Similarly, when you turn the power to devices on and off, you are effectively creating AC current components when you flip the switch. Since AC frequency can vary widely, from less than 1Hz up to many GHz in practical systems, in some systems you might consider some decidedly varying things as DC. For example, 50Hz mains &quot;AC&quot; is practically DC from the point of view of a computer running at GHz speeds.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, when you have electricity flowing through a pair of wires between circuits, the current and voltage involved can change in any way with respect to time. We somewhat arbitrarily classify those as AC and DC, but really, that's an oversimplification and things can get as complicated as you want.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to Fourier's theorem, you can make any function by adding an infinite amount of sinusoids. So, in a way, all electricity is AC with extra steps.</p>
<p>However, if we're talking about signals rather than power and not going off that weird technicality above, your CPU uses a clock, which is a square wave (a periodic function with only two values: logical high and logical low) that tells the components of the CPU that it's time to do stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
