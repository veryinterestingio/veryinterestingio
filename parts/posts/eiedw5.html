		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From my ultrasound work, I can measure the speed of blood flowing from the proximal aorta at  100-200 cm/s at systole. Obvs that changes based on if you’re a kid all the way to being a pensioner. Other things that can change the speed are presence of disease and heart conditions. But yeah, pumping 5-6L of blood a min around the body I would expect the speed to be pretty quick.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><h1></h1>
<h1>1. How fast?</h1>
<ul>
<li>The heart beats around 2.8 billion times in a lifetime of 70 years. The roughly 5 L of blood an adult male continually pumps (4 L for women) flow at an average speed of 4.8-6.3 Km\h (3 to 4 mph) — walking speed. That’s fast enough so that a drug injected into an arm reaches the brain in only a few seconds. But this blood speed is just an average. It starts out by rushing through the aorta at an impressive 15 inches a second, then slows to different rates in various parts of the body. </li>
<li>
<p>How far?</p>
<p>These 5 liters of <strong>blood</strong> circulate through the body three times every minute. In one day, the <strong>blood</strong> travels a total of 19,000 km (12,000 miles)—that's four times the <strong>distance</strong> across the US from coast to coast. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>2.  How much force ?</h1>
<p>How much energy does the heart need? Use the following equations and numbers:<br />
Mechanical Power = Pmax(C,O)<br />
Chemical Power = Mechanical Power/nth<br />
Systolic Pressure: 16 kN/m2<br />
Cardiac Output: 107 × 10−6 m3/s<br />
nth = 0.2<br />
Answer:<br />
Pmech = (16 kN/m2)(107 × 10−6 m3/s) = 1.71 (Nm)/s [W]<br />
Pchem = 1.71 (Nm)/s = 8.6 (Nm)/s (got this from the internet)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>3.  Is there a capillary leading to every individual cell?</h1>
<p>Almost yes, but when capillaries reach their end and turn back to become veins, Oxygen flows out of blood vessels, depending on the oxygen gradient, leading to the RBCs offloading oxygen much more the further you get away from the heart, and it's then when the RBCs affinity for CO2 becomes higher, bringing it back to the heart\lungs.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>4.  And how exactly does blood get through tiny areas in the body, is there some mechanism for even distribution of pressure?  (The blood in my pinky toe is so far from the heart, how does it get back?)</h1>
<p>There is something called interstitial fluid and inter cellular spaces, where the contents of the blood distribute their, also depending on concentration gradients, like oxygen, nutrients, sugar, medicine.. etc</p>
<p>Regarding you're pinky toe: the heart which is the main pump, pushes the blood through the arteries, when the arteries become smaller, they become arterioles.. then capillaries --&gt; no it's time to go back, those capillaries turn into venules, those venules grow into veins, then continue the blood cycle all the way back to the hear. That's why it's called a cycle. Every amount of blood pumped by the heart with each systole(contraction) beat, the same amount comes into the heart during diastole (relaxation)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as my understanding goes an adult averages about 5-6L of blood. Your heart basically circulates that volume every minute at rest. Blood travels through the arteriolar system away from the heart and to the tissues. The heart, brain, and kidneys take up the majority of supply and you will find are supplied by very large vessles. </p>
<p>As for the other part of your question, the large arteries branch into smaller and smaller arteriols. These blood vessels are lined with muscle that can contract and relax to control flow. These muscles respond to hormones in the blood and chemicals released by the surrounding tissue that basically tell the vessel if more flow is needed. Capillaries are the smallest vessles and are regulated in a similar manner. These vessels are where things like gas exchange occur.</p>
<p>To return all that volume to the heart is somewhat more complex as some fluid has leaked from the capillaries into the surrounding tissue. Basically a separate collection system called the lymphatic system collects this leaked fluid and dumps it back into circulation. Otherwise fluid is returned to the heart via the venous system. It is aided by valves and your muscles to keep blood flowing one way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The top answer (100-200 cm/s = 2-4 miles per hour) is correct but only applies to the largest arteries at peak flow. This diagram gives more details: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Rz1Swgt.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/Rz1Swgt.png</a> — it shows the variation in flow speed (measured in cm/s) over the course of one heartbeat, in arteries sorted from largest to smallest.</p>
<p>In the ascending aorta, directly after the heart, the blood flows fastest but the flow speed also varies the most: just after the heart contracts, the speed reaches the aforementioned 100-200 cm/s, but when the heart relaxes the flow can even reverse slightly.</p>
<p>In blood vessels located more distally, the flow &quot;smoothes out&quot;: for example in the anterior tibial artery (rightmost artery in the left part of the image) the flow speed only reaches about 30-40 cm/s at most, but the flow is sustained for a much larger fraction of the heartbeat.</p>
<p>In arterioles and capillaries (right part of the image), the flow is now continuous, never slowing down to 0 anymore, but even in the largest arterioles the speed is about 2 cm/s = one inch per second on average. In capillaries there is a nearly constant but very slow flow of a fraction of a centimeter per second.</p>
<p>I don't have a good diagram for the venous system but blood flow in veins is generally much slower than in arteries, reaching about 1 cm/s in venoles and small veins and 5-10 cm/s in the largest veins.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From my understanding, there are not individual capillaries leading to each cell of the human body. Some organs are highly vascularized and have capillaries distributed densely while other organs do not. One example would be the different layers of your skin. From the hypodermis (deepest layer) and then to the dermis and finally epidermis (outermost layer) there is decreasing prevalence of blood vessels. Nutrients and oxygen are transported via other means such as diffusion or other forms of active transport. </p>
<p>In regards to your last question about fluids returning from the small places in your body, that has to do with the lymphatic system. A series of tiny ducts runs through the human body similar to blood vessels. These ducts collect extracellular fluid that may have been forced out of the blood due to the pressure of circulation. These ducts all lead back to the heart to be deposited back into the circulatory system. This fluid is transported through the body whenever we move and contract skeletal muscle. In your example of a pinky toe, fluid that made it's way out of the blood is collected in lymphatic ducts. When the foot is moved, say when walking, it squeezes the ducts and forces the liquid towards the center of the body with the use of one way valves (similar valves exist in our veins to aid blood in returning to the heart without flowing backwards). This is one reason why movement is important for good health as it aids in returning stagnant fluid and blood to the heart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
