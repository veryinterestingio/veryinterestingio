		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To start off, phones don’t know exactly what percentage they are at. The battery percent the phone displays is an estimate based on the current voltage level of the battery and how much energy it has consumed. It is fairly accurate but it’s nowhere near the 1% precision that phones will display. </p>
<p>Now, that being said let’s get on to the question. Phones do have charging circuitry that shuts off power at full charge. The advice that you should always take it off the charger isn’t really that useful these days for that reason. However, there is some negligible excess wear that occurs as a result of the charging circuitry allowing a small discharge and then recharging. Typically the phone will be allowed to discharge a couple of percent (while showing 100%) before being recharged. You are also relying on that circuitry not to fail, which is probably why it’s still recommended to remove it. If that circuit fails the battery could in theory overcharge and be damaged or cause a fire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As many have said, modern smart phones do stop charging when the battery gets to 100%.  And they will draw power from the charger, not the battery, to keep the phone running while leaving the battery at 100%.  Then, after you disconnect from the charger, the phone will use power and draw the battery down--slowly if you aren't using it and faster if you are.</p>
<p>Batteries age faster if they sit at 100% than if they sit at a more moderate charge level, in the 40 to 80% range.  So the reason to disconnect it is not that it is getting charged more.  Rather, it's that getting away from 100% sooner is better than staying at 100% for a while.  If the phone is turned all the way off, and you charge it to 100%, it will stay very close to 100% if you leave it sit.  That's just as bad as leaving on the charger.  Neither is very bad, mind you, but you won't need to replace the battery quite as soon if it's treated more gently.</p>
<p>As far as whether it could stop at 80%, it could, and that would be better.  Most phones don't have that capability, by it is actually <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-13/features/" target="_blank">built into iOS 13</a> (search for &quot;battery&quot; on that page).  The idea of that feature is to charge to 80% when you plug it in in the evening, and then hold at 80% until a little before you disconnect it in the morning, when it charges up to 100% so you start the day with a full charge.  That way it spends less time at 100% overnight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
