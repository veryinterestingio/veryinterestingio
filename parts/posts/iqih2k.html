		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ol>
<li>
<p>Humans live far longer lives than most other animals. Mice live a few years, dogs a couple of decades. Humans need to keep the teeth for 80+ years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Humans do not have regenerating or replacing teeth. We get two sets, that is it. Crocs replace teeth regularly, as do sharks. Rodents have teeth that grow forever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Humans eat sugary foods that allow bacteria to grow rampant. Animals tend to eat less nutritionally dense foods that doesn't foster bacteria as readily.</p>
</li>
<li>Animals don't have proper oral health. The ones that have rotten teeth and infected jaws, they die. We humans just find that to be unacceptable.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>keep in mind that most animals don’t live as long as people do. in the wild, you wear your teeth down faster but you also don’t need them as long. domesticated animals absolutely should have their teeth routinely brushed and even cleaned in order to keep them healthy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do. A lot of old dogs and cats are missing teeth and have tooth infections because of lack of dental care. </p>
<p>We actually brush our dog and cat’s teeth at night. There’s  an enzymatic toothpaste that we use. We’re a pretty cute sight, the whole family in the bathroom at night brushing teeth. My cat likes the beef flavor, dog likes the chicken.  </p>
<p>It’s made a big difference and my old cat hasn’t lost any teeth yet. My 2 y/o golden’s teeth are so white that people comment on them. Most giggle when I tell them that I brush her teeth but her breath is fresh and no dental problems!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both my 11 year old dogs have about 5 teeth each left in their heads. Regular brushing by us could have saved some or most of them. To be fair, they were working dogs prior to being petted out, and their previous diet was a mix of raw hamburger and mush soaked low grade kibble. Their diet, just like ours caused tooth decay from lack of care.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
