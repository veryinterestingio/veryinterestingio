		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The 8/8/8 cycle isn't based on any science. It was quite literally made up inorder to get a nicely split day for factory work. It allowed for neatly split shifts.   </p>
<p>People's need for sleep varies from 6-9 hrs depending on the person, and when they naturally sleep changes with age and from person to person. Majority of people are &quot;day people&quot; who sleep during the night best, and the rest are split between &quot;night people&quot; and &quot;morning people&quot; who either sleep later or earlier.  </p>
<p>8hrs day cycle starting at 6am, was totally made up during industrialisation. Before this, it was very normal for people to even sleep in two different phases during the night, and do things inbetween. This was totally normal and common.   </p>
<p>If you want to figure out your body's needs for sleep. Go to bed when you are tired, wake up when you wake up. Then allow your body to find it's natural rhythm. And hope that this doesn't deviate from the one society expects of you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>8 hours of work.
8 hours for family time/other stuff.
8 hours to sleep.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>8 actually works, though. Your 5th cycle ends at 7h30m. If you wake up within the first 45-60 minutes of a cycle, you'll be fine, REM is the last 30ish. So, 8 hours actually works. But, you should plan on getting 6.5-7 hours, instead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've read that the first sleep cycle takes longer to, well, cycle. about an extra half hour. the subsequent cycles run about an hour and a half.<br />
hence the even numbered 8 hours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
