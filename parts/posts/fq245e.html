		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As always when it comes to epidemics and pandemics, a combination of factors.</p>
<p>The 1918-1919 H1N1 pandemic had two waves, with those who had contracted the flu in the first wave gaining immunity to the flu during the second wave. The second wave did result in more fatalities than the first wave, but that was due to the virus mutating to a deadlier strain which was then spread primarily by soldiers being transported to crowded hospitals on crowded trains whilst soldiers with the milder strain remained near the front line.</p>
<p>This second wave killing off more of the population results in less viable hosts to carry the virus. The elderly, who are typically prime candidates for other flu strains, had picked up partial immunity to the 1918 strain of H1N1 from the 1898-1905 outbreaks of the H3N8 “Russian flu” subtype. With most of the adults either already infected/dead, being treated for the flu, or already immune from the first wave, it essentially caused what has been termed social distancing during the current SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) - hosts were unable to encounter fresh hosts for the virus and, without a host and being an obligate parasite, the virus begins to die off.</p>
<p>Mutation, not to a deadlier strain, but to a milder strain, is also another factor. This occurs genetically when the virus is not encountering as many hosts, thus having to mutate to cause milder symptoms so that hosts with the new milder strain will spread it more easily. However, it’s easier to recover from a mild strain than a severe one, so still fewer people died from the 1918 H1N1 strain.</p>
<p>These factors, combined with medical treatment of flu sufferers, made the 1918-1919 H1N1 pandemic a flash in the pan (compared to other pandemics - smallpox, bubonic plague, and so on); it was virulent, but it was short-lived. It was short-lived because it was virulent, it was almost <em>too</em> good at what it did, to the point that the virus ran out of viable hosts to continue the pandemic.</p>
<p>Now, none of that is to say that H1N1 is gone, it isn’t. H1N1 was responsible for the 2009 swine flu outbreak, as well as avian flu (A/duck/Alberta/35/76 - Influenza type A/origin: duck/found in Alberta, Canada/ strain 35/ identified in 1976), and is ever-present in a small percentage of the human population. The 1918-1919 H1N1 pandemic essentially ran out of steam and fizzled out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many precautions were taken but not many nationally. Schools were closed, theaters were closed(most people didn’t eat out at that time so there wasn’t much change in the restaurants), public gatherings were banned, etc. </p>
<p>Schools used to use communal cups for drinking for the children. This practice was banned. </p>
<p>San Francisco fined people that were out in public without masks $5($93 equivalent now). </p>
<p>World war 1 ended at the end of 1918 and many of the doctors came back to the US. </p>
<p>A lot of factors helped, including social distancing, but ultimately it just ran its course as all viruses do. Either you survive and develop natural defenses in your body or you don’t.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
