		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several technologies could be eked out of a broken phone in that era.</p>
<ul>
<li>The printed circuit board was first patented in 1925 and is easily discoverable by microscopic inspection.</li>
<li>Spectroscopic study of the Gorilla Glass could reveal the secret of that technology, and it's not hard to imagine them discovering the underlying process (tempering glass in hot alkali metal) to reproduce it.</li>
<li>The Neodymium magnets used in the speaker and microphone weren't invented until the 1980s.  These are macroscopic components with a notable magnetic field.  It's likely these would be discovered and chemically reverse engineered.  If they figured out the powder metallurgy used in their construction that would be a big boon too.</li>
<li>The screen's Indium Tin Oxide coating, being transparent, would be easy to overlook.  If they discovered that they would have the secret sauce to making LCDs and touchscreens.</li>
<li>Reverse engineering the LEDs in the display backlight and flashlight would be very careful work.  The amount of dopants in them is infinitesimal, and that's the secret sauce they'd need to discover how it works.  If they succeeded, figuring out solid state diodes 40 years earlier would have been a huge leap.</li>
<li>Lithium battery chemistry would be a huge leap forward.</li>
<li>The semiconductors in the chips is small enough that I don't think it would be reverse engineer-able until the invention of electron microscopy.  It's likely that these would be destroyed before they unlock them.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>All of this assumes that the scientists realized the value of the device.  If it was ignored or written off as a hoax then it could easily be lost to history.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They would be able to piece together basic functions such as the vibration engine (a tiny motor) via electrical probing. If they did mass-spec they might be able to figure out the exact elements in various components, giving them a leg up in replicating the technology.</p>
<p>Being there are various components that work when resoldered, they may also begin theorizing about solid state switching components and their utility as computing elements. The lithium battery would also provide a very important insight into battery chemistry and design, possibly leapfrogging electrical storage techniques.</p>
<p>Depending on the model, they may also be able to study the display panel, but unfortunately that is the area I have the least hope for. There are far too many layers and components to be able to accurately reconstruct what is going on inside the device.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a story of a British engineer in the 50s who was asked to test what he was told was &quot;a new type of valve&quot; that had arrived from the US. Since he wasn't told that they were actually silicon transistors and that they ran on much smaller currents than a valve would, he broke all of them trying to test them and reported that they must have come from a faulty batch.</p>
<p>Trying to reverse engineer a technological artifact that's 100 years in advance of what can be made today would almost certainly result in breaking the thing out of ignorance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think they'd understand much of it (EE background here).</p>
<p>The small battery would amaze them.  I don't think they'd be able to figure out what an I.C. or SOC was given all  they'd have would be a microscope.  Electronic test equipment was pretty limited back then.  They might be able to figure out what a diode did as well as the SMT resistors and capacitors.</p>
<p>No way would they be able to understand any software aspects of the product.</p>
<p>They might be able to see some things with cross sectioning the components but my guess is they wouldn't understand hardly anything with a piece of silicon on it that was of any complexity.</p>
<p>That's my opinion.  You asked for it.</p>
<p>An aside...<br />
I've always toyed with the idea of a typical electronics engineer being transported back to the 1800s knowing what we know today. What could we actually <em>build</em> given the tools and materials that were present back then?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In 1920, the only plastics we had were bakelite and parkesine.  The plastic components of the iPhone, if given to a competent chemist, would jump-start the plastic industry 20-30 years ahead of its time.  It's not difficult to figure out that modern plastics are sourced from hydrocarbons, and that gets you PVC decades early.</p>
<p>The chemically-tempered glass display is something that a chemist will marvel at.  I'm not sure if they can figure out it's an alkali-aluminosilicate, but if they do then that's a 40 year advancement in glass and ceramic technology.</p>
<p>The circuitry might give electrical engineers the concept of the transistor early, but there isn't much they can do with that.  The technology to create transistors isn't going to exist until the 1950s, minimum.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm most excited about the iPhone's antenna.  It's a bizarre side lobe design that is 60-70 years ahead of 1920 technology, and it's not difficult to understand if you realize that it is, indeed, an antenna.  Radio physicists will leapfrog decades with that design, and we'll get better radio communications and maybe television much earlier because of it.</p>
<p>The upshot of dropping an iPhone in 1920 is that WWII is going to look a *lot* different, with commonplace plastics, superior radio technology, and improved ceramic engineering.  I hope to hell that the Allies are the ones who find that iPhone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
