		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Standard precautions for patient care involves several ways to prevent the spread of diseases, but the main one is washing your hands all the time. Healthcare professionals wash their hands before they leave any room and might even use hand sanitizer between rooms. </p>
<p>Beyond that it's whatever is needed on a case by case basis. Gloves are always worn when you're going to be touching a patient or doing any kind of assessment on them. A mask is worn if the patient has something airborne or is coughing. There is also a disposable robe one can wear as personal protection equipment if the patient has somthing that can be picked up via contact (usually MRSA).</p>
<p>There's many others but those are what I've encountered the most often. It helps to be mindful of your surroundings and what symptoms the patient has</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Most of the time when you get sick, it's because you touched something with your hands and then later touched your mouth, your nose, or some food you were going to eat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other people have answered your question (hand washing, face masks, etc) I just wanted to add that it is very much a popular belief amongst all kinds of medical professionals that you will get a ton of minor infections in your first year or so of seeing patients. Doubly true for your first rotation around kids, those little germ factories.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We wash our hands every time we go into and patient room, and every time we leave.</p>
<p>If somebody has an infectious illness in the hospital, they often will have special &quot;precautions&quot; for their room.  For example, if somebody has a diarrheal illness, they will be on contact precautions.  This means that everybody that goes in and out will put on a special disposable gown and wear gloves while in the room.  We might wear masks in rooms where people have illness spread by droplets.</p>
<p>Sometimes a kid sneezes right in your fucking face and you get sick anyhow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
