		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many antihistamines contain &quot;HCL&quot; as part of their generic name. For example, zyrtec is &quot;Cetirizine HCL&quot;, and Azelastine (a nazal spray) is &quot;Azelastine HCL.&quot; Does &quot;HCL&quot; stand for hydrochloric acid, or does it refer to something else in this context? What role does HCL play in these medicines? Is it an antihistamine itself, or does it somehow enhance the other antihistamines contained in the medicine? It's probably fairly obvious, but I don't know very much about chemistry, so a dumbed-down answer would be extremely appreciated.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>HCl stands for &quot;hydrochloride&quot;. It is because the cetirizine molecule is formed into a &quot;salt&quot;. There are a few reasons for choosing to use a salt instead of just the active ingredient molecule by itself; probably the two most common reasons are solubility (so that it can be more readily absorbed by the body) and shelf stability.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The active ingredient in such medicines are called amines, that are water insoluble. Converting the amine into a hydrochloride makes them water soluble, which means they dissolve in the gastrointestinal tract and are able to be absorbed into the bloodstream more quickly. </p>
<p>The HCl in such medicines refers to <em>hydrochloride</em>, not <em>hydrochloric acid</em>. Of cource, the HCl in the final compound is introduced by the reaction between hydrochloric acid (acid) and the amine (base), which produces the final hydrochloride (salt).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
