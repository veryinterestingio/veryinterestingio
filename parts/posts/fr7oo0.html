		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Species with vertical pupils are more likely to be ambush predators that are active both day and night.<br />
Vertical pupils are better for judging distance by reducing <a href="https://www.cell.com/cms/attachment/523303/3572707/gr1.jpg" target="_blank">binocular disparity</a> (the effect where if you focus on an object and close one eye, the object appears in slightly different places in each eye individually) and blur (where objects at different distances are out of focus). Slit pupils also allow much greater control of light with dilation and contraction at a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982206011961" target="_blank">135 fold difference in some animals</a>
(compared to 10 fold in humans), which protects their sensitive eyes when they move around during the day. </p>
<p>Animals with horizontally elongated pupils (like <a href="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/441cb4a491321c808649f8d67d5e404f.jpg" target="_blank">goats</a>) are likely to be <a href="http://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2142714" target="_blank">herbivorous prey species with eyes on the sides of their heads</a>.<br />
Horizontal pupils expand the field of view, and also means the pupils are parallel to the ground so they can see better while grazing or browsing and limits intense light directly from the sun. They can't see as clear an image, but they don't need a crisp image of an approaching predator, they mostly just respond to movement. </p>
<p>Circular pupils are linked to active foragers, or animals that chase down their prey. They're also <a href="http://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2142714" target="_blank">found in taller animals</a>.<br />
They see <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982206011961" target="_blank">well in low light</a>
(i.e. dusk and dawn) and daylight conditions, but not so much overnight. We typically see better color and details, which is useful for identifying fruits, berries, etc  when foraging. We have a wider field of vision than slit pupils, though not as wide as horizontal since we're still potentially prey animals and can detect movement at a distance. </p>
<p>And there's a few other weird shapes which are more specially adapted to their specific niche -
like <a href="http://www.koryoswrites.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/609px-Cuttlefishhead.jpg" target="_blank">W pupils in cuttlefish</a> (in bright conditions) which have two fovea in each eye so they can <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698913000539" target="_blank">have a clear view in the frontal and caudal periphery of the visual field</a>, as well as greater ability to adapt to varying light conditions,
and <a href="http://www.koryoswrites.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/757px-Gecko-oeil.jpg" target="_blank">pinholes in some lizards</a> which are great for detecting perfect striking distance.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's to do with diffraction and physics, I spent an evening reading a paper on this once trying to figure out what advantage the Octopus eye has, it is a horizontal shape with globules on the end.</p>
<p>Anyway, a vertical eye slit causes light from different distances away to diffract in different ways, leading to a kind of blur as a function of distance. This allows predators to accurately gauge distance (their brain has a cue at least to estimate it) to a prey. Vertical slits are most common in ambush predators, so presumably for them depth awareness is of considerably importance.</p>
<p>Note the vertical slit does the opposite for horizontal spacing, the eye has a poorer discernment of wide field images. There is no blur as a function of x, if x is horizontal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the circular aperture gives a bit of both. It's a balance, and a good bet for prey, as they will be able to judge movements in a wide field of view, as they  will have chromatic aberration as a function of position horizontally, a cue their brain can use. This is likely useful for seeing movement on a horizon in a wide area, far more useful for a prey than a predator it seems.</p>
<p>Here's the paper, it's great</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are actually more like 3 kinds of eyes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Round pupil (what we have), bad low light but able to see far away and have everything in focus</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vertical slit, (predators?), can open wide and let in much more light at night. Top to bottom in focus but sides are less in focus. </p>
</li>
<li>Horizontal slit, (prey?) also great low light, horizon in focus, but top and bottom not. </li>
</ol>
<p>There are subset of each other those as well, like seals have pear shaped pupils and other animals have different variations. </p>
<p>What is interesting is these different pupils evolved independently in many different animals which demonstrates that they provide significant advantages in different situations. Round pupils tend to be better in daytime while slitted ones are much better at night and for camouflage. As daytime hunters we have round pupils while housecats are more nocturnal hunters and have vertical slits. Larger cats tend to have round, i’m not entirely sure why but maybe because round eyes are better to see far away across large plains and the low light is not needed when a bright moon isn’t obstructed by trees (just a guess ofc).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
