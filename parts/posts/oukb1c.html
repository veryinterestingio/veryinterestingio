Whether it is easier access to more natural resources, more fertile land, temperate climate, less geologically active, less chance of flooding or drought, or easier access by land, it's clear that a lot of factors are at play. Is there an index to rank the most habitable places for humans, or an index to estimate the human carrying capacity of a land area?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also maybe not exactly what you're looking for, but versions of something like a &quot;natural hazards index&quot; exist, which attempt to codify a variety of natural hazards and generalize them into a single index. For example, here is one such index for the <a href="https://ncdp.columbia.edu/library/mapsmapping-projects/us-natural-hazards-index/" target="_blank">US</a>. Organizations like the world bank attempt similar indices at the global level, e.g., <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/7376" target="_blank">this</a> or <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/15865" target="_blank">this</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One tricky part of this is that what's &quot;conducive to civilization&quot; depends on the traits of the civilization.  For example, periodically flooding river valleys were very important for many civilizations in the ancient world, because they allowed agriculture to flourish.  But in the modern world, the rise of modern plows and water wells means that the worlds' great grasslands have far surpassed them as fertile breadbaskets...but at the same time increased transport has disconnected cities from the need to have food supplies in the immediate area.  Similarly, prior to fossil fuels the difficulty of heating housing in northern climates caused issues for cities in northerly regions, but now that heating is easier, that's less relevant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
