		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ideal locations for geothermal power are those where you can easily reach the target temperatures (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_power#Power_station_types" target="_blank">50 - 150 C depending on the type of geothermal power plant</a>) at relatively shallow depths. This essentially means that an ideal location is one where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_gradient" target="_blank">geothermal gradient</a> is relatively high in the shallow crust. Generally, geothermal gradients are higher in areas with active deformation and/or volcanic activity. If you look at a variety of efforts to map geothermal potential, e.g., these global map from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652620319211#bib58" target="_blank">Coro &amp; Trumpy, 2020</a> or these maps for Europe from <a href="https://www.geoth-energ-sci.net/2/55/2014/gtes-2-55-2014.pdf" target="_blank">Limberger et al., 2014</a>, you'll notice that the correlation between high geothermal potential and locations of active tectonics / volcanism is pretty good (though in the case of Coro &amp; Trumpy, this is kind of baked in as they're taking a machine learning approach and using earthquake activity as one of the datasets in their model).</p>
<p>Getting back to the question, theoretically you could build a geothermal plant anywhere because if you drill deep enough, you will get to your target temperature. However, there are significant differences in the depth you need to drill and thus the cost. As a trivial example, if we assume we need to drill down to a depth where the crust is 100 C, this requires very different amounts of drilling if you're in a place with a relatively high geothermal gradient of ~50C/km (so 2 km down) vs someplace with kind of the global average of 25C/km (4 km down). The Limberger analysis is useful because they go through the economics and highlight that in most cases, the cost of drilling increases non-linearly with depth (i.e., costs increase rapidly as depth of the well increases). More generally, the economics are a critical component because no one is going to expend the (significant) cost of drilling geothermal wells and building the plant itself if the cost cannot be recouped (and make a profit) by selling power over the expected lifetime of the plant. The Limberger paper considers a lot of the details and is quite useful for thinking about all the considerations going into whether a location is feasible, now or in the future, for geothermal power.</p>
<p><strong>In short,</strong> you could build a geothermal plant anywhere, but it's really only economically viable in places that have moderately high geothermal gradients, which tend to be tectonically or volcanically active locations. Much of this is driven by economics, so as power becomes more expensive and/or technology makes it cheaper to produce geothermal power from lower temperatures, the range of locations where you can build an economically viable geothermal power plant would expand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation about the geothermal gradient by u/CrustalTrudger. In conventional geothermal systems, you also need fluid and/or steam to spin a turbine. Porosity/permeability and fluid play a huge role as well as just heat.</p>
<p>Tons of geothermal exploration wells have been drilled into hot dry rock, but the absence of any fluid flow usually proves the well a failure.</p>
<p>The most productive fields today are extremely hot (600Â°F), and have either a porous reservoir or extensive interconnected fracture network, and fluid.</p>
<p>Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), which attempts to use hydraulic fracturing to stimulate a reservoir, has yet to be successfully implemented on an economically viable scale. It's a promising idea though. Hypothetically if you had a good geothermal gradient, you could create your own system and boom, megawatts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially yes, geothermal can be constructed anywhere. It isn't necessary to build geothermal in tectonic or volcanic areas since you can build geothermal power that uses a thermal exchanger to vaporize a low boiling point fluid and spin a turbine e.g. 75C works iirc. That means the temperature of the water below doesn't need to be very hot. It's also an earthquake/ eruption hazard  to drill and especially fracture or enhance your well by pumping water back underground at volcanic or fault line sites making them often a point of political deadlocking.</p>
<p>When picking sites groundwater flow should be considered. Since for bigger diameters bore holes and for deeper wells (increased pressure) you get more flow to exit the well, you can therefore adjust the output power level by drilling wider or deeper. But if you build a well that depletes the thermal groundwater resource then a new lower subterranean hydraulic equilibrium could take hold and reduce your power extraction permanently. A good target location takes into consideration watershed not just temperature gradient so that output will be sustainable.</p>
<p>Also, a great number of acids and chemicals come up from deep groundwater. One of these is valuable, methane, aka natural gas. The way natural gas is extracted is from high pressure ground water and that is similar to boring a geothermal well. Also importantly natural gas occurs at a depth where the earth's temperature warms the extracted water enough to extract heat using a thermal exchange fluid. The opportunity to combine natural gas extraction projects with geothermal energy extraction was noted in MIT's study of geothermal development. This means good geothermal opportunities can also target natural gas sites. (find the MIT report at this link <a href="https://energy.mit.edu/research/future-geothermal-energy/" target="_blank">MIT-FutureofGeothermalEnergy</a>)</p>
<p>In Iceland, they are experimenting with drilling a super deep hole towards magma where water is &gt;400C in a state called supercritical. This technology is experimental and stands to evolve geothermal technology but to my knowledge it is not operational let alone widespread. If it became very effective then supercritical geothermal would target specifically volcanic sites to get close to magma while only drilling 10-15km deep (continental crust \~30-65km).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is possible in regions without volcanic or tectonic activity.</p>
<p>My house is heated with geothermal power and I'm liviving in the east of Munich, Germany. We have absolutely no volcanic or tectonic activity here. Next sites I know of are in northern Italy or in mid-west Germany. Both several hundred kilometers away.
I might also add, that there are several geothermal powerplants in my area and there are plans and to build even more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
