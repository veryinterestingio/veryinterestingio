At least in the U.S. it is illegal for a minor to open, say, a credit line (I believe). If a company has my ssn, addresses, relatives, and tons of other personal information, why are they unable to verify my age? Is there not a way for companies to access this through a government service?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually am a fraud investigator that deals directly with identity theft.  The main issue is lenders use credit bureaus to determine your information.  Credit bureaus only verify what has been reported to them.  The reason identity thieves use children is they are below legal age for credit, so they know their bureau will have no information present.  They can essentially write the book for the social security number and build a fake identity off of it for whatever reason they need.  Usually it's to acquire goods or services.  The government can and WILL verify a social security number, but only with a signed SSA-89 form, and only if the lender requires it.  Usually they just hit up another lender until one doesn't require the form.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Full identity theft of a child is not as easy as it once was... But as far as opening credit accounts - it is not strictly illegal, but it comes with enough issues that most banks either will not issue or only issue in specific circumstances.  it is also fairly easy for the credit reporting agencies to get the information wrong on someone with limited history as they are collecting it mostly from other financial data and have limited means of verifying it even when they encounter something that might warrant it</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

In fact, early cards say on them, not to be used as identification. CGP Grey made a really good video on the subject.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
