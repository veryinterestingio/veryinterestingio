The universe is infinite, so theoretically in every possible direction we look at some point there should be a star somewhere out there, right? So by that same logic, why are there so <em>few</em> stars in the sky? I get that during the day the sun outshines them and that light pollution makes it harder to see the stars at night, but even in the middle of the desert there is still an awful lot of black in the sky. Shouldn't most if not all of it be filled with starry lights? </p>
<p>Does this make sense? Maybe I am high.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two things:</p>
<p>1) Regardless of how big the universe is, light still takes time to get places. The universe is 13.77 billion years old, so light has only had 13.77 billion years to get here. Because the universe is expanding, we can see stuff from much farther away than that, but there's still a limit on how far away stars can be and still have had time for the light to get to us.</p>
<p>2) As the universe expands, it stretches light passing through it, causing the light to be redshifted, which means it lowers in wavelength. Visible light from the very edges of the visible universe can get redshifted out of the visible spectrum and into infrared or radio waves. That's why the Cosmic Microwave Background is, well, microwaves. It used to include a <em>lot</em> of visible light, but it's so old and it's been shifted so much that it's all microwaves, now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>But I'd like to add that the night sky is really actually quite bright. If you can get somewhere without massive light pollution, there really isn't any direction which doesn't have light.</p>
<p>If you find a &quot;dark patch&quot; and look at it through a telescope you'll generally see stuff... And if there's a dark patch in that then you get a bigger telescope etc.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1) Light diffuses rather significantly with distance. The sky is indeed awash with stars, but most of them are too far away to be even remotely visible.</p>
<p>2) Because of universal expansion, light from far away sources gets redshifted to frequencies below that of human vision limits.</p>
<p>3) Expanding on the above; the night sky, bluntly, <strong>is</strong> one big light. But most of that light is at relatively low frequencies below what the human eye can see, even before redshifting is taken into account.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
