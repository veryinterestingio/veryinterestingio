When it lands in Jezero Crater next February, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/7-things-to-know-about-the-mars-2020-perseverance-rover-mission" target="_blank">Perseverance will look for signs of ancient life on Mars</a> - and gather climate and terrain data that will help pave the way for future human Martian missions.</p>
<p>Tucked underneath Perseverance until landing, NASA's <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/6-things-to-know-about-nasas-ingenuity-mars-helicopter/" target="_blank">Ingenuity Mars Helicopter</a> will be the first aircraft to attempt controlled flight on another planet; Perseverance will also collect rocks and sediments to be retrieved by a future <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PVjj0PEPMA" target="_blank">Mars Sample Return mission</a>, currently being planned by NASA and the European Space Agency. Nearly 11 million names from around the world will fly to Mars, <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8634/109-million-names-now-aboard-nasas-perseverance-mars-rover/" target="_blank">etched on three small microchips</a> Perseverance carries - but even if your name's not one of them, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/specials/virtual-guest-perseverance/index.html" target="_blank">there's plenty you can do to take part in the mission virtually</a>.</p>
