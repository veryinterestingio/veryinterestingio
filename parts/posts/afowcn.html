		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Photosynthesis requires at least blue and a little deep red (green is actually thrown back unused).</p>
<p>Firelight is 1700K-2000k, very skewed towards red and infrared.  There is very little blue.  You might cook your plants with infrared heat before making enough blue at that color temp.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not very efficient Iâ€™d imagine.  Fire produces an intolerable amount of heat for a plant.  Given the inverse-square law you could not get a fire close enough for the light to be very useful as Oznog99 said.  That said, even the light would probably be too cool to effectively grow a plant.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plants with chlorophyll absorb red and blue light most efficiently and both of those fires are &quot;full spectrum light sources&quot;.  So, yes, plants would be able to grow from such a light source, as long as the flame was kept on long enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
