		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, there is a registry for barcodes GS1.</p>
<p>For store that sell their own brand products, Lidl, Aldi, Primark, M&amp;S, Walmart, Trader Joes, etc. they can create and use their own barcodes which may be shorter than a traditional UPC, in the U.K. many I’ve seen are 8 digit barcodes. Because their goods are only sold in their stores there is no risk of the product being scanned as a different item.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are asking two possible questions.</p>
<p>How is a barcode made (a string of graphics which translates to a number or a number and text).</p>
<p>How is a product identification code (upc in the US &amp; ean everywhere else issued)</p>
<p>A barcode is just an algorithm to show text in a different way, there are several algorithms.  Plenty of free online barcode creators if you want to play around.</p>
<p>A product identification code has 4 components, country, company, product code &amp; a checksum.  If I want to put a ean on my product, I apply to my the issuer in my country and am given a block of numbers 941(NZ), 6932 (my company code, I made this up) and the rest of the digits are for me to use as I wish.  No-one else can use ean codes starting with 9416932, so as long as I have my act together, there will be no clashing.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One needs to register with the organization, they assign you a code that is the first half of the barcode. You are responsible for the second half of the code and are responsible for making sure you do not use the same code on multiple items. At least that's how it is with UPC-A, the most common code used at retail checkout.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
