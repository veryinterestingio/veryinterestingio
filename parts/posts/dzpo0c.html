		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The screens are flickering all the time. 50 or 60 or more times per second, that’s how you see movement on the screen. Our eyes however can’t see this; we can see a flicker of a few times  to 10/12 times per second (and we see them as individual images in those cases) , but going beyond 24 per second, our eyes and brains can’t process them individually and we interpret that as motion. </p>
<p>Cameras, like ones on your phone, can actually capture the moments between the image changes; so you see parts of different images being replaced by new ones, and parts remaining the same, so you get “streaks”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the type of screen, different types of screens can flicker for different reasons.</p>
<p>CRT monitors shoots a scanning electron beam that causes phosphor in the screen to glow for a couple of milliseconds.
Each frame at for example 60Hz is 16.7ms meaning the screen is mainly dark with a flickering bright image a few ms each frame. Persistence varies from model to model.</p>
<p>60hz (60 repetitions per second) seems to be around the frequency where some people see flicker and some don't.
At 85 or 100hz, most or all people see a stable image on CRT.</p>
<p>A camera however, can record flicker endlessly fast (to the technical limits at least) depending on frame rate and shutter speed.
There can also be resonance patterns in the flicker.
A 60fps video properly timed could record a 60hz CRT as simply being black. Or perfectly stable and flicker-free.</p>
<p>When it comes to LCD panels, they can behave completely differently.
Some are designed to emulate CRT behaviour for motion resolution (strobing), this is common in gaming monitors (usually optional feature) and some TV models game modes.
These will act just like a CRT.</p>
<p>Normally, LCD monitors display images by holding the image perfectly solid, until the next frame arrives.
These will look perfectly solid to a camera.</p>
<p>However, a LCD monitor produces it's image by combining two components; a backlight (basically some type of lamps or leds), and while the LCD panel can be perfectly solid,the backlight that shines trough the LCD often uses a technique called PWM to control luminance.
Instead of actually lowering the luminance, it instead flickers fast. Humans generally can't detect very fast flicker, and instead views an on/off flicker as reduced luminance.
This flicker of the backlight itself can also produce flicker in a camera,again depending on above mentioned parameters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
