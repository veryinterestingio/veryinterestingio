Now I learn that some viruses actually have membranes and multiple membrane proteins, which is much more complex than the image I have in my mind.  Now I'm wondering about how many different phenotypes of viruses there are, is it a binary thing, some are a protein shell and some are a membrane, or more of a spectrum?  Do we know?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Viruses fall (to my knowledge) into 3 key morphology categories: Icosahedral (or isometric, such as your standard pox/herpes/rhino viruses etc), helical (Influenza, Ebola, measles), and head and tail virus (such as many bacteriophage T7,T4, T4like etc). There is a 4th type which are called enveloped viruses, which as you have picked up, have a segment of the host lipid membrane wrapped around them, aiding in infection of new hosts, and protecting the virus from detection (in some cases). All of the 3 morphologies i mentioned can be enveloped or non-enveloped (only one family of phages have envelopes).</p>
<p>Im not sure by what you mean by how many phenotypes of viruses there are? there are billions of different viruses out there, and each that had different mutations will be a different phenotype, assuming the mutation has an active effect on a protein it is translated into.</p>
<p>Hopefully this helps</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The estimate I remember seeing, but don't ask me to cite it, is that 60% of viruses are &quot;icosahedral&quot; <del>meaning they have a protein shell</del> (EDIT: vague, see below). So most viruses you hear about are like this, which is what you see in school textbooks, eg the classic bacteriophages, the common cold, polio, hpv, rotavirus.</p>
<p>Some viruses have both a shell and a membrane, eg herpes and HIV. The purpose of the membrane is to fuse with the surface of your cell, that gets the protein shell and other stuff inside.</p>
<p>Measles and flu are in the same category as coronavirus, they've got a membrane and no shell.</p>
<p>Then there are helical viruses like ebola and tobacco mosaic virus.</p>
<p>There are some weird ones out there which have protein shells that aren't icosahedral, like these ones that look just like wine bottles that affect archae. I don't think any of those are known to infect humans. Nobody knows why they're that shape.</p>
<p>You could make a very fun, if very small, zoo out of viruses :) it's estimated that 90% of all species <del>of living things</del> (EDIT: philosophically dubious, see below) are viruses, so you should expect to see variation!</p>
<p>ADDENDUM: Lots of people are liking this comment soooo, here's a documentary I made about virus structure :) <a href="https://viruspatterns.com/" target="_blank">https://viruspatterns.com/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are basically two types: those with lipid envelopes and those without. Both types have protein capsids that contain the viral genome. Those with lipid envelopes have an additional lipid membrane that surrounds the capsid. Another common enveloped virus is influenza. It is a trait shared by many respiratory virus'.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
