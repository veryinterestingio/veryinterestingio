<p>If you watch professional sprinters, they don't have their hands flat. If Usain Bolt doesn't do it, probably safe to say it doesn't make you faster.</p>
<p>Nor should you wrong long distances with closed fists, btw. Why expend energy needlessly in an endurance exercise?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, ideally, you want to avoid having tension in your arms in either scenario (long distance or sprints), you aren't supposed to make closed fists while running distance at all. However, it's essentially more tiring to try and manage completely open hands while running long distance than to just let your hands fall, so most people will just keep them in a semi-relaxed limp-fist naturally. As for methodology, try this little experiment. Hold out your arm and retract it with a completely open hand, then try closing 1 finger at a time until all of your fingers and your thumb form a fist. You should notice a pretty big difference in the amount of tension that clenching your phalanges actually causes. Since long distance is a pain, I remember being told that if I couldn't keep from forming a fist, then at least stick my thumbs out to relieve some of the tension and save energy. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>TL;DR: You shouldn't run with a closed fist because it causes tension in your arms, but long distance wears you down so just remember to keep it loose. Oh, and thumbs out!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
