		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A water droplet is a sort of mirror prism. A ray of light comes from the Sun, enters the droplet and changes its angle due to refraction, reflects off the inner wall of the droplet (at least partially), and comes out at a different angle. Different colours come out at different angles.</p>
<p>If you imagine a triangle from the Sun, to the droplet, to your eye, this is the path the light goes. You will get a specific colour if the angle between the Sun-droplet line and the droplet-eye line is just right. What this means is that all droplets in the same line-of-sight will give you the same colour, because the Sun-&gt;droplet-&gt;eye angle is the same along that line, and the light has been bent by the same angle for all those droplets.</p>
<p>A rainbow is (in principle) circular, centred on the point exactly opposite the Sun, because it doesn't matter which direction the light is bent, as long as the angle is right. So a full circle of lines-of-sights of droplets will cause rays of light of a specific colour to hit your eyes. Of course, the ground is in the way most of the time (the Sun is above ground, so the centre of the rainbow is below ground), and the rainbow ends up looking like an arc.</p>
<p>You also get double &amp; triple rainbows etc because light can bounce more than once within a droplet, and will come out at a different angle after each bounce. But some light leaks out after each bounce, which is why the second + third + above rainbows are quite dim - and also why clouds aren't completely dark!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Each raindrop casts a cone of light of different colors, but you only see the color that strikes your eyeballs.  That color depends on the angle between you, the drip, and the sun.  Each raindrop looks like a colored dot, but there are so many so far away that they all blend together.</p>
<p>If you spray water from a garden hose, you can create a rainbow where the individual drops are visible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you were to trace a single beam of light being refracted through a single raindrop into your eye, you would not see a tiny rainbow but only a single colour. That colour would depend on the relative positions of you, the raindrop, and the Sun. So if you move the raindrop to another location you will see a different colour.</p>
<p>When you introduce millions of raindrops across the sky they all occupy those different positions together, and the total effect is that you see some drops sending red light to you, others sending blue, etc etc, resulting in a rainbow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question is symptomatic for why the usual raindrop visual is, by itself, so misleading. I've puzzled over this myself.</p>
<p>You can only see one ray (at most) from a single raindrop, the one that happens to catch your eye, if any. And this ray will be of a single color because the colors spread out and only one will hit your eye. The red band of a rainbow consists of those raindrops that are precisely positioned to direct a red ray into your eye.</p>
<p>The raindrops next to the red band are positioned to deflect some other color into your eye, and so forth. This is how a rainbow appears. When you yourself move, the fitting positions of the raindrops will shift along, so the rainbow &quot;moves&quot; with you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A single drop doesn't create a rainbow.  Each drop is like a pixel which reflect a single color to your eye depending on the angle it forms with you and the sun.</p>
<p><a href="http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/guides/mtr/opt/wtr/rnbw/gifs/scnd2.gif" target="_blank">Here is a schematic</a> simplified with only 2 huge drops. The eye here see 1 drop red, and 1 drop  purple. A rainbow is that but with many small drops so you see all colors in between.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
