		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why a bike stays upright is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_and_motorcycle_dynamics" target="_blank">surprisingly difficult problem</a>, and one that doesn't have any one single explanation — rather, it's a combination of many small factors.</p>
<p>One particularly interesting aspect has less to do with momentum (which depends on both weight and speed), and more to do with speed alone: you can think of balancing on a bike in terms of keeping weight centred on top of the wheels (keeping the centre of gravity directly above the wheelbase, if you want to be technical about it).</p>
<p>If weight shifts to one side, you can correct this by either shifting your weight to the opposite side, or by moving the wheels so that they're directly below where the weight has shifted to. The faster you're moving forward, the faster you'll move <em>sideways</em> when you adjust the steering. Or, from a different perspective: if you need to move your wheels by some distance in some amount of time, the faster you're moving, the less you need to adjust your steering to achieve that. This makes it easier to make fast, small adjustments to your balance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>in the case of a wheel, it's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum#Conservation_of_angular_momentum" target="_blank">conservation of angular momentum</a>. Newton's first law dictates that an object will continue moving in a straight line unless acted upon.</p>
<p>for a rotating body, it will maintain the state of rotation, including both speed and orientation, until acted upon. the leaning of the wheels changes the orientation of rotation, so it requires extra force to subtract from the wheels' angular momentum.</p>
<p>the faster the rotation, the more momentum has to be removed. so more force is required, which makes it more stable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>momentum can be thought of as a desire to continue doing what the object is doing; or, the more momentum something has, the more force is required to change what it is doing. So an upright bicycle moving forward wants to continue being upright and moving forward and will ignore small imbalances in forces, while the stationary bike falls with the slightest imbalance of forces</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you aren't moving there is no way to move your contact point with the ground back under your centre of gravity. Moving lets you steer the contact point continually keeping you balanced. Like keeping a baseball bat balanced on your hand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bicycles are a bad example because they’re self-correcting, which is why a bicycle can “ghost ride” by itself.  They’re designed with rake in the front fork such that when the bike leans left, it causes it to turn left, which props it back up again.  Add a little inertia and gyroscopic forces and voila.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
