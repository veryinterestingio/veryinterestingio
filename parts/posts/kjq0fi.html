		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Inspired by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/kjjz3x/octopuses_have_no_bones_and_can_squeeze_through/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf" target="_blank">this post</a>.</p>
<p>I think it’s safe to say that a human brain would not survive being squished through a pipe like that, so how does the structure between an Octopus brain and human brain (or whatever vertebrate brain is closest to them) differ, and why does that result in the ability to go through just about any hole? </p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>they have different shaped brains. </p>
<p>where humans have one giant group of nuerons in a ball in our skulls, an octopus has a smaller ball in its head and then a bunch of neurons (brain tissue) in its arms as well.</p>
<p>they also aren't able to squish up completely. they have beaks, which are not flexible and compressible. so they can only squish down to that size, which is big enough to prevent any brain squishing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
