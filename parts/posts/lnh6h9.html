Oxygen gets toxic when it's too concentrated (gasses compress at depths and this would concentrate any oxygen a mammal brings down). I assume aquatic mammals would die if they went down too far, much like a human divers would. Can they tell when they've gone too far, or does it just not happen because they would run out of air before they got down there? Can they get decompression sickness?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The oxygen toxicity is from breathing compressed air at depth, which contains very high partial pressure of oxygen. But holding your breath wouldn’t change the amount of oxygen in your body (same for nitrogen and the bends). </p>
<p>Holding your breath is different from breathing compressed air. When holding your breath the air inside still reaches outside pressure so volume decreases There is still a limit to how deep you can dive since you have air pockets in your body that can only compress so far before you stretch/damage tissues, and you’d definitely feel that. Human free divers (divers that hold their breath) feel the pressure, especially free divers going down hundreds of feet, so whales might feel something too. <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-do-deep-diving-sea-cr/" target="_blank">this scientific american article goes into more detail </a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just graduated with a BS in wildlife conservation and ecology &amp; had to take a mammalogy class as a requirement. I remember that cetaceans (whales &amp; dolphins) have a ‘melon’ that was once believed to help out with relieving pressure from diving, but that has been disproven. The only one this applies true would be sperm whales because fun fact, ‘spermaceti’ (a sperm whale’s organ) is hypothesized to help with buoyancy &amp; echolocation. Their name comes from their special organ.</p>
<p>Ironically, there is actually a lot of unknowns about the world of cetaceans &amp; there has to be more research conducted on them. Here is an excerpt from an article stating the most likely:</p>
<p>“All vertebrates have a reflex response to diving (the ‘diving response'), that allows them to limit nitrogen uptake into the blood and body tissues and conserves oxygen, allowing them to dive for longer. The diving response has two main effects on the body: 1) reduced blood flow to muscles (peripheral vasoconstriction), and 2) reduced heart rate (bradycardia). Both of these limit gas transport around the body, conserving oxygen for the vital organs, and limiting nitrogen uptake by the blood and body tissues. Many marine mammals have the added ability to store gas in their windpipe (trachea) when diving. The trachea, together with smaller branches in the lungs, are reinforced by rings of cartilage, and when the air sacs within the lungs (alveoli) collapse under pressure, gas is forced out into these strengthened lung cavities, rather than the bloodstream. This prevents excess nitrogen entering the blood as they descend.”</p>

<p>Dolphins and other aquatic mammals are different from terrestrial mammals because they largely use Myoglobin to transport and store oxygen where humans and terrestrial mammals use Hemoglobin. Myoglobin is better at holding oxygen for extended periods and also releases oxygen MUCH slower than hemoglobin. So as the dolphin, or other mammal, ascends the oxygen doesn't pressurize or fill the blood nearly as quickly. Myoglobin is also why aquatic mammals can hold their breath for so much longer than us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
