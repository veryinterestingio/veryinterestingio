		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Reddit, I am Alison Van Eenennaam. I just published a paper in Nature Biotechnology entitled &quot;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0266-0" target="_blank">Genomic and phenotypic analyses of six offspring of a genome-edited hornless bull</a>&quot;. For the past two years, my laboratory and collaborators have been studying six offspring of a dairy bull, genome-edited to prevent it from growing horns. This technology has been proposed as an alternative to dehorning, a common management practice performed to protect other cattle and human handlers from injuries. We found that none of the bull's offspring developed horns, as expected, and blood work and physical exams of the calves found they were all healthy. We also sequenced the genomes of the calves and their parents and analyzed these genomic sequences. Our study found that two calves inherited the naturally-occurring hornless allele, and four calves additionally inherited a fragment of bacterial DNA, known as a plasmid. This study has generated some media interest, and I am here to answer questions about the study, and genome editing more generally.</p>
<p>On a personal note I'm originally from Australia where I completed a Bachelor of Agricultural Science at The University of Melbourne, before completing my Masters and Ph.D. in Genetics at UC Davis. I have now lived in California for over 30 years with my husband who is a reproductive biologist studying white sturgeon. We are therefore &quot;surf and turf&quot;, and also parents of two college-age boys.  The website for my research is <a href="https://animalbiotech.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank">https://animalbiotech.ucdavis.edu/</a>. You can follow me on Twitter @BioBeef.</p>
<p>I'll be online at 11am Pacific Time (2PM ET, 18 UT) on Friday October 11 to answer your questions. AMA!</p>

<p>Dr. Alison Van Eenennaam is a Cooperative Extension Specialist in the field of Animal Genomics and Biotechnology in the Department of Animal Science at University of California, Davis. She received a Bachelor of Agricultural Science from the University of Melbourne in Australia, and both an MS in Animal Science, and a PhD in Genetics from UC Davis. Her publicly-funded research and outreach program focuses on the use of animal genomics and biotechnology in livestock production systems. Her current research projects include the development of genome editing approaches for cattle. She has given over 600 invited presentations to audiences globally, and uses a variety of media to inform general public audiences about science and technology. She serves as the bovine genome coordinator for the USDA National Animal Genome Research Program, was a member of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) Study Committee for &quot;Science Breakthroughs 2030: A Strategy for Food and Agricultural Research&quot;, and is an elected Fellow and current chair of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Agriculture, Food, and Renewable Resources Section. A passionate advocate of science, Dr. Van Eenennaam was the recipient of the 2010 Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU) National Award for Excellence in Extension, 2014 Council for Agricultural Science and Technology (CAST) Borlaug Communication Award, and the American Society of Animal Science 2019 Rockefeller Prentice Award in Animal Breeding and Genetics.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The idea of genome editing for many, myself included, conjures up visions of horrible accidents or spiraling dystopian futures. Has anyone earnestly quoted Jurassic Park or the like to you; something along the lines of, “Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should”? How do you, either individually or with your colleagues as a collective, re-educate and reassure those whose education in your field consists of science-fiction movies and literature?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
