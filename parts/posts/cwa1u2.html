		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aged cheese wheels have something called a &quot;rind.&quot; Rinds are most obvious on a cheese like brie. Some cheeses are also waxed on the outside (think Gouda.) It's basically an outer dehydrated shell that is maintained by the cheesemakers, and either one certain type of edible mold is allowed to flourish on it (like brie,) or it is wiped with saline regularly to keep mold from growing on it (cheddar). Once you penetrate the rind (slice the cheese into blocks) and stop maintenance, the &quot;inner&quot; non-dehydrated cheese is susceptible to mold it picks up from the environment.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The rind of a cheese (in most cases) protects the cheese during aging. Soft cheese usually being the exception. It’s also very easy to shave off moldy cheese to reveal perfectly wonderful cheese. You don’t always need to throw it out. However, red, grey, black or brown molds are telling you to stop and get rid of that immediately. Also the smell of ammonia on any of your cheese is telling you that it’s bad. Cheers!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what others are saying, your fridge doesn't really control the moisture content of the air inside. Cheese is often aged in climate controlled rooms where temperature and humidity is kept at levels that are ideal for making the cheese do what you want.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mold needs oxygen to develop on cheese. When cheeses are aged, the cheese maker does a number of things to protect the cheese from oxygen. It might be wrapped in cloth(traditional cheddars), or wax(goudas), or rubbed with animal fat or olive oil(parmigiano). Feta is kept submerged in brine. Bloomed rind and washed rind cheeses allow the development of desired molds and bacteria which introduce flavor and crowd out the undesirable molds. Most commodity cheese you buy today(and some really good cheddars) just vacuum seal the blocks of cheese in plastic. Once you open the cheese, you have introduced oxygen and mold will start to form eventually.</p>
<p>Fun fact: if you look at a blue cheese, you can see puncture marks that were introduced when the cheese was fresh. These are not to innoculate the cheese with mold but to  distribute oxygen throughout the wheel, allowing for a more even distribution of the mold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
