		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The math of space time is ultimately best described by Einstein's General Relativity (GR). It's a set of mathematical equations that describes the way space and time bend in the presence of some form of matter (star, planet, whatever).</p>
<p>The usual order of things is to take a mass and calculate how space and time would respond to its presence. However you can also go the other way. You can take a particular spacetime shape and calculate the kind of mass that would be necessary to produce it.</p>
<p>In the case of wormholes, this is what is going on. We can describe a setup of spacetime that would behave like what we would call a wormhole. However if you then calculate what kind of <em>mass</em> we would need to produce this wormhole, we find that it would require a kind of mass that is not known to exist.</p>
<p>So to say the math &quot;predicts&quot; their existence is not really correct. We can describe just about anything with math, but it doesn't mean that thing exists out in the real universe.</p>
<p>EDIT: As u/missle636 points out, there is a sense in which you can say that the math <em>does</em> &quot;predict&quot; such a thing as a wormhole. However it's debated whether or not this mathematical description actually corresponds to physical reality. The physical evidence for black holes is pretty much irrefutable at this point, while the physical evidence for white holes is, to my knowledge, non-existent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The math predicts their existence in almost exactly the same way that math predicts you can push on a rope (which, famously, you can't).  A perfectly straight rope can hold tension (of course) and also, if it happens to be <em>perfectly straight</em> the same spring equation that works to predict the rope's behavior under tension also predicts the rope's behavior under compression.  If it were perfectly straight you could totally push on the ends.</p>
<p>The reason we have <em>tug</em> of war contests but not <em>push</em> of war, is that rope is unstable under pushing.  It simply won't hold the perfect shape to support the push, it'll bend to the side instead.</p>
<p>Spacetime has a similar type of effect.  The equation that describes spacetime has a bunch of solutions about gravity pulling stuff in.  If the gravity is strong enough, you get a &quot;black hole&quot; that sucks in everything that gets close enough.  </p>
<p>It turns out that there are other solutions about gravity pushing stuff out.  Those are called &quot;white hole&quot; solutions.  A while ago someone noticed that you could connect a &quot;white hole&quot; to a &quot;black hole&quot; and get a &quot;wormhole&quot; that would suck stuff in on one side and push stuff out on the other side, and it would all hang together nicely.  And also satisfy the math.</p>
<p>The problem with wormholes is the problem with white holes.  They can't exist, for the same reason you can't push on a rope.  If you somehow created a white hole, it would tend to break itself apart.  If you created a wormhole, it would pinch off into a separate black hole and white hole -- and the white hole would break itself apart.  </p>
<p>Only black holes (which suck everything in) turn out to be stable, even though the equations can have &quot;perfect&quot; solutions that start with exactly the right shape.  Just like a rope -- if a rope is perfectly straight and perfectly made, you can push on it.  But real ropes aren't perfectly made, nor perfectly straight -- and if you push on one, it will bend out to the side instead of carrying the push.</p>
<p><em>Edit: I didn't expect this much interest in a basic ELI5.  The pushing-on-a-rope analogy can only be stretched so far (heh).  If you want more information on this kind of thing, I suggest Kip Thorne's awesome book &quot;Black Holes and Time Warps: Einstein's Outrageous Legacy&quot;.  It's a masterpiece of accessible description, and describes several reasons (not just this one) why wormholes can't exist.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OK, so I went to see Brian Cox a hugely popular physicist and a question was asked about wormholes.</p>
<p>He said there were so many IF's -- so many elements and compounds and materials with properties that we don't currently have any evidence whatsoever of existing anywhere in the entire universe, that would have to exist exactly as the maths required them to - that the whole idea of wormholes was really just a thought experiment.</p>
<p>His analogy:  'It's like someone saying that faster-than-lightspeed travel is possible, and indeed all we have to do is find a spaceship that can go faster than light in order to achieve it'.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Theories try to model the universe in math we can understand. We observe a lot, and try to come up with a bunch of equations that can correctly predict what we see. From this correctness, we infer that it might also be correct in predicting phenomena we haven't seen yet.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, there is no certainty. It's not like &quot;we know it's there, we just have to look harder&quot;, it's &quot;Either we didn't find it yet, or our model was wrong&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
