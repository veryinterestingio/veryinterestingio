		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When an image starts blurry and becomes more clear, you're seeing one of two things.</p>
<p>First, it could be either a <a href="https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/what-is-a-progressive-jpeg/" target="_blank">progressive JPEG</a> or an interlaced PNG. These are both ways of saving an image so that it first loads a low-res version of the image, then progressively higher-res versions until you have the full image. Roughly the way it works is this-- Imagine you have an image with 1000 pixels. First it sends every tenth pixel, which is enough to render a blurry preview of the full image. Then it sends the pixels halfway between the previous pixels, for a higher-res preview. Then it sends the pixels halfway between all the previous pixels, and so on until it's sent all of them. Images saved this way don't compress as efficiently though, so it's not commonly used.</p>
<p>Second, if the images are in a 3D app like Google Earth, what you're seeing are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mipmap" target="_blank">MIP maps</a> loading. 3D textures are almost always stored at multiple resolutions, so the renderer doesn't have to waste video card bandwidth slapping high-res textures on objects that may be only a few pixels across. They load in the lowest-res MIP maps first (because they load the fastest), then higher and higher res ones until the ideal MIP level is loaded for your current view.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because these are two different strategies to load images. </p>
<p>In strategy A you break down the image data into small pieces and send each piece one by one. As soon as a piece is received it shows up on your screen. Typically the pieces are sent such that the top most part of the image is sent first. </p>
<p>In strategy B you keep multiple copies of the image in different &quot;resolutions&quot; or &quot;quality&quot;. The lower the resolution the more pixelated or blurry the image. In this case, the website is smart enough to detect your internet speed and send images of the appropriate quality. Initially it sends the worst quality image and slowly the better quality image is loaded. This is seen on the screen as going from blurry to clear. </p>
<p>PS: This is highly ELI5'd. The actuals may be slightly different</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not yet mentioned in this thread is lazy loading. In order to speed up websites developers often “lazy load” images by only loading high quality images once a user scrolls that section into the viewport. </p>
<p>The initial page load will typically load in an extremely low quality version of the photo that is a small file, then when the user scrolls it into view it will swap to the higher quality image.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's nice to see both methods being explained here,<br />
but the actual question, of WHY this happens isn't answered.  </p>
<p>I personally don't know the answer for sure, but from my days in school I remember it's really just a choice by whoever makes the website, right?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
