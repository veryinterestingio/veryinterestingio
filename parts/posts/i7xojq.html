		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Arachnid keeper here! As far as arachnids go they can become obese from being overfed in captivity. You are very unlikely to find an obese arachnid in the wild as most arachnids are opportunistic feeders which means a meal is whatever comes their way at the time. It could be days, weeks or even months between their meals! They are built to survive like this though by storing energy in their bodies and that allows them to survive even a year without food! </p>
<p>For example, a tarantula that is obese will appear to have an extremely plump abdomen and will be rather slow compared to others of it's genus. An obese tarantula may run into quite a few problems also, such as trouble shedding their exoskeleton. A fall could also be life threatening as just enough height and it will burst, killing the tarantula.</p>
<p>I hope this has been insightful!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Couple examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/103/49/18805.full.pdf" target="_blank">Dragonflies can become obese if they're infected by a particular gut parasite</a>. Essentially, the parasite interferes with the insect's ability to metabolize lipids, thus leading to an accumulation of fat body in the thorax. Interestingly, this accumulation does not seem to be the result of impaired lipid transport.</p>
</li>
<li><a href="https://jeb.biologists.org/content/221/Suppl_1/jeb163881" target="_blank">Fruit flies are often used to study obesity and metabolic syndrome as a whole, too.</a> If you feed fruit flies (that is to say, specifically <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>) a high fat or high carb diet, they can become obese and suffer from a variety of metabolic issues. Certain fly mutants (i.e., <em>adipose</em> lines) are also predisposed to higher fat accumulation.</li>
</ul>
