		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Differences in game styles and different quality programming of the network code in the game (netcode). The concept of ping is the same for all games - how long it takes for data to go from you to the server and back - but how much that ping affects gameplay depends a lot on the game style and how it's been programmed.</p>
<p>Some games let the game hide the lag more easily. For example, in a turn-based or strategy game, it doesn't really matter if there is a brief latency between actions from different players. However, in a FPS game, latency is critical because if you are playing a small fraction of a second &quot;in the past&quot;, and you shoot at someone, they might have moved by the time your action makes it to the server.</p>
<p>There are ways to counteract this. Your game might &quot;predict&quot; what your opponents are doing to hide lag, or it might add an equal amount of lag to everyone. The exact approach that a game uses will affect how it &quot;feels&quot; when you're playing with someone a huge distance away.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/explaining-how-fighting-games-use-delay-based-and-rollback-netcode/" target="_blank">Here</a> is an in-depth article of how different ways of programming games affect the way they lag when you have a bad connection. It's really quite interesting but hard to condense down to an ELI5.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There are different ways to handle networked information going in and out of your game and it mostly comes down to how much they &quot;fudge&quot; or predict actions. The games likely have the same amount of lag, but your opponents in monster hunter won't be upset if the player cheats a little for the purpose of hiding it.</p>
<p>eli15:</p>
<p>These days, almost no games will wait for confirmation from the server to move your character on the client side; they will only correct it once in a while if it's off by some treshold. That's when you get rubber banding.</p>
<p>Server-side consistency is less important for a pve game where &quot;it's probably fine&quot; to let the client have some authority in dictating what happened, but needs to be more strict for a multiplayer game and especially for one as competitive and precise as dota. It might be that dota will only move the characters on the client according to what the server says, meaning you have to wait for a full return trip to see your command get carried out.</p>
<p>It gets trickier once you start applying this to any other actions. You can fire off the attack animation clientside without asking the server, but most games will wait for confirmation before showing the effect it had on the target. Then you get into situations where two players can meet eachother around a corner at the same time, and each will (on their end) fire before the other. There's no good solution for this to make everyone happy, and you are forced to either kill one player who shot first on his screen, or kill both players (I know destiny does this).</p>
<p>The only way to have a 100% consistent, fair, and correct representation is to only show the game state according to how it actually is on the server. It doesn't make it laggier, it only exposes how laggy it actually is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dota underlords is turn-based game so there is no problem with even 1 second lag because game can handle it. I dont know Monster Hunter very good but as i read about it i see there is multiplayer but its PVE so lag is not noticable because you are fighting with computer-controlled enemies and they are client based so latency is not the most important thing.</p>
<p>In Dota or league of legenends or cs you have to have low latency (ping) because every ms count. If you shoot someone server needs to know it instantly so it can &quot;tell&quot; other player that he died and for example cant kill you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lag and ping is way more noticeable if you are facing other players, on games where players beat monsters together or that you send small armies that go slowly and stuff like that it doenst matter if there is a couple hundreds of miliseconds of delay, because the game does not depend on your reaction time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's different ways to handle latency in a game, and in essentially every case, that solution comes at the expense of one of the parties involved. </p>
<p>It used to be common that one player was the &quot;host&quot; and had zero latency, meaning the other player was the disadvantaged one, this is less common nowadays, but still happens occasionally, but is the least &quot;fair&quot; one.</p>
<p>Nowadays most games have a server hosting games, where it can handle latency in two ways, but in each way both players share the disadvantage.</p>
<p>it can either let you input commands in real time, showing your actions immediately and then double checking if your inputs &quot;succeed&quot;, this is more common in shooters, as it is more responsive, but more sensitive to latency and the game might reverse your actions during intense lag.</p>
<p>The other way to do it is that your inputs are delayed according to your latency and you see the game as the server interprets it, this is how DotA and most strategy games do it, as these games generally value correct information over responsiveness.</p>
<p>The common thread between these two methods is that since the different parties are both players, the computer is strict on its interpretations, it won't bend the rules so it can keep a fair playing environment, if your data differs from what the server sees, it will correct your data.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, what makes Monster Hunter work so well is that the two competing parties have a different dynamic, there is the players versus the game itself. Because the computer doesn't care about being treated fairly, it can bend the rules of what is true and what isn't. This means that even though you and I have wildly different latencies, our game clients send in data to the server as we see it and the game completely skips fact checking either of our data, and just accepts it and processes it and returns a result. This means the disadvantage is almost fully on the server, not the players.</p>
<p>As for Underlords, I haven't played it, but assuming it's similar to Auto Chess and TFT, there's no actual real-time interaction with other players, so the game can process your results ahead of time and simply replay the results to you, so latency is largely irrelevant.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Most multiplayer games have to be fair because they're in real-time and also against other players. If a game isn't in real time, or not agaisnt other players, you can &quot;cheat&quot; latency by either processing results ahead of time, or letting the players tell the server what happens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
