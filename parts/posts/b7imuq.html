<p>Is this just an engineering demonstration, or do we expect different properties to emerge when something is, for example, 10E-15 kelvin versus 10E-10 kelvin?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>u/testuser514 mentions superconductivity - I wanted to also mention Bose-Einstein Condensation. Particles on a quantum level interact with other particles very differently depending on whether they have integer or half-integer spin numbers (are bosons or fermions) - Bosons (integer spin objects) are not restricted by the Pauli exclusion principle, and so any number of identical bosons can occupy the same state at the same time. </p>
<p>Normally, however, these &quot;states&quot; in any meaningful anywhere-near-macroscopic system are so close together that thermal energy and thermal noise spreads particles far apart across different states anyway - in other words, whether something is a boson or a fermion doesn't matter if there's only a 0.001% chance that it'll ever even need to try to occupy the same state as something else. But at ultra cold temperatures, you can &quot;freeze out&quot; that thermal noise, and you can see how some kinds of gasses will collapse into their lowest-energy state, where they can interact with each other and quantum interactions become visible. </p>
<p>So, by making your room colder and colder, you can freeze out more and more of the noise in your experiment, and make it possible to see only these quantum effects on a near-macroscopic many particle system in ways that you might not be able to otherwise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I did a course on statistical mechanics a while back and it was really cool to formulate how super-conduction would arrive at low temperatures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you were unaware, atoms at temperatures that approach that limit become a new state of matter known as Bose-Einstein Condensate.  BEC has the interesting property of allowing matter to exist in the same place at the same time, my understanding is that this is because the atoms have collapsed into their wave functions.  </p>
<p>On that note I have been curious since I first learned about BEC as to whether or not atoms might retain their magnetic properties in this state, if anyone is able to answer that here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rather late to the party but adding onto what I didn't see via a skim above are exotic forms of magnetic order, topological states, and general atypical response  (e.g. electronic and thermal transport) of condensed matter systems. In general, the temperature of systems provide thermal energy for its active constituents, which smear out or even erase low temperature (ground state, loosely speaking) properties. Of particular interest are the effects on electrons and how they talk to each other if low enough temperatures are achieved to limit this smearing.</p>
<p>Edit: I realize I forgot to address why we may want lower temperatures, and that is because many of these properties have very small energy scales and will be hard to detect if they are perturbed too much by thermal excitations.</p>
<p>I will list of some interesting things that may occur at low temperatures. Some may be theorized but not experimentally confirmed as of yet.</p>
<p>1) quantum spin liquids (lack of magnetic ordering even at 0 K), skrymions (textured spin ordering). This is in comparison to what we classically envision anti/ferromagnetic materials to do, where tiny spins are either aligned or anti-aligned throughout a material.</p>
<p>2) topological insulators, where materials exhibit different properties within its bulk vs its surface; the same chemical compound can be conducting on its surface but insulating across its bulk. E.g. imagine a loaf of bread. The inner bulk of the bread is fluffy but the outer crust is stiffer and of a different texture, despite being made from the same stuff (bakers please forgive me for simplifying crusts).</p>
<p>3) non-Fermi liquids; e.g. superconducting cuprates, iron-based superconductors, heavy fermion systems. This seemingly goes hand-in-hand with high-temperature superconductivity, but some materials seem to dislike our usual description of metallic behaviour. This is likely due to the complications of the many-body interactions between the electrons and their interplay with their magnetic moments. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many correct, and unfortunately many incorrect, answer here already about phases of matter that occur only at low temperatures, however I think it's important to point out that often one of the main reasons to cool something to near absolute zero isn't to force new physics but rather to reduce things like &quot;broadening&quot; that make it impossible to measure energy levels of atoms if those energy levels are very close to one another in energy. </p>
<p>In other words, sometimes we just want to get more accurate measurements of generic atomic properties, rather than make the atoms do anything crazy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
