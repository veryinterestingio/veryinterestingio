		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OK so what you were taught wasn't wrong, any more than say teaching someone stuff in mechanics and talking about perfect spheres etc is &quot;wrong&quot;. It's just that you got a simplified version.</p>
<p>So firstly let's consider methane, CH4 - the Carbon 2s and 2p orbitals hybridise to form sp3 orbitals. This means the carbon can now have 4 equivalent bonds arranged in a tetrahedral structure, and together with the 4 H atoms, it now means that there are 8 electrons in the outer shell of the Carbon which makes it &quot;happy&quot;, or technically it is now in a low energy state which makes it relatively stable because the 4 available orbitals are all full.</p>
<p>Hopefully you're with me so far.</p>
<p>Now Boron has 1 electron less than Carbon, so if it did the same thing: sp3 hybrid orbitals, 4 bonds to H atoms, it would have just 7 electrons, 3 from the Boron and 4 from the Hydrogens. That's not enough. But it gets around this with the 3 centre, 2 electron bonds, in which it effectively shares 2 electrons with another Boron atom via these &quot;banana bonds&quot;.  Each Boron now effectively has 8 electrons in the outer shell, so just like methane, the structure is now stable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some excellent answers have already been given. I’ll just add a funny note. Boron is probably the strangest element. It is too electronegative to behave like a metal, but not enough to behave like a nonmetal. You could say that however you put it, boron complains, which makes it a <em>frustrated</em> element. This causes all sorts of shenanigans. Under extreme pressures boron is known to form an ionic crystal with itself. That’s right, some borons rip electrons from other borons, which from the point of view of standard chemistry doesn’t make sense, but that’s the magic of boron.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The concepts of chemical bonding and orbitals, at least the way it was taught in school, is very superficial.</p>
<p>As long as there is &quot;enough&quot; electron to compensate for the Coulombic repulsion between the positive nuclei, there is always a possibility of &quot;bonding&quot;. More generally speaking, there is a possibility that you will have a minimum (or minima) in the potential energy surface. In addition, electrons do not stay between the two atoms that are &quot;bonding&quot; - they are delocalized all over the molecule. This is what happens in the B2H6 molecule.</p>
<p>Another interesting example is the simplest molecular ion, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrogen_cation" target="_blank">H2^+</a>, which is basically H + H^(+). As you can see, there is only one electron bonding the two protons together, which is not something you would expect from high-school- or freshman-level chemistry.</p>
<p>To make things more complicated, orbitals are only a crude approximation of the electronic wavefunction. They are <del>produced</del> derived/computed by assuming that the electrons are moving independently of each other. In some situations, they are still useful to help interpret physical phenomena (e.g. excitation from HOMO to LUMO, how organic reaction will proceed depending on the orientation of the orbitals, etc.), but in many other situations using orbitals in this way can be misleading.</p>
<p>Edit: fixing some formatting and wordings. Too much reading/writing paper and fixing typos :p</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
