<p>The range of the strong force is about 1x10\^-15 meters, (so quite a short range)</p>
<p>The weak force has a low range as it's communicated by massive particles, that are so massive they can't actually be created so they have to interact with a virtual W-boson ,</p>
<p>The electromagnetic force has effectively infinite range because photons are massless</p>
<p>but the strong force is communicated by gluons, gluons too are massless. So why (like the electromagnetic force) doesn't the strong force have an infinite range?</p></div></div>

<p>It does.</p>
<p>The potential energy function representing the interactions between quarks according to QCD has the form of</p>
<p>V(r) = a/r + br.</p>
<p>The a/r term is exactly like the Coulomb potential between electric charges. And the br term represents QCD confinement, which doesn't exist in QED.</p>
<p>Taking this potential at face value, it <em>does</em> certainly have infinite range, just like the Coulomb potential. But because of the confinement term, at reasonably low energies we only ever observe color-charged particles in confined bound states. And QCD bound states have characteristic sizes on the order of femtometers.</p>
<p>So it <em>looks like</em> the strong force only has a range of femtometers because we only ever see it acting over femtometers (for most intents and purposes) because of confinement. But it actually does have infinite range.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The residual strong force is to the strong interaction, as intermolecular forces are to atomic bonds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can someone please correct me if I’m wrong here:</p>
<p>I assume that the radius of the strong nuclear force is the the reason the table of elements is ‘complete’ because if particles are outside of that radius they won’t be held inside the nucleus. I assume that you can only fit so many gumballs into the gumball machine. </p>
<p>Am I stupid?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
