		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simple answer is that the starter motors are specifically designed for that purpose. Engineers design them with different bearings, brushes and gear ratios so that they are better suited to the task.</p>
<p>Starting a warm engine is also less strain on a starter than a cold engine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how the system is implemented, for fast retrofits, they indeed use a beefed up starter to handle the frequent use, however, a warm engine takes less work to start than a cold one, and less fuel to do so.</p>
<p>Other methods have a big flywheel style motor to do the starting, such as hondas hybrids, so there is no extra wear on the regular starter.</p>
<p>Finally, another way it is done, is by using the alternator which in itself is made specifically for this task with a strengthened belt drive to acheive start. As an alternator is just a regular electric motor when fed current than giving it back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let’s not forget it’s also a cheaper way to get around the mpg standards that were enacted.  Cheaper and easier to make a durable starter motor vs a more fuel efficient drive motor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p><strong>How does the start/stop feature in newer cars save fuel</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's really as simple as they save fuel by taking the small amounts of time when at stop signs and stop lights to turn off the engine thereby saving fuel.  These small moments add up to for the average driver savings \~5% on fuel .. and most importantly to the vehicle manufactures, increases their MPG numbers in the cheapest possible way (vs other R&amp;D) to meet ever stricter CAFE standards.  It really is not for your direct benefit and I personally am annoyed by it in every implementation I've seen and driven.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>and not just wear out the starter?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Modern starters (brushless) are much more efficient and more powerful than older (brushed) starters. Where a brushed starter is good for \~3000 hours,  a brushless can go \~30000. So while sure stop/start increases utilization on the starter it's up for the job all things considered.</p>
<p>The real wear issue for this tech is on the vehicle Battery.  Batteries are not proficient at the increased cranking throughout the day and the increased load when 'stopped' and still supporting your fans blasting, radio and headlights on, and back to cranking again.  Battery makers are still trying to come up with different construction techniques to minimize the impact of being in a near-constant state of partial discharge.  So what you will find is batteries for these vehicles are more expensive and have to be replaced more often in the typical 3-5yr lifespan.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
