		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the bed you are <em>trying</em> so you <em>have the possibility of failing</em> and then count that as a fail.  On the couch you <em>are never trying</em> so you have zero failures.</p>
<p>So...it's <em>not</em> easier you just never fail on the couch because you are never actually trying.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in sleep medicine</p>
<p>The psychology of insomnia is what we basically break and rebuild to treat it without medication </p>
<p>It’s incredible how powerful the mind is. Some helpful tricks if you can’t sleep:</p>
<ul>
<li>tap your shoulder or your leg lightly until you start nodding off (we don’t fully understand why this even works)</li>
<li>pretend you just heard your alarm go off. Visualize the moment. Feel your eyelids getting heavier?</li>
<li>sleep on your BACK with a towel rolled up under your neck instead of a pillow. Resist the urge to curl up when you can’t sleep as it raises body temp. </li>
<li>DONT have a visible clock in your room. And don’t ever check the time when you wake up at night. Literally just thinking you had a bad sleep causes changes to your cognitive performance the next day, but the reverse also stands. (Of course chronic sleep deprivation is another thing)</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two reasons</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think comes down to a matter of distraction, which I've successfully translated to sleeping in my bed by listening to audio books.</p>
<p>It's nearly impossible to listen to a book this way, but that's not the goal.</p>
<p>The goal is sleep, and to do that, you need to focus on something other than that time when [insert time when something happened].</p>

<p>&quot;It keeps the voices away&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
