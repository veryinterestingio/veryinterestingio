		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the U.S., we still use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_clearing_house" target="_blank">ACH System</a>, developed in the 1960s.  </p>
<p>Basically all the transfers that start at a bank in one day are made into a batch at the end of the day and sent to a central processor, who then routes them to the banks at the other end of the transfer for approval.  The paying bank picks up their messages the next day, has an extra business day to decide whether or not to approve, and sends their batch of rejections (but not approvals!) to the central processor the next night.  The receiving bank then picks up their batch of answers the next day.  Since they don't get approvals, only rejections, and the other bank has another day to reject, they usually wait that extra day.  They also skip weekends and holidays in case anything needs human review, and of course there's a cutoff time to get something in in time for tonight's batch, so if you're late it goes the next business day.  So it can be 3 days to a week or so, depending on timing, weekends, and holidays.</p>
<p><a href="https://engineering.gusto.com/how-ach-works-a-developer-perspective-part-3/" target="_blank">How ACH Works</a> is a more technical explanation that's not ELI5, but might explain the timing better.</p>
<p>As to why we still do this, it's just because they spent vast amounts of money making the systems and processes, making them all capable of following the same standards, making them all robust, and building their processes around that.  They're known to work (most of the time).  Building new systems would be expensive, risky, and they'd have to redo all their processes, and importantly until all the other banks are doing the same thing in the same way and they can all talk to each other, useless.</p>
<p>Yes, of course everything could be (almost) instant.  But there's not a big enough push for it to overcome the inertia of the existing system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll try an actual ELI5 instead of a history of mainframe computing :)</p>
<p>When you send money to someone, your bank gives money to the other person's bank. In the old days, banks would call each other and agree how much money they owe. They only called once a day, because if they called every time someone sent money, that would be a LOT of calls.</p>
<p>Later we got computers, and when we sent money, people put the numbers into computers. Because banks were used to calling each other once a day, they built the computers to work the same way. They also did it because they didn't quite trust the computers, so they wanted to check that the computers got the numbers right.</p>
<p>Today computers are so good that we always trust their numbers. Because computers are very fast, that means all money could be sent in a second. However, many banks still have their old computers, who only know how to call each other once a day. Most banks are buying better computers, but it will take years before they all have them, and until then, sometimes it will take a day or two to send money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
