		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way to look at it is like this: We're new people in ancient bodies. </p>
<p>Our bodies are evolutionary designed over millions (technically billions) of years to live in the wild and be struggling for survival every day. So an active mind is very important to us there, because our intelligence is one of our most useful assets along with our thumbs. </p>
<p>We're not faster than most animals, though we can run longer than a lot. We're not stronger. We're not more dexterous (though, we do have fine motor skills). Our sense of smell and hearing is pretty shit, though our eyesight is pretty good... basically, if we were dumb, we'd be pretty average as far as an animal goes. </p>
<p>As evolution typically aspires to dominance or at least control, our brains worked harder and harder to get us to survive better and better... until we took over the planet, our lives became insanely easy, and our brains... well... our poor brains physically never got the memo and are still working overtime to ensure we can survive our harsh environment, even though our environment is no longer harsh. </p>
<p>And that's why it's always seeking to be occupied. Because a very long time ago it was designed to be that way.... and we're still basically the same as the people who lived that long time ago... even though we live in a drastically different world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As much as you can explain this question via biology, physiology, psychology, and neuroscience... I think philosophy has something to say for what it's worth. What exactly do you mean if a brain is unoccupied?</p>
<p>For the most part, the brain just works as it usually does. It takes in information and experiences it. Things fire. Neurons/electro-chemicals propagate and influence others. It's occupied because that's the single purpose of a brain - to engage information.</p>
<p>It's less like a light switch that you can turn off and on. It's an ongoing, wavy, organ that lives on a spectrum of ebb and flow. Sometimes it's active and goes on tangents, other time it's a bit tired.  And that'll depend on whatever happened to it before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
