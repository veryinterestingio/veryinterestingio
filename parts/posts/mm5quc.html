		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Over the weekend, I made Swiss meringue buttercream for the first time. The first batch, the egg whites would not whip up AT ALL. I whipped it for around a half hour and it stayed gloopy the whole time. </p>
<p>I know that if there's any fat on the bowl, whisks, spatulas, etc from previous cooking or egg yolk or whatever, the egg whites won't whip. But why? What does fat do that keeps egg whites from whipping?</p>
<p>I washed all my equipment and wiped it down with some white vinegar, and the eggs whipped beautifully the second attempt. I just really don't get it.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Egg whites are 90% water and 10% protein strands. When you whip egg whites, these proteins uncurl and bond together into a net that traps air bubbles to create the foamy meringue. If there's fat in the mix, the fat gets in between the proteins and prevents them from bonding into the net, and air bubbles pop instead of creating foam.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Egg whites are about 90% water and 10% protein. When you beat egg whites, you force the proteins to stretch out. As they stretch out, they begin to bond with each other. Meanwhile, you're whipping air into the water, forming little bubbles. As the proteins bond, they form a stable network that traps the bubbles inside - hence you get &quot;stiff peaks&quot; because you have a network of firm proteins supporting a bunch of air bubbles.</p>
<p>If you have some fat in the mixture, the proteins would rather bond to the fat than bond to each other, and thus you don't get the structure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
