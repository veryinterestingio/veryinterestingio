		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I once shared a train ride with a production line engineer who explained how this sort of thing happens. Essentially, if all the ingredients are the same, it comes down to the processes involved, so for example the real brand stuff might have a flash freeze at some point during production or a specific type of stir or something along those lines which might be hard to pinpoint or reverse engineer from the final product, or require expensive special machines to do right, and that makes the difference in how it finally turns out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Industrial recipes are not as simple as you think.  Even if the ingredients are straightforward, the processing steps generally are not.  Temperature, humidity, mixing order and speed, etc. can all have a huge impact on the finished product.  There are hundreds of varieties of corn, grown on thousands of types of cropland -- I assume there are people whose job is coming up with the right blend of corn from different suppliers to make this year's  Doritos come out &quot;right&quot;.  Nobody's going to go to that level of attention to detail when making house brand chips.  Good food chemists command a high salary.  </p>
<p>As another example, that commercial fried chicken may be cooked in a special pressure cooker that gets twice as hot as anything available for the home market.  </p>
<p>And the ingredients are not as simple as you think.  The recipe for Coca-cola, for example, is one of the most closely held trade secrets in the world.  Rumor is that when they went from Coke to New Coke to Coke Classic, one of the biggest changes between Coke and Coke Classic was that a tiny amount of the vanilla had been replaced with something cheaper, saving the company millions of dollars a year; for years after that marketing fiasco people sought out old caches of &quot;real&quot; Coke, claiming that it tasted better.  </p>
<p>All that is just rumor, but rumors and irrational behavior drive a lot of consumer purchases. </p>
<p>In any case, there are websites and cookbooks dedicated to cloning brand name foods at home -- some things are feasible, some are not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally, there's not much reason to enter a market with an identical product at an identical cost, so either you have to have a better product (aka different) or a lower cost otherwise identical product (in an ideal world).</p>
<p>Odds are, going up against someone with the economies of scale of something like Coke, to undercut them on price, you need to compromise somewhere, and that compromise is generally reflected in the product (quality control, sub-par ingredients, rushed processing skipping a key step, etc.).</p>
<p>Finally, there's the simple fact that these products aren't just a simple set of ingredients. Take a look at the side of a Doritos bag and you'll see:</p>
<p><code>Corn, Vegetable Oil (Corn, Canola, And/or Sunflower Oil), Maltodextrin (Made From Corn), Salt, Cheddar Cheese (Milk, Cheese Cultures, Salt, Enzymes), Whey, Monosodium Glutamate, Buttermilk, Romano Cheese (Part-skim Cow's Milk, Cheese Cultures, Salt, Enzymes), Whey Protein Concentrate, Onion Powder, Corn Flour, Natural And Artificial Flavor, Dextrose, Tomato Powder, Lactose, Spices, Artificial Color (Yellow 6, Yellow 5, And Red 40), Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Sugar, Garlic Powder, Skim Milk, Red And Green Bell Pepper Powder, Disodium Inosinate, And Disodium Guanylate.</code></p>
<p>First, there are no quantities, so you have to experiment a lot in that area.</p>
<p>Second, there's no details on how to prepare the ingredients. If I throw an ear of corn into a bag with some oil, salt, and cheese, I'm not going to get Doritos out magically. The corn needs to be dried and ground, but how dry? How ground? Where does the corn come from? There could be 6 different ground corn powders that get mixed together under the label &quot;corn&quot; as part of Doritos secret recipe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Off-Brand products, especially food items, usually come from the same factories that make the name brand products. They're still perfectly fine for consumption, but does not meet the standards set by the name brand. </p>
<p>And certain name brand cos allow repackaging of the rejected but perfectly consumable batches, which the factory itself markets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly the same thing, but I know someone who grew up on a vegetable farm that sold to (I think it was) Green Giant. The time from field to frozen dictated what brand they would be sold as. Same vegetables, same factory but if they didnâ€™t get frozen within a set amount of time, they would be store brand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
