		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with the scattering of incoming solar radiation. It is called Rayleigh scattering. the way weather systems travel is from west to east. </p>
<p>The sun rises in the east and sets in the west.
Incoming solar radiation deflected sideways at an angle. If that angle is high then it brings about blue skies and such. If there is a blue sunrise that, to me, as a weather forecaster tells me I have low pressure to my east. The storm has passed. </p>
<p>As a result of low pressure being to my east, I will have high pressure to my west. High pressure is associated with good weather and great conditions. The high pressure is to come and move over my station. </p>
<p>High pressure brings about a low sun angle because it condenses the atmosphere. This low sun angle gives us our red sunrises and sunsets.</p>
<p>Edit: This is more of a mid latitude United States phenomenon. I decided to give it another shotâ€” see belowðŸ‘‡</p>
<p>Sun rises in the east and sets in the west.  </p>
<p>Cool. </p>
<p>If at any point the sun rise or sun set is the color orange, red, or pink it can be inferred that the atmosphere is being condensed under the influence of high pressure. Because the sun is low in the sky and the atmosphere is condensed this is used to locate where high pressure is. Whether it is departing or arriving to you. </p>
<p>On the other hand, low pressure within the atmosphere allows it to expand. Therefore, wherever low pressure is located the sky at sun rise and sun set will not appear the colors aforementioned but will be your usual blue sky. This is due to the lack of condensation in the atmosphere. It allows the blue to be seen instead of the other colors on the visible spectrum. </p>
<p>In the mid latitudes (not the equator or the poles) between 60 degrees N and 30 degrees N there is the polar front jet (jet stream) that is high in the sky and it helps high pressure and low pressure move across mid latitudes in a west to east fashion as this is the only way the wind travels in the polar front jet. So this is the way low pressure systems (more commonly frontal boundaries) move with high pressure ahead and behind the fronts. </p>
<p>Weather is fluid and ever changing. What one may understand may be understood differently by another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like this was answered well already but just to add...I was a weather forecaster for the Air Force for 6 years. We actually had a few lessons about tips and tricks that were true to forecast. Red sky was one, also leaves that are showing their underside mean it will rain soon, cricket chirp intervals are indicative of specific temp ranges etc. There were more, I just can't remember as this was over 10 years ago. I was blown away by how many of these &quot;tips&quot; I had heard prior to my experience forecasting actually being true. Science is some cool shit!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two factors feed into this:</p>
<p>Weather systems generally travel from west to east in the mid latitudes. Because the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, a rising sun in advance of an approaching weather system would illuminate the approaching mid- and high-level clouds to create a red sky in the morning. If the sun is setting as a weather system exits and high pressure is building, then the departing clouds would be illuminated. This would create a red sky at night with fair weather to follow.</p>
<p>The reddish color results from scattering of sunlight by suspended particles and aerosols in the atmosphere. The suns rays pass through a greater length of atmosphere at sunrise and sunset than at any other time of day. In addition, aerosol, dirt, and dust concentrations are maximized in the lowest layers of the atmosphere when the atmosphere is dominated by sinking air (high pressure). Therefore when under high pressure we can see vivid red sunsets and sunrises.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
