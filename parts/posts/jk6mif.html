		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally caused by differences in temperature between areas, land and sea cause the most.</p>
<p>The sun heats up land quicker than water, the heat moves into the air above the land, it rises causing air from over the sea to be pulled inwards in its place, wind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wind is caused by hot air rising and cool air moving in to replace it. Imagine you in your bed under your blankets. If you push your blankets up into the air with your feet, you will feel a cool breeze rush in, under your blankets. This is a similar process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other people have explained what wind is. As for where it starts, it doesn't need a start. When you swirl water in a glass, it doesn't have a start. Wind is air swirling around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nowhere really, wind is the movement of air from a high pressure area to a low pressure area. These low pressure areas can form because hot air rises, leaving a low pressure at the surface while creating a high pressure high up. Similarly when its cold the air goes down creating a high pressure at the surface while creating a low pressure high up. So it moves in circles: it gets heated, rises, moves to a low pressure area high up, gets cooled down, goes down and moves to low pressure area on the surface where it gets heated up again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>According to the Hairy Ball Theorem, there is always at least one place with 0.0000mph wind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
