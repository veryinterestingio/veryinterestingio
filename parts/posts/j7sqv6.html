		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Inflammation occurs when pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, TNF-alpha) are activated in a cell. These cytokines exit the cell and activate an immune response whereby innate immune cells (neutrophils, macrophages) congregate around the area to combat whatever caused the inflammatory response. Due to the multi celled nature of inflammation, a single cell cannot experience inflammation.</p>
<p>Single celled organisms have their own unique ways to deal with infection though. For example, some bacteria can cut out viral DNA from their genome (this is where we got CRISPR from!).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, in order to produce inflammation various immune cells need to contribute for the effects of inflammation to be produced in an organ or tissue. These effects can't be replicated inside the cell, instead when the cell detects or receives a signal that it's damaged it'll undergo cell death (apoptosis). Cells are a lot more expendable then whole organisms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reaaaaally depends on what you mean by &quot;inflammation.&quot; If you mean redness, swelling, and pain, then no, because you need tissue and a nervous system to experience those things. If you mean a release of cytokines indicating infection or tissue damage..... then also no. Those inflammatory molecules are only in multicellular organisms because their purpose is to convey &quot;THERE MIGHT BE PATHOGENS AROUND HERE&quot; to other cells in the body. Then those other cells can react by boosting their pathogen resistance or recruiting immune cells to attack any pathogens. BUT!! If by inflammation you mean a signal to warn other single celled organisms about danger, then YES! That does happen! One study found that E. coli were able to colonize an area with high antibiotic concentration if they were first exposed to their murdered sister cells. It turned out the bacteria were detecting a protein that's supposed to be on the inside of their sister cells, so finding it floating out in the environment made the bacteria go &quot;There might be something around here that's murdering cells like me, I should boost my defenses to make sure it doesn't murder me, too.&quot; Which is actually pretty similar to how inflammation works in our body, at least on a surface level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Excellent question.</p>
<p>Inflammation is a process that is initiated to fight an agression in a tissue. It is not a cellular process but a tissular one. So no, single celled organisms don't experience inflammation.</p>
<p>However, like us, they have mechanisms that allow them to fight these agressions.</p>
<p>All organisms have stress pathways that allow them to survive and fight a cellular stress (unfolded-protein response, amino acid starvation, glucose starvation, hypoxia).</p>
<p>Bacteria have their own immune system. They use CRISPR/Cas9 to destroy the genome of viruses that infect them. That's what allowed the discovery of this system by Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna, which were awarded a Nobel Prize this year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physiologist here: Inflammation is a process relating to <strong>Tissue</strong> level reactions, caused by multiple types of cells. Single celled organisms do certainly have the ability to do some things like increase the permeability of the cell membrane, produce antibodies, experience hypertrophy, ect. But in general their ability to do so is much more limited than cells of a multi-cellular organism because multicellular organisms can allow (and in some cases require) the loss of individual cells to support the longevity of the tissue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
