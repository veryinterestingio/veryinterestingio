		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>WHO global efforts to eradicate smallpox began in 1959, really stepped up after 1967 and were not complete until 1980. Visiting a billion houses over 21 years in not unreasonable or logistically impossible. <a href="https://www.who.int/about/bugs_drugs_smoke_chapter_1_smallpox.pdf" target="_blank">India alone had a plan to visit every house in the country in a 7-10 day window in 1973</a> (p14). </p>
<p>Efforts were pushed from the international level but plans and actual visits were done by local health officials. When you include using every doctor, nurse and person capable of being trained to poke a needle and repeat that measure year after year for 20 years visiting that number of homes in total is no longer unreasonable.</p>
<p>EDIT 7-10 day, left off day</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Seems reasonable, though I don’t find that exact statement on a quick run through some of the usual sources. But the eradication campaign ran from 1966 to 1977, and </p>
<blockquote>
<p>India was one of the last major hurdles. In 1975 <strong>during a two-week period, 130,000 workers visited 100 million homes there</strong>, finding many smallpox cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—<a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/national/science/061599sci-smallpox.html" target="_blank">Smallpox: The Once and Future Scourge?</a></p>
<p>If workers could visit 100 million houses in two weeks, presumably they were technically able to visit a billion in 20 weeks, let alone 500. </p>
<p>Similarly, in Yugoslavia</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The authorities launched a campaign to vaccinate the whole country – 21 million people. They worked so fast that 18 million were vaccinated in just 10 days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—<a href="https://www.who.int/about/bugs_drugs_smoke_chapter_1_smallpox.pdf" target="_blank">SMALLPOX: eradicating an ancient scourge</a></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/archive/doc/millions/MS_case_1.pdf" target="_blank">Eradicating Smallpox</a>, they suggest that “<em>about a fifth of the 2.5 billion people living in developing countries were vaccinated each year</em>”, which is 500 million people a year. That doesn’t work out for ten years, but it excludes developed countries (like, presumably, Yugoslavia).</p>
<p>All in all, several billions of people were vaccinated, and saying that they involved a billion households doesn’t seem too far fetched.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very doable, the bigger surprise is what DA Henderson and team were able to do on essentially a shoestring budget. He told stories of having team members do collect calls with international partners because their office couldn't afford it. The logistics, supply chains, and people did great things. I would also say it likely helped that the two world super powers at the time were actually both supportive of the effort politically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to give some back of the envelope calculations, 30 years is about 10000 days, so if the project was approximately that long, they would need to visit about 100000 houses per day. If one well trained volunteer could visit 10 houses an hour for 10 hours a day (which isn’t a huge exaggeration in heavily populated cities), that’s 100 houses per day per person, so you would only need 1000 volunteers for the project. It’s conceivable that a massive international effort like this could have 10x or even 100x this amount, making the project seem quite feasible.</p>
<p>All the numbers could easily be off by a factor of 2 or 3 without things seeming impossible, if there was succulent cooperation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
