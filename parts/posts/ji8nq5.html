		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chicken vs egg problem. The first TV broadcasters were TV/Radio set manufacturers. Shows were broadcast on both radio and on TV and had to be done live as there was no way to prerecord video like there was with audio and the phonograph.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the early days of broadcasting, there would be very few channels (perhaps only one), and TV would only be available at set times of the day, for example a news broadcast, and then they'd stop broadcasting and the TV would just pick up static for the other ~23 hours of the day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Heard a story about the first phone salesmen. One guy was selling way more than anybody else. So they asked him how he did it. He said he told people they wouldn't have to get dressed to talk to their neighbor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
