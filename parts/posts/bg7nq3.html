		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the domestically raised bear was a polar bear or a grizzly bear it would likely go through a &quot;hibernation&quot; style phase in the winter as a cub and then as an adult kill and eat you and your family. Other bears, like the black bear, or panda bear would likely make a better choice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bears (aside from pregnant polar bears) aren't obligate hibernators so, no.  They probably wouldn't.</p>
<p>It varies a bit on how tempratures around them are, but it's more of a food scaricty thing for northern bears leading to the winter topor periods.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that A). It's not true hibernation as bears don't lose tempratures during the period of inacitivty and B).  Bears can't be domesticated on any serious level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The shortest answer is yes. Animals that hibernate do so in response to both shorter days and colder weather, so any hibernating animal with access to the outdoors and natural sunlight would feel an urge to put on weight, and then fall into a state of torpor, the sleepiness that most of us confuse for true hibernation. It's not a voluntary choice on their part, so unless you put them in an environment where they never experience seasons or weather, they would always get ready to hole up once fall rolls around.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
