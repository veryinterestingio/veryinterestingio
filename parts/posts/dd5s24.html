<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>....The average &quot;residence time&quot; of water in the oceans—the amount of time a  water molecule spends there before moving into another part of the  water cycle—is about 3,000 years,[14]  and no part of the water cycle traps water for more than a few hundred  thousand years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is insanely complicated, but let's start with some simple concepts.</p>
<p><strong>Population estimate:</strong> All vertebrates have kidneys.  Not all animals have kidneys.  So you're really only looking at a subset of the animal population.  Ants for example don't have kidneys, but there are 10,000 trillion alive at any one time.  We need to estimate the number of vertebrates alive at any given moment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fish are about 5-10 trillion</li>
<li>Mammals are about 100 billion to 1 trillion</li>
<li>Birds are about 100 billion</li>
<li>Reptiles somewhere between 1-10 trillion</li>
</ul>
<p>So an estimate of somewhere between <strong>6.2-20.2 trillion</strong> vertebrates alive on Earth right now.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>GFR estimate:</strong> A good <a href="https://www.vetfolio.com/learn/article/glomerular-filtration-rate-in-general-small-animal-practice" target="_blank">GFR</a> estimate is \~3 mL/min/kg for small animals which are the majority of vertebrates, some larger some smaller but we have to get an average somehow.  And a decent estimate of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698904001646" target="_blank">body weight average for vertebrates</a> is around 0.572 kg.  This leaves us with an estimate of <strong>1.716 mL/min</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Time estimate:</strong> Next you have a time frame of around 500 million years for vertebrates.  This population density hasn't been consistent over that period, so it's important to remember that as an estimate this is going to be the second biggest component of the error involved here because we also don't have super accurate counts for species and population density over that time frame.  <strong>500 million years</strong> is the number we have though so we'll go with that period.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>One year calculation:</strong> We'll go with a middle number of 10 trillion vertebrates at an average weight of 0.572 kg.  This would mean that each minute we have 10 trillion x 1.716 mL/min of fluid filtered.</p>
<p>1.716 x 10^(13) mL/min (525,600 min/year) = 9.02 x 10^(18) mL/year</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Total Vertebrate history GFR estimate = 4.5 x 10</strong>^(27) <strong>mL</strong></p>
<p><strong>Water on Earth</strong> = 1.26 x 10^(21) L = <strong>1.26 x 10</strong>^(24) <strong>mL</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>Rough Estimate: 3,000 times</h1>
<p>(now someone check my maths and let me know where I did wrongs)</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the silver!<br />
Edit: thanks for Gold! Wow, thanks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing I've wondered that could offset the number. How many water molecules are broken apart by plants every day? Photosynthesis breaks water molecules down in chemical reactions. I imagine if the numbers are high enough then many or most water molecules are &quot;new&quot; on a geologic time scale. A lot of big numbers involved...Just wanted to add this aspect to the question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The more important question: how long does a single water molecule stay intact?  You know that water undergoes a process called self-ionization (aka autoionization, or autodissociation)... one of the two hydrogen atoms (as a proton ion) will leave the water molecule and hop to another water molecule.  In all likelihood, it won't be coming back.  This happens once <em>every 10 hours.</em>  In other words, much, much, MUCH faster than the average water cycle.  So it's not really relevant to talk about how many times a single water molecule goes through an animal kidney, since that single water molecule itself doesn't survive for more than a day or two.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, let's do the math and get an order-of-magnitude estimate.</p>
<p>Let's interpret &quot;kidney&quot; very generously -- worms and snails don't have kidneys, but they have something similar -- and talk about water flow through all animals on Earth.</p>
<p>Let's use humans as a typical animal, since they're well-studied.  The average human <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine" target="_blank">urinates</a> about 1.4 liter per day.  So <em>all</em> humans urinate about 10^7 (10 million) cubic meters per day -- about 4000 olympic swimming pools' worth.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/115/25/6506" target="_blank">this paper</a>, there are about 0.06 gigatons of carbon in all the humans on Earth, and 2 gigatons of carbon in all animals.  So let's assume the total mass of animals is 2/.06 = 33 times the mass of humans.  Assuming humans are typical in their urine production per biomass (more on that later), that means all animals produce about 3 x 10^8 cubic meters per day, or 0.3 km^3 /day.  That's a pool 1 km x 1 km x 300 meters deep.</p>
<p>The total volume of all the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_distribution_on_Earth" target="_blank">surface water on Earth</a> is about 1.4 billion km^3.  To flush all of this through organisms at a rate of 0.3 km^3 /day would take about 5 billion days, or 13 million years.</p>
<p>Animals have existed for about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion" target="_blank">500 million years</a>.  If we make the extremely sketchy assumption that the total mass of animals has remained fairly constant over geologic time, we end up with the result that the average molecule of water has been through an animal <strong>about 40 times</strong>.</p>
<p>However, a couple of caveats on this answer.</p>
<p>1) Humans may not be typical urine producers.  In particular, since we're evolved as an arid land species that needs to conserve water, we may produce less urine than, say, a freshwater fish.  On the other hand, ocean animals (which are the majority of the biomass) also have to conserve fresh water because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmoregulation" target="_blank">osmosis through their skin.</a></p>
<p>2) This includes only Earth's surface and crustal water.  The Earth's mantle contains even more water (1.5 to 11 times as much) chemically locked in the rocks, and over 500 million years it may exchange with the surface.</p>
<p>Given all these uncertainties, I think the best we can say is that the average drop of water has been through an animal <strong>probably more than once, probably less than 1000 times.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
