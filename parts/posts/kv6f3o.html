		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know that quantum mechanics states  that some things, like bumping an electron to a higher energy level,  requires something like a photon to have juuuuust the right energy for  the electron to 'accept' that photon and then rise to the higher energy  level.</p>
<p>But it is always explained  that it has to be exact. Like, EXACT exact. It must be, let's say,  10,854.7952 electron volts, which corresponds to a frequency of  12.795832 GHz (ignore the actual values, I just pulled some numbers out  of my head). It is always explained that if it were even slightly higher  or lower than that amount of energy, the electron wouldn't be excited  by it.</p>
<p>Well, what are the odds  that a photon with that very very VERY exact energy level would come  passing by in any reasonable amount of time? I know photons are a tiny  amount of energy and there are a huge number of them all the time, but  still, it seems like such a precise requirement would be very  restrictive, and would result in almost no interactions between  particles and the EM force.</p>
<p>It seems like all my assumptions can't be right here. What am I missing?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a relationship between the uncertainty in the energy of an excited state and the lifetime of that state. This creates the &quot;natural linewidth&quot; of a spectral line. The fundamental broadening of a spectroscopic line that cannot be narrowed by any sort of improved spectrometer design because it's just due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. </p>
<p>In essence the shorter the lifetime of a state, the less precise the energy of that state. But no matter what there is always some fundamental breadth to the energy spectrum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are indeed some situations where the energy of the incoming photon should match quite exactly the energy difference between the two states. The perfect example of this is Mossbauer spectroscopy. It blew my mind when I discovered this technique and how it works.</p>
<p>The goal of Mossbauer spectroscopy is to perform the spectroscopy of the nucleus of an atom. From a quantum mechanics point of view it makes no difference with the spectroscopy of electronics states of an atom (with regular light). In order to make the spectroscopy of an element (Fe for instance) you use another Fe atom that you excite (using radioactivity). Since both elements are exactly the same, the emitted photon will match the excited state's energy of the atom you want to probe. But in fact the two energies (from the emitting atom and receiving atom) can be slightly different due to the chemical environment of the atoms, so the idea of this technique is to change the energy of the emitted photons by physically moving the atoms in the source with a motor. Imagine that just a velocity of a few mm/s is enough the shift the energy of the photons such that the interaction will happen of not. This is a crazy tiny difference of energy! So by plotting the flux of photon going though the receiving sample with the emitting sample velocity you have the spectrum of your sample.</p>
<p>This example shows how precise the energy matching between incoming photon and energy difference between two states has to be. Now coming back to your question the answer is that the energy of a spectral line and that of a photon are never perfectly defined. This has to do with Heisenberg Uncertainty principle (delta_E x delta_T &gt; (h_bar/2)). The longer a state can last the smaller its line width. And the energy precision of a photon will depends on the time it takes for a photon to be emitted. In the case of nuclear transition these line width can be extremely small due to the fact the nucleus is well isolated from its environment, and its quantum states can stay coherent for a long time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People have already brought up the time-energy uncertainty principle and provided good examples. I’d like to add that one my major qualms with introductory quantum mechanics language is that it’s often sloppy (sorta hard not to be) in that it gives this misconception of a wave-packet with a single frequency. It’s a fundamental property Fourier transform theory that such a picture of a wave doesn’t make any sense, that is, if there’s a finite distribution of the wave in time or space, then there’s a finite distribution in energy or momentum, respectively. The Wikipedia page on single photon sources discusses this idea in some good amount of detail.</p>
<p>TLDR: Heisenberg uncertainty principle tells you nothing is exact in practice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thing is, you don't need exact energies to excite the energy levels. The absorption is strongest near some energy level, but there is some weaker absorption above and below it.</p>
<p>Practically, you can have level splitting that artificially broadens any absorption line (doppler broadening, pressure broadening, etc.), but even ignoring those, energy levels have natural linewidths due to energy-time uncertainty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
