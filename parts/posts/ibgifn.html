Now, you're not perfectly symmetrical. No human is, although some are closer than others. When you see a photo, you're seeing the flip of that reflection, and your brain sees it differently. It doesn't line up with what you're used to, and so you find yourself less attractive in photos.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because posing for a photo is a skill, and so is taking a camera angle which flatters the subject. Most photos are taken extemporaneously by amateurs of non-models, and exactly one frame is taken. When you see a photograph which is taken of a model by a professional photographer, that photo is one of hundreds or thousands which has been selected because the pose best flatters the subject. Or, on the other hand, photographs of politicians are selected of those that are least flattering when they're run in news outlets ideologically opposed to the politician in question.</p>
<p>Here's a specific example. <a href="https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/24/931/524/694940094001_6089130430001_6089128945001-vs.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1" target="_blank">This</a> is a photo I grabbed off of Fox News of Nancy Pelosi. <a href="https://media.npr.org/assets/news/2010/09/21/pelosi-5d94489f1fb5d7d2077f4b562daafbc442f4f53d-s800-c85.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a> is the same person depicted by NPR.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People are talking a lot about the flip, but there are many other factors! The biggest one is typically lighting. Lots of bathroom mirrors have strong lights above or around the mirror, which lights up the face in a way that shows off all the good features. It shows your face the best it can look.</p>
<p>Now in the camera, normally people don’t know how to take a good picture of people. They take them in bad lighting, at bad angles, and with a bad focal length lens. This stuff is why portrait mode makes people look so good - they’ve digitally recreated a professional photography portrait set up. Some cameras even have a different physical lens for portraits.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of how a lens/distance from the camera changes appearance:
