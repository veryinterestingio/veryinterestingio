		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a looooot of nerve endings in the skin, and they relay all kinds of stimulation information to the brain. When skin is healing, those nerves in the area send signals to the brain that there are changes taking place (aka healing). The brain interprets this as itching. </p>
<p>Also, when we are injured, in one part of the process the body takesv to recognize and start repairs, hystamine is released. This is the same chemical that signals allergic reactions, also causing itchiness. </p>
<p>Just like with any itch, our bodies reward us for scratching it. This is the one time you <em>don't</em> want to scratch though! Resist the temptation in order to prevent infection and scarring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe it has to do with your histamine system. One time while I was in the military, I got caught up with a serious poison ivy patch. I had it everywhere, including my dick and balls. They were swollen to the size of tennis balls and I had the flaccid girth of a Coke can, it was an incredibly miserable and painful experience. I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy.</p>
<p>My only respite was taking a scalding hot shower, letting the hot water run on the rashes felt like I was having a full body orgasm. I was giving myself 1st degree burns in the process, but it felt so awesome. Apparently hot water triggers the same nerves that cause itching to feel good.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Look up neurodermatitis. It has to do with reward circuitry, as it's very clearly a compulsive behavior. </p>
<p>Itching is a thing, but people like doing this without any itch, so there's a lot more to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Broke my leg a month ago and had 2 surgeries. Over the last couple days I’ve had itching occur in places where I still have nerve damage. It’s quite the experience to feel an itch and realize mid scratch that you can’t actually feel the spot that’s itching, therefor rendering the scratch useless and tipping the scale more toward insanity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
