		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have the science side covered. Talk to your apartment and ask that they move you. They have rendered your apartment unliveable, by not tearing the other down to studs to remove the smell. It sucks a lot for them, but that's what insurance is for. Demand that they move you, and get it in writing. You shouldn't live with that smell. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As u/Lazaryx said below, those stinking things are amines, and they tend to be absorbed by different materials. So it's almost impossible to get them out of walls unless you're willing to strip the plaster and renovate the walls. This is typically an issue with nicotine (also an amine). You can clearly say where smoker lives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When a body rots its broken down by bacteria producing putracine and cadaverine these compounds are incredible smelly and have a long half life in an enclosed environment. because the smell of rotting flesh was a very good thing thing for us to have evolutionary speaking. It helped us avoid dead or decaying flesh that could be from disease, predators leftovers or from eating rotting the meat ourselves. we and most other animals are quite sensitive to the smell so even a little bit will set off your olfactory senses.  Add to that that it really doesn't come off this olfactory senses for days after exposure it can be rough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Somewhat similar story. I’m a funeral director and upon taking a job much earlier in my career, I went looking for an apartment. I looked at a few places before coming to one that looked really nice, however...the second I walked in, I detected a very familiar smell. The landlord showed me around a while before I finally stopped and asked him how long the previous tenant had been dead in the apartment. He froze, then looked kind of ashamed and told me the guess was 2 weeks give or take. Said they had the place cleaned or so he thought but knew the smell was still there. I thanked him, wished him luck in finding someone with no sense of smell and booked it out of there. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Every piece of drywall comes out. We stain block every stud. We grind concrete and even cut out sections. (Concrete is very permeable.) </p>
<p>That smell even sometimes stays after that. (Or at least a placebo smell stays) that’s an actual thing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
