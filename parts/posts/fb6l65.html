		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a study on insomnia, the results were that if they thought 'don't fall asleep' over and over they would fall asleep fast than when they try to fall asleep. </p>
<p>Also you might already be asleep! In another study when patients brain activity showed that they were in early stages of sleep they were woken up, but the insomniac people would say I was already awake!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have suggested good potential reasons already so I'll just point out one that's a little more uncommon. If you are a person whose blood tends to pool in your legs during the day, then lying down to go to sleep can wake you up because your brain is finally getting all the blood it wants. If this is the problem for you, then you can fix it by lying down with your legs up for less than ten minutes about an hour before bedtime.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it's because your body is finally resting but your brain is still stimulated and not able to &quot;shut down&quot; yet. But looking forward to some scientific answer someone may have.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way you fall asleep is through the activation of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid, or GABA.</p>
<p>Now, the reason you're not asleep is that your hypothalamus secretes a chemical called acetylcholine to wake you up. When you're asleep for a long time, you experience a buildup of chemicals, and the acetylcholine wins. (That's how caffeine seems to work, by influencing levels of acetylcholine.) In contrast, a chemical called adenosine builds up with activity and hinders acetylcholine, so we get tired.</p>
<p>As the day wears on, your sleep drive builds as acetylcholine and other chemicals that induce wakefulness decline. Meanwhile, your melatonin rises several hours before bedtime, eventually overpowering what's left of your acetylcholine. So if you have trouble sleeping, then it's actually your preparation for your default state that's broken, indicating you have a very fundamental biological defect that needs some examining.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
