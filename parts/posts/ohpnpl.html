What is it that is chemically or otherwise different that prevents RNA from creating a double strand like its counterpart DNA?  I asked the professor at the time, but never was given an answer other than IDK.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It absolutely will, given the chance.</p>
<p>This is the case in many viruses that have doublestranded RNA as their genome.</p>

<p>Additionally, it also sort of happens in humans. It's not exactly a double-strand but complementary bases can cause the RNA to fold into non-linear shapes. This is integral for the function of certain RNAs, most notably tRNA, the things that match up the codons on mRNA with the associated aminoacid during translation:</p>

<p>So, the actual reason that we don't have actual doublestrands in humans is very simple: Our cells simply only make one strand at a time as that suffices for what we need.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
