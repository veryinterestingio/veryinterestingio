		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Salt water fishes kidneys are crazy good at filtering out salt from the water.  Fresh water doesn’t have nearly as much salt, so when you put a salt water fish into fresh water, it’s kidneys filter out way too much salt.</p>
<p>Salt helps regulate how much water is in your blood, too much and your tissues dry up like a raisin, too little your tissues blow up like a balloon.</p>
<p>Salt water fishes in fresh water die by having their organs like their brain swell up inside a size limited bony skull, causing too much pressure, then death.</p>
<p>Same thing would happen to you if you drank too much water at one time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Late to the party, but I fished a fresh water lake this year, apparently they are stocking red drum (salt water fish) in fresh water lakes. This makes fish sterile, but they get fairly big. I reeled in a 29&quot; fish myself, and we caught 10 that day. </p>
<p>Not saying this is typical, and clearly there are consequences, but it is possible in some cases. I don't believe there are alit of species that can survive both.</p>
<p>And my statement isn't meant to discount any if the science mentioned above.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In chemistry, there is this thing called 'osmotic pressure'. If you have two containers of water, one with a lot of salt and one without, and they are connected in a way that would let the water through but not the salt, then osmotic pressure tends to push water from the not salty container to the salty container. There can be other things affecting the water; for example if the salty container is under more mechanical pressure, it can make water flow from the salty container to the non-salty container (this is 'reverse osmosis')</p>
<p>Fish tend to be more salty than freshwater, and less salty than salt water, so freshwater fish have adaptations to push water out of themselves, and saltwater fish have adaptations to pull water into themselves. If you put a freshwater fish in salt water, it will push out too much water and die of dehydration. If you put a saltwater fish in fresh water, it will pull in too much water and drown.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>There may be some that are born in the sea and migrate into freshwater for all I know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how when you take a bath, and you play with your toys for a long time, your fingers get all pruney? Something similar happens with fish.<br />
There is salt in your body. When you play in the tub, the freshwater in the tub, is absorbed by your body, to try and dilute the saltiness to match the water in the tub. This is called osmosis. When your fingers absorb all that extra freshwater, they puff up and get all wrinkly.<br />
If you put saltwater fish into freshwater, they will absorb excess amounts of water through their skin. They will puff up just like your fingers do in the tub. Sometimes, this can kill them, but there are some fish that are used to it, the same way that you don't die from taking a bath.<br />
If you put freshwater fish in salt water, the opposite happens. The water in their bodies gets pulled out into the salty surroundings. Without water in thier bodies, they die.<br />
High levels of salt is toxic to many things.<br />
Before refrigerators were invented, people used to put salt on the outside of meat, because the salt would draw out and moisture in the meat, and preserve it. It would also kill any germs on the meat, by pulling the water out of them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
