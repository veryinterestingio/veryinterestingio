		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>.44 and .50 are the diameter of the bullet in inches - except .44 magnum is actually more like .42 inches, but it's still called .44 because it is based off of the .44 Special, which in turn was based off of the .44 Smith &amp; Wesson American, which actually was .44 inches.</p>
<p>5.56 is the diameter of that bullet in mm. A 5.56x45 mm round is 5.56 mm in diameter, which is around .224 inches.</p>
<p>Basically, they're usually either the diameter in inches, or the diameter in mm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the simplest terms, they represent the diameter in inches (.40&quot;, .22&quot;, .45&quot;) or in millimeters (9mm).</p>
<p>For shotgun gauges, it was the number of round balls that equaled a pound.  12 gauge were 12 balls, 20 gauge 20 balls.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally, the caliber refers to the diameter of the bullet itself, either in mm (5.56, for example) or inches (.45). Now, the actual diameter can vary significantly from what the name states. And the exact same diameter, and often the exact same bullet, can be used in a variety of different kinds of ammunition; for example, many bullets used in .40S&amp;W can also be used in 10mm. The only real easy hard rule is that there are no easy hard rules. Ammunition loading handbooks contain literally thousands of measurements, variations, and sub-types.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh boy... Chambering nomenclature is an absolute Charlie Foxtrot, even for people that nerd out over guns.</p>
<p>They are basically all semi-arbitrary and half branding.</p>
<p>About the only semi-consistent point is that the first number is the bullet diamete... unless it's the bore diameter... and the bore diameter might be measured groove-to-groove or land-to-land.</p>
<p>Also, the power of the round is only loosely correlated to the bullet/bore diameter, as the amount of powder behind the bullet matters a lot more for power.</p>
<p>That said, there are a few locally-consistant conventions that are used, such as by NATO.</p>
<p>NATO chambering designation lists the bullet diameter in millimeters followed by the case length in millimeters, separated by an &quot;x&quot; (pronounced &quot;by&quot;)</p>
<p>For example: the NATO .30 caliber round is designated &quot;7.62x51mm&quot; compared to the Russian .30 caliber rounds which are designated by NATO as &quot;7.62x39mm&quot; (used in the AK-47) and &quot;7.62x54R&quot; (used in the PKM).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one has mentioned shotgun gauges yet, and they're a little more complicated. The number represents how many lead spheres with a diameter equal to that of the gun bore make one US pound. Twelve lead balls with diameter equal to the bore of a 12 gauge make one pound. The only shotgun that does not fit this schema is the .410; it is measured in inches like many other small arms. It's really a bit bigger though because you can shoot a .44 Long Colt pistol round with it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
