		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You want to stay away from binary, yes/no questions.  The answer is almost always yes, but...</p>
<p>Even before variants came along the vaccines weren't 100% effective. Some small number of vaccinated people got sick, some even died.</p>
<p>Some vaccinated individuals can, to some extent transmit disease, but vaccination overall seems to reduce transmission somewhere between moderately and a whole lot, for 2 main reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For most people vaccination completely protects, even against asymptomatic infection. You can't transmit if you're not infected. </p>
</li>
<li>For infections after vaccination that are not debatable, symptoms tend to be much milder, and viral load tends to be much lower. Those infected have less virus to spread and don't spread as much of what they do have. </li>
</ol>
<p>(Related to both points is the question of how exactly &quot;infection&quot; is defined, especially in terms of high cycle PCR positives.)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a simple scientific standpoint, yes they can.  Vacinated people, can still have the virus.  They just have protection against it so it doesn't take over your entire system and make you sick.  At some point though, the virus is in your body and you technically could potentially give it to someone else.  Although, I would believe that the possibility of spreading it is drastically reduced since you yourself do not have trillions upon trillions individual viruses coursing through your body as someone without vaccination would.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer is yes. Early studies have shown that transmission risk is lowered by vaccination, but not nullified. That is part of why everyone who can must be vaccinated. Other than the fact that transmitting is lowered with full vaccination, the risk of transmitting to another individual that is also fully vaccinated is probably even lower.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the risk of the virus mutating is also lower in a vaccinated person as it can reproduce less before being eliminated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Being vaccinated means your body recognizes and kills the virus. But that will still take some time (better than having your body not recognizing there's something wrong until it's too late). During this time, you can still spread the virus. You can still breathe it onto other people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know this hasn't been directly looked at. The delta variant may be slightly (but only slightly) more resistant to vaccine protection. For example, with the Pfizer vaccine efficacy went from <em>93.4% (95%CI: 90.4 to 95.5) with B.1.1.7 to 87.9% (95%CI: 78.2 to 93.2) with B.1.617.2</em> - a barely significant or not significant difference (<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.22.21257658v1" target="_blank">Effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against the B.1.617.2 variant</a>).</p>
<p>So it's possible that there may be more breakthrough infections with delta, but there's no reason to believe that there's a greatly increased risk of the virus asymptomatically breaking through and being transmitted in a large number of vaccinated people.</p>
<p>As for masks, there's really no downside to wearing one, and it might help.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
