		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a scientist and I have had my work discussed in news articles and sites so I'll explain it as I have observed it. The way we do science is very carefully controlled. Anything from the environment, the temperature, the air around it, the type of people/animals the experiment is done on can be set to specific conditions that likely cover only a very very narrow part of all the possible conditions this same experiment happens in outside of the lab.</p>
<p>So we do an experiment, using our specific equipment with our specific people who have their specific training and we get a result. Usually we will do this experiment a few times to make sure the result is real. A lot of experiments end here (but further testing can also be done), a scientific article is submitted containing all our specific conditions, the result they should produce when the experiment is done, our ideas about what the results mean and how they can be used, and importantly, the concerns about the way we did the experiments, any hypotheses about how it may fail otherwise, basically explaining why we can't get too excited about our work just yet.</p>
<p>Once the article is approved, it becomes public, usually on a journal's website. There are science/medical/tech/etc journalists whose job it is to crawl these websites for any new and interesting results, they find one, they read only the very beginning and the very end of the article (where we very often talk about possible applications of the work IF it can be proven to be reproducible, or more safe, or applicable to normal uses/environments) and they write a headline &quot;NEW STUDY PROVES/INDICATES X.&quot; Then people get mad at scientists because they think we are writing these bullshit headlines and we don't know what we're doing.</p>
<p>Another reason is due to the lack of reproducibility in science and medicine (not sure about tech). A lot of experiments are not repeated after the article is published. There is a very oppressive &quot;publish or perish&quot; attitude in science and what ends up happening is that people move on to the next experiment without anyone repeating the previous one to prove it works with different conditions or at least the same conditions and different scientists. This is largely because the amount of money you get to do experiments is tied to your &quot;output.&quot; Then, doing new experiments is incentivized, doing old stuff is not. So something that may be a great idea with great applications is forgotten about for the sake of something new.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Science and medical reporting is notoriously premature. </p>
<p>There are many, many steps between the first glimmering concepts and a final working product or treatment. The news gets written far too early about things that aren't ultimately viable and fail somewhere along the process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of these that you hear of are new studies that haven't gone through the full testing process to be approved for general use.  That's why they often say things like &quot;a new study indicates...&quot;</p>
<p>As for why you don't hear as much about them later, not all of them are followed up on with further studies.  Secondary experiments and studies don't attract as much attention, so many companies, researchers and universities focus more on &quot;discoveries&quot; because they grab attention and attract funding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the initial fanfare tends to be the loudest, and when they show up in real life, they aren't new anymore, so there is not much said about it. But I happen to have a family member who was facing imminent death for lymphoma, and all the standard treatments had been tried already, and his body couldn't take any more chemo... but he was put in an experimental clinical trial for CAR-T therapy. It worked. He's cancer free now. It's a freaking miracle, as far as I'm concerned. So these things do show up in real life, sometimes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You do. 100 years ago cancer was basically 100% fatal outside a few miraculous recoveries. in 2021 many types of cancer have well over 50% survival rates, meaning if you get the cancer you are more likely to survive than die.   </p>
<p>Same with batteries. The battery in your phone now is infinitely better than a battery 20 years ago. Remember when the game gear used like 6 batteries and lasted 2 hours for single use batteries? Now an iphone can have a giant screen, constantly transmit, and last 18 hours on a battery that takes an hour to charge up and can be charged every day for years?  </p>
<p>Both things are steadily improving by leaps and bounds, but never any one magic step where everything is fixed. But lots of things come and then are 5% better, 10% better, 50% better and are big deals, but none of them are just 1000% better in one step that just solves everything forever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
