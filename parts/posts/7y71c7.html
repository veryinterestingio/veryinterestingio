		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Multiple reflexes are triggered by sound (like infants spreading their limbs when they hear a loud bang). Or your inner ear muscles as mentioned before.</p>
<p>For the chemistry it’s not that clear. However, people who live in louder areas (near airports is the best example) do have a lot more cortisol (stress hormone), and a lot more psychiatric problems, such as anxiety and depression. This is likely not as « hard-wired » as light and melatonin, because loud things are naturally stressful and that « stress » could potentially be reduced by other means than removing the noise. However to the best of my knowledge no studies have proven that and it’s possible the noise itself, with or without the subjective stress it’s causing, could affect hormonal balance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's actually a significant and growing body of evidence supporting negative effects of noise-polluted environments across a variety of outcomes; Wikipedia is relatively well-sourced.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_from_noise" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_from_noise</a></p>
<p>The impact on psychological metrics and personality traits isn't too surprising, but the bad cardiovascular outcomes, presumably (but still in need of more research) from chronic, habituated stress responses, is a little more surprising.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about regular sound but I do know about ultrasound. In the world of ultrasound we worry about something called bioeffects. Essentially that is the effect the high frequency vibrations have on tissues. There are two main effects we see from ultrasound on tissue and they are thermal bioeffects and mechanical bioeffects. The thermal bioeffects are the tissues heating up due to friction of cells as they vibrate. You see this used in physical therapy where they use ultrasound (but at a higher amplitude than is used in imaging) to heat up the deep tissues and promote healing. The mechanical bioeffects are basically vibrating the cells so intensely that they rip themselves apart. FDA regulation and the engineers of the machines themselves make it so that could never happen. </p>
<p>It is worth mentioning though that while ultrasound is perfectly safe as it is practiced in our medical world for mature tissues there is some issues when you are doing fetal ultrasound. With fetal ultrasound the intensities of the machine are turned way down to protect the developing tissues and a properly trained ultrasound tech puts in the system that it is a fetal study and the machine will automatically limit what the tech can do. The problem comes when lay persons get ahold of a ultrasound and are not properly trained and then do a fetal ultrasound. If they are using the wrong settings and not setting it on fetal than the intensity of the ultrasound could cause issues. This isn't the problem that it used to be because most places that do that have been shut down but in the 80s and 90s there used to be places in strip malls that would do ultrasound on a fetus and record a video of it for the parents. None of the people that worked in these facilities had any formal training and had no idea the risk they were running. Now most ultrasound labs will do a dvd for the parents of the study for a fee to fill this want by the expecting parents. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes! I actually did a research project on this. We found that skin tends to conduct electricity much better while listening to slow, intimate music compared to aggressive, exciting music.  This is completely a chemical change in the contents of your sweat, and it implies there is something more going on in your brain when you hear sounds.  I don’t have a good source for you because it was years ago and it was never published.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sound is an autonomic trigger that can influence activation of the sympathetic/flight or fight system (typically via very low frequencies) or parasympathetic/social system (via mid frequencies such as singing or speech, which tells your body it's time to be relaxed and possibly social).
This is likely why living near airports causes the issues other posters mentioned: The constant engine sounds are registered as fight or flight/sympathetic triggers, causing us to be stressed and ready to roar. Also, your autonomic state influences just about every single bodily function. So yes, sound does influence body chemistry in at least this manner.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
