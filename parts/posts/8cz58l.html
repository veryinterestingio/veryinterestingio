		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The rules by which citizens may act against a criminal can vary by jurisdiction. There is certainly an element of legal risk if you are not familiar with those of your location (and potentially even if you are), and you could expose yourself to arrest and conviction of various charges (e.g. unlawful restraint, assault, kidnapping) if you fall afoul. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most jurisdictions have laws that allow people who witness serious crimes to use appropriate force to intervene.  If you grapple someone running from a police officer, that is likely going to be ok.  If you hit them in the face with a baseball bat, not so much.</p>
<p>Also, police officers enjoy what is called qualified immunity.  If they make a mistake in the course of performing their duties, they are usually protected from civil repercussions.  You, however, are not, and if an innocent bystander got hurt due to your actions, you could be civilly responsible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Texas checking in. It’s pretty much a free for all with this. Good Samaritan laws are in effect. The problem is that we have guns in Texas and many times they get brought into the mix, which can be very problematic. As seen in other comments, be REASONABLE. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
