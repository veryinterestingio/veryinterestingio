<p>Edit: Question answered. Several very knowledgeable people have done a great job of explaining that there is no &quot;attachment&quot; rather there is no end between bone/tendon and muscle, they all just merge into each other. Which is pretty amazing when you think about it. Thanks everyone. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tendons are something in between pure fibrous tissue and bone tissue. So they kinda stick to the respective bone as a very adhesive tissue that is interwoven with the bone cortex. As you follow the tendon to the where it connects with muscle, it is more fibrous is origin and resembles muscle itself in structure. Follow it towards bone, it becomes sturdier and more bone-like in quality.</p>
<p>So tendons are a kind of bridge between mucle and bone where in the outskirts the tissue flows in each other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Picture it like this. Each muscle cell is wrapped in the tendon like a Tootsie roll with really long tails. They're then grouped together with all the tails together and then that merges/bonds with a bigger Tootsie roll wrapper around all of it and this repeats a few times getting bigger and bigger until the entire muscle mass is achieved. Even though there's layers of wrapper all throughout the muscle we call it a tendon where it protrudes at the end and attaches to the bone on the rough patches of the bone. </p>
<p>I forgot all the technical words, but that's the basic idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Macroscopically there is a very distinct end to a bone and a tendon. We exploit this all the time in surgery. Microscopically it is more complicated. There are fibers (sharpeys) that interweave and connect tendons to bones.  We cut these when doing tendon transfers etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At entheses, the tendon or attaches either directly to the bone or indirectly to it via the periosteum, i.e. the outermost layer of the bone. If you look at a histological section of it, there is no point of clear differentiation between where the bone ends and the tendon begins, but rather there is fibrocartilaginous tissue present at the site of entheses. The adhesives that you are probably looking for are zona adherens (adherent junctions) which are normally placed between most of the cells and not just at the enthesis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Muscle, bone and tendon are all synonymous with each other. There is no glue or magical stuff that holds them together. If you think of how muscles bone and tendon are shown in lab books all with distinct breaks starts and ends is actually a bit misleading. We as humans created those breaks in muscle just so we in the scientific community have a way of communicating with each other so that we know exactly what we are talking about. That is the difference between dead person anatomy and living anatomy. In a live person one piece of muscle flows into the next and so on, that’s what makes it so durable.
If you were to biopsy where a muscle turns into a tendon, you would NOT be able to find a distinct break where you could definitively say this is muscle and this is bone. The fibers just happen to transition from stuff that represents muscle toward stuff that represents tendon and from stuff that represents tendon to bone in its chemical make up.
Bone tendon ligament and muscle are all made of the same parts of ground substance, but express them self differently based on the stresses that are placed through them. That’s why if a person has an ACL reconstruction an initial biopsy post surgery would show that it is still whatever was grafted there to help repair it. Fast forward several years after the reconstruction has had forces placed through it similar to what a traditional ACL would have, that biopsy would reveal that whatever was grafted there now has ligamentous type expression. </p>
<p>Hope that helps.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
