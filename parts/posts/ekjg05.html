		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This study by <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10530-014-0713-2" target="_blank">Jacob et al. 2014</a> looks into this question for pigeons in western Europe.  They found a correlation between increasing genetic distance and larger geographical distances (<a href="https://media.springernature.com/lw785/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10530-014-0713-2/MediaObjects/10530_2014_713_Fig1_HTML.gif" target="_blank">see figure</a>), meaning that nearby pigeons are more likely to be closely related to each other.  However, the measures of population differentiation they used also clearly show that there is at least some ongoing gene flow and migration even between the most distant of the locations they studied.  To summarize, there is enough migration going on to keep these populations connected, but not so much that all pigeon populations are genetically indistinguishable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I gotta say that one of the things I would love to research, if I was still in the research half of academia and I had the funding, would be the genetic relationships of a lot of human-associated species.  I'm always wondering what the population structure of the feral cats in my town is.  Are they related, or from independent introductions of strays?  And what about rats?  Pigeons are an excellent question as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
