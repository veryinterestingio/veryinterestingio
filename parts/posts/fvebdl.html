<p>Just one idea - do you have access to an ATM that accepts cash deposits?  If so, go deposit the money (either immediately or after Lysoling) and then wash your hands / sanitize.  It’s a lot less handling of the bills.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I would personally put the money away as long as possible (I.e. let it sit until you absolutely need it). 5 days you should be good, but it obviously depends on the initial viral load. If you have a UVC light you could disinfect the money relatively quickly.</p>
<p>Edit: soap and water seems to be a good option as well, if the dollar bills can tolerate it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depending on your country, wash it with soap and water. Let it sit for 5 minutes, lay flat to dry. Normal soap destroys the virus coat, and doesn’t pose the same risk of causing mutation that UV lights and chemicals do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
