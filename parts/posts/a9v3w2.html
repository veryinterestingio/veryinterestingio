		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, <em>i</em> came about because we just decided to create a new number to fill an existing gap (&quot;you can't take the square root of a negative number&quot;). We made the definition that, whatever the square root of -1 is, we would call it <em>i</em>. The lovely thing is that it fits perfectly with the existing body of math, and so making this jump actually makes sense. As an example, you can rewrite √(-4) as √(4)×√(-1), by using regular algebra. √(4) is just 2, so that becomes 2×√(-1) or 2<em>i</em>. Square root of -4 is twice the square root of -1, just like square root of positive four is twice the square root of positive one. This makes sense.</p>
<p>So let's make that same jump for division by zero. Let's take 1/0 and, whatever that number is, call it <em>q</em>. We now have the relationship</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1/0 = q</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which we can rewrite using regular algebra as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 = q×0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this has a problem. An equation that looks like this can't exist alongside the math that we already have, because we <em>already</em> have a definition for zero times a number. Zero times any number, positive negative imaginary or otherwise, is by definition zero. Zero times three million is zero, zero times -47<em>i</em> is zero, zero times <em>q</em> should also be zero. We can't assign a value to x/0, because of the way we already define zero.</p>
<p>TL;DR: making <em>i</em> meant making some new rules, but they fit perfectly with the ones we already have. They just added extra stuff we could do. Making a value for 1/0 would require breaking rules that already exist in math.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for all the positive feedback, it warms my heart to see so many people thinking and wondering about math. My answer is of course my own simplified slice of a very rich topic. I couldn't help but notice that some of you are naturally thinking and asking towards a bigger slice: <strong>limits</strong>. What if we don't just look at an isolated point like &quot;7/0 = ?&quot;, but instead have a whole function to work with? We can get some interesting and much more satisfying answers by looking at how the function behaves as it gets closer and closer to dividing by zero.</p>
<p>The simplest such function is y = 1/x, which is easy enough to answer for every nonzero x-value. What about at x = 0? Well let's look at the <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%2Fx" target="_blank">graph</a>. If we start on the left side and follow the curve closer and closer to the y-axis, it shoots way down towards negative infinity. If we follow the same approach from the right side, it heads towards positive infinity. You can see why, unlike <em>i</em>, there isn't a single answer when dividing by zero. Even just this one function points to two different answers depending on how we come at it.</p>
<p>Okay, let's try <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sin(x\)%2Fx" target="_blank">y = sin(x)/x</a>. Just worry about how it looks right beside the y-axis, on both sides. As you get closer and closer to x = 0, since sine of 0 equals 0, you approach the question y = 0/0 = what? This time however, the function points towards an answer of 1, no matter which direction you approach from. So in this case, we can say that the <em>limit</em> of the function as you <em>approach</em> 0/0 is 1. The specific point &quot;y = 0/0&quot; isn't calculatable and has no defined value, but the nice and simple behaviour of the function through that point lets us say the <em>limit</em> at that point is 1. Mind you, this is only when you approach it from inside that exact function. </p>
<p>In <em>general</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The limit as you approach a &quot;1/0&quot; case will  be positive or negative infinity, depending on the function and the direction you approach.</li>
<li>The limit as you approach a &quot;0/0&quot; case can be any number, infinity, or no definite value, depending on the same.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer is that imaginary numbers are named poorly and do actually exist.</p>
<p>Basically imaginary numbers do exist they are just located above the standard number line. in reality the number line is more like a number field that occupies a 2d grid. When you multiply a value by i you are actually just rotating that number by 90 degrees on this grid. multiplying by i^2 will move you 180 degrees which gives the same result as multiplying by -1.</p>
<p>Dividing by 0 on the other hand has no such logical consistency on mathematics. If you take a number and divide it by 0 it will look like the answer is approaching infinity and -infinity at the same time depending on which direction you are looking at. So is it -infinity or infinity? neither its undefined. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Regarding dividing by zero, we want mathemetical operations to give one defined answer. Dividing by zero does not give one answer. Why is that? Well if you divide by numbers close to zero you will see the problem.</p>
<p>1/0.001 = 1000</p>
<p>1/0.000001 = 1000 000</p>
<p>1/-0.001 = -1000</p>
<p>1/-0.000001 = -1000 000</p>
<p>As you see if we approach zero from the positive side the value increases, but approaching from the negaive side the value decreases. As we approach zero the values will approach plus infinity and minus infinity. So the operation of dividing by zero doesn't give a defined answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thing about math is it's like a game: the rules are whatever we want them to be and depending on what you want to get out of the game, you can choose different rules.</p>
<p>Now, for what almost everyone on the planet wants to get out of math, and the rules to that effect, assigning a value to zero breaks shit. It just breaks all the shit. It makes everything true and false at the same time. You have dogs and cats, living together. MASS HYSTERIA. That said, there are some dark corners where some people play with some house rules where it's allowed, but these niche cases that most people won't ever delve in.</p>
<p>But, for square root of -1, given the rules almost everyone plays with, it <em>has</em> a value. It just does. Back in the olden days, when people were trying to solve certain kinds of equations, we ended up having to deal with the square roots of negative numbers. Now, in the end, they cancelled out and we only had to deal with them temporarily, but the fact that we could perform arithmetic operations and get sensible answers (as opposed to dividing by zero which just outputs nonsense) meant that they had some sort of value. They had <em>meaning.</em></p>
<p>At the time, people didn't like this (though they had to accept it, since the answers to the questions they were asking depended on it) and they ended up with derogatory names like <em>useless</em> and <em>imaginary</em>. But, at the end of the day, they have been developed into their own set of numbers related and connected to all the other &quot;real&quot; numbers you know, with lots of practical and useful properties, even extending into the real world.</p>
<p>Unlike dividing by zero, which just ruins your day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
