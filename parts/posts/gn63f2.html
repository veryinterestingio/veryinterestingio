		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have two tribes. Tribe 1 and Tribe 2. Tribe 1 has lived on the land and farmed it for thousands of years. Tribe 2 comes in a few hundreds years ago from a civil war in a nearby kingdom. Tribe 2 are nomadic herders. Their livestock eats up some of the farming land of tribe 1. A few centuries of this and famines are blamed on them. The Belgians forced Tribe 1 and Tribe 2 different equal political power positions. The Belgians leave Rwanda and a few decades after tribe 1 blames tribe 2 for a recent famine..... despite both of them basically being agricultural now. Tribe 1 has control of the government, military and press. They start marking passports and IDs of tribe 2. The Congo has a civil war, some border incidents are blamed on Tribe 2, tribe 1 takes it as an excuse to wipe them out. The world as a whole is to focused on the breakup of Yugoslavia to care.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I understood it like this:</p>
<p>The Belgian colonists divide the Rwandans into two tribes: a smaller one and a big one. They force the smaller one to rule over the big one for many years leading to bad sentiments towards the smaller one, although they live side by side. When the Belgians leave Rwanda, the big tribe is like “but there’s more of us”. So they overthrow the small tribe and kill and rape huge amounts of them. (Long pause.) Members of the smaller tribe find god and miraculously forgive members of the big tribe who killed their family - in some cases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, the tutsi minority (~10-15%) was the ruling class of the kingdom before colonization. Traditionally they were herders with a strong military tradition.</p>
<p>The hutus were the majority, but divided and traditionally farmers.</p>
<p>Then the Belgians came, with the Catholic Church. When they left the country for real (early 1990s), they left &quot;democracy&quot; behind them. So the tutsi knew they would never be able to take the power back, because when you impose &quot;democracy&quot; in a country where the society is organised around your ethnicity, the biggest group always wins.</p>
<p>So the civil war started, and the genocide is only the final act of years of fighting.</p>
<p>The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda investigated but failed to prove the premeditation of the genocide. It also didn't investigate those who took power after the genocide (RPF, ~ tutsi rebels led by the still current president kagame).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the time Rwanda was predominantly made up of two groups: the Hutu, who made up around 85% of the population; and the Tutsi, who made up around 14% of the population. Decades before during Belgian occupation, these groups became social classes, with the Tutsi being the minority rule. The Tutsi were given higher paying jobs, better education and many more benefits, but importantly, everyone had to have ethnic ids and lists were made up of everyone. At this time there were many riots and a lot of tension between the ruling Tutsis and the Hutu. But when the Belgian’s left in 1962, power was given to the Hutu - the long oppressed majority. Between this and the genocide there was still unresolved hate for the Tutsi and there were many riots and purges of the minority group.</p>
<p>In 1994, Rwanda was under a one party, far right, Hutu government and there was even more tension then every between the Hutu and the Tutsi. On April 6th 1994, the presidents plane was shot down and everyone died. The Hutu government and people blamed the Tutsis and within hours all of the capital was shutdown with barricades and roadblocks. </p>
<p>The genocide was planned, and within hours Hutu militia groups began efficiently and systematically killing every member of the Tutsi population.</p>
<p>Edit: Sorry if it’s a bit long or not basic enough, its my first time righting one of these and I’ve been to Rwanda to learn about this so I wanted to share.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
