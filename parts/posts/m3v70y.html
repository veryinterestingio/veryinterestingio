<p>There is some interesting research on this topic; that the skin's microbiome (the bacteria that live on our skin, and feed on our secretions, etc) actually has a protective role to play against uv light.  I would assume that taking antibiotics has a deleterious affect on these bacteria this causing the photosensitivity.</p>
<p>It's a fascinating, and growing line of research.</p>
<p>Edit:. For anyone interested, here is a great paper:

I've seen this on malaria medications which is especially important because malaria is often found at latitudes where the sun is stronger anyways.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am actually shocked that this isn't talked about more often. If you are on a diuretic then this can happen. Like furosemide or hydrochlorothiazide. Sulfonamides like Bactrim. Even if you have darker skin you can still get a sun rash/burn. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also a somehow lesser known thing to think about is Metronidazole can cause some pretty severe reactions with alcohol. Don't even risk using a mouthwash that has alcohol in it. It always shocked me how few people knew this considering a very large percentage of the adult female population has taken Metronidazole at some point in their life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
