		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s not so much a case that it took a long time for people including artists to be aware of these effects, more a case that what artists were trying to achieve in their art has changed over time. A painting can be made to do a number of things. One of those is to be an optically accurate representation of the world. Another is to provide a representational depiction of people, places and events. If your objective is the second of these, then doing things like making the important people the focus of the painting, and depicting them in a way that indicates who and what they are is important. For example if you want to show a man is a king and guided by God, give him a huge crown and add a hand of God directing him. It’s not optically correct, but it tells you something about the person place and events.</p>
<p>It took until the modern period for the idea to gain widespread acceptance that producing an optically accurate representation of the world was actually a worthwhile and valuable thing for an artist to attempt to do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The shortest and simplest answer is that artists weren't trying to figure out perspective the whole time. </p>
<p>The idea of a linear evolution of art – they got better and better and better at replicating reality until they got so good that they moved toward abstraction, non-objectivism, etc. – really only came to be after they 'cracked' linear perspective ca. 1435. </p>
<p>Throughout history (including before and during the Renaissance a lot of artists didn't care about exacting (linear) perspective because it didn't matter. </p>

<p>I just want to add that the way people view illusions of three-dimensional spaced on two-dimensional planes has been intrinsically changed by technology available to them. Before the advent of photography people saw painted images differently. It's the same with television and moving pictures (which is the era I study). There is a difference in the representation of space in paintings done immediately prior to and after the invention of the moving picture. It has to do, in part, with the existence and location of the plane separating you from the depicted scene. When you go see a movie, the plane is the movie screen. It is the two-dimension barrier which you can't pass, and behind which the scene exists. Before photography there was no barrier (other than the canvas or the wood support). </p>
<p>It's kind of like when you look at a hidden image (the vase/face picture, for example). Once you see it you can't really un-see it. It has changed the way you look at the picture and you can't go back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are better answers by pros in this thread but two things I want to add...</p>
<p>Early medieval and classical artists were just worried about other things. They didn’t put a high value on geometrically accurate perspective, they wanted to give figures importance based on things like...how holy they were. Holy people would be physically larger in some paintings, or closer to god. </p>
<p>Also, they knew that the farther away things were the smaller they got, but they didn’t know the rules that governed these ratios and for thousands of years, no one was really trying to figure it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Roman architects used perspective in their drawings, and roman paintings also show they knew how to depict 3D objects well. </p>
<p>For iconic religious pictures it's not necessary, nor was it desirable. It was a symbol, not a realistic reproduction to draw the attention completely to the meaning of it. </p>
<p>Perspective took off again with printed books. The idea could be spread far and wide and the focus in art and science had shifted towards realistic depictions of the world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
