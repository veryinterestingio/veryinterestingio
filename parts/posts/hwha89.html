		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In order for current to flow, you need to have a complete circuit. A normal light with a single switch is just one loop of wire. When the switch is off, the loop is open. When the switch is on, the loop closes and completes the circuit.</p>
<p>For the double switch lights, it's still a complete circuit, but it has two switches. In between the two switches there are actually two paths - let's call them Path A and Path B. Instead of opening the loop or closing it, each switch controls whether it is connected to Path A or Path B. When they're on the same path, there's a complete circuit and the bulb lights up.</p>
<p>So if they're both on Path A, the light is on. You can turn the light off by flipping one switch, because now one switch is on Path A and the other is on Path B. If you want to turn the light on, you can flip either switch - putting them both on Path B, or putting the first switch back on Path A.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It uses multiway switching techniques. It is easier to understand with pictures than explaining. This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiway_switching#Traveler_system" target="_blank">wikipedia article</a> shows in pictures some ways to implement this, the most common is the traveler system, which uses two three-way switches.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The key is that there is two wires between the switches and when you flip the switch you change what wire it is connected to. If both are connected to the same wire the lamp is on and if they are connected to different wires the lamp is off.  </p>
<p>Look at the illustration on Wikipedia below because it is simpler to get than any text. It is clear that if you flip any switch when it is off the result is that the lamp is on</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's 2 paths for the electricity to travel and the switch.. well switches the path it takes. If both switches are on the same path, it's &quot;on&quot;. </p>
<p>If they're not on the same path, the electricity can't go to the light so it's &quot;off&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
