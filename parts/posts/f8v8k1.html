		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiolite" target="_blank">ophiolites</a> are portions (sometimes semi-complete sections) of oceanic crust that have been 'obducted' onto continental crust along collisional boundaries between plates. If you look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ophiolites" target="_blank">list of ophiolites</a>, you'll see that they can be found in active mountain ranges (e.g. the ones in the Himalaya) and places where there use to be a convergent margin (e.g. the ophiolites in California, which were emplaced before the formation of the San Andreas fault system). Some ophiolites are pretty small, but in some cases, they're quite large, both in terms of how much of the oceanic crust and upper mantle is preserved, but also their length, e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semail_Ophiolite" target="_blank">the Oman ophiolite</a>.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> To address a common type of comment that is appearing elsewhere in this thread, examples of marine rocks on land do not equal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_crust" target="_blank">oceanic crust</a> on land. Large portions of most mountain ranges are indeed marine rocks (because most large mountain ranges represent the closure of an ocean basin), but these are typically thin veneers of sedimentary cover originally deposited on oceanic crust or thinned continental crust that are scraped off during collision (with the oceanic crust mostly being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction" target="_blank">subducted</a>). Similarly, there are various scenarios where shallow oceans existed on continents (e.g. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Interior_Seaway" target="_blank">western interior seaway</a>) leading to the deposition of marine rocks directly on continental crust.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes there are! One good spot to see this is the West side of Catalina Island off the coast of Southern California. The West side of the island is mostly made up of oceanic crust that was uplifted in the various orogenies that formed the mountains of Southern California. The rocks there are flaky with a dark color and greenish quartz crystalline inclusions. As a result the beaches have a very unique gray/green color. </p>
<p>It’s quite a trek to get to that side of the island (it’s pretty remote despite its proximity to Los Angeles), but well worth it for the interesting geology, beautiful beaches, and solitude.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ophiolites are slabs of oceanic crust deposited on land.  There's one in the Lizard, UK (I have a lump of mantle Dunite I collected from there), but there's a few around the world.  Unst in Shetland has one in the north of the island, there's the Troodos Ophiolite in Cyprus, and a big one in Oman, amongst others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oceanic crust is largely at lower elevations than continental crust due to a combination of being denser and thinner. </p>
<p>Ophiolites are the best answer to your question.</p>
<p>Another more controversial answer would be hotspot related island chains. Such as Hawaii. While not your textbook oceanic crust, these igneous regions sit at a higher elevations due to the crust being thicker.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
