So why can't our body just flip a switch and turn on a fever essentially. I have plenty of &quot;stored&quot; energy so I don't see how that would be a problem.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add context to the top answers - the reason why your body is more interested in conserving heat than it is in heating up is that most of your bodily processes will continue if you're cold, and it takes a ton of energy (comparatively) to pump up the thermostat.</p>
<p>All of your body's various nervous system functionalities are geared for survival. Survival is massively dependent on energy use. Your body manages its calories very carefully, and has a lot of mechanisms in place to store and hold onto calories. It's why we get fat, and it's why our ancestors were able to run down prey much larger than ourselves without tiring. Creation of heat takes a relative ton of calories - your body naturally creates some heat as a byproduct of your energy cycle, but creating more incurs an expensive calorie cost.</p>
<p>Actual regulation of bodily temperature is an important concept to survival - all of the proteins you have in your body are finely-tuned to work at 37°C/98.6°F. If your body goes appreciably above that, the proteins begin to denature (unravel) and lose functionality. When your body detects an immune response, it decides that the high calorie cost and potential protein/cellular damage is likely worth it to fight off the infection. This is why you feel like shit when you run a fever - your bodily processes aren't working as efficiently. You're sore (muscles are not as effectively repairing themselves / carting away metabolic byproducts as quickly), fatigued (less energy available because you're running your internal furnace trying to burn out the infection), and with extreme fevers you're probably delirious (actual damage to brain tissue caused by extreme fever denaturing proteins necessary for your brain to function).</p>
<p>So the question and answer with greater context, now; why doesn't your body just turn up the thermostat when you're feeling cold? Because between creating more heat and conserving the heat you already have, conservation is the one that will keep you alive longer per calorie spent. Vasoconstriction is the body's method of triage when dealing with cold; check out your fingers next time they're really cold, and you'll notice that they are lighter in color. This is because the tissue in them has received a neural response to tightly clamp down on blood vessels, which lessens heat loss due to your blood circulating through that area. The concept is that less warm blood flowing out to your extremities, cooling, and then flowing back to your core to lower your core body temperature will keep you alive the longest at the lowest calorie count. Conserving the heat costs way less calories than making more of it. If instead you tried to keep the whole body warm all the time by producing more heat, you'd be dead way earlier due to radiating the heat away and having to keep producing more.</p>
<p>It's 100% about survival. Your parasympathetic nervous system doesn't know the difference between the A/C being up too high and you being stranded in the middle of a frozen tundra. It acts accordingly.</p>
<p>Edited to put more emphasis on the fact that it's more expensive to produce more heat relative to conserving it. The overall goal is to maximize time survived per calorie.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It tries, but you are leaking heat far faster than your body's ability to produce it.  The problem isn't heat production; it's heat loss.  There's a reason why people used to put people with high fevers in an ice bath.  That reason is because it works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you get sick, the thermostat in your body is increased from 98.6F to &gt;100F. This is caused by whatever is making you ill. When you are feeling cold, instead of turning the thermostat up, it tells your body to shiver and constrict blood vessels to keep heat in. </p>
<p>The reason why you don’t want that thermostat being turned up when you’re just feeling cold is because getting too hot is bad. Too much heat breaks things down that shouldn’t be broken down. That’s why there are other mechanisms for your body to warm itself up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Getting your temperature up in a warm environment over hours is easy: a low net heat output increases temperature over time to pretty high.  Keeping it up in freezing temperatures is hard because the body loses the heat so fast.</p>
<p>Your body is actually very good at keeping you warm enough under a very wide range of temperatures.  As with everything with humans, if you want it to be better at it, you can &quot;practice&quot; by progressively doing things that make you chilly.  If you are active, you can last pretty much indefinitely in a t shirt and shorts in above freezing temperatures.  Just go in/warm up when you start to shiver: that means your body isn't keeping up with your core temperature.  Eventually, you wont ever start to shiver.  Source: I went year round in T shirt and shorts in freezing/close to freezing temperatures while being outside for hours at a time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
