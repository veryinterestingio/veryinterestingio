		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it does. However, the effect of the Sun on the tides is quite a bit weaker than that of the Moon. At first glance, this seems contradictory because the gravitational pull of the Sun is stronger than the one of the Moon.</p>
<p>But the tidal force isn't proportional to the gravitational force itself, but rather to the difference in gravitational force between the points  on Earth closest to and furthest from the other body. If you work out the numbers you'll find that because the Moon is so close to the Earth (compared to the Sun), this difference is larger for the Moon than it is for the Sun.</p>
<p>The tidal force of the Sun affects the regular cycle of the tides and depending on where the Sun and Moon are with respect to the Earth, tides may be stronger or weaker. When the Sun and Moon line up and their tidal forces work in conjunction, we speak of a &quot;spring tide&quot;.</p>
<p>edit: See <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/f1m5tm/if_the_moon_causes_high_and_low_tide_due_its/fh8slkw/" target="_blank">this comment</a> for the derivation of an approximation of the tidal force that demonstrates the tidal force scaling with the inverse of the cube of the distance, unlike the inverse square scaling of the gravitational force itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
