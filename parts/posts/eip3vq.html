<p>One theory is that if you don't eat, the blood sugar goes down, starving bacteria.  </p>
<p>The theory behind intermittent fasting is that the body's cleanup system is triggered by fasting.  That would be particularly useful to clean up the detritus of the immune system attack.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When people get sick the immune system instructs cells in the nose to generate more mucus in order to clear the cell lining of other potentially harmful bacteria or viruses.  When this happens it restricts the nose's ability to detect flavors blocking the sense of smell.  Whenever you consume foods that your body does not recognize, hunger is decreased the next day, this is true whether you are sick or not.   There is a benefit to losing your appetite when you are sick.  It takes a lot of energy to digest food and by slowing down digestion it saves energy in the short term allowing the body to dedicate more energy and resources to fighting off the infection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Immune response is driven by BAT activation/increased thermogenesis with 2 main and relevant consequences: BAT controls INS secretion - increased BAT thermogenesis leads to INS inhibition and hyperglycemia, which in its turn is the natural milleau of turning on the reg T cells into NKT cells. Second, blocked INS secretion could provide an answer why your appetite is supressed in confirmation of the Insulin Theory. I believe this to be a conserved evolutionary cross-species mechanism of mitigating BAT thermogenesis increase during a viral infection. </p>
<p>Also loss of appetite/fasting/CR lowers inflammatory processes in the body and core body temperature while increased autophagy clears out the misfolded defective proteins in <strong>healthy subjects</strong> (which by itself does not address the initial question asked but indirectly relates to the effect of fasting/CR on BAT thermogenesis in the healthy state).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
