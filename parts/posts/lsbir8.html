		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because young healthy people have stronger immune systems. The “vaccine reactions” are not directly due to the vaccine (this is true of all vaccines) but symptoms caused by the immune system “turning on” in response to the vaccine and develop that future protection. For the same reason, a young healthy person with a strong immune system will generally be able fight off the virus faster/stronger so won’t get as sick.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It all comes to a concept called immune senescence. As we get older our bodies start to get weaker, and our immune system less capable of producing a effective response to a foreign agent.  The key difference between a vaccine and the virus is that the former is designed to cause a immune response, and the latter to infect an individual. So when a young person gets a shot, it will have a immune response (that doesn't mean that he will develop symptoms mind you), but the virus may not be strong enough to cause illness in such individual.  An older individual may not be able to have a response either to the shot or the virus, each will have it's own consequences. If he can't elaborate a immune response against the agent in the vaccine it will not develop immunity for it and if can't defend itself against the virus it may develop the illness. It's also why we don't vaccine immune compromised individuals, as they will not develop an immunity in most cases.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT: Fever and other phlogistic symptoms are consequence of the immune response, that itself can be caused by a virus, vaccine or a myriad of things. Usually you will not develop a fever if you don't have the apparatus for it.</p>
<p>PS.: It's a COMPLEX subject and my comment is just a really simple overview, made worse for the fact that my english is not that sharp.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The side effects <em>are</em> the immune response.  The more robust the response, then</p>
<p>a) the fewer disease symptoms;</p>
<p>b) the less intense the illness; <em>and</em></p>
<p>c) the more the immune-response side effects (different from (a))</p>
<p>Just to give another example:  a biomedical researcher once told me that we really don't have a lot of experience of what rhinovirus actually does, because 100% of what we normally think of as the symptoms of &quot;the common cold&quot; are actually the huge immune response we have whenever we get hit by the virus.</p>
<p>The researcher surmised that the typical human immunoresponse to rhinovirus is so immediate and so crushingly overwhelming, that the virus itself must be absolutely deadly.  No one (or very very few) whose immune systems don't respond that way is alive today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stronger immune systems.  Because a younger person's immune system is more active, their body's response to the vaccine is stronger but so is the reaction when they get actually sick.  It doesn't allow a bacteria or virus to take hold as well as it can in older people with weaker immune systems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
