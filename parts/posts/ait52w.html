		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no sensory receptor for &quot;wetness&quot; in humans. It's not 100% clear how our brains form the association, but feeling wet is a combination of signals from thermal and tactile receptors, so in the right conditions a cold surface can feel wet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is not what you asked, but u/sxbennett already answered your question, and this might interest you if you’re intrigued by touch sensations. It is one of my favorite neuro fun facts. </p>
<p>Menthol activates TRPM8, the receptor that activates to certain cold temperatures (you have a variety of thermoreceptors w different ranges.) That is why mint and minty-flavored things make your mouth feel cold, and why soaps, chapsticks, lotions, etc... with menthol leave your skin tingly cool: the menthol in them is activating your cold receptors. Likewise, spicy things activate TRPV1, a thermoreceptor for burning heat, b/c capsaisin activates that receptor in addition to high temperatures. </p>
<p>Maybe you already knew this, but I was too excited not to share, in case you found it interesting :-D. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water conducts heat away from your body faster than air, so if you are wet your body detects losing heat via the water. So when you are wet, you generally <em>do</em> feel cold at the same time. And since water is probably the most ready source of being cold for us (we go out in winter in coats, while we dive into water wearing generally as little as possible), it’s easy to equate the two.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
