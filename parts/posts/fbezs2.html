		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While driving you're constantly analyzing, making decisions, and doing micro-corrections. Scanning the road for potential hazards and other drivers, looking for curves that require you to adjust speed or potholes and debris that you need to avoid, making a million tiny corrections on the steering wheel to stay in your lane, etc.</p>
<p>If you have been driving for a couple years (or even months) then your body does a lot of this subconsciously. So while it seems like you're not doing much, your body is constantly working to avoid danger</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Driving a car is one of the most mechanicaly involved things an average human does in the course of a day. I don't mean mechanical as in the machine that is the car, I mean the different mechanics your brain is going through to pilot a car safely. You are constantly visually and sonically alert for other drivers, signs, lights, potholes, what have you. Then you have your arms controlling direction, feet controlling speed (even moreso if it's a manual transmission). Add in turn signals, car radio, climate controls and all the other comforts of a car and it adds up to a lot of things constantly and simultaneously happening.</p>
<p>Also, you are stuck in a pretty static position while driving so muscles get sore and stiff.</p>
<p>Its kinda mindblowing how easy it is for a person to get a driver's license when you break down the act of driving a car on public roads into every little action and look at the web of how its all connected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>4.5 hours of driving is a solid 4.5 hours of driving. You can’t rest your eyes. You can’t let your attention drift too much. </p>
<p>4.5 hours of coding does not require 4.5 hours of completely unbroken attention. Even if you’re not taking breaks, you can still take a few seconds to mentally reset, look at something else, etc., if you ever feel like you need to, which you cannot do while driving.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well when you‘re driving, you have to literally try not to die or cause any accidents. Whereas in coding you literally just sit and write some code without any real life danger. You‘re basically remembering every rule and law you learned to try and navigate the roads. In coding you can clear your mistakes and start over.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
