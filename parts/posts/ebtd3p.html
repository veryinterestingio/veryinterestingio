<p>So after running on a treadmill and basically jump off the treadmill, even though you are standing still, you have this sensation that you are still going forward (It's making me dizzy sometimes lol). From what I've observed, this does not happen when running &quot;normally&quot;(you know, in a park, like a normal human being).</p>
<p>Why does this happen?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its the sensory input in your brain by primarily the vestibular system (inner ear) and partly proprioception (muscles and joints). Your mind adapts to the moving treadmill belt so you can run but when you get off and the ground is stationary you feel that youâ€™re moving for a bit longer until your senses balance out</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe this is just related to momentum and relative velocity?<br />
When you're running normally, the ground below you is static and doesnt move as opposed to the treadmill's belt which is moving backwards.<br />
When you're on the treadmill, you move at a certain velocity relative to the belt moving backwards. So when you step off from the treadmill you're moving from a level that is moving backwards to a level that is static. Your mind at this point is conditioned to think that you're still moving at the same relative velocity as what you had when you were on the treadmill but the ground below you isnt moving backwards anymore and so you &quot;feel&quot; like you are going forward.<br />
Pretty sure this is a terrible explanation but feel free to fix it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
