		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Offset yes, but not totally. The first thing you have to understand is that one unit of fuel used in a car engine does not generate the same power as one unit of fuel used in a power plant. A power plant generating electricity plus distribution losses is still way more efficient at producing power than a small car engine. The economies of large scale energy production lends itself to efficiencies that just cannot be reproduced reasonably in small car engines. </p>
<p>It is this difference that matters. And that difference continues to increase as more renewable energy sources are implemented in the power grid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This isn't true in all states. In Washington, for example, &quot;<a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=WA" target="_blank">more than three-fourths of the state's net generation originates from renewable energy, mostly hydroelectric power.</a>&quot;</p>
<p>This will become true in more and more states as the cost of creating electricity from renewable sources gets cheaper and cheaperâ€”the cost of solar and wind power <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2020/01/21/renewable-energy-prices-hit-record-lows-how-can-utilities-benefit-from-unstoppable-solar-and-wind/?sh=50156af02c84" target="_blank">hit record lows in 2019, which is why 76% of all new electricity generation in 2020</a> came from solar and wind projects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1) The electricity grid is sized for peak use.  You can charge the electric vehicles without needing more power plants, just by running the existing plants more.</p>
<p>2) Electricity needs to be used the moment it is generated. Wind farms get turned off if it is windy, but no one is using electricity.</p>
<p>If you attach a lot of electric vehicles to the grid, with their big batteries, you can keep generating electricity from wind all the time, because there is somewhere to put it.</p>
<p>3) It is more efficient to burn fossil fuels in a central, highly-efficient plant than it is to transport it to every place there is a car, then carry it about with you as you drive, then burn it in your car's less efficient engine.</p>
<p>On a short trip, when the engine is cold, that inefficiency is even worse.</p>
<p>4) Typically, central fossil-fuel generating plants use less-carbon intensive fossil fuels, burning 4 hydrogen per carbon.  Cars burn 2.25 Hydrogen or 2.125 Hydrogen for every carbon - so the car is even worse in terms of greenhouse gas use.</p>
<p>5) After a fossil fuel car is built, it gradually gets less efficient as the engine wears out and gets gets clogged up with dirt &amp; soot.  This also makes it less efficient in terms of greenhouse gasses.</p>
<p>After an electric car is built, it gradually becomes more greenhouse gas efficient over time, as more and more renewable energy is added to the grid.</p>
<p>(It is about 2 to 3 times cheaper, MWh for MWh, to add offshore wind to the grid than to add nuclear. Solar is even cheaper than offshore wind. On-shore wind is even cheaper than solar. And the price of renewables is continuing to drop, so renewables will likely continue to take the largest share of new &amp; replacement capacity, as time goes by)</p>
<p>6) Electricity gets used by fossil-fuel extraction, transport, &amp; refinement &amp; transport.</p>
<p>Electric cars are often use energy more efficiently than the equivalent fossil-fuel car. Some electric cars can travel as far  as a fossil-fuelled car with a full tank, on just the electricity that was used to get the refined fuel into the tank.
(Comparing an efficient EV to a typical US pick-up truck)</p>
<p>So you could even just about swap the fleet to electric cars without necessarily increasing the electricity you need to generate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The US grid is 40% green, and is typically greener off-peak. That will improve as the grid improves, or you can install solar at home. Vehicle To Grid would also allow us to reduce our need for dirty peak power plants.</p>
<p>Gasoline is 0% green, and it should be noted CO2 isn't the only emission to worry about.</p>
<p>Edit: &quot;Green&quot; if you count nuclear, which I do as a transitional technology, same as cobalt in batteries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A massive powerplant engine making power that then loses some energy being sent to charge a battery is still much more efficient then a small engine that can fit in a car.</p>
<p>(Powerplant &quot;engine&quot; might be the wrong word but you get my point.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
