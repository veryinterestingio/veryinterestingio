		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The latter - panels that small would generate so little power that you might only get a 1 or 2% charge over the course of a sunny day (and zilch on a cloudy one). </p>
<p>It just isn't worth it for such a minor improvement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was on a R &amp; D design team for Fisker 10 years ago. We researched all sorts of ideas on how to generate power from solar power collecting paint, regenerative breaking, turning heat into electricity....(I actually wrote a book on it!)....it actually takes a lot to make and store power. So the best thing we found was how to be more efficient (aerodynamics, better tires, better bearings, smarter motors, new battery technology....)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Solar power just isn't efficient enough (yet?) to justify the cost.  Add to it the cost of replacement/repair, and adding hundreds of dollars to the cost in order to maybe someday getting a return on that investment doesn't make sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
