		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's important to qualify what we mean by &quot;memory loss.&quot; Colloquially, when we casually refer to &quot;memory loss,&quot; what we're usually talking about is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_amnesia" target="_blank">retrograde amnesia</a>, which is roughly &quot;something making you forget things you used to remember.&quot; This is usually associated with something significant happening to the brain itself, either in the form of direct physical trauma or in the form of a chemical (crossing the blood-brain barrier) destroying or otherwise disrupting neurons.</p>
<p>COVID-19 has been observed to cause what's classified as &quot;brain damage&quot; at a high order in many patients, but retrograde amnesia is <em>not</em> a commonly observed effect. In that sense, colloquial &quot;memory loss&quot; isn't associated with COVID-19 to a significant degree. But what <em>is</em> associated is difficulty in forming new memories--not full-blown <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterograde_amnesia" target="_blank">anterograde amnesia</a> (counterpart to retrograde), but more of a so-called &quot;brain fog&quot; that can make it very difficult to learn. Reductions in working memory, higher latency in recalling patterns, and lower recall after exercises are all potential &quot;things&quot; to worry about. A large number of COVID-19 patients may suffer from some degree of long-term neurological damage to that effect, perhaps even permanently.</p>

<p>Fortunately, it's not common for the deleterious effects to be so profound as to functionally incapacitate someone forever, but it's very plausible that some people are going to be strongly affected in their cognition by post-COVID-19 effects for a long time to come.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Memory problems and other neurological symptoms do seem to be fairly common after recovering from COVID-19.  For example, New York Times, Oct. 11:  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/11/health/covid-survivors.html" target="_blank">‘I Feel Like I Have Dementia’: Brain Fog Plagues Covid Survivors. The condition is affecting thousands of patients, impeding their ability to work and function in daily life.</a>. </p>
<p>Also:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most frequently reported persistent symptoms were fatigue (55%), dyspnoea (42%), loss of memory (34%), concentration and sleep disorders (28% and 30.8%,  respectively). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>—<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7445491/" target="_blank">Post-discharge persistent symptoms and health-related quality of life after hospitalization for COVID-19</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Patients having COVID-19 infection could have cognitive impairment shortly after hospital discharge. Presence of neurological symptoms during the infection such as headache, anosmia and dysgeusia were the main risk factors for cognitive impairment related with attention, memory and executive function. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of this is probably complications from Hypoxia. Covid patients exposed to high viral loads, with low Vitamin D or who have certain conditons may develop pneumonia, which causes fluid to build up in your lungs.</p>
<p>This can cause lower oxygen saturation as you can't breathe as well with fluid in your lungs, so it is kind of like drowning. People who drown but don't die and are pulled out of water often have brain damage similar to what these people are experiencing, and for the same reason. Lack of oxygen to the brain due to fluid obstruction of the lungs causes cell death which impedes IQ and can cause memory loss.</p>
<p>There are other factors too like blood clots and strokes which can also happen but this is rarer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
