Blood is primarily kept in bigger pipes (like what runs in your walls). The &quot;pipes&quot; in the skin are so small that there won't be much &quot;leakage&quot; when they cut into your skin, but as others have said, surgeons know where the big pipes are and how to avoid them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ob/Gyn here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Entry. When we enter the abdomen or pelvis, we are careful to avoid any major blood vessels that would cause the patient to bleed out if damaged.</li>
<li>Damage control. Minor blood vessels can be easily cauterized with monopolar electrocautery. Larger bleeding vessels often need to be tied off with suture, or clamped and sealed with bipolar electrocautery. We can also use chemical hemostatic agents made from gelatin, cellulose, starch, etc. When we are done we close up layer-by-layer and make sure nothing is still bleeding.</li>
<li>Pressure. The body has its own methods of controlling bleeding. Sometimes all you need to do is hold pressure and allow the blood to clot by itself.</li>
<li>Manual evacuation. Sometimes its not enough and you just need to get the blood out of the way to focus on the source of the bleeding. We use suction and sponges.</li>
<li>Last resorts. If someone is bleeding too much and is beyond repair, we can remove the organ itself or large parts of it. Cesarean hysterectomies and splenectomies are good example of this.</li>
<li>Resuscitation. Sometimes blood is literally spilling out. This is is why you plan (if possible) major surgeries in a place where the patient can be resuscitated with major amounts of blood products.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope this helps! Interesting fact: Pregnant women routinely lose up to 1/5 of their pregnancy blood volume after a C-section, and about 1/10th after a vaginal delivery. Thankfully pregnant women have about that much extra blood (4-5L vs about 3-4L depending on size of person), which has been made hyper-coagulable, accumulated during the pregnancy.</p>
<p>Another interesting fact is the legendary Iranian hero Rostam from the Shahnameh (Book of Kings) was born via Caesarean section, which is (historically) called a Rostamineh, not a cesarean section because why would Iranians care about Rome or Caesar lol. According to the poem/legend, Rostam's dad Zal got instructions from the simorgh (iranian phoenix) on how to do it on his pregnant wife Rudaba, and was able to save both the baby and mom on his first try! What a great teacher that bird was! Which I had him for residency</p>
<p>Here are some hilariously gruesome pictures of the surgery, from across the medieval Persianate world:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of cauterization. Surgeons have a tool which cooks the ends of any small bleeders they encounter to prevent further blood loss. This is not exactly great for the patient, obviously, but it's a kind of injury the body can easily work around. Small vessels like that can be replaced by the body to maintain blood flow after the surgery.</p>
<p>For larger vessels on which cautery wouldn't work, there is ligature. This is basically where you tie the vessel closed with something. The Romans discovered this thousands of years ago, and the knowledge passed to the <del>Arab</del>Muslim/Greek/Persian/etc empires from there, which is why their medicine was so good.</p>
<p>For even larger vessels, the answer is surgeons don't cut those. And if they do, that's what malpractice insurance is for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don’t just cut wildly. They go with scissors and dissect out layer by layer. When the have to cut blood vessels, they clamp both sides cut between and tie the ends. </p>
<p>Scalpels are mostly just getting through skin, those little bleeders get seared shut. </p>
<p>If they have to cut out a vascular bed, like the liver - when the whole organ is a kind of bloody spongy mass, there are specialized charring tools and clamp/staple combo devices. As well as sheets of material that aids clotting and prevents sticky scarring - which is left in. It’s a whole area of surgical research.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
