		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a very complex issue with no clear answer. The half-life effect is still the case but this just says that memory cell pool against any specific pathogen will slowly (it varies) decrease over time but it doesn't say how. Some times this decrease still means protection over decades which practically means lifetime, some times it is a few years with varying levels of protection.</p>
<p>Though there is a lot of research for that, there is no definite answer of even why some pathogens (or vaccines) tend to induce a more long lived or effective memory pool than others. </p>
<p>Tissue residency, combinations of surface markers, cytokines, expression (or non expression) of specific transcription factors all play a role in how the half life of  memory T and B cells works over time. And although you can find research that may suggest one mechanism or another or build upon a previously suggested mechanism, there is no definite universal answer AFAIK.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would second /u/kd-_ 's answer and add: There definitely isn't a super clear answer yet at the detail you might want - part of the difficulty is that the answer is &quot;lots of things.&quot;</p>
<p>Amount of virus/bacteria at the time of infection, length of time of infection, general immune state of the individual, other cell types present at the infection, age, maybe sex, if there is a second infection (whether the host knows it or not - this is why we get boosters, the second infection makes memory cells last longer), TCR binding affinity... it's a ton of different things.The answer definitely lies in part in transcription factors - especially FoxO1 for long term memory (&quot;central memory&quot; T Cells) - but what specifically causes some T Cells to ramp up FoxO1 expression vs. other transcription factors that would make them cytotoxic and short lived (e.g. Blimp1, Tbet, Eomes) aren't clear in every case. <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02826/full" target="_blank">This</a> is a pretty good review on the topic if you want specific cytokine signaling pathways in the body that effect specific transcription factors and protein expression in T cells.<br />
-----<br />
At a more conceptual level: the half-life answer is correct. Even memory T cells undergo apoptosis over time, and there is a stochastic decay of memory pools (stochastic might just be a fancy word for &quot;we don't know exactly when/why&quot;). You can lengthen the half life in mice by injecting certain cytokines - but these carry unacceptable side effects in humans, it's really artificial and not relevant to actual medicine.What is relevant to human medicine is that reinfection with the same virus causes an increase in the size of the memory pool and extends the half life - this is why we give booster shots. </p>
<p>Conceptually, the immune system builds up a memory pool after the first infection (or vaccination), but seeing that infection a second time (or receiving a booster) tells the immune system that <em>this is going to be a recurring problem, better create a lot of memory cells and keep them around for a long time.</em>That's why the mRNA vaccines require boosters shortly after the first shot - it bolsters both the size of the memory population and will make it last longer. Doing this multiple times in succession stops helping more, and doing it too many times is actively harmful (T Cell Exhaustion). If you wait years between boosters, you can probably avoid exhaustion, while still expanding the memory pool.</p>
<p>A lot of the people saying we'll need boosters for COVID [<em>at X time</em>] are 1) pharmaceutical companies or 2) not looking at (or spoke before) the recent data for mRNA vaccine protection against variants. We don't know how long COVID protection will last from these vaccines - mice only live 2 years, and it's not that every process happens at 40x speed of a human, so if an mRNA vaccine gives a mouse 2 years of protection that isn't a guarantee of 80 years in humans. This will need to be determined empirically, we don't have a set rule for how long immunity lasts for mRNA vaccines in general, let alone specifically for these vaccines (as there will definitely be some variability between mRNA vaccines - different peptides generate different strengths of immune response, which is a very active area of research currently).</p>
<p>So we may need boosters in a few years. Option 3) is scientists being cautious, and preparing us for a real possibility. Perhaps COVID immunity from mRNA vaccination only lasts for a couple of years. Perhaps some variants will evolve to evade mRNA vaccine immunity - there's certainly going to be a very strong selective pressure for SARS-CoV-2 to mutate to avoid mRNA vaccine immunity, as billions of people will have that immunity and be hanging out maskless indoors very soon. Perhaps &quot;need&quot; is too strong of a word and people will want them (I will take one in a year or two if they offer an mRNA cocktail containing a few variant Spike sequences). And I don't have the data to back it up, but people who got Adenovirus-based vaccines are going to want a booster in a year or two if they want to maintain their immunity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So this is a different angle than you were asking, but: <a href="https://www.cell.com/immunity/comments/S1074-7613(00\)80622-6" target="_blank">Epstein-Barr virus apparently persists by making B-cells it has infected persist.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We propose that EBV indiscriminately infects B cells in mucosal lymphoid tissue and that these cells differentiate to become resting memory B cells that then enter the circulation. Activation to the blastoid stage of latency is an essential intermediate step in this process. Thus, EBV may persist by exploiting the mechanisms that produce and maintain long-term B cell memory.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are different types of memory cells, each with varying homing properties and degrees of 'stemness'.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that when an adaptive immune response occurs, what's happening is that the relevant naive or pre-existing memory compartments aren't just being activated, but actually <em>differentiating</em> into an effector phenotype aimed at clearing out infected or aberrant cells, and that these have a pretty short lifespan (a few weeks). Meanwhile, however, a subset of these activated cells differentiate into or remain in a self-renewing memory state and localize to 'home base' (typically the lymph nodes or spleen - making them hard to detect in the blood). These are generally referred to as central memory cells but, in recent years, another memory subset of T cells has been characterized (called Tscm or stem-like memory T cells). These cells are rare but are extremely long lived and proliferate quite explosively when simulated with their antigen. </p>
<p>The overall point here is that memory cells bear a lot of similarity to how stem cells work and are generally a small population of self-renewing cells that are retained long after the proliferative burst that happens during the course of a memory or &quot;recall&quot; response. Individual memory cells have a limited lifespan but they are able to self-renew so that the repertoire at-large remains poised to react to threats it has seen before.</p>
<p>What dictates whether or not people need booster vaccines for some pathogens and don't need them for others is, as others have said here, is largely unpredictable at this time. I'd speculate that the main differences lie in the conditions of an infection or vaccination and how efficient they are in inducing activated T or B cells to differentiate into memory phenotypes. This could include factors like the cytokine context (which would be influenced by the adjuvant cocktail in the vaccine or by how the innate immune system is reacting to the pathogen) or the potency of the individual antigens responsible for driving responses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
