		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Itâ€™s a change in barometric pressure. Many fluids in your body (and particularly the synovial fluid in your joints) contain dissolved gases which stay dissolved in your fluids due to a constant air pressure around you. When that air pressure changes, usually the weather does as well, as does the pressure balance in your body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Old injuries and irritated joints often have some amount of inflammation on a constant basis. The air pressure kinda squeezes them constantly, so your body gets used to &quot;this amount of inflammation/pressure is fine.&quot; When a storm front moves in, the air pressure drops like a rock, without the &quot;usual&quot; amount of compression, the inflammation gets way worse than usual and that makes it hurt a lot.</p>
<p>Bonus fun fact: cats are pretty good at predicting rain for the same reason! If a cat is washing over the back of his ears a lot, there's probably a pressure front coming in; the cat is trying to get his ears to pop!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The claim that weather and barometric changes cause joint pain is a longstanding and widespread myth. There isn't any conclusive evidence to back it. <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/359/bmj.j5326" target="_blank">In fact, there are large-scale studies that don't show a correlation between weather and pain</a>.</p>
<p>My personal belief is that it's primarily due to the mood and mental related aspects of poor weather. It's a downer when things get really dark, wet, and cold. This changes the way peoples brain modulate pain signals, and leads to them experiencing more pain.</p>
<p>Source: I'm a physical therapist. Patients ALWAYS complain when it goes from being nice out to being stormy, but they rarely complain about increased pain when it goes from stormy to being nice out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
