Does it really matter what grade of gas you use?  Can I use the lowest grade one week and the next week get premium if I can afford it?  Does it help with milage or does it keep your engine clean?  What is the difference?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question. When would you ever use mid grade? Most cars use regular, some higher performance engines use premium. Is mid grade just a money maker for the oil companies from the people who think higher octane gas cleaned their engine or gets their non high performance engine better mpg?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Use the gasoline recommended by the manufacturer. If you do not have a special high-performance car you would use the lowest grade.</p>
<p>There is no advantage to use a higher grade. You need to design the engine to have higher compression for it to be useful and then lower grad will work badly in the engine.   The octane rating of the fuel is about how much you can compress it before is spontaneously detonate. So use the lowest grade the manufacturer recommend because it leaves more money in your pocket.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The quality of fuel has nothing to do with the energy contained in the fuel (it's all essentially the same), but on your engine's ability to extract that energy without unwanted and possibly destructive side effects. Higher-performance engines need fuel that can put up with higher compression ratios.</p>
<p>In terms of what you should use; use whatever fuel your manufacturer recommends. If the car is getting older and knocking more often, consider moving up to the next highest grade of fuel. In addition, if you throw an aftermarket turbocharger on, you'll probably also have to move up a grade or two.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
