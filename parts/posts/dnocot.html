		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well it is a fairly multi factorial process The Ascending Reticular activating system is the part of the brain responsible for awakeness and alertness. Lesions of this system are often associated with a form of so called brain fog or difficulty to rouse. There is also the action of melatonin which is basially the sleep hormone. That in turn depends on your sleep cycles and exposure to sunlight. So increases melatonin production reason due to whatever reason can be implicated in brain fog.</p>
<p>There's also vitamin/ nutritional deficiencies that could manifest as psychomotor impairement which is the closest medical term for brain fog I guess.</p>
<p>Other than that infections and drugs can also cause it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had brain fog for about a year a few years  ago. It would come and go, and eventually I figured out that it only seemed to happen during the week. I figured that something at work was causing the problem. Tried changing the lighting in my office, getting an ergonomic assessment done, walking more during the day. Nothing seemed to help. Finally, it donned on me that I drink a lot more soda at work than I do at home. So I cut that out and the brain fog completely disappeared. Through process of elimination I eventually narrowed it down to Diet Coke. The aspartame was seemingly causing it. I was finally free, but for years after even a small amount of aspartame in something would trigger it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
