		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you sleep, a lot of systems shift gears. Brainwaves shift, metabolism, hormones, all the way down to the cellular level there is a shift in activity. </p>
<p>You ask why we don’t get the same benefit from being still in the dark but awake…</p>
<p>Why does your car continue to wear and age if left running but parked in the driveway and not moving versus a car shut off in the same driveway?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly, then a Ted Talk explained it that when you are awake, then nutrients go into the brain cells, making them expand. This process takes place the whole time you are awake, but when you sleep, then the &quot;flow&quot; reverses and that allows the waste from cell activity to get removed, thus the cells themselves &quot;rest&quot;.</p>
<p>It also explained that because of this process, actually going for an all-nighter would have a similar effect to a concussion.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Put simply its because your brain is focusing on being ready for your commands. When your actually asleep it can take those resources and spend them on other things like recovery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As the mind relaxes, the type of brainwaves that release change. When you are relaxed, the brain releases alpha waves. When you just fall asleep the brain releases theta waves. During deep sleep, the brain releases delta waves. In order for sleep to be regenerative (meaning chemicals are rebalanced), one need to have sufficient REM sleep (5, 90 minute cycles typically).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
