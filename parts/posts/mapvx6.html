		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Right in my wheelhouse! My PhD is on physics at RHIC, which is the ion part of what will become the electron ion collider. The answer to both of your questions is generally speaking &quot;yes.&quot;</p>
<p>As its name suggests the EIC will collide a beam of electrons with a beam of ions such as protons, Deuterium, Helium-3, Aluminum, and Gold. RHIC is currently able to collide these various ions with one another but not with electrons.</p>
<p>The physics goals of RHIC and the LHC are broadly speaking quite different. RHIC is primarily a &quot;nuclear or heavy ion physics&quot; or &quot;spin physics&quot; machine whereas the LHC is primarily a &quot;particle physics&quot; machine. There is a massive caveat here in that the lines between those different fields are often very blurry and all of the LHC experiments (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb) have groups that study heavy ion physics (ALICE primarily so) as well.</p>
<p>The two main prongs of the physics done at RHIC are the study of the quark gluon plasma and the proton spin puzzle. The quark gluon plasma is an exotic state of matter that can be produced in high energy collisions of large nuclei like gold. The constituent quarks and gluons of the nuclei are deconfined within the plasma which, like I said, is very exotic as free color charges do not exist under &quot;normal&quot; circumstances. Unlike the LHC RHIC collides beams of spin <em>polarized</em> protons which allows for the study of the proton's spin and how it arises from the properties of its constituent quarks and gluons; they always add up to a spin of 1/2 in a yet to be understood way giving rise to the name &quot;Proton Spin Puzzle.&quot; Broadly speaking we can say that RHIC is a machine for studying the strong force which is described by the theory of quantum chromodynamics.</p>
<p>Since the simplest system RHIC (or the LHC) can collide is two beams of protons, and protons being composite particles, there is always some uncertainty about what is actually colliding. The electron beam of the EIC, the electron being an elementary particle, will always provide a well known initial state. This can help disentangle which effects in heavy ion collisions arise due to the presence of nuclear matter, allow for tomography of the proton, provide more constrained spin measurements, etc. etc.</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks to u/DEAD_GUY34 for pointing out that the EIC will be able to better measure parton distribution functions (PDF) which describe how the proton's momentum is distributed amongst its constituents. As they mention this will help reduce uncertainties in high energy measurements at the LHC and future hadron colliders. I was sure I had mentioned them, but here we are!</p>
<p>Please ask more questions if you have them :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
