		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Spanish took a more &quot;integrate as opposed to eradicate&quot; approach toward the natives in Mexico than the French and English did toward those in North America. That's not to suggest natives in Mexico weren't brutalized and subjugated (Aztecs say hello), but intermarrying and exchanging culture was seen as acceptable and sometimes even encouraged, while the same thing was much more of a taboo among the French and English in North America. Mexican culture is essentially the melding of Spanish and Native Central American heritage. To this day there are stereotypes in Mexico around the upper class and government being descended from the Spanish and whiter, and the lower class having more native heritage and darker skin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Lots of Europeans and few Natives north of Mexico. Few Europeans, lots of Natives south.</p>
<p>I'm just going to quickly acknowledge that Latin America, as colonized by Spain, is more than just Mexico, and that Portugal colonized Brazil.</p>
<p>There are going to be a lot of reasons, but a lot of it comes down to how many natives were in an area, and how many non natives, and how that butterfly effects out. <strong>In North America there were probably 2-7 million natives total, US and Canada</strong>. There was a huge influx of Europeans to the United States during the 1800s. Population of the US more than quadrupled from 5.2 million to 23 million from 1800 to 1850. There were also 350,000 black slaves brought to America, up to 1800, and were encouraged to have lots of children before and especially after Cross-Atlantic trade  was outlawed.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there were huge kingdoms of natives in Central and South America, probably around <strong>37 million in Mexico (including the Aztec, Mayan, Inca, etc)</strong>, and there were probably around 1.86 million Spaniards that immigrated to Latin America up until 1824, and maybe a few million more after.</p>
<p>Considering that the native populations were drastically reduced similarly in both continents (citation needed, I know that different nations and empires were not killed at equal rates, but that they were all drastically reduced) it would be like if blue aliens invaded New York City and Anchorage, Alaska, killed 90% of both, and then sent 50 or 100x more blue aliens to live in Alaska. In one city the population is roughly equal, there might even be more humans. In the other there are dozens and eventually hundreds then thousands of aliens for every human. There is some interbreeding in both cities, and after a few hundred years Alaska would be a lot more blue than New York City.</p>
<p>This would lead to a different power dynamic for the two cities during occupation. In New York the aliens would have to devote a lot of resources to ensuring they remained in control and they would be more conquerors or slavers, while the aliens in Anchorage could probably just find an abandoned house or plot of land and start a human-free life as colonizers. As these cycles go on for hundreds of years even more aliens are going to prefer Anchorage rather than New York City. It's far easier to start a village than to conquer and suppress a city.</p>
<p>With different power balances, social norms would also be affected, as the closer to equal populations of New York City would lead to humans in New York having more power than the humans in Anchorage. New York might even be able to declare independence from the Aliens after a few hundred years and form their own identity. Meanwhile in Alaska, the blue aliens would retain a sense of identity with their blue homeland, and the humans with theirs because the aliens of Anchorage would have enough of a power discrepancy that they could corral all of the humans together in some corner of the city.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
