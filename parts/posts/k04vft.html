		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good answers here already. But the big reason why THEY can take on a bunch of water while the one in your car can't is that turbines don't have a &quot;closed&quot; compression, which means hydrolock can't happen. It's a continuous flow of air rather than taking isolated gulps like a piston engine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since this is ELi5, I'll try to keep it basic. The most common type of turbine you'll see is a bypass type turbo fan engine. These engines have what is called the core engine which is the compressor in the front and the turbine in the back and is surrounded by the bypass ducts. For the sake of this explanation, I'll just say that the purpose of the core engine is solely to accomplish the suck-squeeze-bang-blow cycle and doesn't create any usable thrust in that process. The core engine drives the turbine fan in the front which is responsible for producing a majority of the thrust simply by accelerating a large volume of air as it goes through the fan and is blown out of the tail pipe without being involved in the combustion process, so all that needs to happen is to keep the water out of the core engine. Consider that at cruise power, that fan is turning at about ~5,000 RPM depending on the engine. When water initially hits the fan, the centrifugal force slings the majority of the water outwards to the ends of the fan blades, the water is blown through the bypassing air, and out the back of the engine never having gone through the core engine. Some water does make it into the compressor and goes through to the turbine section but it's not enough to interfere with the combustion process and cause a flame out.</p>
<p>TLDR; When an a jet engine goes through heavy rain, the water doesn't make it into the part of the engine that keeps it running.</p>
<p>Edit: Corrected fan RPM.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are not waterproof. They are designed to funnel the rain through the fan blades, compressor blades, into the combustion chamber (where it is turned into steam), through the turbines, and out the back. (most of it goes through the front fan blades and bypasses the rest of the engine and get blown out the back.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
