		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your bladder is made of a very stretchy type of tissue called transitional epithelium. It can change size rapidly to hold and release different amounts of urine. The bladder has stretch receptors in it, and when they detect the bladder getting full they send signals to your brain that it is time to pee. However, there are many signals that can interrupt and interact with this stretch signal that your bladder sends to the brain. For example, when you are nervous you can experience an urge to urinate that has nothing to do with your bladderâ€™s size. When you are feeling threatened, you can not realize you have to pee until your bladder is far fuller than it would normally be when you felt the urge to urinate. The nervous system is complicated, and while some of your urge to urinate is governed by physical stimuli, some of it is governed by your emotions and other sensations your body is experiencing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your bladder has nerves that tell the brain when they are stretched and thats what you feel when you need to pee.</p>
<p>Caffeine and alcohol both have chemicals in them that can irritate your bladder and your brain interrupts that as you having a full bladder even though it still has lots more room</p>
<p>Its also a big reason for &quot;breaking the seal&quot; when going out drinking. Your first wee will have less alcohol as a percentage so the irriation is almost entirely from it being full.  The rest will then have a very high concentration of alcohol which is why you pee so much when drunk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It can be explained by something called cystometrogram. Your bladder acts as a distensible balloon.</p>
<p>It gets filled up the same way, you'd blow air into a balloon. At 150 ml(appx) you get this urge to urinate, but when your bladder capacity reaches 400 ml, it inevitable evacuates, to prevent damage (viz excess air can burst a balloon)</p>
<p>Also it is modifiable by a myriad of factors not limited to stress, sexual activity, age etc. Besides the nerve control also plays an important part, both the Autonomic Nervous System(parasympathetic/sympahetic) and the Somatic nervous system.</p>
<p>They have differential innervation at the sphincters( the valves that control the bladder outflow), and hence imparts some degree of control to us</p>
<p>Ex- You feel the urge to urinate, but are in a movie, you can hold it in, till it reaches 400ml limit. The somatic innervation to your ext sphincter makes this possible.</p>
<p>Also, this is precisely one reason that in old age, you can no longer hold as much, but various other factors also comes into play!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
