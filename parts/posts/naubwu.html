		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Coffee contains (among other things) <em>aromatic oils</em>, that is, oils that vaporize at lower-than-boiling temperatures. These oils are what make coffee smell so good when it's being brewed traditionally.</p>
<p>Those oils also help balance the flavor of the coffee, specifically offsetting the bitterness of the roasted beans. More oil in the coffee = less bitter flavor... but less delicious inviting aroma.</p>
<p>Making traditional coffee, and letting it cool in the open, means you lose most of those oils and the remaining drink is bitter. </p>
<p>Making coffee via a cold-brewing method means the coffee never gets warm enough to vaporize the aromatic oils, so they remain in the coffee and balance out the bitterness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ice Coffee is cooled down immediately after brewing so the oils in it have not evaporated away, and other compounds have not oxidized due to exposure to air. It is still fresh and so still tastes good. Standard hot coffee that is allowed to go cold in your cup over the course of an hour or more has had more of the oils evaporate due to being at a high temp longer, and had more of the compounds oxidize due to sitting for an hour or more. The temperature is a very small factor in it starting to taste bad, it effectively going &quot;stale&quot; or the coffee equivalent of going flat over time is the factor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our coffee maker doesn’t have a heating element and instead stores the hot coffee in an insulated thermos carafe. Even when the coffee goes cold it retains its flavor quite well. The open top glass carafes that sit on a hot plate are death to good coffee.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>long time specialty coffee barista here. &quot;specialty coffee&quot; is used to denote high-quality beans that are sourced directly from farms, not bought on the commodity markets. the roasters we worked with were extremely dedicated, and the product was often very different than what most people are accustomed to. a light-roasted high quality coffee should have a color like tea, a clean body (not thick!!!!!!!!), and a juicy, flavorful, sweet flavor. good coffee is truly more like tea than the coffee you'd get at starbucks or dunkin donuts, to the point that those latter drinks are almost unrecognizable as coffee to me.</p>
<p>here's my point.</p>
<p>if you're drinking GOOD coffee, it tests <em>best</em> at lower temperatures, somewhere between hot and room temperature when the flavors have had time to develop and it reaches a temperature that won't scald your taste buds. it will continue to taste good as it turns lukewarm and cool. so if your coffee tastes bad when it's cooler, it was never good coffee to begin with. as such, i cannot really answer your question, as the premise of the question (&quot;hot coffee that goes cold taste[s] bad&quot;) is itself flawed. but i'll try to answer somewhat.</p>
<p>iced coffee that you get at many shops is simply yesterday's brewed coffee poured over ice. if that tastes good to you, then that's great, i'm jealous! at best, it's tolerable to me. i make no apologies for being a snob so save your breath if you want to call me out on it. cold brew makes good coffee because for whatever reason the low temperatures never extract some of the harsher notes from even low-quality coffee. i suspect that most places are doing a better job at filtering cold brew, because partly why warm coffee that goes cold tastes bad is due to unfiltered solids continuing to brew, leaving bitter/sour tastes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
