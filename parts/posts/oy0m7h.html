		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I highly recommend reading this research - <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289616303324" target="_blank">High intelligence: A risk factor for psychological and physiological overexcitabilities</a></p>
<p>The researchers found that those with a high IQ experience mood disorders, anxiety disorders, autism, ADHD, autoimmune issues, and childhood allergies at a higher rate than the general population.</p>
<p>The hypothesis is that those with a high IQ, or ‚Äúhyper brain,‚Äù have overexcited bodies, which can lead to inflammation and allergies. Basically, when you are intelligent, your brain is more excitable than others. Things that may not be of interest to average people may reel in a person with a high IQ. The same cognitive process that allows an intelligent person to overthink a problem and find novel ways to solve it, can also lead the person to overthink unnecessarily, and lead to anxiety and rumination, which causes a physical response to stress through activation of the sympathetic nervous system, and then physiological problems from that. </p>
<p>They also mention that because having a high IQ is rare, it can be isolating. People with high IQs may go throughout life always having to adjust their way of thinking and speaking in order to relate to others, which can be exhausting and emotionally painful, like those with ADHD or autism needing to mask. </p>
<p>I highly recommend reading that research. I had the same question as you and I found their hypothesis and discussion compelling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I‚Äôm not a psychologist but I do have a degree in psychology and working on a master‚Äôs in clinical counseling (probably doesn‚Äôt hold much ground), and I haven‚Äôt read anything in the DSM-IV or the limited research I‚Äôve read that would suggest there‚Äôs a positive or negative correlation for this. At least one that has statistical significance. In my personal opinion, and one that is shared with a lot of individuals within the MH community, the idea that mental disorders and IQ have a significant correlation is antiquated. You can see high IQ‚Äôs in people on the autism spectrum, ADHD, personality disorders, mood disorders, etc., and you can see low IQ‚Äôs as well. Neural plasticity and neural pathway change can also effect IQ and it‚Äôs postulated that IQ isn‚Äôt necessarily fixed. I hope that made sense ü•¥.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One problem here is the way your question is written because of the way ‚Äúpsychosis‚Äù is defined. Psychosis is an umbrella term that can be used to refer to an incredibly wide range of mental disorders that can have an incredibly wide range of causes like physical or mental trauma, neuroanatomy, physiology, neurobiology, neurochemistry, etc. Therefore, it is possible that some types of psychoses could be positively correlated with IQ, other types negatively correlated, and others not at all correlated. Even within the same mental disorder, for example depression or Major Depressive Disorder, underlying causes and symptoms can vary between individuals, sometimes significantly. Depression is not the same to all people, and people aren‚Äôt always depressed for the same reasons. Just a quick example from a neurochemical perspective: some cases of depression seem to be linked to a lack of dopamine, others a lack of serotonin, others to excessive reputake of dopamine, others to excessive reuptake of serotonin. It is of course much more complicated and diverse than that, but I‚Äôm just making a quick point. (This is also partly why there are so many different pharmaceuticals or other medicines for depression). </p>
<p>So back to the question. Even within Major Depressive Disorder, that term might be too broad. It could be that people with MDD due to excessive reuptake of serotonin are correlated positively with having a high IQ, and maybe people with MDD related to dopamine are positively correlated with lower IQ‚Äôs (this is just a hypothetical of course). </p>
<p>So the way you‚Äôre phrasing the question is too broad. Maybe dementia is positively correlated with IQ while Borderline Personality Disorder is negatively correlated with IQ, and Schizoid Personality Disorder has no correlation with IQ.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think I know why you‚Äôre confused.  So there‚Äôs really two things to think about.  One is well known, the other is postulated.</p>
<p>Psychotic episodes decrease IQ.  Following an episode of psychosis an individual rarely is able to fully return to their cognitive baseline.  Essentially the psychotic state does permanent damage.  The longer they spend in psychosis, the worse the effect. As well, future episodes further degrade their cognitive ability.  That relationship is widely known and is taught in undergraduate level psychology curriculum.</p>
<p>Now the one you probably want to know about, does having a higher IQ predispose you to psychosis?  Well, maybe.  A few studies have found a relationship.  However the ones that have supported the relationship have found very small effects.  Two studies I found doing a brief literature review before answering this question found correlations that very small.  One would question the clinical significance of the relationship.  I think you could find many more important factors that alter risk for psychosis than IQ.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
