		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dementia is a collective term for a group of diseases affecting cognitive function.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's accounts for around 80% of all dementias - it's a progressive disease in which brain cells and connections slowly die off. Memory loss is often noted first, followed by personality changes (agitation etc). People with Alzheimer's can be described as constantly living in the moment - reacting to things around them, and not creating new memories. The disease eventually affects the persons ability to care for themselves (bathing, feeding, toileting etc), eventually resulting in decreased ability to swallow and eliminate effectively.</p>
<p>Other common types of dementia include frontotemporal dementia (no memory loss, but issues with mood, self control, and attention), vasular dementia (personality and attention changes due to physical damage from bleeds on the brain), and Lewy-body dementia (similar yo Alzheimer's, but with stiffness and rigidity throughout the body).</p>
<p>Hope this helps answer your question!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone please stop confusing delirium with dementia.</p>
<p>Delirium is an acute, (typically) reversible confusional state.  Common causes -especially in the elederly-  include infection, constipation, pain.</p>
<p>Dementia is a syndrome associated with cognitive decline.  Almost always  progressive.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's is a type of dementia.  Other types include Lewy Body, Parkinsonian, and Vascular Dementia.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dementia is an umbrella term - so alzheimers is a form of dementia.</p>
<p>Alzheimers is to dementia:</p>
<p>As leukaemia or lymphoma is to cancer</p>
<p>As rock or hip hop is to music</p>
<p>As a sandwich or pie is to food</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
