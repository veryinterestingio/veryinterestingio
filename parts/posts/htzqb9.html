We've gotten pretty good at measuring distances between us and other stars, and by putting those into some modeling software, we can then look at them from different angles. Kind of like how cartographers were able to make accurate maps before satellites or even aircraft were a thing.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not unfair to say that we don't. We know a great deal more than we did 10 years ago and 10 years ago we knew a great deal more than we did 10 year before... but our understanding of the shape of our galaxy is ultimately limited by our ability to know the locations of the stars and other matter in it.</p>
<p>In a sense, we're just starting to expand our definition of what the Milky Way <em>is</em> in the sense that we've recently discovered much more of the structure of the &quot;halo&quot; region of the galaxy and begun to understand the interconnectedness of that halo to the rest of the Milky Way.</p>
<p>What we know:</p>
<ul>
<li>The locations and proper motion of most nearby stars over a certain brightness</li>
<li>The locations and proper motion of a fraction of the stars over 10,000 light years (2/5 of the distance to the galactic center)</li>
<li>That our galaxy has a substantial &quot;dark matter halo&quot;</li>
<li>That there are multiple &quot;streams&quot; of stars around the central black hole, not all of which are within the galactic plane, and some of which may be remnants of &quot;recent&quot; galactic collisions.</li>
<li>The general shape and extent of the part of the galaxy that we are within</li>
</ul>
<p>What we have only general ideas of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The shape of the far side of the galaxy</li>
<li>The structure of the halo</li>
<li>The total number of dim stars in the galaxy</li>
<li>The total mass of the Milky Way</li>
<li>The amount of dark matter in our galaxy and its halo (we have what we think are reasonable constraints on the amount)</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Astronomer here: my main job consists in mapping the Milky Way and to understand its dynamics.</p>
<p>One of current ESA missions, Gaia, is helping astronomers improve the knowledge of our Galaxy by measuring accurately coordinates, distances, velocities and colors from the objects in the Milky Way, in the visible spectrum of light.</p>
<p>Mapping the stars allows to see the sky as a whole with a much higher definition: [ESA Gaia Sky map](<a href="https://sci.esa.int/web/gaia/-/60169-gaia-s-sky-in-colour" target="_blank">https://sci.esa.int/web/gaia/-/60169-gaia-s-sky-in-colour</a> ). </p>
<p>The coordinates of the stars can be projected in a XY plane to obtain a &quot;Top View&quot; of the Galaxy in the Visible spectrum. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the dynamics of the Galaxy also help astronomers to understand the structures and shape of the Galaxy. </p>
<p>For instance, we know that the arms of the galaxies are the site of star formation. By tracking the brightest stars in the galaxy (the blue stars, because they are the brightest, their life span is also the lowest, indicating they had little to no time to migrate from the place they were formed, like red stars) one is able to map the spiral arms of the Galaxy. </p>
<p>If you have any questions, comment below, I am willing to answer to any questions!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is difficult to precisely know how the Milky Way looks since we're inside of it. Imagine trying to draw your house from the inside. Through mapping features we're at least fairly close to how it looks. We're a little uncertain if there's a bar or not, but it's more likely we do have a bar. Also we think the disc is warped at least somewhat. But knowing the precise features to make nice pictures like we have of other galaxies is pretty much impossible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
