		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they can but it's complicated. Hepatitis D is a virus that can only infect people with chronic hepatitis B infections. However, when that happens, the hepatitis B virus tends to be suppressed and hepatitis D dominates. You actually can be infected with hepatitis B, C, and D simultaneously, and hepatitis B also gets suppressed and either C or D dominates.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Multiple viral infections that happen to infect the same cell may compete to a certain degree within that cell, competing for ribosomes, amino acids, etc.  But on the larger clinical scale, there are plenty of cells to go around.  Each virus will infect only a tiny fraction of a particular cell type.  </p>
<p>If a person is so infected with a virus that they have no available resources for additional infections, they have much bigger problems than a competing virus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's complicated--- but for something like Rhinovirus (there are 3 species, and about 130 different subtypes across the 3 species) you rarely have more than one at a time. Whether that's because it's rare to contract two , or whether one out-competes the other is hard to say.  For other respiratory viruses in some of the work I've done screening hundreds of people at high risk of respiratory infections, you rarely see more than one viral infection at a time (in one study I think we had 3 or 4 incidences of viral co-infection, out of \~800 total infections in that study). So for the lung anyways, I think you usually get one virus at a time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it appears that co-infections with viruses and bacteria are quite common and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. For example, in COPD patients, 1/2 to 2/3 of them will develop secondary bacterial infections following an initial Rhinovirus infection. The people that have these secondary bacterial infections have more severe disease and end up hospitalized at higher rates and for longer times. It's actually usually the same bacterial species that grow out as well, suggesting it's not random and that the virus predisposes you to the secondary bacterial infections.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer:  Not necessarily</p>
<p>HIV can infect the human body and lay dormant for years.  Also, not all viruses have the same kind of genetic material.  SARS-COV-2 is a cis-sense RNA virus, much like influenza... but different. Rhinoviruses (common cold) are positive sense, but also different.  There are different Baltimore classifications of DNA viruses.  All of which means different proteins are in play at different steps along the process of replication at different times.</p>
<p>Edit:  To further drill down on your question, if similar (but different) viruses infected you like SARS-COV-2 (WT) and SARS-COV-2 (B.1.1.7), then we need to talk about which one enters first and takes hold, because pathogens and your immune system are in an arms race.  B.1.1.7 is more infectious, but apparently not more virulent, so it might get in first but may not make you sicker.  We really don't know yet.  However, if that does occur, I would suspect at least thermodynamically it has the upper hand and would have a higher viral load.</p>
<p>Honestly, it's an interesting question.  Probably something we could model but would never attempt in vivo except perhaps on animal models... but that's again only an analogue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
