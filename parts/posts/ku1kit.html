<p>Why is radioactive decay a random process?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately there's not really much of a meaningful answer which can be given here.  It's random because the most statistically accurate description happens to be random, and no determining factors have been found to date.  Quantum mechanics — the most accurate theory of small phenomena such as particle decay — is a fundamentally probabilistic theory; it can tell us what all of the probabilities are for any process to occur within a given time frame but it can't tell us exactly when any specific process will occur.</p>
<p>Most interpretations of quantum mechanics simply assert that the randomness in the theory is inherent to nature, and that's that.  There are some interpretations which retain full determinism, but this necessarily comes at the cost of other important and nice features such as locality (i.e. no faster-than-light signalling and no causality violations).  There is an important theorem known as Bell's theorem which essentially says that a classical theory (one with all of the &quot;nice&quot; features like locality and determinism) cannot ever reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics, and experiments have repeatedly shown that nature favors quantum mechanics' predictions over classical predictions.  Consequently, at least one &quot;nice&quot; feature such as determinism or locality <em>must</em> be violated in nature ... but unfortunately Bell's theorem does not give us a way to ascertain exactly which feature is the wrong one.  That's essentially what the different interpretations of quantum mechanics are about:  different interpretations reject different features, and then explore what those decisions mean for how nature must behave.  But we don't know which interpretation is actually correct.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Because a truly random variable is <del><em>un</em>caused</del> <em>un</em>determined by definition.</p>
<p>(Edit: wording adjustment because random processes are not necessarily uncaused even if they are undetermined; there are processes where some causing factor might require one of them to <em>necessarily</em> happen — for example, to conserve energy or momentum — but which one actually does happen is still randomly chosen from a probability distribution over the possible outcomes.)</p>
<p>The key thing to understand, in my opinion, is that a pseudorandom process (i.e. one which is actually deterministic but for which the determining factors are unknown or known but practically impossible to control) and a truly random process (i.e. one with no determining factors at all) can both produce a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_randomness" target="_blank">statistically random</a> dataset.  Consequently it is impossible in practice to determine whether a given random variable in nature is truly random or merely pseudorandom.</p>

<p>It may simply be the case that there is no governing principle by which such a prediction could ever be made.  If there are simply no determining factors, then that's kind of all she wrote.</p>
