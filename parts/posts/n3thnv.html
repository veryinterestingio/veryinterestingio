		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is not just one list. Instead the lists are grouped by category and format. And there is new lists every week. This means that there may be a hundred books which gets to the top of at least one of the lists every year. And several hundreds make it onto at least one list. So claiming to be a New Your Times Best Seller may bean that the book was the fourth most sold fiction book in a pocket format during the 42nd week of 2020. But that does not sound as impressive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it's one of the easiest awards to manipulate.</p>
<p>I know a gentleman that self-published a book, bought 15,000 copies himself, made the New York times bestseller list.</p>
<p>There were some rules about how many physical copies had to be printed, but in total it cost him about $13,000 to be a New York times bestselling author and motivational speaker.</p>
<p>Now he charges 10,000 per speaking engagement</p>
<p>Super easy way to game the system to give yourself validity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's simple survivorship bias. Any particular book you've heard of is more likely to be a NYT bestseller simply due to you <em>having heard about it</em>. <a href="https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-018-0135-y" target="_blank">About 3 Million books get published every year, only 500 end up being NYT bestsellers</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aside from what everyone has already posted about different lists and formats and timing, the &quot;best sellers&quot; are reported to the NYT by the merchants. So, let's say that some big-name brick-and-mortar shop buys too many of a certain title. They need to get interest in this title so they can move the merchandise. So they report that this title sold a bunch of copies, thereby placing it on the list, thereby drawing attention, so they can make their money. So basically, that book is a best seller because someone said it was a best seller. This of course doesn't apply to all books.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they're the only ones that get the press coverage.
I used to wonder this as well, but I think the better question is; why do I only ever hear about New York Times bestsellers, when hundreds of books come out every month.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
