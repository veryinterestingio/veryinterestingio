		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are the <a href="https://www.vumc.org/music-cognition-lab/" target="_blank">Vanderbilt Music Cognition Lab</a>, a research team dedicated to studying the relationship between musical skills and communication skills.  We use tools from psychology, neuroscience, genetics, medicine, and engineering to better understand how and <strong>why humans engage with music</strong> and to what degree musicality interacts with language and social communication. Many of you readers probably have intuitions about <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00327/full" target="_blank">how people with a more &quot;musical ear&quot; might have a leg up while learning a new language</a>, or about how musical talent runs in families, or that children's music skills may be affected by the musical environment to which they are exposed.</p>
<p>But did you know that what scientists are learning about music, genetics, and the brain may even be important for our understanding of childhood speech-language development? In 2015 <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/11/141105101238.htm" target="_blank">we showed that children's rhythm skills are predictive of their spoken language skills</a>.  Many studies have also found that people with reading disability and speech problems are more likely to have difficulty with music rhythm. Our <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcs.1528" target="_blank">recent paper</a> reviewed evidence for a new framework about rhythm and speech-language development. Discoveries in this emerging area could help solve an urgent public health problem, which is that many children with language problems are not getting identified or treated!</p>
<p>Alongside this AMA, there is an opportunity to participate in research.</p>
<p><em>Do you have good rhythm? Or is rhythm hard for you? All skill levels are welcome! Our new study examines the biological basis of musical rhythm, with an online rhythm test and optional mail-in saliva collection. Participants can choose to receive their rhythm scores at the end of the survey! Participation takes 10-20 minutes. Participants can choose to be entered in a raffle to win a $100 Amazon gift card.</em></p>

<p>Let's talk about the scientific study of music and language in the brain - Ask Me (us) Anything!</p>
<p>Bios</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reyna Gordon, PhD</strong> (/u/Reyna_Gordon): I am an Assistant Professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where I direct the Music Cognition Lab (/u/VandyMusicCog) and also am on the faculty of the Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, the Vanderbilt Brain Institute, and the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center. My research group's interdisciplinary research program is focused on the relationship between rhythm and language abilities from behavioral, cognitive, neural, and genetic perspectives. I am passionate about <a href="https://www.vumc.org/music-cognition-lab/publication/interprofessional-education-next-generation-musician-scientists-through-music-cognition" target="_blank">training students and staff to work across traditional disciplinary boundaries</a>. I hold a PhD in Complex Systems and Brain Sciences, and before I became a cognitive neuroscientist, I was a classically trained singer (my Bachelor's degree is in Vocal Arts!).</li>
<li><strong>Eniko Ladanyi, PhD</strong> (/u/eladanyi): I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Music Cognition Lab of Vanderbilt University Medical Center. I have degrees in linguistics and cognitive science and my current research focuses on associations between rhythm and language skills in typical and atypical speech/language development. I use EEG and behavioral tests to investigate whether rhythm skills at infancy can predict childhood speech/language development and whether children with low speech/language skills also show low rhythm skills. I hope my research will eventually improve screening and therapy of children with speech or language disorders.</li>
<li><strong>Daniel Gustavson, PhD</strong> (/u/DanielGustavson): I am a Research Instructor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Trained in cognitive psychology and behavior genetics, I use twin studies and measured genetic data to understand how cognitive abilities relate to everyday behaviors such as procrastination, impulsivity, goal management, and (most recently) music engagement. I'm also interested in how our cognitive abilities (like memory and self-control) change over the course of the lifespan, and what types of factors help us improve the most through childhood and keep us most resilient to decline in old age. I play a range of instruments including guitar, drums, and harmonica.</li>
<li><strong>Olivia Boorom MS, CCC-SLP</strong>. (/u/OliviaBoorom) I am a certified speech-language pathologist at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Music Cognition Lab. I use behavioral measures to investigate how language and social communication skills relate to rhythmicity, and how the natural rhythms of our daily interactions impact language development in children with Autism spectrum disorder and Developmental Language Disorder. I'm also interested in how music can be used as a tool to support parents and clinicians during everyday activities and during intervention. Before becoming a clinician I was an avid flute player!</li>
<li><strong>Srishti Nayak, PhD</strong> (/u/nayaks1): I'm a postdoctoral research fellow at the Music Cognition Lab studying the biological bases of speech rhythms (prosody) and its relationships to musical rhythm and language development. My training is in Developmental Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience methods, and my work investigates how language environments early in life shape cognitive and neural development. Relatedly, I am interested in how different &quot;domains&quot; of cognition - e.g. our attention system or our emotional brain - interact with language. Given my longstanding interest in language as both an environmental <em>input</em>, and an <em>outcome</em>, my current work investigates bidirectional links between music and language skills, and the possible neural and genetic basis underlying individual variation in these skills.</li>
<li><strong>Anna Kasdan, BS</strong> (/u/avkazz): I am a third year PhD candidate in the Neuroscience Graduate Program at Vanderbilt University. Broadly, I study the neural basis of rhythm in both neurotypical individuals and in individuals with Williams syndrome and aphasia, using neuroimaging techniques such as EEG as well as behavioral measures. I received my undergraduate degree from Boston University, where I majored in Neuroscience and minored in Piano Performance.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How are our emotions easily manipulated by music?</p>
<p>In movies, using the right musical cue could immediately signify what the feeling of the moment is and we actually feel for the characters/plot.</p>
<p>When in a downer mood, listening to an &quot;upbeat&quot; song can usually get you back on track.</p>
<p>Or, something more mind-boggling, when listening to certain music (usually classical ones, <em>Clair De Lune by Debussy</em> for me), makes us feel these emotions of non-materialistic origins (almost ethereal or metaphysical feelings).</p>
<p>Why is that? Thank you for doing this AMA.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I’m curious if there is any work in biotyping in music— as in, are there commonalities people might share who are musically gifted? If not, do you think there might be a reason for that (such as musical ability being linked more to acquisition period than bio type)?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
