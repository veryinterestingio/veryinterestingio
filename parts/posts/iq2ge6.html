		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Sun's gravity actually <em>does</em> cause tides! They're just weaker than the Moon's tides.</p>
<p>The Sun's gravitational force on the Earth is stronger than the Moon's, but its tides are weaker. This is because tides decrease with distance more quickly than net gravity does.</p>
<p>Tidal forces are caused by the difference in gravity between one side of the planet and the other. Gravity drops off with distance, so one side of the planet gets pulled a bit more than the other. This causes the planet to get stretched a little bit, which is the tidal force.</p>
<p>If you're close to an object, gravity is dropping rapidly, which means that the tidal forces are extra strong. They're strong because the net gravity is strong, but they're extra strong because the gravity is dropping fast with distance. This is what makes tides decrease more rapidly with distance than net gravity, because there are, in a sense, two effects to make it stronger when you're close.</p>
<p>So the Moon ends up dominating our tides, even though we orbit the Sun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It <em>does</em>.  The moon causes the daily tides, but the Sun modifies how high or low the peaks and troughs of the tides are.  These are called Spring and Neap tides.</p>
<p>But to understand it, we need to take a step back and understand tides themselves.</p>
<p>The strength of the gravitational force between two objects follows the <em>inverse square law</em>, which basically means if you move two objects to be twice as far apart, the force will go down to a quarter.  Tidal forces are caused by the difference in gravitational pull across the planet.  The side of Earth closest to the Moon feels the pull stronger than the side further away.  This causes water to bulge towards the Moon on one side, and causes another bulge on the opposite side where the water can move away.  (It's not quite this simple.  The bulges are a bit offset, but we'll forget about that for now.)</p>
<p>The strength of the difference also depends on the distance.  In fact, tidal forces actually follow an inverse cube law, meaning if Earth was twice as far away from the Moon, the tidal forces across the planet would be an eighth of what they are!  When you crunch the numbers (the distance from the Earth to the Sun and Moon, and the relative masses), the Moon has roughly 10 times the effect on the tides as the Sun.  But...</p>
<p>Depending on how the Earth, Sun, and Moon are aligned, the effects of tidal forces from the Sun and Moon may add up or partially cancel each other out.  The interaction between the Earth, Sun, and Moon are what we know as months.  During full and new moons, the forces add up so we get more extreme (Spring) tides.  When the Moon is half illuminated, they partially cancel (as the Moon and Sun are at right angles to Earth), and we get smaller (Neap) tides.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add on to the answers already given, where gravity falls with the square of distance, tidal forces fall with the cube of distance. The Sun pulls on the moon about twice as much as the Earth does, but the tidal force between the Earth and Moon is significantly greater due to the power law.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, most people get wrong how tides really work, including people in STEM. The Moon's (and Sun's) gravity doesn't really lift or &quot;stretch&quot; the oceans. Rather, due to the gravity differential from the Moon and the sum of the tidal acceleration vectors across the surface of Earth, the water perpendicular to the Earth-Moon line &quot;pushes&quot; or &quot;squeezes&quot; water towards the Earth-Moon line, creating tidal bulges. It's a cumulative effect that requires enormous surface area. That's why you only observe tides on the ocean or on very large bodies of water.</p>
<p>This video from PBS Space Time explains it quite well:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It does, but it's smaller than moon tides. Look up spring tides. Spring tide is when the moon tide and sun tide match and create a larger-than-normal tide.
In 1953, a spring tide combined with a storm led to the North Sea flood, one of the biggest natural disasters in the Netherlands, and the subsequent building of the Delta works to protect our tiny wet country.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
