		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Subduction is a sloooooooow process.  It's not as if you could stand there and watch a section of the Earth's crust be pulled under another section like an escalator disappearing under the mall floor - plates are subducted at a rate of 2 cm to 8 cm per year (&lt;1 in to 2.5 in).  So even if you could safely deliver waste to a subduction zone (you can't), you'd have to manage to keep it there for the thousands to millions of years it would take for any meaningful amount to be pulled down.</p>
<p>And to make life more interesting, subduction zones are underwater (deep underwater), so there's huge expenses and risks with putting things down there where you want them.  And they're in earthquake prone areas, so you'd have to contend with that.  And then subducted materials can make their way into magma on geoligic timescales, so there's the very real issue of radioactive lava and gasses spewing from active volcanoes in a few millennia - not our problem, but still a problem.</p>
<p>This issue is similar to the &quot;just send it into space&quot; solution often proposed on reddit.  Neither works and for the same reasons - expense, engineering difficulty, high risk of catastrophic failure, and the operational scale required (even if we could overcome every other issue) is far too large for the resources we have.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Heat and burning rearrange atoms into different molecules, such as turning complex sugars and fats into CO2 and water. It's basically rearranging the elections so that the atoms are grouped differently. </p>
<p>The problem with nuclear waste is that the individual atoms have unstable nuclei. Nothing you do to the electrons (i.e., nothing chemical) changes what's in the nucleus. Those nuclei would not be affected by burning or by the amount of heat the Earth can produce. Even the formation of the Earth didn't destroy them, which is why we can mine uranium and other radioisotopes today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't work because the motions of the Earth are much vaster, and much slower, than you imagine.  Earth's ocean plates are indeed sliding under the Earth at subduction zones, carrying the seafloor into the Earth's interior like a conveyor belt.  But it's not like the baggage claim at the airport.</p>
<p>1) The speed of movement is a few cm (an inch or two) per year.  If you put a barrel of waste on the seafloor and waited <em>5000 years</em> -- the entire span of human recorded history -- the barrel would have moved about the distance of a football field.</p>
<p>2) The movement isn't steady.  The descending ocean plate is stuck to the underside of the continent above it.  Often there's <em>no motion at all</em> for a few centuries, and then suddenly the plate breaks loose and move a few meters, then stick again.  This is an earthquake, like the ones that struck Japan and Indonesia recently.</p>
<p>3) The ocean plate is covered with sediment: several kilometers (miles) of mud.  The mud doesn't slide down with the rest of the plate: it gets scraped off by the overlying continental plate, like dirt in a  bulldozer's scoop.  It piles up to form an &quot;accretionary wedge&quot; on the nose of the continent.  Your toxic waste is going to become part of this mess rather than going smoothly into the interior.  Often this area gets pushed upward to form new land.  It's also a region with lots of volcanic activity driven by the melting plate underneath.</p>
<p>So say tomorrow you set a toxic waste barrel on the seafloor in the subduction trench off the coast of Japan.  100 years from now, it's exactly where you put it, absolutely nothing's changed.  1000 years from now, it's moved a few paces away, having survived a colossal earthquake or two.  10,000 years from now, after countless earthquakes, it's maybe a few feet down in the mud.  100,000 years from now, it's pretty deeply buried.  1,000,000 years from now the mud is starting to solidify into rock, which is added on to the Asian continent.  10,000,000 years from now, the continued &quot;bulldozing&quot; pushes the rock up to the surface, to form a new mountain range that's part of the islands of Japan.</p>
<p>At no point does your barrel actually go down into the Earth's mantle.</p>
<p>Here are some diagrams showing the &quot;accretionary wedge&quot; I'm talking about.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people are bringing up the geological impossibilities, but also; that shit's expensive, bro.  And ecologically damaging.  At least for trash.</p>
<p>I live in Michigan.  No tectonic plate action here.  If they wanted to ship my trash, it'd be thousands of miles.  A quick google source tells me Michiganders produce 43 million cubic yards of trash annually, or 387 million cubic feet.  With semi-trucks able to cart around 127 cubic yards per trip, that's 338,000 truckloads.  Nearest plates collision zone is the Cascade Arc, in the Vancouver area, 2,459 miles away.  With semi-trucks averaging 6.5 MPG, you're looking at 756 gallons of fuel round trip for each truckload.  To dispose of my state's trash, you'd need 255,528,000 gallons of fuel annually.</p>
<p>Not exactly the most ecologically friendly option.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
