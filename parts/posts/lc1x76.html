<p>The sleep cycle runs in about 90 minute increments from light sleep, to deep sleep, and back again. If you wake up during a light sleep phase, you'll feel more rested. It's when your body naturally wants to wake up.  If you wake up from deep sleep, your body doesn't want to wake up, so you still feel tired.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would imagine it’s most likely a combination of your physical biology and lifestyle factors. Some people need more sleep than others plus your diet and physical activity play a role in how you feel day-to-day. Another variable might be medications. Doesn’t exactly answer your question but if you take stock of what you ate and did that day, or the day before, you might be able to narrow down what causes it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
