Maybe the heart of the mega cities seem a little more futuristic, but the geographical majority of the country is stuck in the 90’s. Email is barely used, fax machine is king, you have to rent your dvds, internet phobia is real, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Japan had an industrial strategy after WW2 to invest in education and businesses that would lead to creation of high-tech jobs. This was aided directly by US funds in the early years but even more helpful was openness of the US to import Japanese products at tariffs that were significantly less than the tariffs that Japan placed on American imports for much of the postwar period, starting at a time when American companies dominated most industries including the electronic and automobile fields. It was important for the US to help build up Japan as a potential bulwark against communism in Asia. But at the same time Japan took the proceeds of its sales from imports and wisely kept investing to make their technology better. By the time that trade conditions became more fair between the US and Japan, US products in many areas had already fallen behind Japanese products in quality and price. It took a lot of hard work and shrewd decision making on the part of Japan.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Im not sure if this is getting away from the topic, but I can tell you that while Japan may export a lot of electronics, their population is not as tech-savvy as the we think they are.  Pre-Covid (Haven't been back since), I used to live in Tokyo.  I found that a lot of people knew iphones well enough, but when it came to computers, typing, android, and various other things they struggled.  That said, this was more apparent with those that were of 35 or older.  The younger generation, naturally, seemed to be okay with tech for the most part.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
