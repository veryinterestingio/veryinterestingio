		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/tommustill?lang=en" target="_blank">Tom Mustill</a>, wildlife filmmaker and whale enthusiast. After a humpback whale breached on top of me in 2015 (you may have seen the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u-MW7vF0-Y&amp;te=1&amp;nl=watching&amp;emc=edit_wg_20200115" target="_blank">viral video</a>), I became obsessed with learning about who this whale was and why it had done this. I learned about a lot more about humpbacks and their current situation along the way, culminating in a documentary film you can watch now, titled <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/the-whale-detective-5nsii3/20808/" target="_blank">&quot;The Whale Detective.&quot;</a></p>
<p>I'm joined by <a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/joy-s-reidenberg" target="_blank">Dr. Joy Reidenberg</a>, Professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. As an expert in whale anatomy, Joy was a tremendous help as a scientific advisor and correspondent for the film.</p>
<p>We'll be answering your questions at noon ET (16 UT). Ask us anything!</p></div></div>
