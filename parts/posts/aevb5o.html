<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Near the tip of the nozzle is a small hole, and a small pipe leads back from the hole into the handle. Suction is applied to this pipe using a <strong>venturi</strong>. When the tank is not full, air is being drawn through the hole by the vacuum, and the air flows easily. When <a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/gasoline.htm" target="_blank">gasoline</a> in the tank rises high enough to block the hole, a mechanical linkage in the handle senses the change in suction and flips the nozzle off. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a second tube that is sucking out the fumes as they come up the inlet pipe. There is a membrane inside the handle, underneath the round cap with the logo on it. This membrane when pulled up stops the fuel supply. When the tank is filled up, it can’t pull the fuel vapours anymore so instead it pulls on the membrane which cuts off the fuel supply. </p>
<p>Edit: as mentioned in the comments below. It’s any gas, not just fuel vapours so air is included.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the pump nozzle you put in the fuel tank when your filling up is in actual fact, two nozzles. Underneath the main large one which the fuel comes out of is a second very small nozzle. However that one is sucking in air as you pump.</p>
<p>The reason for this second small nozzle is twofold. Firstly it lets the pump know when the tank is full and to stop the fuel flow so fuel does not flow out your tank causing a spillage everywhere and potentially a serious accident. It does this by sucking in air and fumes from inside the tank as you pump. However as soon as this suction gets cut off by coming into contact with the fuel, the pump knows to immediately cut the fuel flow.</p>
<p>Think of it like sucking air through a straw and slowly dipping the other end of the straw into some water. As soon as you do so you will need to apply a lot more suction to get the liquid to travel up the straw. This is what the pump detects which tells it to turn the fuel flow off.</p>
<p>The second reason for this suction nozzle is also to capture fumes. Pumping such high amounts of fuel would normally involve really high amounts of hazardous fumes which are really quite combustible! However because this suction nozzle is sucking them up, it's not so bad.</p>
<p>These fumes are actually quite bad for the environment as well, so rather than just vent them to the atmosphere, they are stored in the empty space of the fuel tank that feeds all the pumps for the service station. When a fuel truck comes to refill the service stations tanks, it takes the fumes away where they are processed into usable fuel again (They used to just be burnt but the days of that have come to an end in a lot of countries).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>LPT--you should not keep goosing the gas nozzle in an effort to fill the tank to the brim.  Fill the tank until it clicks off, then either stop there, or fill again one time only.  There is an activated charcoal filter near the top of the tank's filler neck, and if you keep pumping long enough the filter can get soaked with fuel.  This can cause problems with the car's computer, fuel control system, etc., and throw a code at you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What I want to know, is how much reserve gas is left when I get down to empty. Specially on this car I now own that has a computer that gives me an estimated range. Online specs say the tank is 12.39 gallons.</p>
<p>But even when I got to zero and drove another while, when I finally got gas, it only lets me put in a little over 11 gallons. So is there always a gallon of reserve? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
