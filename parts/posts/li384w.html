		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The lungs are filled with fluid.  Before birth though a lot of the fluid is absorbed, and some can be squished out during birth. (Newborns are kinda squishy like that) So the first breath after birth inflates the lungs.</p>
<p>Some fluid is left over but that gets absorbed in the first few hours. Though it is possible too much fluid is left in there and  leads to difficult breathing for a while till it gets absorbed.</p>
<p>Also what happens is that when the lungs first fill with air a lot of pressure gets released from the blood vessels to the lungs allowing more blood flow through them and that sets of a series of changes that reconfigure the circulatory system to transition from being supported by the mother, to being self supporting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The instinct to breathe is triggered by an increase in CO2 in the blood. While in the womb, the baby’s blood is oxygenated by the mother’s similar to how the baby gets its nutrients from the mother as well.</p>
<p>When the baby’s lungs are fully developed it will take practice breaths but the lungs stay mostly collapsed. It isn’t until the baby is out (or in some cases not if something goes wrong) that the baby takes its first real breath, inflating its lungs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The lungs do fill with liquid, and some newborns do have trouble breathing if there's still too much. However, most of it gets forced out by the lungs themsleves, the whole chest cavity being squeezed hard during child birth, plus the fact the lungs are sort of like deflated balloona until they start breathing air for the first time so they were never entirely filled with fluid. </p>
<p>The transition isn't instant, they get oxygen through the umbilical cord from the mother. When the umbilical cord stops delivering oxygen is when they need to start relying on their own lungs. </p>
<p>The knowledge to breath when in air and avoid breathing while in water is instinctual. They breath when they meet air, just like when an infant or adult gets water over their face they instinctually stop breathing in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>During the fetal stage there is a special type of circulation that carries nutrients to the fetus but maintains gas exchange (what we commonly call respiration) without function, it is at birth that the newborn must be stimulated (the now prohibited spanking) so that through the increased pressure within the thorax, lung surfactant (a liquid that keeps the lungs inflated and lubricated) that the circulation changes and starts the gas exchange as a being from this planet</p>
