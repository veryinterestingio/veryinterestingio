<p>A friend casually raised this issue the other day over lunch and it stuck with me. I assume it has something to with better handling but I don't know for sure.</p></div></div>

Notice how they are bigger for this reason. The simplicity in design other comments suggest it’s just a bonus, one extra joint it’s not big deal nowadays.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part tradition, part necessity. As somebody else already pointed out, you will want to have some leverage when the power steering goes out. </p>
<p>I started as a bus driver 14 years ago, and the oldest buses we had were from 1989 - we were very happy to have leverage, because the power steering did die on some of them. Interestingly, we had one on which the power steering worked, but only to the left. Interesting effects. </p>
<p>On the new buses we got in 2010 and 2012, the steering wheels had shrunk dramatically.</p>
<p>I should note that I drove city lines and short distance intercity lines in Europe; honestly I have never driven a coach younger than 1995, so I’m not sure how things developed on a long distance bus. On a city bus, you’re always close to a depot, so if the power steering dies, you never have to go far.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If you have to drive for hours and hours keeping hands up at 90 degree without support is not easy at all. Having the steering wheel horizontal allows you to rest your arms on it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Time ago it was to fit the biggest possible wheel, coupled with a reduction ratio, to allow a man to manually steer a very heavy vehicle.</p>
<p>With power steering it is not the case anymore BUT:</p>
<p>The vehicle still weighs a lot and has a lot of momentum, you want to apply little inputs and with precision. On a car, going from straight to full left means less than one turn of the wheel, you can do it easily with a “vertical” wheel, and it’s more comfortable (and safer in a crash). On a bus, to be able to give little inputs, the ratio is different and you have to turn 2-3 full turn to get a full left. In this case, the “horizontal wheel makes more sense, because it allows small movements but it’s also very easy to spin it multiple revolutions when you have to follow narrow turns on the road.</p>
<p>And last, there is a bit of “we always did that way”, in the sense that we started with the big horizontal wheel and even with new tech, it is still viable so why change it?</p>
<p>In fact, it is the car wheel that evolved from horizontal to vertical in the span of a century, while the truck one remained horizontal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Buses and trucks sit a lot higher, and the driver sits a lot more forward, than a car, so the steering column needs to be more vertical to connect the steering wheel to the front axle.  To make a bus with a car-like steering wheel orientation, you'd need to do some pretty creative engineering with the steering assembly that just wouldn't be practical and would introduce a lot more potential points of failure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
