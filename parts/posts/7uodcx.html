		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Seeing as you have no answers so far i decided to do some reasearch. I found the following snippet at: <a href="https://marine-conservation.org/media/shining_sea/place_wpacific_mariana.htm" target="_blank">https://marine-conservation.org/media/shining_sea/place_wpacific_mariana.htm</a></p>
<p>&quot;Imagine the deepest, darkest place on Earth—an underwater trench plummeting to a depth of 35,800 feet, nearly seven miles below the ocean surface. The Mariana Trench is one of the least explored places on Earth. Deep enough to swallow Mt. Everest, the Mariana Trench was first pinpointed in 1951 by the British Survey ship Challenger II. Known since as Challenger Deep, it was not visited for nearly ten years. Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh descended in asubmersible called the Trieste, which could withstand over 16,000 pounds of pressure per square inch. Their descent to the bottom in cramped quarters took five hours, but provided our first glimpses of the seafloor and life at the ocean’s greatest depths. The Mariana Trench represents just one small part of the Earth’s last, great frontier. Less than five percent of the entire ocean has been explored, yet scientists have found that even the deep sea has great numbers of species—and the discoveries have only just begun&quot;</p>
<p>Interesting info from wikipedia:</p>
<p>&quot;As of February 2012, at least two other teams are planning piloted submarines to reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench. Triton Submarines, a Florida-based company that designs and manufactures private submarines, plans for a crew of three to take 120 minutes to reach the seabed.[28] DOER Marine, a marine technology company based near San Francisco and set up in 1992, plans for a crew of two or three to take 90 minutes to reach the seabed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In 2011, it was announced at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting that a US Navy hydrographic ship equipped with a multibeam echosounder conducted a survey which mapped the entire trench to 100 metres (330 ft) resolution.[2] The mapping revealed the existence of four rocky outcrops thought to be former seamounts.&quot;</p>
<p>So we have mapped it roughly but their appears to be plenty more to discover.</p>
<p>Also a cool fact on the wiki:</p>
<p>&quot;The trench is not the part of the seafloor closest to the center of the Earth. This is because the Earth is not a perfect sphere; its radius is about 25 kilometres (16 mi) less at the poles than at the equator.[6] As a result, parts of the Arctic Ocean seabed are at least 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) closer to the Earth's center than the Challenger Deep seafloor.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This massive scientific endeavor was live - streamed on multiple cams (different vessels and you could select which cam to look at) the whole time they were in the trench. I didn't follow it religiously but  checked in a bit and watched some of the streams - saw some very cool stuff.  They had scientists on the boat and back on the mainland who were experts in various areas that would chime in and provide their knowledge. It was seriously interesting.  Should be heaps of cool photos,  vids and info on the website ?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
