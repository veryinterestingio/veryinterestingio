The nutritional facts also says that it contains 43 grams of added sugar. A gram of sugar is 4 calories, 4*43 = 172. Therefore, shouldn't it have at least 172 calories?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because carbohydrates aren't exactly 4 kcal/g. Glucose and fructose, the components of both sucrose/table sugar and high fructose corn syrup, are more like 3.8 kcal/g. So 43 g * 3.8 kcal/g = 163.4 kcal, which is rounded down to the nearest 10 by FDA labeling rules. To clear up a couple of misconceptions in other responses: water in HFCS is not labeled as sugar, only the actual sugar (glucose and fructose) in it is, and since the most recent FDA update to the Nutrition Facts panel format, small packages have to be labeled according to their entire contents, so there are no more soda bottles in the US that are labeled with nutrition for a portion of their contents only.</p>

<p>Edit: When I quickly jotted down an answer to a question that was in my wheelhouse before bed last night, I didn't expect it to account for the vast majority of my comment karma and first awards by the time I woke up! Thank you! I tried to respond to as many questions below as I could. Maybe I'll do an AMA soon like a couple of commenters suggested.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>4 calories per gram of sugar is only true is the sugar in question has a water content of 0%.</p>
<p>The source of the sugar in Fanta is high fructose corn syrup.  HFCS has 3 - 4 calories per gram, depending on its water content prior to being added to the drink.  Regardless of that water content, each gram of HFCS has to be labeled as 1 gram of sugar on the nutrition label.</p>
<p>Also they're allowed to round the calories to the nearest 10, so it may actually have 155 - 164 calories in it.</p>
<p>So basically, up to 25% of that &quot;sugar&quot; may actually be water and it may have slightly more or less calories than the label states.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sugar has <em>about</em> 4kcal per gram, as a rule of thumb. The exact value though depends on the kind of sugar, and whether it is pure carbohydrates or a syrup/solution. Many web pages just go for the simple &quot;4kcal/g&quot; approach, but you can find sources with more precise values if you are looking for it.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal granulated sugar: 3.87kcal/g</li>
<li>Brown sugar: 3.80kcal/g</li>
<li>High fructose syrup (76% carbohydrates, 24% water): 2.81kcal/g</li>
<li>Honey (82% carbohydrates, 18% others, mainly water): 3.04kcal/g</li>
</ul>
