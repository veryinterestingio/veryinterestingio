		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding on this is the action of popping ones’ ears when congested feels “good” because you are equalizing a pressure imbalance within your sinuses (which your ear is part of).</p>
<p>The pressure imbalance can be caused by inflammation of some sort, that causes the sinus system to fill with fluid. In turn this fluid can lead to feeling of pressure or fullness in ones face/ears - ideally you want to find root cause for the inflammation and attack that problem, but for temporary relief the act of popping one’s ears can feel good temporarily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an ENT, I see patients with this all the time. Popping your ears equalizes the pressure between your middle ear and the outside environment. If the difference in pressure is large enough for a long enough period of time, you can develop what’s called a “middle ear effusion” or “serous otitis media”. This is what happens when people say they have water or fluid in their ears. Essentially, the negative pressure buildup in your middle ear sucks fluid from the mucus membrane lining the middle ear. Fluid will cause a hearing loss, increases risk of infection and developing a hole in your ear drum. Popping your ears helps prevent that fluid from collecting. It’s a good thing.</p>
<p>People who have difficulty equalizing that pressure have Eustachian tube dysfunction. The most common cause in adults is allergic rhinitis. Other causes are viral URI and significant changes in environmental pressure such as air travel or scuba diving.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Piggy back question. Generally speaking is everyone supposed to be able to do this? I feel like I can't and I don't know if there's something I'm doing incorrectly lol. A few years ago I traveled to Colorado and up the mountains for the first time (lived in Midwest all my my life). Going up was fine but when we came back down I had a lot of uncomfortable pressure and I couldn't pop my ears. We tried every home remedy, drops, and every thing. It eventually equalized i guess but it took more than a day. Sorry about the long post here but I'm just looking for any advice. Never been on a plane either but would love to withojt worrying about my head exploding</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because when the eustachian tube gets blocked, it often creates a vacuum in your inner ear, that gets equalized when you do it.</p>
<p>I would recommend against &quot;popping your ears&quot; by holding your nose and trying to blow air through the nose while you are congested.</p>
<p>There is a risk of spreading bacteria from the nose to the ears and give you an ear infection you could just as easily be without.</p>
<p>Instead use nasal spray, the decongestive kind, and yawn/chew gum/suck on something to equalize your ears. If that doesn't do it, consider tolerating the uneasiness of an unpopped ear to save you from the risk of an ear infection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
