		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hmm. Interesting question. The first thing to ask is did we destroy the genetic material during the milling process? It turns out that DNA is pretty sturdy, and in labs we’ll often subject cells to some pretty tough conditions (blasting glass beads against them at a high speed, or sonication, for instance) just to <em>get</em> to the DNA, and that generally leaves plenty of intact genetic material for us to work with. Being that the proteins in wheat are still intact (we rely on the glutens, a protein, to “stick” the dough together), it’s likely that the DNA is too. </p>
<p>So the second question is, does the DNA get destroyed during the baking process? A quick google search tells me that the internal temperature of bread rises to 190 degrees Fahrenheit, or about 88 degrees Celsius. Well, in the lab we will raise the temperature of DNA up to almost 100 degrees Celsius during a PCR reaction to denature (that is, separate the two helical strands from one another) without destroying the DNA (when you cool the DNA down, it’ll re-anneal back to the other strand, or to whatever strand you’re trying to make it anneal to). However, this is done inside buffers made to stabilise the DNA. <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3d07/6500cab553e7aab8cf09ea8f55b75da3c534.pdf" target="_blank">A quick google search</a> suggests that DNA degradation starts at around 130 degrees c in dry heat. Now, whenever I bake bread, I generally introduce some steam when I first place it in the oven, so it’s likely not terribly dry, nor will it be inside of a wet dough. However, that same paper suggests temperatures above 90 c in moist air will start degradation of DNA. And we said the internal temperature of the bread should be 88c when the bread is done. </p>
<p>In conclusion, I do believe we could isolate intact DNA from a loaf of bread, and that we could recover enough intact DNA to determine its origin. </p>

<p>If you want to trace it back to a specific strain of wheat, then you'll have to check if there are microsatellite &lt;300bp which can ID your target strain.edit: be mindful you will also get a large mixture from multiple plants and other organisms.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's assume you can grab the DNA 100% intact.</p>
<p>Unless the company was using very specific &quot;heirloom grains&quot; or &quot;ancient grains&quot; etc, you are probably just going to end up with a very boring mix of commercial heritage wheat varieties.</p>
<p>Wikipedia has a cool list of Canadian heritage wheat varieties:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Canadian_heritage_wheat_varieties" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Canadian\_heritage\_wheat\_varieties" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Canadian\_heritage\_wheat\_varieties</a></a> </p>
<p>I couldn't find any other lists, but I'm assuming that it's gonna be these kinds of lists from other parts of the world as well: relatively short lists of varieties, many man-made by big companies, that are then sold to farms who wanna do some wheat growin'.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add on about tracing flour back to the wheat, but from a non-DNA perspective, we can use stable isotopes to find the 'signature' of the area that the wheat was grown from.</p>
<p>Stable isotopes exist in almost every naturally occurring element, and exist in a very narrowly defined ratio. This ratio is altered through a process called fractionation that occurs during things like evaporation (where lighter stable isotopes are preferentially evaporated) and photosynthesis (where plants preferentially use different carbon stable isotopes to create sugars.</p>
<p>The end result of this is that a particular region will have a stable isotope signature which is a function of the climate, soil and geology. Plants growing in that region now will carry that signature, and we can compare the same signature from other plants to show where it came from.</p>
<p>The baking process will not change the stable isotope signature, although you would be limited to whatever elements would be found in bread (primarily carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen). Take the stable isotope signature from the bread, and compare to a database of wheat stable isotopes from around the world and find your match. Of course, it would get complicated in the flour is a mix of wheat from different locations, thereby giving a hybrid signature which would make it more complex to identify how much is grown from where.</p>
<p>I couldn't find a paper on the tracing of stable isotopes in bread, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19765966/" target="_blank">but here's an article where stable isotopes are used to determine origin of weed in the US.</a> Spoiler - a lot of US weed comes from Canad, and relatively little comes from Mexico. The vast majority is still grown within US borders.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
