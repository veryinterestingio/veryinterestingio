		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ancient cultures did have sunscreen. But it was all about dressing appropriately for the conditions: long sleeved shirts or robes of light fabric, hats with wide brims, long pants, robes, or skirts, gloves. </p>
<p>Also folks learned to take naps during the parts of the day that were the most UV intense, such as the siesta. </p>
<p>Here’s a neat article on it if you can get behind its paywall. <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/article-abstract/2471534" target="_blank">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/article-abstract/2471534</a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not really. This is exactly why middle eastern cultures wear robes and head coverings (originally), why hats used to be ubiquitous in the western world, etc etc. People used to cover up as much as possible to avoid it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s important to keep in mind that the distribution of melanin content in skin is historically directly linked to the amount of sunlight energy reaching any given place. In other words, people living near the equator, where sunlight is direct and powerful, often evolved to be darker than those who lived farther north, as a natural form of “sunscreen”. In fact, the main hypothesis for why people in the far north, like Scandinavia, tend to be really really white is that they lived in places where so little sun energy reached their skin that they needed to absorb more of it in order to make enough vitamin D, which our bodies produce when molecules in our skin react to sunlight.</p>
<p>ETA: By the way, this actually applies to more than just humans! Arabian horses have black skin, even if their coat is grey, in order to protect them from the harsh desert sunlight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m 72 and grew up in LA. My friends and I spent every summer day at the beach, without sunscreen and without hats. In fact we’d put Baby Oil on to accelerate burning. Occasionally someone would bring an umbrella, but it wasn’t “cool.” We’d make fun of them. </p>
<p>Smash cut to last year when I went in to my dermatologist to have some skin cancer cut off my ear. The waiting room was filled with people my age, all of them having cancer cut out from their nose, ear, forehead or elsewhere. </p>
<p>Use heavy sunscreen, kids.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
