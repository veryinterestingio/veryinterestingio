		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That &quot;fact&quot; is mostly a myth. Most cells have a specific limited lifetime, but there are cells which last your entire life.</p>
<p>Neurons are specifically cells that pretty much last your entire life and only get renewed in very few specific areas.</p>
<p>Red blood cells live a few months, sperm dies after a few days, skin cells live a few weeks. Saying that your entire body is replaced after seven years is vague and not really any sort of useful information.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The 7 years thing is a <em>general average</em> for the sorts of cells that do actually replace themselves. Different tissues in your body have vastly different rates of reproduction. For instance, the cells in your stomach lining replaces themselves as often as every <em>two days</em>. Skin cells last a few weeks at most. Your heart will replace about 1% of its cells every year for much of your life, but it slows down with age.</p>
<p>Neurons <strong>never</strong> regenerate, ever, in your entire life. By the time you are about 13, you have all of the neurons in your brain that you will ever have. After that, all reproduction stops and none of them will ever be replaced. <em>Glial</em> cells, which are nerve cells that coat and protect your neurons (and probably play a role in cognitive function) do reproduce, slowly, but it's the pattern of connections between your neurons that holds memories and thoughts.</p>
<p>New memories and thought patterns don't come from new neurons, but rather from new connections between them. The individual cells can extend new branches to form new connections, or allow branches to die off if they're unused. Additional cells nearby can form matching branches to reinforce a pattern. But the cells themselves stop reproducing.</p>
<p>That's what makes brain injuries so debilitating. There is no mechanism for damaged cells to be removed and lost cells to be replaced. Once they're gone, they are gone. There <em>may</em> probably be <em>some</em> mechanisms in the brain to generate new neurons in <em>certain</em> parts of the brain, probably. Certainly, people <em>do</em> recover from brain injuries. Usually in those cases surrounding neurons create new branches and new connections to replace the lost or damaged connections, rather than making entirely new neurons.</p>
<p>Edit for the pedants: yes it's possible that neurons do regenerate. I already acknowledged that possibility. Brains are complicated and poorly understood. <strong>If</strong> neurons regenerate, it's probably very slowly which still supports the general concept that memories aren't effected by cell regeneration because those cells aren't regenerating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>We don't really know how memory works. There have been experiments to test the memory of caterpillars before they metamorphose and turn into butterflies... memory seems to survive even though the caterpillars basically turn into a cocoon full of liquid goo before re-forming into a butterfly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
