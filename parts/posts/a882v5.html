<p>One such example of a person with big facial muscles is Matt Stonie. He’s a competitive eater so he has to utilize those muscles quite often. Thus his jaw is. Very developed compared to most people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Repetitive small work will bulk muscles until the muscle adapts to do that volume of work done.</p>
<p>The problem is that repetitive small work is not specific enough to increase the strength of that muscle for an appreciable length of time, because the load is too light. This means it's not efficient to build strength that way, making it harder to increase the total work done by increasing the load. Increasing the load in this case would be chewing tougher and tougher objects over time.</p>
<p>You could increase the total reps (chews) done, but you'd be getting even further from the specificity of building strength. A 1 rep max, a movement done at maximum effort and for which you can only lift it once before you are totally gassed, is the most specific to building strength. Walking 50 miles is very non specific to building strength and is more for building aerobic endurance in those for which that is an aerobic event.</p>
<p>Most people do not systematically increase the work done by their jaw over time by an appreciable amount. You can however, build jaw muscle by treating it just like any other muscle at the gym. The genetic potential of our jaws however is probably very small so they would not grow very much.</p>
<p>There is way more to unpack here, but they are the key points.</p>
<p>No increase in the total volume of work done = no increase in muscle mass. Poor genetic potential = small increase in muscle mass</p>
<p>If you increase the toughness of objects which you chew over a period of time, and chew them the same amount of times each time, you will build jaw muscles. This is the same premise as strength training in the gym. You could also increase the amount of chews slightly over time too, but not so much as to go too far away from a 'strength building' amount of chews. You'd be better off increasing the toughness if you could do more than say 20 chews at a time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
