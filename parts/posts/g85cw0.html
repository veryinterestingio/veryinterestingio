		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cost of recovery is extremely high. It's much cheaper to just leave it there and build a new one.</p>
<p>Planes usually disintegrate on impact, meaning that they are in thousands of pieces by the time they hit the bottom. Making salvaging them even more difficult.</p>
<p>The only reason we spend the money is to determine why the crash happened.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In August of 2000 the Russian submarine Kursk sank in 353 feet of water after a faulty weld in a torpedo set off a chain reaction of explosions while it was submerged. </p>
<p>All but the bow section was recovered at a cost of over $100 million. </p>
<p>Wrecked ships are rare, and occurring in shallow enough water is even more rare. </p>
<p>Planes are extremely fragile and are generally destroyed beyond repair on impact.</p>
<p>Edit to add - the Costa Concordia capsized after hitting rocks in shallow water in January 2012. It was mostly above water. That salvage operation cost roughly $1 billion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cost to recover dead passengers and crew from the Costa Concordia and salvage it was $1.85 billion. Many cruise ships cost as much as $1.3 billion, so that project was in the ballpark of cost. Oil tankers and freighters usually cost $40 million - $120 million. The insurance company usually decides to &quot;total&quot; the wreck much like insurance companies decide that the damage to repair a car would be more than its value. As a diver, I was asked to video a freighter in 250 feet of water that is broken in half, but the company still owns the ship and has to prevent environmental damage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
