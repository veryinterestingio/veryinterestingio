		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Waves are not current.  Waves are really just pulses of energy and can pass through each other.  They are mostly generated by wind.  They can reflect and refract like light.</p>
<p>In the middle of the ocean, most of the waves travel in the direction of the wind.  When the wind changes direction, the already generated waves will keep traveling in the same direction (and will eventually dissipate) and it will start generating waves in a different direction.  As a result, the open ocean has sets of waves traveling in several directions.  Form the perspective of a small boat, there will be a main swell and then &quot;under&quot; it, you can usually notice secondary swells traveling in different directions.</p>
<p>Waves go slower in shallower water.  Like light entering a lens, this causes the waves to turn towards shore.  As a result, any waves traveling at an angle towards the beach will get steered straight towards it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Giant waves in between. They are harder to notice because the whole ocean is moving/they are more underwater.</p>
<p>Imagine the earth is a cup of water, and if you move it around, the water goes from one side to the other, you don't really notice the peak of the water moving in the middle but you do when it hits the sides.</p>
<p>Now imagine the cup is a ball (Earth) instead and gravity is holding the water in at all angles, give it a spin and that's what we got.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are waves in the middle.</p>
<p>Waves &quot;come in&quot; because the water is getting shallower as you get close to the beach/coast.  In the middle, they just go up and down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of all the waves are cause by wind. The friction between the wind and the water causes waves to form. You can verify this by blowing over a pan of water. Especcially in open water, waves can build up energy, becoming very long in wavelength and high in amplitude. Near shores it gets less deep, this forces the waves to become of shorter wavelength and slower. Because of this, the waves always turn towards the shores, and not in the original wind direction. </p>
<p>Also, I am surprised by the amount of bad answers i read in this thread. Many people apparently overestimate their knowledge on this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
