<p>Like when it strikes a pool apparently people can get electrocuted if they’re in the pool, does the same thing happen in the ocean? Would the nearby fish die? How far away from the impact of the lightning do you have to be to get affected by the electricity?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lightning does strike the ocean, but less often than the same area of land. <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/files/science-pink/s3fs-public/styles/large/public/mnt/medialibrary/2001/12/02/ast05dec_1_resources/lightningmap_med.gif?itok=bCKlrs5M" target="_blank">Strikes per km^2 per year</a>.</p>
<p>Lightning is most likely to <a href="http://sciencenetlinks.com/science-news/science-updates/zapping-fish/" target="_blank">disperse across the surface of a body of water</a> because that is where the charge has built up to induce the strike, and ocean water will conduct electricity even better than water in a pool. Since the charge will travel the path of least resistance, it would tend to travel more through the water than through skin or scales. There would likely be less danger to a fish in the ocean near a lightning strike than to you at the same distance in a pool. Though I'd wager you'd be at less risk than a fish on the surface of the water at the same distance (assuming your head didn't become the target of the strike) due to how they breathe.</p>
<p>Since you can't say exactly what path the discharge will take, there's no precise falloff, but the estimates I've seen are in the range of 5-50 meters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, lightning does strike the ocean, but relatively rarely (per unit area). There's essentially 2 things to consider here. </p>
<p>1) When lightning strikes water (or the ground) there is a build up of charge at the surface that precedes the strike, it isn't nearly as sudden as most people think. In something conductive like sea water, in which charges are freely mobile, the charge build up happens right at the surface and ultimately the lightning doesn't penetrate very deep below the surface.</p>
<p>2) Sea water is much more conductive than you (or fish). That means a relatively small proportion of the current will flow through you. If lightning hits right next to you, it could still kill you, but you are safer submerged in the water than you would be sitting in contact with the hull of a boat nearby.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since most thunderstorms actually happen in the ocean, it is the most common impact point. Generally, during storms, fish and other marine animals dive deeper to avoid the strong waves and currents of the surface. The electricity of the lighting strike splits uniformally in the water in the form of a growing half sphere. Just like with any kind of wave in a medium, the intensity lowers proportionally to the distance of the point of impact, in this case, 3 dimensions, so proportionally to the cube. Fish would have to be considerably near to the impact point to receive a shock high enough to damage them. Considering on storms they are usually lower, they feel nothing or a tickle. </p>
<p>There's also other reasons like salt water being more conductive than fish themselves but thats kind of it.</p>
<p>Edit: </p>
<p>As comented bellow (ty for pointing it out) the intensity would lower proportionally to the area of the sphere, not the volume, so it would be to the square, not the cube.</p>
<p>It was also pointed out that electrical current tends to expread in greater part through the surface of the conductor, aka the ocean, so the impact lower would be even more insignificant.</p>
<p>As pointed out by another user and after a little research, it does seen like despite there being more thunderstorn in the ocean, lighting striking the seas are considerably rare.</p>
<p>Thank you redditors for your corrections and i apologoze for my disinformation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
