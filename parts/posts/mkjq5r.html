		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a certain amount of rubber in the balloon. The bigger the balloon becomes, the more the rubber is stretched, which means more force needed to inflate.</p>
<p>However, the bigger the balloon gets, the thinner the rubber gets, which makes the &quot;stretching force&quot; less!. This not only cancels out the original stretch force, but since the surface area is dependent on the square of the radius, this actually beats the linear relationship of the rubber stretching, thus making it easier to blow an inflated balloon than an uninflated one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a matter of surface area to volume ratio. When you start, adding a breath's worth of air has to stretch the balloon a lot, but near the end, a single breath only stretches it a little.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you start blowing up the baloon, the rubber its made of is stiff and thick (compared to what happens next). When you blow air into it, you can feel that it quickly stretches a lot, and then it gets easier to blow it up completely. That is also why its much easier to blow up a baloon which was once filled with air and deflated.</p>
<p>Kind of like with tight pants. You struggle to get them on because fabric is new. Once you wear them for even few minutes, they become easier to put on again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
