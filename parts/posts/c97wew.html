		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All the information I found, I found on Google, but it's concise and pretty clear. Here's what I found:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It all has to do with the refractory period</p>
<ul>
<li>There are three stages in the male orgasm:</li>
</ul>
<p>Phase one is the excitement phase — the part where your nipples will get hard, things like that. This is followed by the “plateau phase,” where there’s a sustained level of arousal that ends in ejaculation. Finally, there’s the third stage, the refractory period, which is when men generally become flaccid — and stay flaccid, despite their most frantic efforts to the contrary.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Women don’t necessarily follow this path, and are able to repeat the second phase again and again in what we generally think of as multiple orgasms.</p>
<p>&quot; Once the ejaculate leaves the body, the penis is telling the brain that it no longer needs that blood supply,” explains Muhammad Mirza, a specialist in male reproductive health. Since the neurotransmitters in your brain don’t register that you’d actually like to keep going, it redistributes the blood that was previously keeping you hard. In order to regenerate, the arousal process needs to start all over again. In younger men, this may be a matter of mere minutes, while further into adulthood, the average is more like 30 minutes. In older people, it can take up to 24 hours. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nobody has stated the technical answer yet. </p>
<p>Prolactin.</p>
<p>This is the chemical on the flip side of the dopamine coin.</p>
<p>Dopamine is often associated with pleasure(location+receptors type in the brain determines it's function), but it has a bigger role: motivation. Dopamine increases the 'wanting' of something. Food, sex, movement, etc.</p>
<p>Prolactin serves as the brakes. Once you ejaculate, prolactin is released and you no longer want it as much (in this case, sex. You might want food, which is controlled by dopamine in other parts of the brain along with other complex hormonal systems).</p>
<p>There are theories as to why men and women differ in the dopaminergic/prolactin response.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
