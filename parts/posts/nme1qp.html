		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m wondering about this because a common criticism of gay relationships is that men and women are complementary, but same-sex couples are not. However, it seems to me like sex is probably not a great predictor of complementarity. As far as personality goes, as long as there is significant overlap between the distribution of personalities for the sexes, it should be feasible to find complementary pairs both for homosexual and heterosexual couples.</p>
<p>What I’m looking for is data that shows how much overlap there is between personalities for the sexes. Any related research would also be interesting :)</p>
<p>Thank you!</p></div></div>

<p>TLDR they are largely overlapping curves. Men and women are more alike than different with the extreme ends of the distribution leaning heavily to one gender or another.
Example, most men and women can average out to similar levels of disagreeable-ness, but take the most disagreeable person out of 1000 and it’s a man every time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
