		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Becuase there are fewer birds that side. Quite seriously, that's all there is too it. Birds flying in a V do so becuase those not at the tip get a substantial benefit of drafting off the lead bird. They swap around regularly as the one at the front has to work much harder but after that it's pretty much of a muchness as to any other position in the group so it really doesn't amtter if there's 3 on one side and 13 on the other, everyone except the lead is getting a fairly simialr benefit. So they'll distribute more or less at random and that means that it'll be fairly even most of the time but a bit lopsided on occasion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
