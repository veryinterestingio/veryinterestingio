<ol>
<li>The mirror would be blue, as it reflects the color from the sky</li>
<li>The mirror would be black as it reflects the &quot;color&quot; from outer space</li>
<li>The mirror would be white as the Rayleigh scattering from the atmosohere gets canceled</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit 1: Thanks for your answers. My conclusion of this would be, that the image of the mirror would be blue (if there is no sun in the frame)</p>
<p>Edit 2: Changed Refraction to  Rayleigh scattering </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work for the Landsat program, and I can show you this!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In the Novosibirsk region of Siberia, there is a gigantic greenhouse where they are able to grow vegetables all year round.  The roof of that greenhouse is essentially a big mirror.  Most of the year it just reflects the sky and appears somewhat dark.  But during part of the year, the roof of that greenhouse reflects sunlight directly into the satellite's sensor.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/keeping-cal/" target="_blank">This page has a small image of the greenhouse in various bands</a> (the satellite sees red, green, blue, and several infrared bands).  There's a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/7/2/2208/pdf" target="_blank">better picture on page 19 of this journal article (PDF) (I'm a co-author)</a>, if you want to take a look there.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>What happens is that the pixel appears very bright.  But all sensors have a limit on how much brightness they can image.  Most satellites will drive into saturation (full bright with no variance) and then oversaturation (the detectors fail and go dark temporarily, or roll over in integer space).  The detectors normally recover after this; sometimes recovery takes a short period of time.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So the answer to your question is #1 -- the color of the sky is reflected, and sometimes that color is dark blue (space with some refraction) but sometimes it's bright white when it looks at the sun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That depends. If you look directly at the sun in the mirror, it would look red. </p>
<p>The sky is blue, because the blue components are scattered in the atmosphere stronger than the red ones.</p>
<p>If the light travels a long way through the atmosphere, fewer/no blue components are left in the &quot;original&quot; light ray coming directly from the sun. For that reason, sunrises and sunsets are red. The sun rays are propagating tangential to the ground and cover more distance through atmosphere. </p>
<p>A mirror would cause the sunlight to pass the atmosphere twice. So the idealized reflection should show a red sun, as the problem is equivalent to a sunset.</p>
<p>The tone of red may be different, but the underlaying principle is the same.</p>
<p>Edit: If you just look at the scattered light, i would still use the same argument as before. The mirror shows you, how the light looks like after passing the atmosphere twice. So again, it would probably look like the sky at close to the horizon. </p>
<p>As we know, the light scattered away fron the sun ray is blue. So the only light reaching the mirror is blue. This light gets reflected and passes the atmosphere again. </p>
<p>On the way back, as to the way down, not all of the light is scattered. So the remaining light is blue, but less bright than on the ground. It would probably be hard to see in practice using only scattered light.</p>
<p>Edit2: About the scattered part i am not sure, how the Ozone layer comes to effect, as it filters UV rays it also may filter blue slightly. </p>
<p>Edit3: Thanks for the silver, i am glad i could help.</p>
<p>Edit4: The sun would probably still look yellow. As some of you pointed out the atmosphere is not as thick as it would need to be to make the sun look red enough to see it with the bare eye. But it would probably be measurable using a spectrometer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what surrounds the mirror to some extent.</p>
<p>With so much atmosphere and resulting multiple scattering of light, you would generally see an average of the strongest signal - the colour of the sky.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The answer may be different in the mirror is surrounded by objects such as trees, buildings or light sources which could impart colour due to reflected and scattered light from them.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>A similar situation to second point is a major consideration at larger scales for earth observation satellites as signals can be mixed by edge effects (if you consider the mirror as a pixel viewed by a sensor).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>e.g. a satellite looking for phytoplankton blooms in coastal waters can get scattered light from vegetation on nearby coasts and using simple band-ratio algorithms, we might overestimate chlorophyll concentration, or miss some fine structure in the bloom (signal to noise)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
