		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/gas-exchange" target="_blank">On average, about 0.3L of O2 is taken up by the lungs each minute</a>. Assuming the average ventilation rate of <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/10881-vital-signs" target="_blank">16 breaths per minute</a> (the article says 12-20 so I took the mean value), that means each breath will take up 0.01875 L of O2. Under one atmosphere of pressure and at room temperature, this means about 4.69E20 molecules of oxygen will enter your bloodstream in one breath (ideal gas law calculation). </p>
<p>Now, the average human has about 5.5L of blood in their body, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK54103/" target="_blank">which means there's about 1.1L of O2 in the blood stream at any given time</a>. Again using the ideal gas law, this time pressure = 880mmhg (average human blood pressure) and temperature = body temperature, we get a total of 3.01E22 total molecules of oxygen in the blood stream. Therefore, (4.69E20/3.01E22)*100% = the total percentage of blood oxygen turnover with each breath. This happens to be around 1.56%. </p>
<p>As you can see, there are a lot of factors that went into this calculation, and mostly I used population averages to get these numbers. As you can imagine, a higher blood volume to lung capacity ratio would cause a decrease in the total percentage of blood oxygenated with one breath. I'm not sure exactly what would cause these kinds of conditions, but this number will certainly vary from person to person quite a bit!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
