		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In banking, a clearing house can be thought of as the bank's bank.</p>
<p>If someone with an account at bank A writes you a check and you deposit the check at your bank B, bank B gets the money for the check from the clearing house and the clearing house gets the money to deposit in bank B from bank A. </p>
<p>So a bank gets checks from many, many banks but only has to submit them to one clearing house for payment.  </p>
<p>The hold on a check deposit is to give this process time to complete.</p>
<p>In the US, clearing houses are run by the Feds.  I think there are about 5 Fed clearing houses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dtc.asp" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dtc.asp" target="_blank">https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dtc.asp</a></a></p>
<p>The entire site is a good resource for questions regarding investing and how things work. Basically a clearing house is a central location that keeps electronic records of who owns what shares. The broker maintains your account but every time you make a transaction, the  transaction will be routed through the clearing house who then becomes like the central authority of &quot;certifying&quot; that a transaction took place. This is necessary because there are so many transactions taking place across so many brokers, banks and financial institutions. So these companies register with this central clearing house to keep track of everything. </p>
<p>Grossly simplified example: say you went to broker A with $100 and request to buy stock S. This sale is completed but the seller uses broker B. You might think that your $100 goes from broker A to broker B and broker B transfers the shares to broker A who registers the shares under your name. That isn't how it actually happens because if things go wrong, broker A and B's records might differ (broker B claims they didn't receive the funds or broker A claims not to have received the shares). So this central clearing house manages the ownership transfer and payment claims as a neutral third party to minimize disputes. Essentially the clearing house is the &quot;master record keeper&quot; and your brokerage account should be a reflection of the records within the clearing house.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of them kind of a like a toy store my 5 year old friend. Lets say you want the newest officially licensed Star Wars Darth Vader figure. Now you can't just write a letter to Disney that reads &quot;Gib Vader plz&quot; with your allowance stuffed in the envelope. Your Vader toy is probably made and packaged in India or China so someone else has to bring it to your county, then to your area. Since Disney mostly makes TV shows and movies they don't really want to do that. So they rely on toy stores to receive your toys, unpackage them, and display them so people like you can buy them. While the toy IS a Disney toy that you got from Disney Corp., you had to go through a toy store to actually get your hands on it. </p>
<p>The same thing is true for their stocks. You are very much buying real stock in Disney when you purchase it but it's probably not part of what's called an &quot;initial offering&quot; which is when the stock is brand new. Instead, it's stock that's been traded already and it might be owned by someone in your neighborhood or someone very far away. Rather than buy it directly from that person (because it would take a very long time to find and negotiate with them), you tell your broker (your parents) you want Disney stock (your vader toy). They in turn use a clearinghouse (the toy store) to get the stock from a seller (Disney).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Letâ€™s suppose that you are in a market for orange juice futures contracts. You want to procure 1000 gallons of OJ from the manufacturer. Such contracts bears certain risk to both parties - for you that the manufacturer will not be able to deliver the juice, for the manufacturer that you will not have enough cash to pay for the OJ on the delivery date. So exchanges figured out that it would be easier to have this risk mitigated by a heavily-regulated third party. So clearing house serves as a regulator, who controls the risk associated with the transaction, ensures that both parties deliver on their contract obligations and helps to make derivative market more stable, predictable and reliable</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would add that in banking the clearing house is run by the government. However, when you are talking about stocks there are several, and they are private for profit corporations.  The DTCC being the largest, who handles 95%+ of all stock trades.  AFAIK.</p>
<p>Someone who has better knowledge of the industry feel free to correct me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
