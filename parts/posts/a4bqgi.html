		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe. This isn't really tested but our understanding of what causes noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) suggests that it could happen for high-level infrasound.</p>
<p>The stereocilia that translate fluid motion to mechanical motion (which is then translated to signals in the auditory nerve down the line) in our inner ears still move with low frequencies, though not as efficiently. We know that people are affected by infrasound, even though they can't perceive it. So it stands to reason that excessive excitation of stereocilia by infrasound can damage them the same way that excitation by audible frequencies can.</p>
<p>But this is really hard to test. Useful NIHL studies take decades to conduct because that's just the nature of the phenomenon. We have workplace NIHL data that go back decades and include measurements of exposure to noise in the audible range but, as far as I know, nothing like that for infrasound.</p>
<p>And interesting side note is that hearing loss tends to happen in the same frequencies, regardless of the frequencies of sound energy that caused it. The reason for this isn't well understood but it's thought that it could be because the stereocilia responsible for interpreting sound in the frequencies that are usually lost with NIHL are located in the first major bend in the cochlea. So very loud at 20 Hz might cause people to lose hearing at 4 kHz because that 20 Hz fluid motion is going around the corner there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well at that point it becomes a question about air pressure rather than sound.Well, sound is air pressure and vice versa, but really really low frequency sound, would basically equal to getting hit with an air wave 5,10 or 15 times a second. If the pressure of the airwave is big enough, well it could rip your body apart.</p>
<p>imagine the classic experiment with hitting a note that breaks glass. Well, that glass breaks because you hit its resonant frequency. but it breaks because the air around it is moving because of air pressure/sound waves</p>
<p>Also, a speaker works by having a cone that pops in and out according to data it is fed. it is this moving in and out that creates sound, because it moves air around.  now imagine a giant giant giant speaker, moving really slowly. you would get with airwaves/pressure that could do some crazy stuff. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The real answer is that this is still an active research question, but LF sounds most likely do not damage hearing considerably. Sound waves are measured in hertz and the lowest audible sound wave is around 20 hertz. The audible hearing range is 20-20000hz. &quot;Loudness&quot; is a subjective measure of sound experienced by human beings. The intensity (amplitude, more specifically pressure amplitude) and frequency are what are responsible for the energy of a sound wave. Since we have a low frequency, the sound would have to have a very large amplitude to carry a high amount of energy. Loud low frequency sounds would be felt as vibrations by the body since lower frequency sounds are harder to absorb by materials (walls, etc), but as far as we know, dont affect the inner ear. </p>
<p>A high intensity sound with a high frequency like a jet engine, however, does cause significant hearing loss even with hearing protection through bone conduction. This is why there are special helmets designed to prevent the sounds from traveling through the skull and impacting hearing loss that way. This is also why hearing protection does not reduce sound after a certain threshold, even with ear plugs and muffs combined, etc. </p>
<p>Note: there is an interesting phenomenon called 'Otoacoustic emission' which is basically a healthy ear emitting spontaneous faint sounds and there was a recent study done on LF sound showing changes to that mechanism, however we are not fully certain yet if it affects hearing loss to any extent. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, obviously, but only at amplitudes so great that... you would feel (literally) the vibrations in the air and suffer incredible headaches at far lower amplitudes than would be required to destroy your hearing. Technically speaking, you would experience pain and whatnot of various kinds below destructive amplitudes no matter what the pitch/frequency, but at the lower ranges the required amplitudes will themselves require greater wattage to produce.</p>
<p>My area of study was electrical, and I think someone who studied acoustics would be able to better answer this question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
