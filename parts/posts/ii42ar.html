<li>Africa is not completely free of polio. It is free of the <em>wild</em> version of polio. There are two vaccine-derived versions that are still around. They are not as bad as the wild one but it would still be nice to get rid of them.</li>
<li>Afghanistan and Pakistan continue to have wild cases - but they are in Asia, not in Africa.</li>
</ul>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In relation to the questions about vaccine derived virus and the replies, it is worth pointing out that the polio virus is spread  by fecal-oral transmission or when infected shit enters the body via the mouth.</p>
<p>Thus the mention of poor sanitation, no flushing toilets and no water for washing. Thus from dirty hands to mouth, either directly or via food or drinks contaminated during preparation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wild type (not vaccine derived) polio virus has been found in sewage in some countries. This means wild type virus is infecting and replicating in people. There are no reported cases of poliomyelitis in said countries because everyone is immunized with IPV, the inactivated vaccine. IPV is injected, and it has been shown to provide poor gut immunity. This means the virus can get into the gut and replicate there, but it won't pass into the brain to cause paralysis. OPV is a live attenuated vaccine which is given by mouth, it is what causes vaccine derived poliomyelitis, and also great gut immunity.</p>
<p>IPV is used in most developed countries, others use only OPV, and some do both. I believe USA is IPV only. To my knowledge as of 2016 (when I was still working with polio), there have been no extensive studies of sewage for WT polio in the USA. All to say, there is a chance wild type poliovirus can start causing poliomyelitis in unvaccinated people because the wild type virus is still around and NOT eradicated.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of politics going on here in CDC and WHO, remember there was a lot of money spent by many countries in hopes of eradicating the virus, a lot of promises. </p>
