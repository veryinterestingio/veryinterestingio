		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The prostate is a spongy organ that sits just under the bladder and wraps around the urethra at a point where the ejactulatory ducts from the testicles and seminal vesicles (where sperm and seminal fluid are made/stored) join up. </p>
<p>It's made up of glands that produce fluid that also contribute to semen. It contracts during ejaculation, closing off the short bladder urethra and expelling the semen towards the penis.</p>
<p>Basically, the prostate is where the sperm and fluids are all combined together to make semen and then moved to the urethra where it will be blasted out by muscular contractions. </p>
<p>Why does it give pleasure?</p>
<p>Because like a lot of organs in our body, it's supplied by nerves. If you poke the prostate it'll send signals to our brain which can be perceived as pleasurable and it will also result in contraction of prostate (squeezing) which can also be perceived as pleasurable because it's a part of the ejaculation process. It's a highly sensitive area with a lot of nerves, lots of stimulation in the area is going to feel really good and lead to orgasm.</p>
<p>TLDR: the Prostate helps with making jizz. It also contracts when jizzing. If you get to the prostate and play with it enough that it starts contracting on it's own, it'll feel like you're jizzing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The prostate gland makes fluid that feeds the sperm. At the right time, the prostate squeezes the fluid and sperm out into the woman.  To make the timing right, nerves that feed the orgasmic response are connected to the prostate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
