		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you’re referring to is an allograft. The skin would stay the same color as the donor. Freckles don’t move around; melanocytes in grafted skin behave similarly. </p>
<p>There are a few different types of skin grafts you can get. It depends on several factors, including surface area to be covered, thickness and texture, and hair growth. Autografts are when thin strips of epidermis are harvested from an unaffected part of the patient’s body, usually the back or thigh, and reattached over the graft area.  Xenografts are when another animal’s skin is used, typically porcine, and allografts are irradiated cadaver skin. You don’t have to deal with immune suppression in that case because many of the things the immune system would target are destroyed in the prep process. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I've also heard it explained as a failed transplant attempt or simply a gangrenous leg that is black due to disease. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>I’ve had grafts from my own body, animal grafts (from memory I think it was from a pig) and also had my skin taken and grown in a lab and then grafted, which they termed “cultured skin.”</p>
<p>I might be having another graft down the track where the surgeon wants to use skin donated from a dead body. He explained it as it’s all “cleaned” so there’s no DNA to create rejection. </p>
<p>If I get it done might end up having a graft of each type ?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
