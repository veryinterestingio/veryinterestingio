		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. Firstly, it has to be agreed upon. You can't just say it and expect it to happen (See Elon Musk's &quot;pedo guy&quot; email for an example). Secondly, if you do make an agreement and the reporter goes back on their agreement, there are no legal repercussions, but it's what's professionally known as a &quot;dick move&quot; and will ruin their reputation</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Long time radio journalist here (yes: we still exist) who rarely if ever agrees to go off the record. It makes you part of their conspiracy to withhold information from the public and you can end up dealing with gossip instead of facts with no accountability or attribution. </p>
<p>From a practical standpoint, going off the record doesn’t really shield the source. The people involved can usually figure out who is leaking. </p>
<p>One more thing. A source cannot simply announce something is off the record and then spill the beans. The reporter has to agree to go off the record. Can’t tell you how many times I’ve had to explain that to politicians. Even had one try it in the middle of a one-on-one interview while I was holding the microphone up to his mouth. When he announced after the fact that his last answer was “off the record,” I assured him it was not and when the story aired, he accused me of recording him out of context.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not directly. But powerful people often want to guide media people towards particular pieces of information that they don't want to be quoted on and want to maintain good relationships with the press, and the press benefits by getting information they couldn't get in a quote. So neither party wants to break that agreement, because it's beneficial to both.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My mom and dad were reporters for a local paper. They both tried to do decent stories for a small town.  It was mostly silly stories but sometimes it was big ones locally.  Government corruption, pollution issues, economic development scams, things like that.  Even small towns can have big stories for the region.</p>
<p>Off the record is not off the record.  It's &quot;A little bird told me&quot; kind of stuff where you conceal the source and the details so that they can't be identified.  Then you get corroborative information so that the original snitch can't be found from your story.</p>
<p>You code your notes so that only you know whom you spoke to.  </p>
<p>To sum up:  It's not off the record, but the reporter will conceal your identity and will not identify you unless you intend to commit a crime or are a really bad person.  You have to be really, really bad for a reporter to say who you are.  You always protect your sources.  No one likes a snitch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's not binding, but if you go on the record after saying that good luck getting that person to talk to you again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
