		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I tried to google for a bit and learned that we know what the inside of earth is made up by analyzing earthquake data (still not 100% sure how it works but I got the idea).
But I could not find out how we know for example that the moon core is supposed to be liquid or even what further planets &quot;contain&quot; under their surface?
Also how do we know what the temperatures inside the sun or other planets/stars cores are?
Thanks a lot.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Outside of earthquakes, there are several ways the core lets us know it's there:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Magnetic fields</strong>: in order to form a magnetic field, something liquid needs to be conducting electricity, and there needs to be sufficient convection from the deep, hot interior to the cooler exterior. The shape of the magnetic field can also tell us where it's being generated (the center vs. in a shallow shell), and the strength can tell us how big it is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gravitational fields</strong>: the less dense the core, the more flattened it will be. The amount of flattening will affect orbiting satellites by altering their trajectory. The larger the core, the greater the range the core has to affect trajectories. By carefully watching a satellite orbit, we can determine the core's density and size. This is in fact one of the primary science goals of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(spacecraft\)#Scientific_objectives" target="_blank">Juno spacecraft</a> currently orbiting Jupiter.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Overall density</strong>: based on the whole planet's mass and size, the Earth's overall average density is 5.5 g/cm^(3). However, almost all of the surface is rock (density: 3 g/cm^(3))...that tells us there must be also something a lot denser (e.g. iron, density: 8 g/cm^3) at the center to average out to 5.5 g/cm^(3).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> to add: The above are actual observations, but those are are also backed up with a lot of theory from solid state / materials science on paper, in simulations, and in the lab.</p>
<p>For instance, Jupiter's magnetic field is <a href="https://i.imgur.com/kPVIFTk.jpg" target="_blank">absolutely enormous</a>, so we know there must be a ton of electrically-conducting fluid there...but its density is barely higher than water, suggesting it's almost all hydrogen and nothing like iron. Quantum theory comes to the rescue here, pointing out that at the pressures and temperatures expected in Jupiter's mantle, hydrogen becomes a lightweight liquid metal. This was the proposed hypothesis on paper in 1935, one that was strongly verified in the past couple decades by actually making metallic hydrogen in the lab.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

We have put seismographs on the moon. “The instruments placed by the Apollo 12, 14, 15, and 16 missions were functional until they were switched off in 1977.” And we intentionally crashed rockets into the moon to cause known impact events to collect data. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_seismology" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_seismology</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally by the electromagnetic fields they create, we can tell if its a liquid metal core or something else.</p>
<p>We also know gas giant structure, because of physics.</p>
<p>Outside of that, its all about the class of planet, its rotation, the angle it sits on its axis and the distance from the star its around. Rocky planets will have liquid metal cores, gas giants will have a small rocky core, and a suns core is where fusion happens, by the radiation released we can approximate core temps</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
