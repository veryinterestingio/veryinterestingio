		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 113 known cannabinoids.  Many have some effect or another on appetite, but those effects vary greatly.</p>
<p>THC, the most well-known cannabinoid (mostly for creating the 'high'), seems to have the greatest impact on appetite according to current research.  THC is often found in small amounts in CBD oil (up to .3% is legal federally).</p>
<p>THC affects appetite in 3 ways.  First, it boosts a hormone called 'ghrelin', which makes you feel hungry.  Normally, the body only releases ghrelin when your stomach is empty.</p>
<p>Second, THC can interact with CB1 receptors in areas of the brain that modulate appetite (I think these interactions can actually boost or suppress appetite, depending on circumstance).</p>
<p>Third, THC can boost dopamine and our senses of smell and taste, all of which help us get more pleasure from eating.</p>
<p>TLDR ; CBD itself doesn't cause the munchies.  However, it does quell nausea and pain.  For people who struggle to eat enough because of pain or nausea, CBD could help.</p>
<p>If you're concerned about over-eating as a result of taking CBD oil, you shouldn't have any issues.  Just consider using one of the totally THC free products, rather than one with .3%, to be safe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
