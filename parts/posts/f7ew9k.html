		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spacecraft are able to determine their position and orientation through a combination of on board sensors (like star sensors) and off board trackers (like radar). Beyond that, it is typical to describe their position and velocity as an orbit. These orbits can be described using a few variables that indicate the size, orientation, and direction of the orbit. These are called &quot;Keplerian Elements.&quot; </p>
<p>So, for example if you wanted to convey information about a satellite above the Earth, you wouldn't say &quot;It's 500Km above the ground, moving 7km/s in the Northwest direction&quot; but you could say, &quot;The satellite's orbit has a semimajor axis of 6800km, with an eccentricity of .01, inclination of 23 degrees...&quot;</p>
<p>Of course, there are other ways of keeping track of and describing these, but that's one of the most basic ways.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually work in the space industry, so I feel qualified to answer this. As other commenters have alluded to, there are two parts to this question: reference frame and navigation.
In science and engineering, when describing motion you need a base coordinate frame. To start, you need a fixed reference point and direction to base the coordinate frame on. The typical reference is the vernal equinox, which is an imaginary line pointing towards a distant star called Vega. For our purposes, the position of Vega is fixed, so it makes a good reference. From there we can build our axes, but this will depend on the physics involved.</p>
<p>For a low-earth orbit spacecraft we use the Earth-Centered Inertial frame (ECI), which has an origin at the center of the earth, x axis pointed towards vernal equinox, z-axis pointed through the north pole, and y axis perpendicular to both x and z.</p>
<p>A base reference frame should be &quot;inertial,&quot; or non-rotating and non-accelerating, in order to make the physics work out. For an interplanetary spacecraft, the ECI frame is NOT inertial, because it is fixed on the earth which is accelerating around the sun. In this case we define a different frame: sun-centered. In this case the origin is at the center of the sun, X-axis pointed towards vernal equinox, z axis perpendicular to the ecliptic (plane that Earth's orbit makes around the sun), and y axis perpendicular to X and Z.</p>
<p>Now, for navigation: we use devices called Inertial Measuring Units, or IMUs, to constantly measure acceleration and rotation. Think of them as fancy accelerometers and gyroscopes like you have in your phone. If we know where we start, and we keep track of all the accelerations, we can figure out where we end up. The previously described reference frames give us the language to describe this (in terms of X, Y, and Z coordinates). We can improve knowledge of our position with dead reckoning, where we CHECK our distance and speed with radar measurements. If we send a signal to a spacecraft and it takes 20 minutes for that signal to get back to us, then by knowing the speed of light we can say exactly how far it has travelled, which makes the estimate we got from the IMU more accurate.</p>
<p>EDIT: I think forget what I said about Vega. The X axis is defined by the mean vernal equinox, which is when the southern and Northern hemispheres receive the same amount of light (around March 21st). At this point, you can draw a straight line from the sun though the center of the earth and that line will intersect Earth's equator. Because of this, it is by definition perpendicular to the north pole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Easy, the enemy's gate is &quot;down&quot;. I'm not a space engineer of any sort, but I can at least talk about the math that's helpful here (linear algebra).</p>
<p>When you are walking around, you can talk about how things are <em>in front/behind</em> of you, <em>to the (right/left) side</em> of you, or <em>above/below</em> you. If you want to be clever, you can mix the descriptions too: &quot;enemy ship at 2 o'clock!&quot; means something is mostly to your right, but also a bit in front of you.</p>
<p>When you're talking to someone else that isn't facing the same direction, you can't just use the forward/right descriptions anymore, so you have to pick something both of you understand. A nice one is to align to the Earth with North/East/South/West. Or, if you know what direction they're facing, you may choose to use their perspective instead (&quot;turn right on Maple, then turn left on Jefferson...&quot;).</p>
<p>To give directions, you only need to define the three basic directions &quot;up&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, and &quot;forward&quot; and go from there. The third can be derived from the first two, so really you just need  two of them. Usually you use some sort of reference point(s), maybe a star or a planet or your own spaceship, whatever.</p>
<p>ELI25 note: a set of <em>n</em> directions for an n-dimensional coordinate space is called a <em>basis</em> space, and requires <em>n</em> orthogonal vectors. Converting from one basis to another is very easy with linear algebra. With as few as three points that aren't all on the same line (e.g., center of the sun, North Pole of the sun, some other star) you can create a full basis because of the neat property that the cross product of two vectors is always orthogonal to both input vectors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
