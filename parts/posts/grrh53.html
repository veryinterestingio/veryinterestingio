<p>There are a lot of diseases and deficiencies that can display symptoms in your fingernails but if you had something like that it would most likely be expressing it in all your nail beds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this question!  I have the exact same symptoms in my right thumb nail, no other nails are impacted. I closed my thumb in my car door and I kept my gel nails on for way to long after the injury trying to save my nail. It didn’t work and ultimately had to remove the gel and my nail tech ended up cutting my nail basically to the cuticle as it was completely separated from the bed. Fast forward to today and my nail still hadn’t recovered and I’m experiencing the same issue as you’re describing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can think of the nail as a modified hair shaft. Deep at the base there is a &quot;root.&quot; When this root gets damaged by trauma, picking, infections, etc., it is no longer able to produce perfectly symmetrical and smooth nails.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>There are quite a few systemic conditions that can manifest in your nails. </p>
<p>If worried worth getting seen by your doctor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
