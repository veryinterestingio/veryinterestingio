		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of it is genetic. The antlers is designed to fork more as the deer ages. But it is also based on how much stored up energy the deer have. The bigger the deer the bigger their antlers will be regardless of how many forks they have.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, the antlers wouldn't be able to grow as the deer ages if they <em>didn't</em> shed them.  Growing antlers are covered with a thin layer of tissue called velvet.  The antlers themselves are bone, and like all bone are created by cells which have to be inside the body to function.  Velvet provides nutrition and bloodflow to the cells growing the antlers.  </p>
<p>But of course, all that fragile velvet couldn't withstand the combat that antlers are used for.  So it is lost when the antlers mature, leaving only dead bone.  The problem is, dead bone can't grow.  So a deer that didn't shed and replace antlers would be stuck with the same ones it had in the first season.</p>
<p>Antlers really are incredibly <em>weird</em> when you think about it.</p>
<p>Anyway, getting stuck with your original antlers would be  a problem because, as you note, antlers get larger as a deer ages.  And big antlers let deer get more mates.  So being stuck with your first set is bad.</p>
<p>But to get back around to your actual question, deer antlers are really expensive to grow.  They are the fastest growing bone in any mammal, and they require lots of calories and <em>loads</em> of calcium.  On top of that they are pretty heavy.  So small deer just don't have the capacity to produce big antlers. As they get older and larger and have bigger reserves of energy and calcium, they can support larger antlers.  More resources means antlers can grow faster during the growing season meaning they wind up being larger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually read about this a few days ago! Deer antlers usually first come out after a year, and they're pretty small since a lot of the calcium goes towards bone growth. As the deer gets older and matures (around 5-7 years) they'll need less and less calcium for bone growth and more of it is used for growing antlers. After the 7 year mark is when they start getting those giant antlers. That being said the maximum size for antlers is somewhat determined by genetics so it varies from deer to deer, some mature deer will just never get massive antlers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to add that they do get bigger every year until they reach middle age. They start to go down in size after middle age, except for the base of the antler. The base always gets bigger.  You don't see this in the wild, because most deer don't live past middle age in the wild.  Also, antlers are like finger prints to the animal. They always grow the same shape for that deer.  <a href="http://imgur.com/KSvxlzD" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/KSvxlzD</a> <a href="http://imgur.com/pBwWNNL" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/pBwWNNL</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
