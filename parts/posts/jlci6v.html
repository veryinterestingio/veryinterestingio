		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand global contraction, or the slow shrinking and deformation of the Earth’s crust, was one of the dominant ideas in geology prior to the development of plate tectonics. I know it has been ruled out in favor of plate tectonics, but I recently read that it does seem to have played a role in shaping features on other bodies in the solar system like Mercury and the moon. I’m curious if global contraction is still thought in modern geology to have had any kind of effect on Earth’s crust in the present or past?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Global Contraction Theory is also referred to as Geophysical Global Cooling Theory, involves a planet in a molten state gradually cooling as it ages. First the surface cools to a solid rock state as the mantle and core cool at a slower rate, the interior cooling shrinks the rock and so the crust has to shrink and crumple around it.</p>
<p>This does happen in other places in the solar system, like Mercury or the Moon, as their crusts are not broken up into plates and are instead one solid surface. However because Earth has plate tectonics each plate can slide over or under each other as the Earth loses heat and the interior shrinks. This means that although the earth is losing heat very very slowly and is therefor contracting the impact on the crust is negligible at best.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I do not believe that it does, certainly the only mention of the theory in my degree was as a background, this is what they used to think before plate tectonics kind of thing. </p>
<p>When the Earth tops being tectonically active I imagine the process will play a role in shaping the crust of the Earth, but the Earth will remain tectonically active for billions of years yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sure! As you already mentioned (and as other commenters have helpfully reiterated) contraction is not the <em>main</em> force shaping the Earth's surface. But that doesn't mean it's irrelevant. </p>
<p>To see a possible example of contractional tectonics, you need to go to the seafloor. In the middle of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, new ocean crust is <a href="https://atmos.eoas.fsu.edu/~odom/ESC1000/tectonics/tpb.html" target="_blank">constantly being generated</a> along long volcanic mountain ranges called mid-ocean ridges. These mid-ocean ridges are associated with large numbers of parallel transform faults, the most common and most active faultlines on Earth. For example, see the dark lines in <a href="https://atmos.eoas.fsu.edu/~odom/ESC1000/tectonics/images/transf.jpg" target="_blank">this image</a>. Seriously look at that picture and think about the huge moutnains and canyons down there. There's so much stuff happening at the bottom of the ocean!</p>
<p>These transform faults relieve strain in oceanic crust. Most of that strain probably comes from differences in how fast different parts of the crust are moving relative to each other. Transform faults allow those different sections to slide past each other, relieving the strain.</p>
<p>Maybe contraction still plays a role? Since the new oceanic crust is warmer than the old crust, it's also less dense. Cooling the crust shrinks it, and shrinking causes strain. Contractional faults would relieve that strain.</p>
<p>What's the evidence? Some of the seafloor faults have <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2002GL015612" target="_blank">zero offset (PDF warning)</a>, indicating contraction not sliding. The fault-lines are <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JB091iB06p06405" target="_blank">regularly spaced</a> like you would expect with cooling cracks. Finally, there are many earthquakes in these faults close to the spreading centers, and few further away, which <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JB079i017p02573" target="_blank">would be weird</a> if they were only relieving lateral stress.</p>
<p>I don't think that there is a consensus about whether these seafloor faults are (partially) thermal cracks or not. See <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/329/5995/1047" target="_blank">this paper</a> for example, which explains some of the anomalies I pointed out with a purely non-contractional model (but also calls them &quot;deeply enigmatic&quot;). The ocean is deep, and tectonics is complicated! However, I think that it's likely that, if only in a small way, contraction influences the way the crust breaks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not in terms of the original theory, but significant earthquakes do lead to tiny reductions in the Earth's size, which via conservation of angular momentum then leads to a tiny increase in the rotational speed, reducing the length of a day by a few nanoseconds.  The amounts involved are so small that I have only seen it mentioned in relation to the Sumatran earthquake of 26th December 2004, and the Japanese earthquake of March 2011.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
