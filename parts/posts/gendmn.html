I'm not sure how carefully food transmission specifically has been studied, but given that (a) food-borne disease outbreaks are something we're already in the habit of monitoring and (b) takeout/delivery has exploded during shelter-at-home, I think we would have noticed by now if the risk were high.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple of things regarding the meat packing industry that I'm more concerned about than getting infected by COVID from contaminated meat, and u/The_RealKeyserSoze has effectively summed up the risk of that.  Just to beat down the &quot;it lives in frozen meat for weeks&quot; argument - the standards here in the US at least are more than enough to overcome this concern.  Packing plants have regular points of decontamination using various relatively inert substances that help reduce agent contamination, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4711421/" target="_blank">e.g. lactic acid sprays, etc</a>.  See point 2 below, however.</p>

<li>Supply chain problems related to outbreaks which are currently occurring at <a href="https://www.abc15.com/news/rebound/coronavirus-investigations/workers-at-tolleson-meatpacking-plant-want-2-week-closure-of-facility-to-avoid-outbreak-risk" target="_blank">those plants</a> and throughout the supply chain, whether that be due to plant shutdowns, high rates of infection in plant workers, changes in the trucking industry related to the outbreak and shifting supply chain requirements, and grocery store problems like customer numbers, staff PPE, etc. <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/5/5/21247286/plant-based-meat-coronavirus-pandemic-impossible-burger-beyond" target="_blank">You might want to consider learning to enjoy plant-based meat.</a></li>
<li>Maybe more importantly, and <a href="https://www.wsbtv.com/news/georgia/number-food-recalls-drop-since-start-pandemic-experts-say-food-supply-is-still-safe/25AFA72NVNDUVBQE325TDP2H24/" target="_blank">this has been touched on in the media a little</a>, is the effects of the pandemic on food safety.  These are unprecedented times, and for a variety of reasons I'm concerned that some of the checks and balances in our food safety programs here in the US are not optimal.  <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-s-covid-19-meatpacking-order-returns-us-jungle-days-ncna1198761" target="_blank">Fewer inspectors, relaxed inspection standards, packers rushing to keep up with demand in the face of a drop in workforce, etc.</a>  I fully expect we'll have more cases of e.g. E. coli, Salmonella, Listeria, Brucella, etc. linked to a drop in food safety, and these issues are likely to kill many more people than COVID ever would when considering food contamination (i.e. not natural cases of the virus vs. these other agents - just considering food contamination).</li>

<p>Studies have shown that various coronaviruses can last up to 2 weeks frozen and 72 hours in a fridge.</p>
<p>Yes, cooking meat properly will indeed wipe out the virus without issue. But before cooking your meat, you have probably handled it raw.</p>
<p>Make sure to use gloves when handling raw meat butchered recently, protect your face, and thoroughly wash your hands both before and after handling the raw meat. If you follow all the proper cross contamination prevention procedures you already should be doing when handling raw meat, you should be fine.</p>
<p>Raw meat, especially beef and chicken, already has plenty of other worrying viruses and bacteria on it (like salmonella), that are way more lethal and dangerous than SARS-COV2, so as long as you already follow the proper process to stay safe from Salmonella and friends when handling raw meats, SARS-COV2 is no more concerning anyways.</p>
<p>Id recommend not eating sushi though, and salads. These two food types are the highest foods for transportation of dangerous bacteria and viruses, as neither are cooked and are handled quite a bit by peoples hands, and are both stored in refrigerated environments, preserving any bacteria/viruses transmitted to them.</p>
<p>The vast majority of cases of food poisoning typically come from Salads for this reason. There's no step in the process of making a standard tossed raw veg salad that would kill off bacteria. Its extremely common in restaurants for employees to handle these salads directly without any form of PPE either.</p>
<p>If you are going to get sick from food, its almost always going to be a salad. During a pandemic I would strongly recommend passing on getting that side of cesear or house salad, and maybe skip the sushi bar for now if you really want to play it safe.</p>
