		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>CO2 is a very low-energy molecule. In order to break it apart, you need to add energy to it.</p>
<p>Plants do this using sunlight as an energy source for photosynthesis, turning CO2 and water into sugar. Whenever we eat the products of those plants, we eventually reverse that process, turning the sugar into CO2, water, and energy.</p>
<p>The real problem with our greenhouse gases is that normally that cycle of plants taking in CO2, plants being eaten, and then animals exhaling CO2 is a closed cycle. The amount of Carbon between the atmosphere, plants, and mammals remains pretty constant. However, millions of years ago, there were some trees that didn't get eaten by bacteria when they died (there just wasn't a bacteria that could eat them yet back then).</p>
<p>This resulted in a lot of dead trees capturing carbon outside of the natural cycle. Those trees eventually got buried underground as the Earth shifted around, and over millions of years have broken down, and are now what we call fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Whenever we burn fossil fuels, we reintroduce that carbon into the cycle. Without more plants or animals for the carbon to live in, all that extra carbon in the cycle ends up in the atmosphere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your question assumes that we canâ€™t, but we actually can convert carbon dioxide, methane, and some of the other greenhouse gases. The main limitation to that strategy is that capturing them from the atmosphere is challenging.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>one extra note, there are many project in the works to capture carbon from the atmosphere and sequester it somewhere.</p>
<p>its much easier to do it you get it at the source before its diluted, so power plants and the like are ripe for this.  but there are several large scale projects ongoing.  I dont know the details of how they work or what they products, I want to say calcium carbonate is one of their products...  it does take energy, but if you get that energy from nuclear or a renewable source, its a net reduction.  That is likely where we will end up, we've already released too much, and it appears inevitable that we will (or already have) reach the point of runaway change, so it will take an active effort to dial it back.  itll just cost us a good bit more to do so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We burn fossil fuel and create CO2 to get energy. To revere the effect of CO2 would take more energy then we got by making it to begin with.</p>
<p>Spending energy changing green house gasses don't make sense until we no longer use fossil fuel at all since if it worth it to change it then it is even more worth it to not create it to begin with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It can be done.  Trees do this every day.  The catch is that it's very energy intensive... which is the whole reason we've released so much into the atmosphere to begin with. (utilizing energy from chemical reactions which have an exhaust product of co2).  So there's kind of a catch 22 there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
