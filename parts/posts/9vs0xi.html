		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've seen some content online about how certain parasites control the behavior of their insect hosts, like the jeweled cockroach wasp or whatever species is in <a href="https://youtu.be/vMG-LWyNcAs" target="_blank">this</a> video.</p>
<p>My question is how these parasites are able to reprogram their hosts so well. In the case of the jeweled cockroach wasp, it seems like the wasp fiddles with a few key areas of the cockroaches brain, then poof-the cockroach has no more motivation. In the video, the caterpillar seems to know what the larvae cocoons are and protects them.</p>
<p>How can it be that simple? Is removing the motivation from a cockroach really as simple as just cutting a few connections in the brain? Is it easy to make a caterpillar think &quot;must protect yellow lump&quot;? I would think that these tasks would be really complicated, so how are these parasites able to complete them so effortlessly?</p>
<p>Also, if it really is that simple to reprogram a brain, are researchers studying the possibility of reprogramming mammals or primates at all? Thank you!</p></div></div>

<p><strong>Very short answer</strong>: We don’t know, because we don’t understand brains well enough yet.</p>
<p><strong>More info</strong>: Lots of ways.  Evolution just tries lots of things.  There seem to be a lot of different hosts and parasites that affect behavior. From viruses to bacteria to funguses to wasps. And they seem to work differently.</p>
<p><strong>Maybe a little satisfying</strong>: Brains are good at working even when we mess with them.  So crude changes can result in specific behavior.  Pretty much any brain drug (e.g. alcohol or anti-anxiety pills) is crude. Kinda like hittting a computer with a club.  It washes the brain in one or a few chemicals — completely unlike the ridiculously tiny complicated chemical communication cells use.  But unlike a computer being hit with a club our brains mostly work even when we do stupid stuff to them.   Theoretically, parasites can evolve to basically make crude arbitrary changes to brains (directly or indirectly) and eventually they’ll find some that tweak the brain stats in a way that favor certain behaviors (/adapt to take advantage of the behaviors they induced).</p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: We don’t know, but the fact that mind control is possible is also a testament to how self-regulating brains are that you can throw a wrench in ‘em and get subtle changes rather than complete break down.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually, the change being made is hormonal, not neurological.  Typically the parasite hijacks one of the host's normal instincts by producing a chemical that mimics one of the host's natural chemicals, or suppresses some normal chemistry of the host.  Basically the parasite &quot;drugs&quot; its host - not <em>quite</em> brain surgery.</p>
<p>One of the best examples of this is <em>Loxothylacus panopaei</em>, a barnacle which infects crabs and causes them to protect the parasite in the same manner that the crab protects its own eggs.  The crab already has the egg-protecting instincts; the barnacle just &quot;triggers&quot; them by activating certain hormones.  Even male crabs, which don't normally protect eggs, still have the dormant instincts for doing so, these instincts are just never triggered normally because the male crab does not produce the same hormones as the female - but the parasite can trigger them.</p>
<p>In the case of cockroaches, not much hijacking is necessary; a lot of a cockroach's &quot;control points&quot; are not in the head at all, and the cockroach doesn't need to do anything, just keep its balance by walking where the wasp pulls it.  Severing the main part of the brain is all this takes.</p>
<p>In insects and crustaceans, a huge amount of decision making is instinctive and can be activated using simple chemical triggers.  In vertebrates, there's usually a lot more active learning going on over the course of the animal's life, so every brain will be structurally different and a parasite cannot so easily modify the host's behavior.  However hormonal modifications are still possible, so you can have parasites that trigger aggression (rabies) or suppress fear (toxoplasma).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Which is what lyme disease is. I've found that the bacteria in me is quite fascinating and difficult to kill. There are other interesting things the bacteria does. But the body temp regulation is something the bacteria does for self preservation. Also fuck lyme disease you fascinating SOB! </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
