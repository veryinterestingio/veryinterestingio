		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depending on some details your example could roughly describe a few different, totally legitimate ways to make a profit.</p>
<p>Maybe this artist wanted to make this piece, but they couldn't/wouldn't without financial backing, but as part of the deal for funding their project you own or partially own the result so you can turn around and sell it for your own profit? That's venture capitalism.</p>
<p>Maybe the art is already being sold, but you have way better connections to people who would pay more for it, so you buy some and re-sell it at a markup? That's scalping.</p>
<p>Maybe you negotiate a deal with the artist, offer them a <em>huge</em> volume sale in exchange for a bulk discount, and then turn around and sell it above the price you paid for it to make a profit? That's wholesale.</p>
<p>Really, this &quot;buy low, find a new buyer, sell high&quot; trick happens all over. If you can commission an artist to doodle something for you for $20 and then successfully convince an art collector to buy it off you for $20mil, great. Literally nothing is preventing you. You just probably won't find a trade with such a remarkable margin because buyers and sellers usually aren't stupid and tend to have ballpark similar ideas of what the things they trade are worth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is part of a commonly known tax loophole. Normally you are not valuing the artwork yourself, or have people to value it for you. The artwork is valued by the people who needs to know how much it is worth. So a bank will not loan you money without having someone they trust value your collateral. The same thing is true about the IRS as they will come after you if they suspect the valuations on your tax forms is wrong. However you can get away with it by actually having the artwork be traded at that high price which means someone not only valued the artwork at that price but were willing to put their money behind that claim. But they do not have to do that if they are given the artwork as a donation. And money you made but donated away is not taxed. And this is indeed a problem that is hard to fix.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nothing. But why would it even matter? A persons net worth doesn't mean anything without context. You cant just stroll into a bank and declare a $1 billion net worth and get a loan.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In this case, the person turning your net worth into actual money gets to put the value on the art. If I paint a picture, go to the bank for a loan, and use the painting as collateral, they will decide how much it's worth, and the loan amount will reflect that value. If they give me a $100 loan, that's how much the painting is worth at that time. If they won't give me a loan, the painting is worthless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
