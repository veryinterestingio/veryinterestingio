		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neurons aren’t firing or are misfiring, it’s not permanent damaged but more of a non- or low- active area of the brain.</p>
<p>An easy way to understand what’s happening in the depressed brain is to look at recent studies done on various compounds (mostly psychedelics)/treatments and how they can stimulate neurons into firing again, often long term. </p>
<p>This article is about the effects of ketamine on the brain, but there are other ways to stimulate the less active parts of the brain including transcranial magnetic stimulation, synthetic or natural substances, and on rare occasions a blunt trauma. However, without some form of stimulation those dormant neurons won’t just start firing correctly. At least that we know of yet.</p>

The extreme emotions, <a href="https://sciencenordic.com/denmark-depression-evolution/depression-can-damage-the-brain/1392566" target="_blank">including depression</a> can negatively affect the brain, by atrophying parts, damaging cells, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6489983/" target="_blank">reducing white/gray matter</a>. This in turn can cause the brain to be less able to process emotions and can make one more susceptible to those extreme emotions. They've found that by comparing images of the brain of those who suffer bipolar or depression early on to later in life pictures of the brain, there shows a clear progression of damage to the brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alexithymia is a reduced ability to detect ones own emotional state and that of others, can be brought on by a few things and it's comorbid quite frequently with autism for example. Personally I think it's a protective shell that's gone awry. I wouldn't say it's irreversible though, unless it's brought on by some physical damage.</p>
<p>There's some school of thought that prolonged exposure to stress chemical cortisol can cause this, and PTSD sufferers have changed cortisol levels too - some too low, some too high. Perhaps the stress affects the cortisol production and once the imbalance is rectified the damage can be reversed?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
