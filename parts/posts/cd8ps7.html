		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR: It prevents your cells from repairing themselves from everyday damage, and it's very hard to flush out of your system.</p>
<p>Mercury like many other toxic heavy metals accumulates in your body over time. Your body has a difficult time flushing it out so even if the source of Mercury poisoning is small, if it persists then it will accumulate over time, possibly reaching poisonous levels.</p>
<p>No amount of Mercury is considered safe (The background level in humans is zero, so ideally you should avoid exposure) but you can have a certain amount of Mercury in your system without any ill effects. Which is why you are able to safely consume certain fish like Tuna that naturally have tiny amounts of Mercury in the meat.</p>
<p>Mercury is not a disease and therefore your immune system doesn't fight against it. Your body has to rely on organs like the liver and kidneys to flush the toxin out, but it happens that our bodies aren't really good at that so it takes a long time to flush mercury out.</p>
<p>Mercury poisoning can cause a variety of problems including muscle weakness, hair and nail loss, kidney dysfunction, etc but is most well known for causing neurological problems including memory loss, difficulty sleeping, and in bad cases insanity.</p>
<p>Mercury causes damage in various ways, but one of the most significant is it prevents your cells from repairing themselves from oxidization damage which constantly occurs by our bodies nature. Since the brain uses more oxygen by mass than any other part of your body, the damage to the brain is most severe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our bodies have lots of tiny, tiny machines inside our cells. These machines often have a bit of metal in them, which they use to do their jobs. </p>
<p>For example, there's something called Haemoglobin in your blood. This has a tiny piece of iron at its centre. It uses this iron to latch on to oxygen and carry it around.</p>
<p>Other machines use different metals, and do different things. The metal Selenium is used in a machine (an 'enzyme') that helps us use vitamins C and E, for example.</p>
<p>The metals that these machines use have specific properties. Generally, they're able to latch onto things in one environment, and let go of them in others. Iron can latch on to oxygen in your lungs, where there's lots of it, and let go of it in your muscles, where there's very little. This is why each machine needs very specific metals to do specific jobs. </p>
<p>Heavy metals like Mercury and Arsenic are dangerous because they can replace useful metals like Iron and Selenium in these machines. This is irreversible - once Mercury manages to replace Selenium in a machine, there's no removing it. The whole machine has to be scrapped. And since our bodies aren't very good at getting rid of Mercury, scrapping the machine will often just free up the mercury to go ruin another machine. The result is that if you have too much mercury in your body, a bunch of the machines that keep you healthy will just stop working.</p>
<p>We treat this with something called 'chelation'. This involves a medicine that is really good at trapping mercury and holding onto it. This means that instead of lodging into our machines, the Mercury lodges into the medicine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Elements come in different oxidation states (Number of protons - Number of electrons). When Mercury lacks two electrons (Hg^(2+)),  it gets confused with other metals like Magnesium (Mg^(2+)) by certain proteins that usually contain Magnesium. These proteins incorporate Hg instead, which renders them useless. Since Hg stays in your body this process continues even after the useless protein got destroyed by the cell. Hg just slips into another comfy pocket of a protein.  </p>
<p>That's why Hg^(2+) is poisonous.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Elemental mercury is actually fairly nonreactive and does not cause much damage if ingested (orally) it's been used in fillings like gold. Other metals can also be fairly toxic in different oxidative states, even gold for example. It is mercury cations and mercury containing compound like dimethyl mercury as well as mercury vapour that cause major damage and accumulate in parts of the body where other elements would naturally be, messing up the chemistry of the body causing proteins to function incorrectly, resulting in brain damage among other problems that will eventually result in death if they are left untreated and continue to accumulate in the body, since we have a hard time excreting certain heavy metals once they form compounds within the body. Chelation therapy is the main treatment for heavy metal poisoning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
