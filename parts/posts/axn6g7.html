How did the encapsulation occur? If it came from above I would suspect the weight of the liquid sap would have been greater than the strength of the praying mantisâ€™ antenna causing them to bend (as you can clearly see, they are not bent in the slightest) if it came from below you would assume there would be other trash or contents in the amber or sap. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It probably landed on this poor guy or he fell into it. The weight of the Amber is irrelevant, once it's encapsulated the antenna have plenty of time to spring back before the Amber hardens. Bugs die of oxygen deprevation relatively quickly. Amber is not this pretty in nature, this was almost definitely cut/polished to show this little dude off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a cut on a tree that was &quot;bleeding&quot; resin. You can spot those e.g. on cherry tries. They are sticky and grow very slowly forming a round droplet that likely won't fall down but will harden still on a tree branch.</p>
<p>The mantis went on top of such droplet and got stuck, surface tension sucked the mantis slowly for a bit and the continuous flow of resin covered the rest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
