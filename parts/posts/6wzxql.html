		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a flood engineer i wish i came here sooner to answer a few questions. </p>
<p>But the main thing is that a number of vectors will remove the water due to gravity.   Namely sewers, ground drains, good old evaporation, lay of the land, local ground geology, tidal differences to name a few.  Once the hurricane has passed though then levels will drop fairly quickly.</p>
<p>The biggest problem will be both the environmental (mobilised sewage etc...) and physical property damage that has occured.</p>
<p>Lots of standing water means mozzies and vermin.  Contaminated waters means polluted ground water sources, damaged agriculture infrastructure, dead livestock, crops wiped out and quarantined/destroyed  (certain crops absorb harmful nasties). </p>
<p>Infrastructure wise lots of work gutting out the drainage system and clearing hurricane damage will take place. Damaged electricity/phone/gas infrastructure will need checking too.  </p>
<p>Now let's talk about the houses that are damaged. </p>
<p>There are typical damage assessments that can be done but there are 2 typical factors that ultimately determine damage costs and severity - the depth of water and the time water stays around (ok and type of building materials used)</p>
<p>Anything typically above 400mm for a day or 2 means that the lower floor needs gutting and requires a complete rework.</p>
<p>Now think of this in terms of demands locally.  Every homeless person will  need rehousing, every house will require skilled trades to repair them(and they WILL be in  demand). It will take years for all affected properties to be repaired by all trades.</p>
<p>But as a starter for then why not google what happened during hurricane katrina or the 2005 flooding carlisle in the UK.  Some of the stats are just mindblowing and heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Ps also google the lake levels rises during hurricane Katrina due to the low air pressure alone.  It makes for amazing reading.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a semester away from graduating with a degree in soil science, so I'll answer this as it pertains to soil.</p>
<p>The most important concept to understand before I delve into this is that everything moves through soil via water. This includes nutrients, pollutants, minerals, etc.</p>
<p>The large scale scope of a flood like this is pollution and soil erosion. When soil is flooded to the point that water can no longer infiltrate, it begins transporting the top 2 layers of soil. This is the organic layer (such as leaf litter) and the surface layer (topsoil). These are the two most nutrient rich layers of soil, and often the most polluted (by pesticides, foreign chemicals, or trash). This is not good for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The main source of nutrients have now been stripped from the plants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sub-surface layers are exposed, and from what I understand about Texan soil, this is mostly clay.</p>
</li>
<li>Pollutants are now being transported and dumped into waterways or varying soil environments. </li>
</ol>
<p>Some of the nutrients will be returned to soil elsewhere, but most of these nutrients will flow to waterways and into the ocean. This will not be good for the Gulf, as it is already hypoxic (lack of dissolved oxygen due to nutrient runoff. Essentially, the large amount of nutrients results in algae blooms which deprives the water of oxygen). The reduction of plant matter will also reduce the stability of the soil, meaning it will be more likely to erode in the future. </p>
<p>The second portion of this is that clay now becomes the surface layer. Because clay is so small, it takes water significantly longer to move through the soil profile, thus lowering the hydraulic conductivity. This means water runoff will now become a large problem in the affected areas for months or years to come.</p>
<p>The third portion is pollutants. Chemicals and trash are now being transported to different soils and waterways. Not good.</p>
<p>As for the smaller scope impacts, soil horizons will become disrupted. Soil stability will be negatively impacted. Nutrients will be forced through the horizons quicker, leaving a deprived soil. Many soil microbes (the most important indicator of soil health, depending on who you ask) will be killed off.</p>
<p>So, yeah. It's disastrous for soil and the overall environmental health of the area.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, as for plants, many can survive being submerged for up to a weekish. Many cannot. The flooding will inhibit root nutrient uptake, which will result in decay. Water-logged roots are also more susceptible to organisms that specialize in root-rot.      </p>
<p>EDIT2: /u/BadBadger42 asked a question about highly expansive clays. These are what we call shrink-swell soils. The clay fraction is expanded in area when water-logged, which causes extra stress on infrastructure. This is the leading cause of flooding basements, and why many buildings in Texas do not have basements. Taking a look at <a href="https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_MEDIA/nrcs144p2_000979.jpg" target="_blank">this soil map of Texas</a>, most of the area effected is Vertisol. I'm sure you've all noticed a vertisol before, when it dries it looks like <a href="http://geotechfoundation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cracked-soil-texas.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>. The &quot;swell&quot; of the soil is caused by the micropores between the clay particles becoming over-saturated - and when it dries (&quot;shrinks&quot;) those cracks are left behind. Vertisol is the shrink-swell classification of soil. I would imagine that the effects of shrink-swell on infrastructure will be exacerbated by the flooding.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a Professional Engineer in Pennsylvania who consults in stormwater management.</p>
<p>Q1: Water will recede just like any other storm, it will just take MUCH longer. In an urban setting like Houston, it will flow into storm drains along the curb, into small pipes like 18” diameter, then those feed into larger pipes like 48” or even concrete box culverts which might be 15’ wide by 4’ high (the possible dimensions are endless). Those large pipes/culverts drain into the streams and rivers. Everything eventually keeps draining downhill to the ocean, bay, bayou, etc. </p>
<p>Q2: In general, this probably won’t change much regarding the landscape. It will look like the same place as it did before, except structures around main drainage channels may have washed away.</p>
<p>Q3: No permanent lakes or rivers will be made. Everything will drain naturally in a matter of days. If there is a low spot that doesn’t drain by gravity to a storm sewer, channel, stream, etc., that depression could hold water longer but it will eventually infiltrate into the soil and/or evaporate.</p>
<p>Up here in Pennsylvania, we design pipes/culverts to carry up to the 100-year storm which would be like 8” of rain in 24 hours. Not sure what they design for down south, but their 100-year storm is probably like 12”+ of rain in 24 hours. This hurricane is dumping 4+ feet in some areas so there’s no way to drain that much water very quickly. Just have to wait.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water will recede in basically same way as in the normal, non-flooding rain. </p>
<p>There are two (three) types of <a href="https://water.usgs.gov/edu/watercyclerunoff.html" target="_blank">runoff</a> (= outflow/discharge). We have direct runoff and basic runoff. </p>
<p>One part of direct runoff is surface runoff: water is no longer being soaked up by soil, because soil is fully saturated, therefore water can only flow on the surface. </p>
<p>Other type of direct runoff is hypodermic runoff - water is <a href="https://water.usgs.gov/edu/watercycleinfiltration.html" target="_blank">infiltrated</a> to the soil, but above groundwater level, only in soil capillaries, where it's flowing away.</p>
<p>About basic runoff, this is the <a href="https://water.usgs.gov/edu/watercyclegwdischarge.html" target="_blank">groundwater runoff</a>, where water in zone of saturation(=aquifier), beneath the groundwater level, flows off.</p>
<p>When you have flood, all soil is fully saturated even in aeration zone, above groundwater level, so soil is not able to soak up water and water is not able to infiltrate into the soil, so it stays on the ground. Or there is precipitation so strong, water cannot infiltrate into the soil in time. But, in time, all that water flows away, because groundwater is basically connected system of water bodies, so excess water is distributed to other areas via basic runoff and via basic runoff, especially surface runoff, it flows back to terrain depression, rivers and other areas with low altitude. In this area it's the gulf of Mexico for most of this excess water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
