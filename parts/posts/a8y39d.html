		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The steep roofs are less prone to collapse under the weight of snow, compared to flatter ones. So they are effectively safer/ cheaper to build in places with heavy snowfall.</p>
<p>However, due to the high angle, the snow or ice can slide off in large pieces and be dangerous, so the &quot;fences&quot; act to prevent/ reduce that. Melting snow and smaller bits can still run off  which is why a fence type structure is preferred to a solid barrier. </p>
<p>Edit: contrary to the insistence of some, there is no support for the idea that snow is deliberately held on top of roofs in order to provide insulation in Germany.
The main/ sole reason is to prevent dangerous falls. <a href="http://www.dach.de/eindeckung/dachsteine/dachsteine-nur-nicht-kalt-erwischen-lassen-01274/" target="_blank">http://www.dach.de/eindeckung/dachsteine/dachsteine-nur-nicht-kalt-erwischen-lassen-01274/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not in Germany, but in the US those little fences are so big chunks of snow/ice don't fall and hurt people. I would guess they serve much the same purpose in Germany. You see them alot on metel roofs as they have more of a tendancy to have the snow slide off in large chunks. Steep roofs are also common as it allows more useable living space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have the same in Norway, and the point of theese &quot;little fences&quot;, or snow catches, as we call them, is to stop the big pieces of snow and ice from sliding down the roof and hit people below the roof</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
