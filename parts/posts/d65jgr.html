		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>He has older brothers and one of them explained that you can live much longer without food than water and he’s been interested in this topic (for the last week at least).  So I think what he is asking, when compared 1:1, water vs Gatorade, would Gatorade keep you hydrated longer than water in a situation where resources are sparse?  I guess I’m also interested in the aspect of ‘better’.  Is there a ‘better’ in a situation like that?  Would Gatorade keep you in better health if you had one a day in that situation?  I’m guessing you wouldn’t want to overdo it?  Climate would play a big role I assume?  In a hot climate, Gatorade would help you replenish electrolytes lost due to sweating?  I would probably also assume a person of average health since my guess is certain health conditions would impact this as well.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The salts and sugar help the water be absorbed faster by the body, as there is a sodium-glucose cotransporter  in the intestines. You can look up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_rehydration_therapy" target="_blank">oral rehydration solution</a> for a medical product that does basically the same, just better. But it does not hydrate the body more. You only get the water a few minutes quicker in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>But Gatorade contains less than 1 liter water per liter (edit: \~5%), to due all the solved molecules. So if you are only limited on water, gatorade might be a worse choice. If you are sweating a lot and not eating (gives many electrolytes), gatorade might me a better choice.</p>
<p>Outside of extreme conditions, in everyday life, water is the better choice. (Edit: because normally you want to avoid sugar and overloading on salts)</p>
<p>Edit: in severe dehydration, especially due to diarrhea, Oral rehydration solution is best.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Looking at this article about it, most of the advantages measured were how your muscles recover from the workout, nothing specific about hydration.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In the desert (and in most cases of high calorie burn/dehydration), you'd probably be better off in the short run drinking Gatorade, and in the long run drinking water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
