<p>I thought that viruses used the internal processes of the cells they invade to handle replication so what is &quot;proof reading&quot; the replication as before replication the virus has made no proteins of its own.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, first you aren't really that far off here.  Generally speaking viruses hack the machinery of the cell to replicate.  But, just about every virus has a viral genome that encodes for a few, or in some cases many, proteins.  It all just depends on the virus, it's evolutionary history, and the type of genome is has (Dna single stranded, DNA double stranded, +/- Rna).  Sadly this coronavirus actually has the genetic code for creating an RNA proofreading protein complex (crazy right!?!) So in this case the virus itself is providing the proteins for proofreading during replication, causing the relaticely low frequency of mutations (which is still high generally speaking because it's a virus, they replicate fast and enter new environments fast)</p>
<p>This also makes it difficult to target covid with drugs as many of the best antivirals drugs work by tricking non-proofreading viruses into incorporating a bulky, not easy to work with nucleoside instead of a normal one into it's genome.  These &quot;nucleoside analogs&quot; look to the non-reading virus like a normal ATCG but they are chemically modified to terminate the reaction.  So if you as a virus incorporate a nucleoside analog then too bad, you are now prevented from replicating.  Covid can tell that they picked up a nucleoside analog instead of a normal nucleoside, will kick the analog out, and thus our best antivirals can't stop covid from doing it's thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To clarify, <strong>proteins from the original viral RNA genome are first made by the host prior to later replication (i.e. making new copies)</strong> of the genome. Those proteins include the proof-reading machinery.</p>
<p>TL;DR - The host creates the proofreading proteins</p>
<p>Timeline:</p>
<p>Infection --&gt; Host makes viral proteins --&gt; Viral proteins make copies of the viral genome (with proofreading) --&gt; New viral genomes get packaged up --&gt; Start new infections</p>
<p>For the second part of your question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>what is &quot;proof reading&quot; the replication as before replication the virus has made no proteins of its own</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Nothing</strong>, the proofreading would only be happening if the proofreading proteins (specifically nsp-14 and nsp-10) are present.</p>
<p>After the virus infects a cell, its genome is uncoated from the intracellular vesicles and is immediately subjected to translation by the host machinery. Only after this initial period of expression would the proof-reading be happening for subsequent RNA replication.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7592455/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7592455/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7592455/</a></a></p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Essentially, you have to realize there is a level of purifying selection happening on the viral genome. If the virus acquires deleterious mutations in its genome then it will be unable to survive and reproduce - resulting in its genome not being propagated into the future. So even if the initial RNA genome replications have errors only functional genomes will be passed on.</p>
<p>Interesting side note:</p>
<p>Although there are errors in RNA replication without proofreading, the error rate is only  15-20 times higher.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m a biochemist and I actually sort of study this. My normal research is how a specific set of proteins in cells (FET proteins) interact with transcription and effect it normally, and what occurs in pathological states involving these proteins. When COVID hit we switched to seeing if these proteins are involved in that replication process. SARS-CoV-2 uses an RNA dependent RNA polymerase that reads and transcribes it’s own RNA in our cells. It’s pretty cool and definitely worth reading about. The Protein Data Bank did a sweet feature on the RDRP this summer that’s worth reading if you’re interested.</p>
<p><em>ExoN that was mentioned in a previous post replaces mismatched nucleotides after transcription</em> Forgot to add that to the original post.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
