		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;When you cry or are on the verge of crying, your glottis, the opening in your throat that ushers air into lungs without taking food with it, is trying to stay open, but gets forced close every time you swallow. This tension messes with the muscles in your throat, giving the sensation of a lump.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something else not mentioned here: the insula, a small island of cortex deep in the brain, is associated with physical sensations such as nausea, shortness of breath, a racing heart, and so on. I was even reading a paper that showed that electrically stimulating the insula in humans causes various sensations, including sensations of constriction, closing and discomfort in the throat. And, the insula is associated with emotions, it has a connection with the cerebral amygdala, involved with various emotional states. Therefore, sensations such as &quot;tightness in the chest&quot;, &quot;butterflies in the stomach&quot;, &quot;a lump in the throat&quot;, often associated with our emotional states, can be attributed to the insular cortex in the brain and its relation to our emotional and physical state.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
