		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been letting my beard grow out lately, and horror of horrors the family shame has shown itself as there are some ginger hairs amongst the beard (insert dramatic horror movie chime here).</p>
<p>I'm British/Irish so I am of an ethnicity more likely to be ginger than others, nonetheless am not ginger at all. My normal hair is 'dark blonde' - originally blonde as a kid, now darkened into a dark brown with some speckled highlights of lighter brown.</p>
<p>I've noticed however that I am not alone in this. Some of my friends with similar hair colour have very ginger beards. One friend who does have a ginger sister despite being fairly dark haired himself is outright Captain Redbeard.  It seems to be very common amongst the population at large that orange-tinged hair appears in beards far more than in head hair.</p>
<p>What are the reasons for this?</p>
<p>I understand beards are governed by different genes than head hair. But why is it the ginger gene is so strong in beards and not in heads?</p></div></div>

<p>In case videos aren't your thing I'll run over the answer here:</p>
<ul>
<li>A dutch scientist discovered that hair colour isn't down to just one gene, it's a collection.</li>
<li>You can inherit your parents hair colour, but it may go even further back as your ancestors also have a part to play.</li>
<li>The MC1R Gene is thought to be the 'ginger gene'.</li>
<li>With two of them, you will have ginger hair all over, but with just one of them it's possible to have a ginger beard but non-ginger hair!</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope that helped mate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
