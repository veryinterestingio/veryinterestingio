		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I haven’t seen anyone else mention this, so I’ll toss it in. In a suspected or confirmed rabies exposure, they don’t only give you the rabies vaccine. They also give you rabies immune globulin, which contains antibodies to the virus. It’s meant to hold off the virus as much as possible while the vaccine trains the immune system to fight it. The vaccine is administered across multiple doses, whereas you only get the antibodies once- before you start making your own.</p>
<p>Treatment for rabies is a really great example of how we’ve harnessed immunology in medicine. It use artificially acquired active immunity (vaccination) and artificially acquired passive immunity (rabies immune globulin). </p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/medical_care/hrig.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is the CDC page about it, but look up rabies immune globulin if you want to read more!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a good overview of rabies virus replication:
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6842493/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6842493/</a>
(see section 2)</p>
<p>Basically, it first replicates locally in the muscle cells, then spreads up motor neurons into the brain. It moves by retrograde transport, which has a speed of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axonal_transport" target="_blank">about 10 cm per day</a>.</p>
<p>Vaccines wouldn't hinder this movement, but they would allow the immune system to kill the virus.</p>
<p>Edit: I also learned while researching this that biologists can track the spread of a weakened strain of rabies virus to label how nerves are connected to each other. This is quite cool: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18634512/" target="_blank">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18634512/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The virus spreads slowly along the nervous system. It travels at the rate of about 3 inches per day. When it reaches the brain, you die.
But, if you can get the vaccine before it reaches the brain, you can survive. The shot doesn't hinder its movement as much as teach you to fight it.</p>
<p>Edit:
there are plenty of sources and papers, including the Wikipedia article on Rabies, but my favorite is this podcast from NPR from almost 10 years ago. </p>

<p>Sadly the Milwaukee protocol has fallen out of favor, but this is hinted at in the beginning of the episode.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A couple more questions: can rabies virus be transmitted between humans through body fluids (such as saliva, semen, nasal mucus)? Also, is it possible for people to spread rabies even if they have taken the vaccine shot?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Rodney Vs. Death</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/312245-rodney-versus-death" target="_blank">https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/312245-rodney-versus-death</a></p>
<p>This episode walks you through why Rabies is so terrifying. Historically, if you showed symptoms of rabbies, the chance of survival was 0%. This helps explain why this virus is so different and how it gets into the brain, using the story of a girl who ended up surving. A doctor decided to try and provide some treatment where none had existed before by inducing the patient in a coma, but this treatment (Milwaukee Protocol) is still very controversial and as of the last time I listened, still inconclusive as to its actual efffectivenss. It is well worth a listen. To me it’s a Radiolab classic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
