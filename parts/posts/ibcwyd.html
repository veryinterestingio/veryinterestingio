If you repeat the same thing over and over again it becomes something you can do without thinking and the dopamine response is less and less = ugh this is getting boring lets do something else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dopamine plays a major role in the reward pathway of the brain. Addictive drugs act on this pathway, even eating cheese acts on this pathway (freaking love cheese). When you first start to do something that you have a large interest in, that dopamine reward pathway is activated. As you do it more and more, and it becomes predictable and mundane, that reward pathway isn’t activated anymore.</p>
<p>Now when this happens with drugs (aka tolerance) you can just increase the dose, but if it’s something else, like a hobby for instance, you can’t increase the dose, and because this hobby no longer activates the reward pathway, you lose interest in it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5 - Humans have a tendency to get over the impact of something very good or very bad happening to them and return to their own individual level of happiness.</p>
<p>ELI16 - this is the concept of ‘Hedonic Treadmill’, which says
“The hedonic treadmill, also known as hedonic adaptation, is the observed tendency of humans to quickly return to a relatively stable level of happiness despite major positive or negative events or life changes. According to this theory, as a person makes more money, expectations and desires rise in tandem, which results in no permanent gain in happiness.”</p>
