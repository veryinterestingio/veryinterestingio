I know commercial chicken eggs are not fertilized (at least not on purpose!) so the yolks could never become chicks. Would double yolks even appear in a fertilized chicken egg?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chicken farmer here. Even if the egg could produce two chicks it's likely one or both would be born with problems. Just raising normal chicks I've seen that if they are positioned wrong within the egg while developing they have trouble walking and standing and sometimes just can't get off their back if they were positioned wrong during development. This is why we need to rotate the eggs during incubation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A double yolk occurs in an egg when a chicken releases two yolks into the same shell. Double yolks are usually produced by young chickens. Since their reproductive systems have not fully matured,  they periodically release two yolks instead of one. Double yolks can also come from older chickens nearing the end of their egg producing period.</p>
<p>And to answer your question, yes very rarely but 2 chicks can actually hatch from the same egg.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People who raise them often check the egg before and during incubation by candling. It allows you to see inside the egg. The eggs with two yolks are usually not incubated because if something were to go wrong with one chick during incubation it would probably kill the other chick as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing to note is the chick does not come from the yolk. There is a smaller white/clear booger-looking thing attached to the yolk and that is what becomes the chick. </p>
<p>The next time you have a double yolk egg, look for that little booger and see if there are two. If so, then there's a possibility it could have become two chicks. If not, no dice on becoming two chicks. It would simply be one chick with lots of food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
