		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sound is just wiggling air.  </p>
<p>Wiggles travel fast through air, but they travel very very VERY fast through the ground.  </p>
<p>When you explode something, it wiggles everything around it.  </p>
<p>The wiggles that go through the ground get to you faster than the wiggles in the air.  </p>
<p>If the ground is wiggling hard enough, it makes more wiggles in the air close to you that sound like a boom.  </p>
<p>These extra wiggles that came through the ground get to your ears sooner than the wiggles that just went through the air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's my take on the videos, if which I've watched many: </p>
<p>I thought I heard a few smaller explosions,  then one  medium explosion.  You can clearly hear that, but there is no shock wave or compression of vapor. </p>
<p>Then, finally, the big one.   I did not hear that one until it reached the cameras.  </p>
<p>It seems like people are confusing the last medium explosion with the massive, massive explosion and shockwave of the final one. </p>
<p>Source:. Watched the videos numerous times.  Seen a decent number of explosions in real life, Iraq.  But I'm not a expert or physicist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Beirut blast apparently caused a pressure wave, not a shockwave. Pressure waves travel  slower than sound and build up pressure gradually (but still very quickly), which gives lungs and enclosed spaces a fraction of a second to equalise before reaching the peak pressure. Whereas a shockwave travels as fast or faster than sound and the pressure increase is instant, which leads to much more damage to people and objects.</p>
<p>So the vibrations of the sound travelled quickly through the ground, the sound followed soon after, and very quickly afterwards the pressure wave of the explosion hit.</p>
