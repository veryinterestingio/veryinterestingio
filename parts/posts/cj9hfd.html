<p>This is correct. If you take a pebble and then compress it to such a density that it becomes a black hole, the gravitational attraction of the pebble-hole doesn't change. Any objects that were being pulled towards the pebble will still be pulled towards the pebble-hole, but any objects that weren't affected by the gravitational pull of the pebble still won't care about the pull of the pebble-hole.</p>
<p>The range at which a micro black hole would be able to interact with other particles through its gravity in a meaningful way would be extremely small. In fact, if the micro black hole would be charged, it's likely that its electromagnetic interaction would be stronger than its gravitational pull, because electromagnetism is in general a stronger force than gravity. (EDIT: Maybe not, see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/cj9hfd/are_micro_black_holes_even_dangerous/evc77ru/" target="_blank">this comment</a>)</p>
<p>In addition, it's commonly assumed that micro black holes evaporate very rapidly after being created through a process called Hawking radiation (although this process hasn't been observed experimentally yet, primarily due to the difficulties of detecting Hawking radiation).</p>

<p>Unfounded anxiety over things that have an ominous sounding name.</p>

<p>They were dangerous to one of the detectors at CERN, but not in a way you'd expect. Early versions of the processing software of the ATLAS detector had a small memory leak with each particle created in an event. Since the decay of a micro black hole would cause the creation (and detection) of a very large number of particles, the memory usage of the process would spike and it would crash. I've heard ATLAS researchers joke that such a software crash would be a good indication of the discovery of a micro black hole, but that they might have issues getting it published. To the best of my knowledge, this bug was resolved quite some time ago. Also, no micro black holes were detected.</p>
<p>EDIT 17:30 UTC</p>
<p>Multiple comments are discussing the gravitational pull of our &quot;pebble-hole&quot; and wondering if, assuming that such a micro black hole is stable, it could interact with nearby air particles (or other particles), swallow them up, grow, and eventually start to increase its gravitational pull.</p>
<p>The short answer is &quot;No&quot;.</p>
<p>Gravity is a very weak force at those scales. For example, for a pebble of 1 kg (FYI: that's a rock, not a pebble at this point) you would obtain a pebble-hole with a Schwarzschild radius of 10^(-27) m. That means that anything that comes within 10^(-27) m from the pebble-hole would be definitely swallowed up, including light. </p>
<p>How big is 10^(-27) m? Consider the radius of a hydrogen atom, the average distance between the proton and the electron making up this atom. This number is also known as the Bohr radius and is approximately 5.3 * 10^(-11) m.</p>
<p>The space between matter, even solid matter, is extremely empty. The ratio of &quot;things&quot; to &quot;empty space&quot; at the microscopic level is much lower than it is at the macroscopic level (in star systems and galaxies). As such, the probability of a micro black hole interacting gravitationally with other matter is exceptionally small.</p>
<p>And even if, in the case of some cosmic luck, a micro black hole were to swallow another particle, it wouldn't matter much. Lets take a medium-sized molecule, abundant in our atmosphere: nitrogen. 1 nitrogen molecule has a mass of approximately 4.6 <em> 10^(-23) gr. To double the mass (and gravitational force) of a pebble-hole of 1 gram, it would need to swallow up about 2 </em> 10^(22) nitrogen molecules. And considering a single interaction is already extremely unlikely, you can see what that means for the likelihood of the mass of a micro black hole ever increasing by any meaningful (or even measurable) amount.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Micro black holes evaporate pretty quickly.  Even if one fell into the Earth it'd have to already be fairly massive to absorb enough mass to sustain itself before it disappeared.  Any that were created by CERN would've dissipated much too quickly to be dangerous to anything but its own equipment.</p>
<p>Thing is, when a black hole evaporates through Hawking radiation, it emits the amount of energy equivalent to the mass used in its formation.  For a black hole that CERN might generate, with the mass of a few hundred or thousand atoms, that's relatively tiny.  A black hole created from a gram of matter would explode with the force of forty-something kilotons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Micro black holes have not been confirmed and there is a fair bit of disagreement on whether they can be generated with the current state of the universe. Hawking called them primordial black holes as he thought they could have formed in the early universe. </p>
<p>If they do exist many people think they would dissipate incredibly quickly and would not be a problem.</p>
<p>But if that is wrong, CERN did some estimates on how long it would take for a micro black hole on Earth to become a noticeable problem (gain enough mass) and I believe their estimates were longer than the time since the Big Bang.</p>
<p>CERN spent time finding two very old neutron stars as proof of concept. Their argument was, if these neutron stars can be this old then it is unlikely micro black holes would be a problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ol>
<li>
<p>They still have the gravity you'd expect of an object of that mass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even though they have the same gravity at a distance as any other object of similar mass, they are tiny, so their escape velocity is the speed of light.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stuff falling into them releases a lot of energy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The large gradient in gravitational acceleration can rip nearby objects apart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For objects much smaller than Earth mass, the hawking radiation they emit can become incredibly intense and incredibly energetic. This means that below about 300 billion tonnes, black holes emit primarily gamma rays. At that size it's &quot;only&quot; 4 kW of Gamma rays, but the smaller the hole the brighter the hole. At 300 thousand tonnes the black hole is emitting petawatts of hawking radiation. Almost entirely very hard gamma rays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tiny black holes have very much finite lifespans. The aforementioned 300 thousand tonne black hole has a lifespan of 72 years, during which it will only increase in intensity. A black hole with a mass of 230 tonnes has a lifespan of 1 second and is brighter than some small stars. A 1 kg black hole is a million times brighter than the sun and lasts for 86 1 billionths of a nanosecond before that brightness skyrockets so bright it burns off all of its mass energy. Effectively a big explosion.</p>
</li>
<li>Below a certain size, feeding black holes at a rate faster than they decay becomes tricky. This effectively dooms them to explode in a finite amount of time.</li>
