		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember in school learning that the core of Earth is made from mostly iron and nickel.</p>
<p>...how did we get that particular information?</p>
<p>I can wrap my mind around the idea of scientists figuring out what the inside of the Earth looks like using math and earthquake data but the actual composition of the center of the Earth? It confuses me.</p>
<p>What process did we use to figure out the core is made out of iron and nickel without ever obtaining a sample of the Earth's core?</p>
<p>EDIT: WOW this post got a lot of traction while I slept! Honestly can't wait to read thru all of this.  This was a question I asked a couple of times during my childhood and no teacher ever gave me a satisfying answer. Thank you to everyone for taking the time to truly explain this to me. Adult me is happy! :)</p>
<p>2ND EDIT: I have personally given awards to the people who gave great responses. Thank you\~! Also side note...rest in peace to all the mod deleted posts in the comment section. May your sins be forgotten with time. Also also I'm sorry mods for the extra work today.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was hypothesised that Earth had an iron core long before we could employ seismic measurements that deep because:</p>
<p>• Measurements of the Earth’s mass in the 1800s indicated that the Earth was on average quite a bit denser than the rocks we find at the surface and even the (slightly denser) rocks brought up from much deeper (in the mantle) that we <a href="https://blog.nationalgeographic.org/2012/11/12/xenoliths-from-the-mantle-little-green-rocks-from-deep-inside-the-earth/" target="_blank">occasionally find in volcanic rock.</a> There must be a region of something much denser inside the Earth just based on this.</p>
<p>• We have also known for a long time that the Earth has a magnetic field, and so something metallic is a good candidate for all that extra density down there. A formal publication on Earth’s magnetism was first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Magnete" target="_blank">made in 1600</a> proposing lodestone as the magnetic source, though this was before we had the mass measurements of the Earth and lodestone is still not dense enough, nor does it produce the right type of magnetism. It was not until 1919 that a self-exciting dynamo was proposed as an explanation for the Earth’s magnetic field. This forms the basis for our current geodynamo theory.</p>
<p>• The study of meteorites as rocks from space (rather than just superstitious stories or false assumptions of volcanic products) began in the early 1800s. It became known that some meteorites had a rock-like composition, while others were much denser, composed largely of iron. In 1897 E. Wiechert, (who subsequently became a renowned German seismologist), suggested that the interior of the Earth might consist of a dense metallic core, cloaked in a rocky outer cover. He called this cloak the “Mantel,” which later became anglicized to mantle. Metallic meteorites do in fact represent the cores of long gone planetoids, which managed to differentiate the heavier elements to their centre of mass before being smashed apart by collisions in the early Solar System.
Meanwhile, the Milne seismograph had been invented in 1880, and subsequent refinements to seismic measurements meant we were able to put constraints on the density and composition of Earth’s interior further and further into the planet. By 1906, the first seismologic detection of the Earth’s fluid (outer) core was made by R. D. Oldham, who showed that P-waves have a significant slowing when travelling through the core. Oldham also predicted a P-wave shadow zone beyond 103° from the origin, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/xfe2vqB.jpg" target="_blank">shown here between 103° and 142°.</a></p>
<p>Around this time it was also found that no S-waves arrived at the other side of the Earth beyond the 103° mark, ie. they do not pass through the core at all, so that the S-wave shadow zone stretches between both the 103° points from either side of the origin. S-waves rely on shear strength of the medium in order to propagate and fluids have zero rigidity, so zero shear strength. This is how it was deduced that the core is fluid, which then led to that 1919 proposal for a self-exciting dynamo via the movement of conductive molten iron in the core.
It was not until 1936 when Inge Lehmann, a Danish seismologist, reported weak P-wave arrivals within the aforementioned P-wave shadow zone (103° - 142°) which she interpreted as an inner core with higher seismic velocity, possibly solid. The limitations and difficulty of interpreting weak seismic signals, and quite possibly the fact that Lehmann was a woman meant that this remained controversial for some time, but it is 100% true.
Nowadays, we can use seismic tomography to build up more detailed pictures of the Earth’s interior. This is the generation of many 2-D seismic slices through the Earth and then the stacking of them to produce a 3-D image, the same principle used for medical CAT scans. This is shedding light on the fact that the mantle is not particularly homogenous (it seems like the inner and outer cores are). The mantle has large (continent sized) structures of hotter rock within it, thought to be associated with the generation of mantle plumes. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/v6iZUU9.gif" target="_blank">This is the sort of visualisation that can be generated from seismic tomography data.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s super interesting geology stuff! Basically we map it out by measuring the speeds of seismic waves (earthquakes) and then compare the speeds (and deflect!) of that with other elements. Once we have a match, it’s safe to presume that’s the composition</p>
<p>Of course this is a really dumbed down answer, but be sure to read other comments as this is a really interesting question.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At last a question for me! I did my masters on exactly this! The idea of an iron-nickel core was first suggested in the 1950s by Birch et al, he had carried out seismic studies to determine the density of the subsurface, and found that the earths core most resembled an iron nickel alloy. But there are also a number of other clues:</p>
<p>Clue 1. Earth formation! The Earth is believed to have formed through collision of many smaller bits called planetesimals. When the energy of these collisions were modelled, it was found that it was easily enough to fully melt the earth. If that happened the densest material, ie iron would sink.</p>
<p>Clue 2. Meteorites! Iron meteorites are thought to be the centre of smaller planetesimals and meteorites, and these are always an alloy of iron and nickel.</p>
<p>Clue 3. Meteorites again! Some meteorites are what are called “chondrites” which means they are undifferentiated, they never went through the melting and separating step during formation that larger bodies did. This means they can form a good overall (bulk) composition for planets. If you collect a bunch of chondrites and get their average bulk composition, then compare it to the bulk composition of the parts of earth we can study easily, ie the average of the crust and the mantle, there is one major element in chondrites that is glaringly absent from the crust and mantle. Iron! </p>
<p>The exciting bit (to me anyway, this is what my masters was about) is that the seismic velocity of the core doesn’t perfectly fit an iron nickel alloy, there is about 10% of some other element. Since Birch noticed this in the 50s, people have tried all sorts of experimental and computational methods to try and isolate what that element is, and to be honest nobody has much of a clue. It’s probably a combination of silicon, carbon, oxygen, and a bunch of other common elements, but nobody knows!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
