		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Magnetic fields are more convenient for bending/focusing elements at high beam velocities than electrostatic devices. Electrostatic methods are used for very low-velocity beams (typical v/c ~ 0.05 or less). After the pre-acceleration is done and the beam has been injected into some larger accelerator, magnetic methods are used instead.</p>
<p>Additionally, electric fields will not just bend and focus, but also change the energy of the beam particles. Magnetic fields don't do this (neglecting synchrotron radiation, which is currently only relevant for electron beams). This complicates the dynamics. In a synchrotron, you want the energy increases to occur in the RF cavities, not also in the bending/focusing elements. And in a storage ring, you just don't want the energy to change at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To produce the same force as an 8 T bending magnet you need an electric field of 8 T * c = 2.4 GV/m where c is the speed of light (as very good approximation for the speed of the protons in the LHC). This is way beyond every field strength we could produce. 1 MV/m is possible, if you are fine with oscillating fields you can produce 30 MV/m (but that would be impractical for permanent bending elements), but not gigavolts per meter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
