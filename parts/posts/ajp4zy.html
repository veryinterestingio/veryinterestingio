<p>It didn't talk about HGH, but it did summarize a great deal of studies that specifically look at height compared to physical activity during puberty. For women it appears that extreme exercise such as gymnastics makes you shorter, but less extreme exercise such as swimming may make you taller or average. For men it is less clear. When comparing extreme exercise, it varies on the specific sport with an untested implication that it is more dependent on diet than exercise. An example is that long distance runners have conflicting published results from mildy shorter to average, while wrestlers (known for extreme dieting) are generally shorter than average. Normal exercise did not appear to affect height in men, but did accelerate sexual maturation.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There is an obvious correlation between exercise, HGH, and these results in women, but I didn't find anything that confirmed it specifically. For men it looks like it may not be true, although androgen hormones may have a significant correlation with exercise during puberty. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Complicated question, as hormones function in a tightly regulated environment.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In one role, Growth Hormone functions to increase insulin resistance, keeping glucose available for metabolism in the body rather than storage. In times of increased energy use (like exercise), the body needs to keep glucose available.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Growth hormone is regulated by a host of other hormones. The secretion of GH acts on the liver to stimulate insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGFR-1), to release somatostatin. IGFR-1 will reduce secretion of GH via negative feedback, while IGFR-1 itself acts to mediate growth/anabolic processes. At the same time, IGFR-1 positively regulates somatostatin, which provides additional negative feedback on GH release. All of the hormones are in a careful balance based on metabolic needs of the body. Times of linear growth would be a different story, but you could think of it as an increased metabolic need (for anabolic growth).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Adults with pituitary tumors releasing growth hormone (that is not subject to the normal regulation of the body) can have a condition called acromegaly. This results in coarsening of facial features, among other effects. Most bones will not grow in length as the growth plates are closed. Children with certain conditions can receive growth hormone to accelerate linear growth prior to growth plates closing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An addendum on exercise and GH.  GH peaks when you're sleeping. Your growth plates are closed but this doesn't mean density and shape aren't changeable by the GH.  This response is one of the reasons we push for a good hard warmup and using large muscle group dynamic exercises at the start of an exercise session as these two processes peak T and GH from the get go.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
