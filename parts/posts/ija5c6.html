		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unhealthy things are beneficial in the right circumstances, or mimic beneficial things, or take advantage of evolutionary biology to produce unintended effects</p>
<p>Fat, sugar (and alcohol technically) are all very calorie dense, lots of energy for very little chewing. In a survival situation finding nuts or fatty cuts of meat would provide more energy in a shorter period of time leaving more time available for finding shelter/water - so eating these is rewarding. The activating of the reward pathways in the brain would release &quot;feel good&quot; chemicals to encourage early humans to seek these out or prefer them to less rewarding things given a choice.</p>
<p>Nicotine/caffeine are both similar stimulants, we have receptors for these in the brain which are related to sleep/wakefulness, they mimic the chemicals which would normally bind (that our body creates) just by happening to be a similar shape. So these are more of a chemical trick. Most drugs in general are along the same lines.</p>
<p>Chocolate actually combines the three - contains both caffeine, sugar and fats.</p>
<p>Things like gambling or thrill seeking behaviour are adrenaline-based and related to risk/reward pathways. Taking a risk was beneficial evolutionarily. In survival a gamble paying off is rewarding to encourage another similar gamble, but in a casino these games are designed in such a way to create bigger and bigger rewards (and bigger losses) that trick the brain into wanting to keep going.</p>
<p>So depending which way you are thinking about, the issues surrounding addiction are overabundance and genetic susceptibility. A &quot;healthy lifestyle&quot; in the modern age is about going against the things that humans evolved to have - to avoid issues of overabundance and fight against the urges that were at one time helpful but are now less so - and it's hard to get addicted to that because it feels unrewarding based on our biology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I met a guy who was addicted to going to the gym. It had definitely become harmful for him. Pretty much anything taken to excess becomes unhealthy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Take high fructose corn syrup as an example. It’s not something we think about but it roughly takes about 1 ear of corn for a 1 liter bottle of coke. </p>
<p>People generally can drink anywhere from three to five a day depending on how bad their soda addiction is. Now imagine trying to eat three to five ears of corn every day. That’s going to get pretty difficult because you are now placing the need to process the entirety of the corn on your body. The corn also comes with nutrients, fiber, water, calories , more volume, you now have to eat, chew, swallow, etc whereas a company using millions of dollars of equipment to get you a 1 liter ready to go, your body now has access to liquid corn and water which can get absorbed super fast where if you had to process the corn yourself in your body would  take much more time and effort and even trying to do it yourself would require a lot of your time and money. </p>
<p>Generally anything processed is going to go into your blood stream and spike you pretty darn fast because it can be absorbed super easily. Most natural occurring foods are nutrient dense and low in calories.
When it hits your gut it has to break down all the things the plant has like layers, husks, membranes, starches and in general it just gets water, vitamins and some calories so it is way more difficult to spike your blood sugar or create or mimic the euphoria you can get otherwise. </p>
<p>Most things in the natural world are spread out and in small quantities and the time it would take to round them all up to equal the caloric value of a burger would be a very hard thing to do over the course of a lifetime. Humans have this strange habit of concentrating things like rounding up flakes of metals and making highly concentrated things like cars and wires and shit, making plastics, etc. The same thing occurs with our food and also drugs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
