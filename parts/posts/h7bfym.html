		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Copied from Wikipedia:</p>
<p>During medieval times, barbers performed surgery on customers, as well as tooth extractions. The original pole had a brass wash basin at the top (representing the vessel in which leeches were kept) and bottom (representing the basin that received the blood). The pole itself represents the staff that the patient gripped during the procedure to encourage blood flow.</p>
<p>At the Council of Tours in 1163, the clergy was banned from the practice of surgery. From then, physicians were clearly separated from the surgeons and barbers. Later, the role of the barbers was defined by the College de Saint-CÃ´me et Saint-Damien, established by Jean Pitard in Paris circa 1210, as academic surgeons of the long robe and barber surgeons of the short robe.</p>
<p>In Renaissance-era Amsterdam, the surgeons used the colored stripes to indicate that they were prepared to bleed their patients (red), set bones or pull teeth (white), or give a shave if nothing more urgent was needed (blue).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's supposed to be a recreation of what you would see in the house of a medieval-era barber. </p>
<p>One theory is that during those times, doctors didn't really have the steady hands to do surgery, they only had the knowledge of anatomy. Barbers, on the other hand, had steady hands to pull off complicated procedures. Doctors worked with barbers to perform surgeries of the time. </p>
<p>As a result, you would typically see towels hanging from the clotheslines of a barber's place. Red ones (stained with blood), and white ones (clean and no blood stains). When those are hung at daytime, you would know it's a barber's place if you see the red (bloodstained towels), white (clean towels),and blue (the sky) on display. </p>
<p>Other theories say that the blue is either supposed to represent veins or to depict patriotism for Americans. </p>
<p>It's shaped like a pole because patients of those surgeries had to squeeze a pole or stick to make their veins pop, making them easier to locate. </p>
<p>Modern day barbers recreated those colors with the spinning barber's pole with the same colors.</p>
<p>EDIT: Clarified that this was one of the theories, and may in fact be an urban legend.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Barbers used to perform surgery (amputations, tooth extractions, suturing deep wounds etc) with anatomists (doctors), not every barber did, but if there was a blood stained towel hanging outside it was likely the man inside did.
They later became known as barber surgeons, but they were not doctors. This is the reason in the uk that when a doctor trains to become a surgeon,  at the point of becoming a registrar (a surgeon able to operate unsupervised) they drop the Dr. Before their name and revert back to Mr. (Or Miss/Ms in the case of a woman).
So if you meet a doctor who is a Mr, Ms or Miss, you know they are a surgeon.  (UK- in US they are all &quot;Dr so and so&quot;, or &quot;who ever MD&quot; which stands for medical doctor).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
