		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There does indeed seem to be some research to support this idea!  <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2016.0111" target="_blank">Altermatt and Ebert 2016</a> conducted a study on <a href="https://butterfly-conservation.org/sites/default/files/styles/masthead/public/2019-03/16548412681_9c6dceea7a_o.jpg" target="_blank">spindle ermine moths</a> to address the question of how light pollution has affected insects.  They collected larvae from 10 regions with either high or low light pollution, and raised them all in a common lab environment (so that any differences in behaviour would be more likely to be a result of genetics rather than habituation during their upbringing).  And when exposed to lights as adults, the researchers clearly found that moths from darker regions were <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/cms/attachment/561bc6df-d988-4eb2-9eec-e28e951106a7/rsbl20160111f01.jpg" target="_blank">more likely to be attracted to lights</a> than those from places with higher light pollution.  Though this isn't 100% conclusive, it's reasonably good evidence that there may be selection acting to reduce the strength of phototaxic behaviour in urban moth populations.  Also, if you're just generally interested in the impact of light pollution on insects, check out this review paper by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.4557" target="_blank">Owens and Lewis 2018</a>, though it's more about the effects of artificial light than evolutionary responses to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former entomologist here, but this was not my focus. Or anybodies focus afaik.
Insect populations are plummeting for a myriad of reasons, light pollution is one reason. But with chemical pollution, habitat destruction, invasive species etc... Where seeing massive changes in gene frequency in many directions at once. </p>
<p>But here are some points about lights attraction and hypothesis from many nights gathered around the &quot;light trap&quot; with my colleagues. </p>
<p>Some species are attracted to bright lights and are very active near them. </p>
<ul>
<li>They may be navigating by the light and confused. Or searching for the dark area <em>behind </em> the light. </li>
</ul>
<p>Many other species fly into the lit area and stop flying.</p>
<ul>
<li>they're normally nocturnal, and could be mistaking the light for daytime. </li>
</ul>
<p>Some are only attracted to dim light - such as a lit window, rather than a bare bulb.</p>
<ul>
<li>perhaps searching for 'open ground' outside of tree cover.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some agricultural pests we collected by lights at night, and by bright colours during the day. They normally seek leafy vegetarian but also are just suckers for these artificial attractions for unknown reasons. </p>
<p>Many, many species are not attracted to lights at all. We usually don't know much about these ones because they're harder to collect. </p>
<p>My favourite answer is that the Queen of the moths promised to marry any suiter who could bring her the moon.
Billions are trying to fetch it for her this very night.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The innovation of the lightbulb was incredible, no doubt. Now with time came the TV. So it goes to say that in the 1980’s when einstein made the lightbulb it was majorly overlooked considering the fact that there was major use of FM radio. People did not trust the lightbulb and relied strictly on flashlights. Through these past years, lightbulbs began to evolve towards something bigger. Take computers for example. That’s one huge lightbulb.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
