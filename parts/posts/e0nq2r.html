		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Laser has nothing to do with colour or beam divergence. Lasers are just good for making tight beams, and they inherently make a rather monochromatic source. You can have a really wide laser beam, and you can have a rather narrow focus with lenses or mirrors. </p>
<p>L.A.S.E.R. is actually an acronym. It's Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. To be a laser, it has to be light amplification done by stimulating the emission of radiation. Basically you energize certain types of materials so much so that more electrons are in the energetic state than the ground state, and then as light passes it causes electrons to emit basically identical photons, amplifying the light. The coherence of this light is what makes laser have a narrow wavelength band and allows for tight beams if desired.  </p>
<p>This is opposed to spontaneous emission, which is most other sources, like an from a hot object like an incandescent bulb or fluorescence like in a fluorescent lamp or white LED. Here a minority of electrons are energized, and they randomly emit leading to a less coherent light source. Some spontaneously emitted photons may trigger stimulated emission, but it's a minority effect. Once you pass a point called population inversion (more electrons energized than not) stimulated emission takes over as a dominant effect as you can start lazing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun Fact: There are naturally occurring lasers.  A laser is light amplification through stimulated emission of radiation so if a light source energizes a material a laser is produced.  Natural lasers are formed from stars that are surrounded by clouds of gas.  The light from the star stimulated the gas cloud to also emit light at the same frequency and in the same phase as some light from the star.  When scientists on earth looked at the spectrums of light from these stars, the natural laser light appeared as a very bright line in the spectrum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While all of the other answers are technically correct, a more simple explanation may be helpful as well.</p>
<p>Laser is more than a noun, it is also an acronym. LASER is actually an acronym for a process that is used to create light. LASER stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission Radiation. </p>
<p>So, what makes a laser is not the type of light, the color, or even the spread (divergence) of the light. The method by which you created the light is what makes it a laser</p>
<p>Edit: laser is a noun</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of comments about the physical mechanism that is used to produce laser light (stimulated emission), which is probably the information you were looking for. I just want to add that from a practical perspective, what makes lasers useful is not just their spectrum (nearly monochromatic), but the fact that laser light is coherent. This is a difficult concept to explain, but one simple picture of coherence is that the light at different points in the wavefront oscillates in phase. Wikipedia might have a better description of coherence: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics</a>)
Coherence allows for the formation of stable interference patterns and many other uses of lasers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you filter, say, sunlight so that there's a really narrow range of wavelengths left, the resulting light will still be different than laser light. It's a technical point, but laser light has different photon statistics than sun light, even when filtered to a single wavelength and into a single beam.</p>
<p>To make laser light you need a material that can amplify light when given the correct energy, and you need a pair of mostly reflective mirrors on either end to enhance that amplification for a narrow range of wavelengths.</p>
<p>In short, you really do need a laser to make laser light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
