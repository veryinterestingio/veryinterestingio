		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! We're misinformation and media specialists: I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/saltzshaker" target="_blank">Emily</a>, a UX research fellow at the Partnership on AI and First Draft studying <a href="https://www.partnershiponai.org/partnership-on-ai-first-draft-begin-investigating-labels-for-manipulated-media/" target="_blank">the effects of labeling media</a> on platforms like Facebook and Twitter. I interview people around the United States to understand their experiences engaging with images and videos on health and science topics like COVID-19. Previously, I led UX research and design for the New York Times R&amp;D Lab's <a href="http://newsprovenanceproject.com/" target="_blank">News Provenance Project</a>.</p>
<p>And I'm <a href="http://www.twitter.com/victoriakwan_" target="_blank">Victoria</a>, the ethics and standards editor at <a href="https://firstdraftnews.org/" target="_blank">First Draft</a>, an organization that develops tools and strategies for protecting communities against harmful misinformation. My work explores ways in which journalists and other information providers can effectively slow the spread of misinformation (which, as of late, includes a great deal of coronavirus- and vaccine-related misinfo). Previously, I worked at Thomson Reuters.</p>
<p>Keeping our information environment free from pollution - particularly on a topic as important as health - is a massive task. It requires effort from all segments of society, including platforms, media outlets, civil society organizations and the general public. To that end, we recently collaborated on <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/it-matters-how-platforms-label-manipulated-media-here-are-12-principles-designers-should-follow-438b76546078" target="_blank">a list of design principles</a> platforms should follow when labeling misinformation in media, such as manipulated images and video. We're here to answer your questions on misinformation: manipulation tactics, risks of misinformation, media and platform moderation, and how science professionals can counter misinformation.</p>
<p>We'll start at 1pm ET (10am PT, 17 UT), AUA!</p>

I.e. most of your work seems focused on preventing or slowing the spread of misinformation (which is obviously super important!), but do you have suggestions for how to deal with folks who've bought massive quantities of misinformation?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Personally, I always saw misinformation on social media as an echo-chamber phenomena. Many people seem to follow the news/feeds/informations/ideologies that suit their initial affirmation and reject the ones that oppose those. In this sense, I got a couple of questions: </p>
<ol>
<li>Doesn’t your task lead to more distrust and division?</li>
<li>Wouldn’t it be more beneficial to society as a whole to encourage critical thinking and exposure to a variety of different informations rather than having authorities decide which informations the population is exposed to?</li>
<li>What is your thought on complete censorship of misinformation?</li>
<li>How can we ensure that it doesn’t become a slippery slope resulting in censorship of all kinds of socially unacceptable and politically incorrect ideas?</li>
