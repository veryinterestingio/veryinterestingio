		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nerves from your brain go to your spinal cord then split up and reach your internal organs then go to your skin. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stabbing pain: There are many pain receptors on your skin and they are close together. So the ones that are damaged report pain to your brain and the ones right next to them that aren't damaged don't report pain. So you can point to the exact spot that hurts. This is sharp stabbing pain because it's like a fine knife going into your body.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dull ache: This is often used to describe pain on internal organs where the pain receptors are more spread out. So you can't pinpoint exactly where the damage is because one pain receptor is covering lots of area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Burning pain is often used to describe when the nerves themselves are damaged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Colicky pain is when a hollow organ squeezes over something hard. Your gut pushes food forward like when you squeeze the last bits out of a toothpaste tube. If there is a hard mass inside, you'll feel pain when it squeezes around that part then the pain goes away when the squeezing moves forward. Then it comes back at the next squeeze. The same goes if you have a hard stone in your urinary tract. </p>
</li>
<li>Radiating pain is when your brain confuses the internal organs with the parts of skin that share the same nerve. For example, the nerves that cover your heart then go on to cover your left arm. So if you have a heart attack, your brain might confuse the heart pain with left arm pain. This feels like the pain starts in your heart, but then moves out to your arm.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many other terms, but this gives you an idea of how specific injuries and the anatomy of nerves affect the terms we use. The actual terms aren't that important. There are hundreds of languages, but all humans experience the same types of pain. They're just helpful for doctors to try to narrow down what's going on when they first meet you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are interested in pain science - take a look at Lorimer Moseley’s “Explain Pain” a lot has changed in the neuroscience world of pain. Everyone is talking about the biological pain pathway and no one is talking about the context of pain which is a higher drive of your pain system. Your pain system DOES NOT measure damage it measures your bodies perception of damage. Aka you can have a lot of pain and no damage and alternatively you can have a lot of damage and no pain. Pain is based around the context. You ever step on lego? 10/10 pain no damage. Ever have a shower after a sunburn 10/10 pain and yet the water isn’t doing damage.</p>
<p>Source: I am a physiotherapist who works with a lot of chronic and acute pain and particularly persistent pain clients.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every receptor could be a pain receptor if the stimulus is more than it can handle. Ex: for heat receptors, they feel the temperature of things, but if the temperature is too high for the receptor's measurement capability, the brain will interpret it as pain. This is because the receptors are made to measure what the body can take and it makes sense that when this limit is achieved, you risk severe injury or death and need to go away from it. To answer your question, different type of receptors will give different type of pains because pain is just a sensation and the receptor type just adds flavour. <strong>Edit:</strong> Thank you all for info! I am aware of the pain specialised receptors, but this was an ELI5 and they asked about pain feeling differently. Lots of good answers here!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of things can make the pain feel different. One is that you have different types of nerves for different kinds of pain. It takes a different sensor to detect that your skin has been broken than to detect that the temperature is unsafe. </p>
<p>Another is just that the context the pain happens in will change how your brain perceives it. For example if you have someone close their eyes and warn them that they are going to touch something hot, but instead you touch an ice cube to them they may momentarily get a sensation like they've been burned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are different types of pain receptors, different types of nerves that carry the impulses from the receptors to the spinal cord and brain, and different types of neurotransmitters/pain pathways in the brain. Based on the receptors, nerves, and exact pain pathways in the brain that are activated, you feel things differently. These are modified to some extent by past experience, and other stimuli being presented to the brain at the same time (hence your experience of pain depends on your past painful experiences, and what else you are exposed to at the same time).
