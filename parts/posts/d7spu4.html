		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They can be farmed, but it's extremely difficult since they can only grow in very specific conditions that are extremely hard to replicate in any kind of controlled environment.  </p>
<p>Truffles are essentially the fruits of a certain type of fungus, which &quot;bloom&quot; underground, and only is specific conditions. The fungus needs to grow in soils among the roots of specific types of trees, including oak, hazel, poplar, beech and pine. The soils need to have a certain level of acidity, and certain kinds of microbes, and must be near the roots of living trees, because the tree roots provide the fungus with sugars, and the fungus provide the tree with certain essential nutrients.  </p>
<p>In order to farm this fungus, you need to create a setup where you have specific species of live trees, specific types of soil with specific acidity and microbes, in an environment where you can prevent changes in the soil's acidity and microbe community, AND try to prevent other types of fungus from getting into the soil and competing with or even killing your truffles.  </p>
<p>One way that people try farming is by planting seedlings of specific kinds of trees in just the right kind of soil, and, before planting, seeding the roots of the baby tree with truffle fungus so that the truffle fungus gets an early start in establishing a healthy colony, which then makes it harder for competing fungi to come in and get a foothold. And even then, if you have the right trees and right soils and right fungus, an unusually heavy rainy season or severe drought can completely sicken or even wipe out your entire truffle crop.  </p>
<p>So yes, it can be done, but the time and effort and resources and risk involved make it not worth even trying for most hopeful growers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The use of inoculated trees to cultivate Tuber melanosporum and other truffles has proven successful over the past 20 years in Europe and many farms, including two in the United States are now producing French black truffles in other parts of the world.<br />

<p>Truffles long eluded techniques of domestication ... However, truffles can be cultivated. As early as 1808, there were successful attempts to cultivate truffles, known in French as trufficulture.<br />

<p>I also think part of the 'allure' of truffles is that they are so rare. When supply grows, prices will drop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
