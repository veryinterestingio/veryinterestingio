<p>If we only eat when we're hungry why do we have to drink when we're not thirsty?</p></div></div>

If your diet has other components than Jacob's cream crackers, you are consuming significant amounts of water through the food you eat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's actually a myth that we need 2 liters a day. A lot of studies that say we do need that much, were funded by bottled water manufacturers. There was a medical journal in 1945 that said we needed 2.5L, but it also rightfully pointed out we get most of that from food. Real answer is, your thirst is like your hunger - Drink when thirsty, eat when hungry</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1) The recommendations are junk</p>
<p>2) The amount YOU require varies enormously from person to person.</p>
<p>3) The amount you require varies according to what you've been doing, sweating, local temperatures, time of day, how much you pee, etc.</p>
<p>4) You get an awful lot of water from food.  A potato is something like 80% water. 20% solids.</p>
<p>5) Your body knows far better than any statistic what it needs, and will make you desire certain things.  Of course, you have to moderate your bodies desires (like all such things) but if you're thirsty, then drink and if you're not you likely don't need water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes we confuse thirst with hunger. We think we're hungry when we're actually just dehydrated. </p>
<p>Also, you can 'get used' to the feeling of dehydration just because you don't know what it's like to be hydrated. i.e. chronic dehydration causes dry skin, sluggishness etc. but you might blame those problems on other factors. Point is that the symptoms of dehydration are more than just thirst.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have three sensations related to thirst and hunger.</p>
<p>Dire thirst - really need water.  Associated with dry mouth, chapped lips, dehydration, etc
Starvation - when hunger pangs turn into hunger stabbing
Hunger - day to day sensation that it’s time to eat.  This feeling occurs when you need food or water.</p>
<p>So this is why it is advised to drink some water if you are hungry. The feeling may go away.  Your body may be craving water, but there is no separate sensation for this.</p>
<p>You don’t have a drive to drink water because we are taught incorrectly how to listen to our bodies.  It is there, but we typically just snack when hungry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
