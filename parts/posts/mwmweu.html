		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Speech is hard.</p>
<p>This is what is involved in saying 'twang'</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To say the sound /t/ we need a momentary blockage of the airflow with the tongue just behind the teeth at the alveolar ridge. We need blocked airflow but no vocal fold engagement. Immediately after to say the /w/ sound we need to now engage the vocal folds and make an o shape with the lips that then pulls back. We then need to co-ordinate the jaw dropping and lounge moving to the floor of the mouth and back a bit to say the /æ/ sound, while maintaining vocal fold engagement at roughly 110Hz for men, 200 for women. That's the air being forced through the slightly tensed and raised vocal folds to bring them together so that sound passing through vibrates them in a regular pattern. Now let's keep those vocal folds engaged and occlude the mouth again, quickly bringing the tongue up towards the soft palate, further back in the mouth. Also let's lower the velum and open up the nasal cavity briefly so that sound can escape out the nose to make the /ŋ/ sound.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All that to say twang. 4 simple sounds in a split second, involving 6 moving parts all with precise co-ordination.</p>
<p>And that isn't even taking into account any of the other things you can add on, all the tone and intonation. </p>
<p>Language is hard too. That's just the pure mechanics of saying the word. Formulating a whole sentence that is meaningful, conveys what you want to say, makes sense to the listener... it's a lot of processing, at a very rapid speed. Add in anxiety and concerns about social stuff, and we're at a very complex system making a lot of bits move all in co-ordination during a lot of stress. How complex speech is isn't really appreciated enough, we are in awe of people moving just their fingers and feet for pedals when they master the piano but speech involves even more things moving as one in just the right way. And I haven't even mentioned co-ordinating all that with breathing right for speech (which is also actually a major contributor)</p>
<p>And so we expect to see a number of dysfluencies, some stuttering behaviours. 1-3% is normal for everybody, usually of the repetition (the sound, word or phrase is repeated) kind with some prolongations (the sound is stretched out). Much more than that 1-3%, or Blocks (when no sound comes out) and secondary behaviors (other behaviours that the person does or that the stutter causes) are where it starts to become a true stutter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not my specialist subject at all, but I've read a couple of articles on the subject.  To make words come out of your mouth, there is a part of your brain that takes the &quot;words you want to say&quot; messages and controls the parts of your mouth, tongue, breathing and stuff to make the desired sounds come out of your mouth.  There is another part of the brain that deals with hearing and understanding.  That part of the brain takes sounds coming in your ears and identifies word sounds and constructs meaning out of them.</p>
<p>When you actually want to speak, both of these processes are working together.  In your brain you form the sequence of words you want to say, and send them to the &quot;make words come out of your mouth&quot; process.  At the same time the &quot;understanding language&quot; part of your brain is listening to the actual sounds coming out of your mouth and checking that the sounds it is hearing are a correct representation of what you wanted to say.  If it detects something going wrong, it interrupts the making words process and makes you go back a bit and do it again, but right this time.</p>
<p>For people who stammer, there is a mismatch in this process.  The &quot;detect a mistake and correct it&quot; process happens when it doesn't need to happen, and causes a stutter.  Of course once the first stutter happens, there is now a genuine mistake, so the process repeats, and you get caught in a loop of trying to correct the error caused by trying to correct the previous error.</p>
<p>It is well known that people who are prone to stuttering and stammering only do it in certain situations, for example if they are nervous or in certain emotional states, because in those situations, there is a different threshold for error tolerance.  If you are comfortable and with people you trust, your brain just doesn't care as much if it makes a bit of a mistake.</p>
<p>If you can't hear yourself speak, then you can't stammer because it breaks the feedback loop.  If you are singing, then a different process is taking place.  The brain deals with music and language separately.  If you listen to a song, for example, it is very often the case that you just don't follow the meaning of the lyrics because your brain is in &quot;music&quot; mode rather than &quot;language&quot; mode.  When you sing, the sound feedback is being handled by the music part of the brain, so the hypercorrection from the language part of the brain doesn't cause the undesirable interruptions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>im not sure how ELI5 this can be - as there are MANY different reasons and pathologies for stutters so you'd need many ELI5s for each an every one maybe? Other general comments here are kinda covering it but two people's stutters whilst seeming the same may be due to wildly different reasons/causes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The part of your brain that figures out what you actually want to say and the part of your brain that makes your mouth actually say it are both separate areas, all on their own! </p>
<p>That's why you can have a word stuck on 'the tip of your tongue', or stutter over something you clearly have in mind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
