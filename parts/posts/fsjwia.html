		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Listening/hearing is a passive skill, but speaking is an active skill.  A passive skill is something you are able to do without any real effort.   This can include reading and learning, or listening to a language.  All you do is collect the information.  An active skill is something you physically have to do, which requires a bit more effort.  Instead of reading a book, you have to write a book, or write a speech about what you read.  Talking is an active skill.  It requires thought to mouth co-ordination.  Some foreign languages require sounds not pronounced in your mother language.  You know what the sound sounds like, but it could be too difficult to maneuver your mouth and tongue to pronounce it.  When you listen, the correct syntax and form is given to you.  When you talk, you have to think of the syntax and put it into practice.  In other words, when you listen, the other person does the thinking for you, but when you talk, you have to do the thinking.</p>
<p>I dare say that confidence also plays a role.  Some people know a language, but are a bit too timid to speak it because they are afraid of sounding stupid.  In that case, they avoid talking, or claim that they cannot.  However, they do have a fair grasp of the language, so they understand it okay.  If a person who thinks they can't talk is forced to do so, then they usually adapt and end up talking without too much issue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The part of the brain that understands speech is different from the part that we use to talk. As people age the talking part loses the ability to learn how to talk in a new language. This is part of the reason people have accents when speaking a different language than what they learned growing up. There are ways to avoid this, like regularly learning new languages, and it's not the same for everyone but it is common for people to lose the ability to speak a language that is not close to their main language.</p>
<p>The understanding part though never loses the ability to learn and understand new languages. Because of this people who need to learn a language significantly different from one they speak later in life can learn to understand the language just fine but often will be unable to speak without such a thick accent that they aren't understandable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's much easier to understand just a handful of important words/phrases in a sentence than to be able to understand and recall every word needed to make one. </p>
<p>For example, if I tell you that</p>
<p>Ich = I</p>
<p>Gut / guten = good</p>
<p>Morgen = morning</p>
<p>Und = and </p>
<p>And then say &quot;ich essen eine gut Frühstück und ein guten morgen&quot;. </p>
<p>You can probably get that I said that I had/have something good this morning, and that it was a good morning. But if all you know are those 4/5 words, you'd never be able to express the same idea clearly. So if you expand this to a vocabulary of 50+ random nouns or uncongugated verbs, you would probably be able to listen to a speech okay, but could never write one </p>
<p>(Don't criticise my German too much, I'm just starting to learn)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
