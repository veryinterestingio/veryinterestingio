		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Panama uses locks to go uphill to a man-made freshwater lake and then back down. It isn't as drastic effect as the Suez.</p>
<p>The Suez is actually making the water saltier on northern Egypt's coast and is killing native species around there and some species from the Red Sea are crossing over.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One specific items with the Panama Canal is that the native Tarpon have emigrated through the locks over to the Pacific side and are starting to breed in the river systems. It’s take a long time but they’ve actually become quite prevalent in southern panama over the past 15 years or so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Suez Canal is an open cut between the Mediterranean and Red Seas, there are no locks or barriers of any kind. Therefore several species have been able to cross between them.</p>
<p>The Panama Canal on the other hand contains numerous locks, making it much more difficult for anything to cross over it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The not the canal itself, but when the US took over the Panama canal project they sent armies of workers out into the swamps to kill mosquitoes. They basically covered all the open water with a layer of oil and they were actually quite successful in eradicating essentially all mosquitoes in the canal zone. I can't imagine any of that was good for the local ecosystems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
