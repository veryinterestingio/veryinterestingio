So you could put a subwoofer anywhere in the room and you can’t tell which direction it is coming from. I would assume because a helicopter sounds much lower in frequency the same applies here. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few reasons- helicopters fly lower to the ground than planes. The sound also is generally directed downward by the rotation of the helicopter blades. Since the sound waves are generally lower in frequency, they travel much further and reverberate very well from objects on the ground, such as brick buildings and concrete structures. This is what makes it difficult for your ears to determine the original direction of sound. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think its a frequency thing. </p>
<p>Jet engines make a fairly consistent sounding roar, which remains largely the same in terms of how it sounds, EXCEPT for Doppler shifting, as the aircraft moves over, then away from your position. If we assume that a large jet engine is spinning at its higher speed for a moment, that is approximately 25,000 times per minute. Now, I am no mathematician, but seems to me that in order to work out how many times per second that is, you just split that 25,000 into sixty, which cranks out a number right around 417 revolutions per second (or 416.6666667, but that's just a silly number, so I rounded it up for ease of explanation). Now, this is important, because something happening 417 times a second, generally sounds like one, continuous thing that just happens and happens and never quits. </p>
<p>But a typical light helicopters blades rotate at between 440 and 460 RPM, or 7-8 times a second. Your brain does not process helicopter rotor noise as one sound, but a whole series of thumps, or throbs, or however you would call them. There are longer spaces between the sounds, so when you hear the chop of the blade, then the next one, the whole time between those beats, you are lacking real time audio information. Might not seem a long time, but it actually is, in terms of trying to follow the sound. And then you have to consider this: </p>
<p>Sometimes, the echoes of rotor noise, actually bounce off of objects, and smack into the next wave of rotor noise, distorting it, cutting the higher tones out of it, and further confusing the mind of the listener, as to its position. So, imagine a whole bunch of waves on a pool, bouncing off the edge of the pool, then hitting the next wave in the set, distorting it, changing its shape and intensity... Now imagine you are trying to find the origin of those waves, by only the data to be found at the very top of the waves, rather than looking into the troughs of that set of waves.  </p>
<p>That is what searching for a chopper by way of the ears is like. If you are in a heavily built up area, with tall buildings all around, its even worse, because the waves are constantly bashing into one another, tearing one another up, so that you have no hope of telling whether you are listening to an echo, or the original wave, unfettered by impact with objects. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I live in a rural area. When helicopters go over I have no issue determining their location through sound. It's likely that you are in a city. A helicopter flies low and it's noise bounces off of buildings so you can't determine it's true direction. A plane flies high so the noise bounces in a very different way such that you can still generally tell where it is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
