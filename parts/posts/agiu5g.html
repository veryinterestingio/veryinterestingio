		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Medical student here who can explain the basic science (but if any psychologists or other psych professionals want to chime in I'd be happy to hear from you and edit accordingly).</p>
<p>This is a condition that is loosely called pica, but specifically with ice is pagophagia. It's not especially well known but is seen as a behavioral spectrum disorder which may have its roots in evolutionary development. The general idea is your midbrain structures monitor your internal status: hunger, thirst, temperature, arousal (both sexual and otherwise), hormonal, pH, and in this case mineral content. There are known neural/neurohumoral (hormonal) mechanisms by which the midbrain communicates with the &quot;conscious&quot; part of the brain to drive behavior.</p>
<p>Iron is a mineral required for proteins that carry oxygen (hemoglobin) in red blood cells. Iron deficiency leads to smaller red blood cells (&quot;micro&quot;cytic anemia). This isn't the usual state of things so it's thought that the behavioral response changes accordingly and you develop a desire to chew on hard, crunchy things. The idea is that this drove us to chew on rock, clay, and other non-animal sources of iron (in this example we're iron deficient after all, which must mean animals are scarce as they're the primary source of the right kind of iron Fe2+). Women, who are more prone to iron deficiency, are more likely to develop this craving; especially pregnant women who actively create more blood.</p>
<p>We commonly have ice now which satisfies both the desire to crunch on something hard while simultaneously being more sanitary, socially acceptable, hydrating, etc. It doesn't, however, fix the underlying anemia.</p>
<p>That's the short of it, and it's important to realize that brains and behavior are complicated. Chewing ice doesn't mean you're anemic or deficient, just that we tend to see that behavior more often in people who are. Pica as a behavior can also become pathologic, with a driving need to compulsively eat non-food items like glass, chalk, hair, pencils, etc. But that's an entirely different topic.</p>
<p>Edit: The original source of what I'm talking about was from lecture, which is the intellectual property of professors, but here are NCBI links regarding what I'm referring to.</p>
<p>Referrences:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27701928" target="_blank">Pica as a manifestation of iron deficiency</a> - an interesting take on differing forms of pica</p>

<p>The CNS cause of pica is not known, but as early as 2012 there was a study hypothesis regarding pica behavior and the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. The study found that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22430068" target="_blank">Atrazine influence on the HPA did not affect pica behavior</a>, but the main takeaway is that's one of the structures that's suspected to be involved, as it's so involved in other hemodynamic processes. I can't speak with any authority further than that.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another thing that I haven't seen mentioned here yet, is that eating ice improves cognitive performance in people with iron deficiencies. People with iron deficient anemia have reduced alertness and perform worse on neuropsychological test. When eating ice their performance is improved, while in healthy people there is no difference in performance. It is thought that the cold temperature increases blood flow to the brain.</p>

<p>In people, pica is related to iron deficiencies, but in pregnant women eating dirt still isn't will explained.</p>
<p>All we know it's there's more than one reason different animals eat dirt, we just haven't found the one that applies to people yet</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
