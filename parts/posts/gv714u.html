While I write and speak science for a living these days - I call myself a science evangelist - I earned my doctorate in materials science &amp; engineering from Stanford; in many ways that shaped my professional life and set me on that path to write &quot;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Alchemy-Us-Humans-Transformed-Another/dp/0262043807" target="_blank">The Alchemy of Us: How Humans and Matter Transformed One Another</a>.&quot; I'm here today from 12 - 2 pm EST (16-18 UT) to take questions on all things materials and inventions, from clocks to copper communication cables, the steel rail to silicon chips. And let's not forget about the people - many of whom have been relegated to the sidelines of history - who changed so many aspects of our lives.</p>

<p>I think to the stone, copper, bronze, iron ages and wonder how the technologies spread. Will patenting begin to hurt or help the development speed of material methods? (No patent, no funding vs. 'slowed' XX year improvement cycles)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am interested in the current push back against single use plastic.  I see the fact of plastic being such a cheap solution for businesses as a huge economic factor against this movement.
With your knowledge, do you think that people can influence a significant reduction in single use plastic?
Or will the economic factors in favour of single use plastic keep it common for years to come?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
