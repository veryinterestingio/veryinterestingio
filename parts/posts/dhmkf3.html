Rather, we have evolved to find bodily fluids disgusting in a lot of contexts because they often spread disease. We literally go from identifying with the saliva to being repulsed by it when it leaves our body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Personally, I am fine with spit that is still on my body, and most people do not mind the spit film on a piece of candy (say, a lollipop). Same with blood, tears and some types of sweat. I do not go out of my way to consume it, and I would be grossed out by armpit or butt sweat, but getting hand or face sweat into my mouth is nothing awkward unless someone collected it beforehand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
