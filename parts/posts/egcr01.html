<p>Why this happens?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who answered this! I've seen some of your answers, and maybe I wasn't very clear. Yes, I can remember and imagine pictures, places and random things. It's just that for music, it's WAY easier to &quot;replay&quot; it on my mind. With pictures, it's a little bit more difficult. I do not have aphantasia.</p>
<p>Some of you have pointed out that this varies from person to person.  It made sense to me that it was a common behavior, but after reading your comments and thinking about it for some time, I saw that my initial thought was erroneous. Thanks for pointing that out.</p>
<p>Also, some of you pointed out that it's easier to &quot;replay&quot; music in our head for evolutionary reasons.  As our eyes are always occupied with seeing things, if we could just imagine a vivid lion in front of us, it would be a disaster.  That is something that I've never thought about, and makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>And, some of you also said that it's related to repetition. If I'm listening to a song over and over, my brain will remember it perfectly after some repetitions. </p>
<p>So, after reading your answers, I've come to the understanding that this happens because of a series of factors that when combined, will favor my hearing memory instead of my visual memory. And that this is not true for everyone - some may have a better visual memory, and some may not even be able to imagine things at all.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your time, it really helped me understanding these topics.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OP's premise is flawed. Though OP may subjectively feel they have vivid auditory imagery and poor visual imagery, there are individual differences among people with respect to how vividly they can engage in imagery across the senses, and expertise plays a large role:</p>
<p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2044-8295.1994.tb02536.x" target="_blank"><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2044-8295.1994.tb02536.x" target="_blank">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2044-8295.1994.tb02536.x</a></a></p>
<p>Note also that forming a mental image involves reconstruction, and there are far more rules that you can use to reconstruct a song (even rules that you don't realize that you know, e.g., the 8-note octave in Western music, which determine the notes that combine to make familiar chords) than there are rules that you can use to reconstruct visual images of real-world objects.</p>
<p>I'll also point out the curious association between the hippocampus, believed to be critical in supporting your episodic memory system (i..e, your built-in Go-Pro) and olfactory imagery (imagery of smell).</p>
