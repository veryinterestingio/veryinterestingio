		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For ease of explanation we are going to say that your body is mostly a sealed container of all your insides. Inside your body there are slightly pressurized areas with different pressures in different places. When your stomach is breaking down foods and such it creates gasses via chemical reactions. These gasses alter the pressure in your stomach and move around creating vibrations. Your ear interprets those vibrations as sound. Hooray poop!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your stomach uses movement, squeezing, to help break down food. This movement creates noise, especially if theres nothing in your stomach for it to squeeze. Also, if you eat things that are difficult for your digestive system to break down, you will produce gas as a byproduct of bacterial activity which will also make noise as it moves through your body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When your intestines process food, your abdomen may grumble or growl. The walls of the gastrointestinal tract are mostly made up of muscle. When you eat, the walls contract to mix and squeeze the food through your intestines so it can be digested. This process is called peristalsis. One common problem that many people donâ€™t even realize, which is swallowing air. You can swallow a lot of air into the esophagus and the stomach by eating too quickly or talking while eating, and that can cause belching, bloating or rumbling. You can minimize this by eating more slowly and not talking or exercising while chewing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>MD right  here </p>
<p>the movement of the stomach (peristalsis) does not generate noise, the stomach stretches and shrinks while it has something inside, from food to only stomach acid, the movement that generates noise is intestinal peristalsis, it occurs when the intestine stretches, shrinks, widens and narrow to move the food, and gas, this difference in volumes within the intestine causes the noise  remember that there are 25 feet of hose that move in your abdomen and although the movement is forward it is quite messy. </p>
