That doesn't cut you, but a slicing motion with a much lighter pressure does. I know to a point if a knife is being pushed straight down onto your thumb it would go through, but its more pressure then slicing. How come?</p>
<p>Thanks :)</p>
<p>Edit:
Thanks for all the answers, really awesome!
Just to clear up some confusion, I'm not saying pushing down on a sharp knife can't cut you, just it take more work then a slice. For example It's easier to cut into a chicken breast with a light slice then pushing straight down to cut. Sorry for any confusion and thanks again!</p>
<p>You guys are a cut above the rest ;)</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you were to look at a knife's edge through a microscope, you would see something like <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-X9jLqxYWU4E/WQxJTiHgYLI/AAAAAAAAAHE/5AhIShTSSns_6CntdEiIHauSpR8722UTgCLcB/s1600/knifeedgeclose2a_iowa.png" target="_blank">this</a>. There's little tiny bumps all along the edge. Even smooth edged knives are serrated to some extent, with the little bumps helping to saw through foods.</p>
<p>A knife that's sharpened at a very narrow angle can in fact push through soft stuff, since it acts as a wedge. If you want the blade to easily bite into a material, however, you add in the slicing motion to get those little teeth to help out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/Eulers_ID 's answer is a good answer, but there is more to it than that, because slicing along the blade is still better with a perfectly smooth knife. Might not be ELI5 but hopefully useful nonetheless.</p>
<p>Imagine tearing a piece of paper - if you just grab both ends and pull, it takes a lot of force to rip the ends apart. By comparison, if you start a tear on the edge, it's pretty easy.</p>
<p>All those little serrations help because when you slice the blade along something, you are starting a bunch of tiny little tears (called fracture nucleation sites) and then making them longer (and deeper) to make one big cut. Once the cut has started, we are effectively tearing the two halves apart just like the paper.</p>
<p>But wait, <em>why</em> is tearing so much easier than just breaking it all at once? And what does that have to do with slicing with our perfectly smooth knife? It has to do with how crack propagation works. Think back to our piece of paper we were tearing - it took effort (energy) to tear that paper, equal to the force needed times the distance it was applied over. From conservation of energy, that energy had to go somewhere. A bit became heat, but what happened to the rest?</p>
<p>Well it turns out that, much like pulling two magnets apart, pulling atoms apart coverts work into a type of potential energy called <em>surface energy</em>. It doesn't matter if you have a laser cut single molecule leading edge super scalpel, it's still going to take  energy to seperate all those little molecules from each other.</p>
<p>Idealized, for an infinitely sharp blade (or infinitely sharp leading edge of a crack), there is a well defined amount of energy required to cut our bit of apple in two, and you need to supply that energy as you cut. </p>
<p>As we know energy = force x distance. When you push the knife straight into the object, the distance is small and so the force needs to be large. When you run the knife across it, the distance is large so the force needed is small. Ta-da! Watch videos of people doing stuff like slicing grapes - they use a lot of distance (a lot of slicing) so they can make the force as low as possible.</p>
<p>If that isn't making sense,  another way to think if it is like trying to lift something heavy, like a fridge, up to some height. If you try and lift it straight up, like trying to push the knife straight down, it takes a lot of force. If you using a nice long ramp, like slicing the knife in at a shallow angle, its a lot easier. </p>
<p>(<em>Edit to clarify above - as pointed out in a reply, work technically equals force dot product displacement, or force times displacement times the cosine of the angle between them, and not cross product as written above. I've left it that way though, because x is more easily recognised as 'multiplied by' to most non-maths people and this is ELI5 after all</em>).</p>
<p>As a follow on fun fact, the energy absorbed through plastic deformation (which becomes heat instead of surface energy) helps determine whether a material has a slowly propagating tear or just smashes when damaged. Let's take the example of a rock hitting something at high speed. The rock has an amount of energy that needs to be absorbed (kinetic energy). We'll ignore transfer of momentum to keep it simple.</p>
<p>Something soft and ductile, say a sheet of low strength aluminium, will deform a lot before breaking, meaning that almost all of the energy will go to plastic deformation (creating heat), and only a little bit goes to surface energy (making the crack longer). Because it takes lot of energy to propagate a crack, the energy supplied by our rock will run out quickly, and the crack will be pretty short.</p>
<p>By comparison, brittle materials like glass only deform a tiny bit before breaking. As a result, even though glass is strong and tough and the force required is high, the distance is so tiny that barely any energy is lost to deformation. In turn this means almost all of the energy from our rock gets converted to surface energy, and we get a much bigger crack.</p>
<p>If it's tempered glass, which is all under stress like a pile of springs stretched in every direction, once started the crack might actually <em>gain</em> energy and only stop when it hits the edge (or fork and turn the whole thing into a pile of cubes). It's also the reason why inflated balloons pop - the amount of energy stored in being all stretched out is more than the combination of plastic deformation and  surface energy required to propagate a fracture.</p>
<p>Edit: for more ELI25 reading, have a look at <a href="http://web.mit.edu/course/3/3.11/www/modules/frac.pdf" target="_blank">http://web.mit.edu/course/3/3.11/www/modules/frac.pdf</a> - it explains fracture mechanics more accurately and cohesively that I can. Cutting with a knife is a similar process to mode 3 fracture propagation, except because you are wedging the two bits apart instead of pulling them, you don't get all the strain energy release that you normally would.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s the same reason why people are able to stand on 2 swords edges with both of their feet as a gimmick. Merely resting on a blade isn’t enough to cut by anything we use from day to day. The force to cut an apple isn’t that much, but if you catch a knick in the apple(say the core) and jerk the knife through, you will get cut. There’s a reason the Guillotine was changed from a straight piece of metal to one at an angle. The blade was coming down and NOT cutting or at least enough to get a full decapitation. They learned that by making an angled blade that the Guillotine would make a sawing motion on its own, thus making cleaner cuts. So the more flat a surface you can make your thumb and if you pushed it against the straightest part of the blade, it’s not going to cut easy. Effective cutting happens at angles where the point of contact is minimal with what you’re cutting. The best analogy I can use is try ripping a piece of fabric in half. It doesn’t tear in half instantaneously, it tends to start from one end and follow through like a zipper. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
