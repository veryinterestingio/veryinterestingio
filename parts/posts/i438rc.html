		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.mpgranch.com/" target="_blank">MPG Ranch</a> is 15,000 acres of conservation property in Western Montana, focused on restoration and ecology. We seek new ways to understand and restore lands affected by invasive weeds, herbicide use, and other management practices that create disturbances. MPG works closely with local conservation groups and researchers to offer educational opportunities to students of all ages. The health of wildlife and plant populations are some of the central responses we use to gauge our restoration's success.</p>
<p>Through various research projects we've been able to capture and record some incredible data on the area's species, such as the elusive mountain lion population, activity of local bears and the migration of raptors, to name just a few. You can learn more about the work the ranch is doing in a new PBS Nature short film, &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9oZ_iM12WY&amp;t" target="_blank">Inside Montana's Living Laboratory</a>.&quot; </p>
<p>Today's participants:</p>

I read a lot about new species being introduced to handle the problem species (a natural predator brought in to stop a population boom of a pest, etc) but that seems like now you'd just have 2 invasive species.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many restoration ecologists have this fundamental view that the natural world is separate from humans.  But we now know that Native Americans had a heavy influence on the land and its ecosystems throughout North America before contact.  Fire management, gathering practices, hunting of large herbivores all interacted with systems and these are just a few examples.  How do you account for this in your restoration practice and philosophy?  Are you making any attempts to re-create these influences?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
