		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you detonate a bomb at ground level then a lot of the energy is spent digging a hole which is useless. You want the bomb to have a clear line of site to a large area for effective destruction</p>
<p>It's also important to note that if a 10 PSI overpressure will collapse most reinforced concrete structures then there isn't much value in hitting them with a 50 PSI overpressure, they're collapsing either way. Nuclear bombs are generally detonated at a height that maximizes the range of their 5 PSI overpressure which will knock down most structures and is almost universally lethal</p>
<p>There's also an interesting effect where the shockwave hits the ground and then bounces back up still expanding. This means that the edges of the shockwave are extra strong because they're the combination of the initial shockwave coming outward from the bomb and the shockwave reflecting off the ground. This results in extra damage and increases the radius of the 5 PSI overpressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think about shouting in a pillow, most sound is absorbed by it. </p>
<p>The ground does the same thing, if you explode a nuke at ground level, most of the force will go into the ground. If you explode it in the air, it will have a larger reach.</p>
<p>Of course, a ground level nuke would have more devastating effects on the impact point, but even a fraction of a nuke power is enough to kill and destroy, so you just spread that force over a wider area.</p>
<p>Side note, in the past they built some massive nuclear bombs (Castle Bravo, Tsar Bomb), but they ditched the idea because they were uneffective. Multiple smaller bombs are more effective than a huge, single bomb.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A good question! To help understand, when the bomb explodes it pushes out it every direction evenly to create a big sphere. If you detonate it in the air you can pick the distance above the ground where the widest point of the sphere touches the ground so it covers the most area. If you waited and let it explode once it hits ground level a lot of energy is wasted pushing dirt out of the way and digging into the ground instead of traveling above it like in the air burst detonations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Non-shaped charges explode in a sphere so at most about 50% of the shock wave, aka kill potential, will reach a target. Now if you put that explosion in contact with a surface, 50% of the kill potential goes directly into the ground. The remaining kill potential goes into the sky and a small ring radiates outward and thus about 15-25% of the power of the bomb actually reaches the intended targets. You also have to take into account the light emissions of a nuclear weapons because that flash can also kill. When you detonate it on the ground the surrounding structures will occlude anything behind them thus further reducing the destructive power of the weapon.</p>
<p>If you take that same explosion and put it at a moderate height, 50% of the kill potential reaches the target area and increases the effective yield by greater than 2x vs a ground detonation. This is obviously far more devastating. In addition to increasing the direct impact of the shockwave and flash, both will bounce off of the ground further increasing the kill potential ( by a small margin ).</p>
<p>Thus air bursts are far more deadly than surface detonations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
