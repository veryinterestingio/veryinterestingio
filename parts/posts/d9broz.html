<blockquote>
<p>Optical Tweezers use light to manipulate microscopic objects as small as a single atom. The radiation pressure from a focused laser beam is able to trap small particles. In the biological sciences, these instruments have been used to apply forces in the pN-range and to measure displacements in the nm range of objects ranging in size from 10 nm to over 100 mm.</p>
<p>The most basic form of an optical trap is diagramed above. A laser beam is focused by a high-quality microscope objective to a spot in the specimen plane. This spot creates an &quot;optical trap&quot; which is able to hold a small particle at its center. The forces felt by this particle consist of the light scattering and gradient forces due to the interaction of the particle with the light. Most frequently, optical tweezers are built by modifying a standard optical microscope. These instruments have evolved from simple tools to manipulate micron-sized objects to sophisticated devices under computer control that can measure displacements and forces with high precision and accuracy.</p>

<p>You can also use a scanning-tunneling electron microscope to manipulate individual atoms, or you can use something called an Atomic Force Microscope and a very fresh probe. </p>
