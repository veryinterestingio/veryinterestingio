		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One metric is the rate of positive tests. Let’s say you tested 100 people last week and found 10 cases. This week you tested 1000 people and got 200 cases. 10% to 20% shows an increase. That’s especially the case because you can assume testing was triaged last week to only the people most likely to have it while this week was more permissive and yet still had a higher rate.</p>
<p>Another metric is hospitalizations which is less reliant on testing shortages because they get priority on the limited stock. If hospitalizations are going up, it’s likely that the real infection rate of the population is increasing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As has been mentioned, testing postivity is used as an estimate for testing saturation. In normal circumstances, the percent positive tests should be &lt;5% based on normally <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/coronavirus/natl-trends.html" target="_blank">circulating coronavirus trends</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-capacity" target="_blank">Hospital utilization</a> is a potential estimate of burden based on known disease severity and local catchment populations and in reverse, we can <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/hospitalizations-forecasts.html" target="_blank">forecast hospital burden</a> based on various assumptions and known population and disease parameters.</p>
<p>The real silver bullet measure that epidemiologists are looking for are sero-prevalance studies, those let us know who has been infected so far. CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/commercial-labs-interactive-serology-dashboard.html" target="_blank">just released a large study</a> based on a convenience sampling of blood banks, not the greatest, nor even really representative sample but you use what you got in public health. India also did a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-53485039" target="_blank">similar study</a>.</p>
<p>This is just a very basic overview, if you're more interested, CDC has <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/purpose-methods.html" target="_blank">their methodology</a> available.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This doesn’t directly answer your question, but I think it’s related. A very simple but helpful metric is the number of excess deaths. In any city, or an entire country, the number of deaths in any particular month tracks pretty closely from year to year - unless there is an unusual event.</p>
<p>Across the country and in a large number of large cities, deaths have spiked this year. That’s pretty obviously attributable to Covid.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about that metric is that the amount of testing is irrelevant. The trend started showing up in April and is still in force now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Measures like hospitalizations and deaths can be good indicators, as these don't really depend on how many tests are being done. Because a relatively stable percentage of patients will require hospitalization or die from the disease, you can interpret the relative changes in these values to reflect a relative increase in infections.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I never understood why this is even an issue.  If you test 100 people and 10 come back positive, then the following day test a thousand and 200 come back positive, - those same people would still be positive if you had tested them or not.  The just wouldn't know it.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be better to know how many are infected?  I'm sure there is a very high percentage of people that never got tested and yet had the virus.  They still had it, but don't count to the numbers since they never had that swab rubbing the back of their tonsils.  </p>
<p>Expanding testing would just show how many are actually infected.  Lessening testing would make the &quot;official&quot; positive numbers go down, but would be completely inaccurate and dangerous to the public's well being since there would be a high amount of undiagnosed cases running around town.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
