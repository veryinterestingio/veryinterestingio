		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a stem cell biologist and director of the UCSF Diabetes Center. My lab aims to generate unlimited supplies of insulin-producing cells to unravel the mysteries of diabetes, with the ultimate goal of combating and defeating the disease. We just published a paper demonstrating for the first time the successful creation of mature, functional insulin-producing cells made from stem cells. Read more here: <a href="http://tiny.ucsf.edu/7uNbjg" target="_blank">http://tiny.ucsf.edu/7uNbjg</a></p>
<p>My lab focuses on type 1 diabetes (T1D), which is the result of an autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Currently the only cure for T1D is a pancreas transplant or beta cell transplant, but these options are only available to the sickest patients, who then have to take immunosuppressants for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>One of the biggest problems in diabetes research is that it is really hard to study these beta cells. They sit in the pancreas, an organ tucked away in the back of our bodies, that is hard to access in living people. We can obtain beta cells from cadaveric donors, but often the process of isolation affects the functionality of the cells. Therefore, one can argue that there is still a lot we do not understand about human beta cells, how they function under normal conditions, how they deteriorate in diabetes, and how one can possibly fix them. </p>
<p>By producing working beta cells in the lab, we've opened new doors to studying diabetes as well as new options for transplant therapies. Down the line, we hope to use genetic engineering technologies such as CRISPR to produce transplantable cells that don't require lifelong immune suppression.</p>
<p>I'm really excited about this work and looking forward to your questions. I'll be starting at 9am PST (12 ET, 16 UT). AMA!</p>
<p>EDIT: I am signing off now, thank you for all the thoughtful questions and comments! </p></div></div>

How does your team plan to prevent the immune system from attacking the new beta cells? Do you all plan to transplant the cells back into the pancreas or are there plans to place them in a pseudo pancreas, like a skin patch?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
