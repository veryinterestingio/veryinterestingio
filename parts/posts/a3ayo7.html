		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Antarctic one is the “famous” one but there was also an article in Nature in 2005 about an Arctic ozone hole and occasionally a hole will form over Tibet (albeit not as intense). The Antarctic one was primarily exacerbated by the polar vortex in the Antarctic that fed into a seasonal increase in reactive chlorine that destroys ozone.</p>
<p>Hope this helps! I think it’s just that we hear about this one because it goes back farther (found in the eighties) and was worse. Ozone depletion (or too high of levels in the troposphere) are problems in other places as well, just not as severe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While not disagreeing with the other answers provided, there are additional details<br />
1) A smaller hole does/did form over the Arctic<br />
2) The ozone destroying chemistry occurs when the ozone depleting chemicals condense on ice crystals that form high in the atmosphere at the center/calm area in the center of the polar vortex. The catalyzed ozone destroying reaction occurs on the surfaces of those crystals.  The Antarctic polar vortex is much more stable, forming over the center of high landmass/ice cap surrounded by ocean. The Arctic polar vortex tends to shift and be much more turbulent in comparison to the Antarctic vortex. As a result, it is warmer than the center of the very cold Antarctic vortex. The above the stratosphere ice crystal clouds do not form as strongly in the Arctic as they do in the Antarctic, and when they do form, they don't tend to last as long as the one in the Antarctic. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As no one mentioned this till now, I'd like to add that the whole process is periodic and the hole over Antarctica last for only about 3 months. Just like others mentioned, there is a vortex (funnel) that forms, but one even more special phenomenon is the formation of Polar Stratospheric Clouds (PSC). These provide ideal conditions for degradation of ozone. As these PSCs are formed inside the vortex, the ozone depleted air inside and ozone rich air outside the vortex do not mix. This is why the process of diffusion fails to bridge the gap as long as there is a vortex. After 3 months the vortex disappears and thus the hole is healed.</p>
<p>So the reason this process is not so well pronounced in the north pole is due to the fact that CFCs and sunlight are mere catalysts in the process of Ozone degradation. But the formation of PSCs is the major prerequisite for Ozone degradation. <strong>In north pole, the PSCs form during the 6 month sunset, that's why the reaction is not catalysed.</strong></p>
<p>P.S: this cyclic phenomenon happens during September to November every year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some good answers, but basically it comes down to the South Pole usually gets a few degrees colder (\~180-190 K) than the North Pole (\~190-200 K) over their respective winters.</p>
<p>Colder temperatures are better for ice crystals to form.</p>
<p>The freeing of radical chlorine and bromine atoms happens on those ice crystals.</p>
<p>Radical chlorine and bromine atoms catalytically destroy ozone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
