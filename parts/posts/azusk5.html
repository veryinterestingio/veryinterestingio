		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, first off, some people can wake themselves up with their own snoring. Both my dad and I have done it.</p>
<p>Basically the reason most people can sleep with it is because it's consistent enough and your body expects the noise (similar to how you can't tickle yourself because your brain expects it), so it doesn't wake you up like an unexpected noise. It's like how you wouldn't wake up if the heating turned on while you were asleep. It's not unexpected, and it's background-y enough for your brain to ignore it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Snoring occurs when the back of the throat loses muscle tone and flops down to literally block the air moving in and out.  Snoring occurs when the air movement is almost but not totally blocked. </p>
<p>When it gets really bad, the airway can get totally blocked.  Note that the chest and stomach will keep trying to push air, but air flow will be very limited.  When air doesn't move, its called &quot;Apnea&quot;, and when it happen during sleep, it's called &quot;Obstructive Sleep Apnea&quot; or OSA.  If air doesn't move, you get the same result as if someone placed a pillow over your face...the blood oxygen goes down and the CO2 rises.  This causes increases in blood pressure and heart rate as well as a few other things that can be very harmful to the body.  Normally, the person will wake themselves up just enough to start normal breathing and then they slip back into this OSA state.  This repeating cycle can happen several times a minute through the whole night, with snoring occurring before and after the total OSA state.</p>
<p>When this happens, it usually occurs before necessary REM sleep,  so the person can claim to have slept for hours but still feel exhausted.  Unfortunately, a lot of people will have booze or drugs to &quot;help them sleep&quot;, but this make the OSA worse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone has tissue in their throat and nose. Some people have more due to many different reasons such as being overweight, having a broken nose, smoking,Etc. When you fall asleep and you get all relaxed in your bed, the tissue in your throat and noses gets relaxed to. </p>
<p>Now Imagine that your throat is a kazoo (that annoying child’s noisemaker). As air passes through your kazoo it vibrates that little membrane ( your throat tissue) which makes noise (a snore). Now the harder you blow the louder the noise your little kazoo makes. Same with a snore. If your throat tissue relaxes to much you struggle to breathe causing you to have to work harder moving air through your kazoo.</p>
<p>To answer the second question. Snoring can and does wake most people up though not always from the noise. Have you ever blew really hard on a kazoo? It tickles your lips with the vibration of the membrane. Well the same thing can happen when you snore. In my case I wake up more because I feel myself snore. But I have woken up because it was so loud. Another way it wakes them up is that they can stop breathing which in my father’s case caused him to start coughing which woke him up. </p>
<p>But your right some people can sleep through it and some people can sleep through a train going right by their house. If you hear it all the time I’m sure you body just gets use to it and tunes it out.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This is a lovely question and gaining popularity (which is great). I do invite anyone seeing this to give a quick read to our rules before commenting. In particular rule 3. Basically top comments need to be direct explanations or direct follow up questions. Many people snore (myself included), but this isn't the place to share personal stories or anecdotes about that.</p>
<p>Enjoy,</p>

<p>EDIT: In a sorry update we do need to remove this post as based on a false premise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
