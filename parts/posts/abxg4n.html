		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>5Ge is AT&amp;T marketing for the latest release of LTE Advanced called LTE Advanced Pro or sometimes Gigabit LTE.  It is essentially a backport of some 5G technologies that are compatible with the LTE Advanced hardware to provide a transitional network.  This allows for a faster network without requiring complete replacement of the radios.</p>
<p>Real 5G has been launched in some test markets, but as of now there is no benefits to it for mobile phones.  Right now there are very few mobile phones that have 5G radio.  5G radios right now are typically on a separate chip which means they decrease the battery life.</p>
<p>Don't look for real 5G to be widely available until 2020.  Real 5G requires a hardware upgrade on the towers and phones.  2019 will start to see 5G showing up in more phones but carrier coverage will likely still be somewhat limited to larger markets.  </p>
<p>You can get 5G in some markets for fixed wireless services.  These are the mobile companies attempt at the home internet market.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I understand your confusion, as cellphone makers will not exactly lie, but not tell the truth either about what 4G means.</p>
<p>There are several  current ways to implement a wireless radio based network, and to be honest its a MESS of standards.</p>
<p>ripped right from wikipedia to show how convoluted this aspect of networking has become:</p>
<p>&quot; LTE is commonly marketed as <strong>4G LTE &amp; Advance 4G</strong>, but it does not meet the technical criteria of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4G" target="_blank">4G</a> wireless service, as specified in the 3GPP Release 8 and 9 document series for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_Advanced" target="_blank">LTE Advanced</a>. LTE is also commonly known as 3.95G. The requirements were originally set forth by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU-R" target="_blank">ITU-R</a> organization in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMT_Advanced" target="_blank">IMT Advanced</a> specification. However, due to marketing pressures and the significant advancements that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WiMAX" target="_blank">WiMAX</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolved_High_Speed_Packet_Access" target="_blank">Evolved High Speed Packet Access</a> and LTE bring to the original 3G technologies, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Telecommunication_Union" target="_blank">ITU</a> later decided that LTE together with the aforementioned technologies can be called 4G technologies.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication)#cite_note-3" target="_blank">[3]</a> The LTE Advanced standard formally satisfies the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU-R" target="_blank">ITU-R</a> requirements to be considered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMT-Advanced" target="_blank">IMT-Advanced</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication)#cite_note-4" target="_blank">[4]</a> To differentiate LTE Advanced and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WiMAX-Advanced" target="_blank">WiMAX-Advanced</a> from current 4G technologies, ITU has defined them as &quot;True 4G&quot;.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication)#cite_note-5" target="_blank">[5]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication)#cite_note-6" target="_blank">[6]</a> &quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication)" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE\_(telecommunication" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE\_(telecommunication</a>)</a></p>
<p>So, LTE advanced *IS* a 4G (fourth generation) networking system....except that.. its not TRULY?</p>
<p><del>If you want to get super gritty with it all, I believe IEEE</del> <strong><del>802.16</del></strong> <del>2-2016 is the current documentation that I would trust.</del>  </p>
<p>Its all just a mess..</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well to answer the last part, no, true 5G won't come too soon. 5G can't be simply installed on a tower. It doesn't have the range to blanket an entire city. They have to install on rooftops in cities for the time being. And it has issues penetrating walls like 4G can. I've seen estimates that service extends as low as 500m from the transmission site. So they have to spread transmitters all over like a net.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/329808/not-quite-but-close-att-starts-5g-evolution-i.html" target="_blank">Here's an article on the '5Ge' distinction.</a> It's essentially 4G+.</p>
<p>Edit: a word.</p>
<p>Also like to point out that I should have said that while there are some ‘true 5G’ coverage areas, they’re few and far between for the moment, and last I saw there were like 2 or 3 available phones that could take advantage of it, besides some router devices. That iPhone or Android you have on you now can’t take advantage of it.</p>
<p>What is almost certainly rolling out first to most places is apparently ‘5Ge,’ which is just really enhanced 4G. It’s a bit like if Ferrari took a Nissan and through in some engine enhancements and then marketed it as a Ferrari. It’s not really a Ferrari, it’s an enhanced Nissan.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Until 5G, the G meant generation.  1st, 2nd, 3rd generation --  the 4th generation had two competing technologies,  LTE seems to have de facto won, but it took too long for the technology to win a singular 4G naming convention. </p>
<p>5G is also the 5th generation wireless telecom technology, but some clever engineer also though to double the operating frequency from 2.4 to 4.8 GHz to make it approximately 5GHz as well. (5G wifi is called 5G because it operates at this frequency, but is wifi,  not 5th generation wireless)</p>
<p>And since range of a signal is less at higher frequency,  as others have stated. It requires more infrastructure to operate, and thus will take time and investment to propagate through the world. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
