		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The feeling of hunger is induced in your body by the secretion of the ghrelin hormone in the stomach. It does not mean that your body is out of fuel, it just means that your stomach was expecting some food and didn't get it. </p>
<p>When you fast for a certain period of time, your body automatically stops demanding food and switches to burning the fat stores for fuel. If your body is &quot;fat-adapted&quot; (it becomes used to consuming your body's fat easily), the period of fasting required for this to happen is less.</p>
<p>When you're using your fat for fuel, you don't feel hungry anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body makes chemicals called hormones. Different hormones come out at different times of day. My anatomy prof used to refer to the “daytime cocktail” and the “nighttime cocktail”. The hormones at night help you rest (melatonin), regrow your muscle tissues (growth hormones), and digest the food left in your GI track. The daytime hormones are the ones that make you get up and feel energized (like cortisol, testosterone, adrenaline, thyroid stimulating hormone). You might not know what all of those do, but I bet you’ve heard of adrenaline. That’s the chemical responsible for “fight or flight”.... imagine you were in a tense situation, where you either need to run away or fight for you life. In either of those situations, eating is the last thing on your mind! Adrenaline suppresses hunger feelings.  Together, the day time chemicals give you a burst of energy, so you don’t feel like you need to refuel with food right away. </p>
<p>Everyone’s body is different. The proportions of different hormones and when their levels rise in your body are different for each person. </p>
<p>Hope that makes sense. Feel free to ask if you have follow up questions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
