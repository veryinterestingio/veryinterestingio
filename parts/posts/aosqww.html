		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are right, it is a ridiculous thing to say. It is also important to remember two things about people who write these (and any) articles. </p>
<p>1) Their job is to write articles and those articles are products to be consumed. The more readers, the more profitable the site is. This means investing a lot in a few deeply researched and well thought out articles, or cranking out loads of pop science level articles for mass consumption. </p>
<p>2) The authors are not experts on the subject matter. Most don't have advanced degrees or experience in the subject they cover. Spending 15 minutes interviewing an expert doesn't make you an expert.</p>
<p>Being someone who used to follow Space.com, I think they fall squarely in the pop sci arena. Many of their articles are non-discovery based and pointless. And it's not their fault, they cover a subject that progresses slowly over years. But as a business they have to &quot;engage&quot; readers multiple times a day. Hence the large amount of fluff.</p>
<p>This is something to consider when reading articles on any site, science, news, food, entertainment, technology, etc. All authors who have a consumer level understanding of the subject and are trying to rush through work to get home to see their families or friends, just like the rest of us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not right to say that 96% hasn't been discovered, but we don't really know the nature of it. If we assume the standard model of cosmology is correct, our best measurements of the universe suggest that it's composed of about 68% dark energy, 27% dark matter, and 4% regular matter.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter" target="_blank">Regular matter</a> is everything we can see... anything from people to cars, from clouds to trees, from stars to galaxies. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter" target="_blank">Dark matter</a> is a type of matter we believe to be out there in the middle of galaxies that would explain various things about the universe, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens" target="_blank">gravitational lensing</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy" target="_blank">Dark energy</a> is a little bit more complicated, but the amount of it out there is estimated from the expansion rates of the universe. </p>
<p>So out of everything we believe to be in the universe, we've only &quot;held&quot;, &quot;seen&quot;, or studied here on earth enough to confirm it truly exists, about 4% of the universe. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, it's a silly claim, like saying that we only use 10% of our brains.</p>
<p>But there is a serious way to tackle problems like this. Consider counting the number of fish in a pond. First you catch some, tag them, and put them back. Let the fish mix in, then catch some again.  If half of your fish are tagged, then there are 2x as many fish total.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you're cataloging animals in the rainforest, and only 10% of the animals you find are known species, then there are about 10x more species out there to finish cataloging.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe &quot;discovered&quot; in this sense just means &quot;looked at&quot;. The 96% percent comes from the amount of the observable universe we can see and have seen. Since we know the universe is 13.7 billion years old the oldest light we possibly could see is from 13.7 billion light years away (a bit more due to the expansion of space in all directions). So anything beyond that threshold we can't see or interact with. So really who cares, that space is reserved for theoretical physics (aka math).</p>
<p>The idea that the universe is infinite is another larger question science doesn't yet have an answer for. It could be a 3D projection on a 4D object, spacetime could be a &quot;sphere&quot; and if you travel in one direction you just end up back where you started. We could be a simulation. We have no damn clue. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
