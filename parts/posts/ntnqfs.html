		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Telescopes typically have a field of view somewhere from 0.01 to 1 degrees (squared if you consider both dimensions) - really rough guideline and it depends a lot on the telescope. Antares, one of the &quot;widest&quot; stars from Earth, has an angular diameter of ~0.00001 = 10^(-5) degrees. Between telescopes on opposite side of Earth, the place of Antares in the sky only varies by 0.00000000015 = 1.5*10^(-10) degrees. It's completely negligible for stars.</p>
<p>If you want to watch the Moon then it is important. It will appear in notably different places relative to the stars. That was the historic way to measure the distance to the Moon - 2000 years ago, no telescopes required. Measuring that effect during a Venus transit (much smaller, but observable with telescopes) was the historic way to measure the distance to the Sun and generally distances within the Solar System.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The geometry in your diagrams are good, but you vastly underestimate how far stars are and how well we can resolve stars. The field of view of telescopes is far larger than any single star, so you can't meaningfully use your trick to look at the left vs right side of a star.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a geometric perspective, ignoring the limitations of telescopes and of light, the telecopes would be diverging.</p>
<p>Practically, the largest star by apparent size is only 57 milli-arcseconds (0.000016&deg;) across so that even the largest telescopes need to use special techniques to resolve it.  Still, that star only appears so large by having a diameter over 30&#8239;000 times greater than the earth's.  Being on opposite sides of the earth would affect the direction by that many times less than pointing at opposite sides of the star.  So, definitely diverging.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The second diagram (diverging) is correct, there's really no other way of looking at it. The first diagram is incorrect because it depicts the star as smaller than Earth. If two people are looking at the edges of something with a converging view, then the object is smaller than the distance between the two people. The distance from the people to the star has nothing to do with whether or not it's diverging or converging. Yes, the difference between the two edges of the star are not really detectible, nor is the difference in the location on Earth, so it's basically parallel, but all you asked is whether it's theoretically divergent or convergent, and it's divergent. As the diagram gets more realistic, meaning the star gets further away, the angles get smaller, but they will never hit or cross 0 degrees and become convergent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From an observer’s perspective on the ground they will appear to be converging. This is simply due to the curvature of the planet and the star’s relative position in the sky to each observer. From an absolute perspective, they would be diverging. People keep responding with examples of distant stars, but you could actually imagine this experiment with the sun as the target and a point printed in the center of the telescope’s view field. </p>
<p>As a further example someone in America could look to the East at a rising sun, while someone in  Europe could look to the west at a setting sun and it would appear that they are looking towards each other. But that only applies if you maintain that “towards” means following the curve of the planet. If you drew a line from each person’s perspective point to opposite edges of the sun, they would be diverging.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
