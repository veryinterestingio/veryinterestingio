		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>because it's never completely dead, just not producing enough steady current to work. when you remove it, you broke the circuit and the battery builds up some charge which is released at once when you insert it back. then it's &quot;dead&quot; again, producing not enough current inside your remote.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A battery is basically just two electrodes, and a permeable barrier between them that lets ions pass but not electrons.  At each electrode there are chemical reactions, the reactions at the negative electrode deposits electrons at the terminal, the reaction at the positive electrode removes electrons from the metals and move those electrons into the other reacting chemicals. </p>
<p>So both those reactions occur at some rate, a slower rate as the battery is depleted.  When the battery is installed in a device, electrons move from the negative terminal, through the circuits, back to the positive terminal.  So, the voltage of the battery is determined by the amount of free electrons on the negative terminal compared to the positive terminal.  When you take away the drain of the circuitry, the number of electrons, and hence the voltage, is allowed to build up by the chemical reactions at the negative and positive terminals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many incorrect answers here. Depending on the chemistry, a dead battery's voltage will rebound slightly when removed from a load (the remote), even though the vast majority of the capacity is used up. So the rebounding voltage might be briefly high enough to power the remote, but when the remote tries to draw current, it will quickly drain the battery back to its low voltage, dead state because the battery can't provide any more capacity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A battery is dead when the resistance across the battery and the circuit it is trying to drive drops the voltage below the threshold the device needs to function. Battery's have resistance themselves, in addition to generating voltage. When you take the battery out and slide it back in, you scrape off a little bit of the oxide that has built up on the batteries terminals (or on the contacts in the remote) or both. This slightly decreases overall resistance. Not enough to make a significant difference. Your battery is dead after all, but enough to briefly raise the voltage across the battery enough to bump it over the threshold the device needs to operate. It fails pretty quickly because as the ions migrate inside the battery and the battery slight ly heats up, the resistance rises again, dropping the voltage below the remote's operational threshold</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called 'rebound', and it is typical for batteries. As a battery is discharged, spent chemicals have to migrate away from where the reaction happens, and fresh reactants migrate back. As long as there is plenty of active chemicals there, this happens quickly enough to keep the battery running, but when it is nearly discharged, this slows down. As long as you keep the battery connected, the chemicals will be consumed as soon as they migrate in, but there's never enough to produce enough voltage to run the device. But disconnect it, and the chemicals build up, so the battery can work. But it won't take long for those available chemicals to be exhausted again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
