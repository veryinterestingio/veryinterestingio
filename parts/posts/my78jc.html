		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First some clarifications. (1) For petroleum reservoirs (and the same is true for groundwater reservoirs, i.e., aquifers), the right mental image is something like wet sand. The fluid occupies pore space (basically the space between grains that exists because most grains that make up a rock are not perfect cubes that can stack with zero space between them) within the rock, not large exclusively fluid filled areas. (2) Reservoirs are never completely empty after extraction is completed. We often talk about this in terms of stages of recovery, i.e. primary, secondary, or tertiary recovery. This <a href="https://www.energy.gov/fe/science-innovation/oil-gas-research/enhanced-oil-recovery" target="_blank">page</a> provides a nice overview, but to summarize:  Primary recovery is basically a series of holes into a reservoir, which relies on the pressure within the reservoir and pumping in the producing wells to extract oil, which on average will allow you to extract ~10% of the oil in the reservoir. Secondary recovery involves a second set of wells where you inject water to &quot;push&quot; some of the oil towards producing wells and typically allows you to get upwards of 40% of the oil in the reservoir. Finally, tertiary recovery involves injection with additional techniques or additives to try to loosen the oil more (heated water/steam, gas injection, polymers, etc) and can get you closer to around 60% of the oil (or maybe more in ideal scenarios). Ultimately though, you will never get 100% extraction with drilling, pumping, and injection AND in the secondary and tertiary production phases, you are replacing the oil with other fluids for the most part which will mostly be left behind when extraction ceases.</p>
<p>Ok, so with the clarifications out of the way, the process of oil extraction does have some noticeable surface impacts. The main one is subsidence, i.e., sinking of the ground surface, which is observed in areas of intense petroleum or ground water extraction (e.g., <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/98GL52260" target="_blank">Fielding et al, 1998</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425712003975" target="_blank">Chaussard et al, 2013</a>, <a href="https://se.copernicus.org/articles/11/363/2020/" target="_blank">Metois et al, 2020</a>). Largely what is happening here is that especially during primary production when you are extracting fluid but not replacing fluid, the reduced volume of fluid in the pore space allows the reservoir rocks to compact somewhat. This compaction is driven by the overburden pressure (i.e., the weight of the rocks above the reservoir) and the lower fluid pressure in the reservoir as the fluid was essentially helping to keep the pore spaces open in the rock. The compaction of the reservoir rocks in turn causes sinking of the ground surface, i.e., subsidence. The broader impact of this subsidence really depends on the background context, but it can increase the flooding risk depending on the proximity to rivers or the ocean. In contrast (and as discussed in a few of the references above), injection can cause inflation of the ground surface in the areas around the injection wells.</p>
<p>The process of oil extraction can also cause seismicity, both through the extraction of fluids during primary recovery (e.g., <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/geology/article-lookup/17/10/942" target="_blank">Segall, 1989</a>, <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/bssa/article-lookup/81/3/948" target="_blank">McGarr, 1991</a>) but also from injection during secondary/tertiary recovery (e.g., <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/110/47/18786.short" target="_blank">Gan &amp; Frohlich, 2013</a>). Both of these would be considered &quot;induced seismicity&quot; and are just a smaller subset of human activities which can cause earthquakes (e.g., <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001282521730003X" target="_blank">Foulger et al, 2018</a>). The mechanisms are complicated, but can relate to stress changes resultant from reduction (extraction) or increase (injection) in pore pressures, but also changes in fluid volumes on faults, or simply changes in overburden pressure (i.e., a reduction in weight from removing fluids). </p>
<p>Importantly, this answer obviously doesn't consider the myriad of other environmental issues related to oil extraction and consumption and is focused on the very narrow issue of physical impacts of removing fluids from the ground (since that's what OP asked about). There are of course <em>huge</em> environmental impacts of oil extraction (e.g., habitat destruction to build the necessary infrastructure to extract and transport petroleum, what happens to waste products during production) and consumption (e.g., anthropogenic climate change) and lots of thorough reviews of these out there (e.g., <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.energy.28.050302.105617" target="_blank">O'Rourke &amp; Connolly, 2003</a>). Finally, it's worth noting in terms of &quot;issues they could bring up in the future&quot;, that a lot of the characteristics of oil reservoirs are the same characteristics we look for in ideal places to sequester carbon (e.g., <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/elements/article-lookup/4/5/325" target="_blank">Benson &amp; Cole, 2008</a>). There are some issues with using old oil reservoirs for hypothetically storing carbon, mainly related to the reduction in pore volume that may have occurred during primary production which would make it less suited for sequestration.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Some wells, after depletion even go on vacuum. These especially are used for injection wells.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the nature of the reservoir. Oil and gas were already covered here thoroughly. I will add that coal being a solid object is closer to your mental image of a physical void underground. You have a situation in north Germany for instance where centuries of coal mining have resulted in the region at risk of falling into the sea. The government has built <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LseK5gp66u8" target="_blank">pumps that have to operate forever</a>, or at least, as long as people don't want to live underwater.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Petroleum reservoirs can be thought of bubbles trapped under ice.  The petroleum floats on salt water and gets trapped in the pockets of a layer of impermeable material above above them. </p>
<p>As the oil and gas  is removed, the salt water rises to take its place. </p>
<p>The earth is made of many different layers of material, some which is impermeable to oil and some that isn't.  The oil flows through the stuff that is permeable, think gravel and sand, and rises to the surface unless trapped by something it can't flow through.  The thing that makes the oil flow is saltwater, which is heavier than oil, pushing it upwards.</p>
<p>In short, when you extract oil, something such as salt water or clay, takes its place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
