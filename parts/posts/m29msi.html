I obviously know the moon is tidally locked, but I know very little about planet science and wasn’t sure of how rare or common the phenomenon is. I suppose I’ll do more research before coming to this sub and asking such a basic question. To those that did help and were so polite in doing so, thank you immensely, you’ve given me a lot to go off of.</p>
<p>I'm trying to come up with interesting settings for a fantasy/sci-fi novel, and this idea came to me. If its possible, what would the atmosphere and living conditions be like for such a planet? I've done a bit of googling to see what people have to say about this topic, but most of what I've read seems to be a lot of mixed opinions and guessing. Any insight would be great to have!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tidally locked objects in space are quite common. Our moon is tidally locked with Earth, Mercury is *almost* tidally locked with the Sun, in fact there are several moons in our solar system that are tidally locked with their planet. If I remember right the closer the bodies are to each other the more likely they are to be tidally locked.  There's not much information on this outside of our solar system due to the difficulty to measure this phenomenon, however there is a concept known as an &quot;Eyeball Planet&quot; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyeball_planet" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyeball\_planet" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyeball\_planet</a></a>) which I believe would provide you with more insight as to what you're looking for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>They are definitely a consideration for habitability. The argument being, with the vast temperature swing from one side to the other, a “habitable” zone would likely exist somewhere in the middle. </p>
<p>It is all theoretical. Everyone is “guessing” we just don’t have enough data to make statements with great certainty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
