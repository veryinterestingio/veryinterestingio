		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Often, the cause is your muscles relaxing during sleep allowing a nerve ending to squeeze between two vertebrae (spinal bones).  When you wake up, your muscles contract and your spine squeezes together damaging, or even trapping, the nerve between the bones.  The damaged nerve can take days, months or even years to recover.  It's called Cervical Radiculopathy.</p>
<p>Another cause is the relaxation of your jaw, and damage or trapping of nerves in that area.  This can be related to TMJ (temporomandibular joint) disorders.</p>
<p>I've found that one of the best remedies for this problem is to stand against a wall, point my chin down and push my head and shoulders back against the wall as hard as I can for at least 10 seconds.  This pulls the vertebrae apart and can allow a pinched nerve to be released.</p>
<p>edit: it has been pointed out to me that a more common cause is simply inflammation due to repetitive muscle strain.  This is caused by weak muscles in your neck being strained during your sleep, probably because of a bad choice of pillow or poor sleeping position.  You might find certain muscle strengthening exercises will help you with this over time as you strengthen those weaker muscles.  Office workers who sit with their heads in one position for long periods of the day may have this problem more often than other people with more active lifestyles, and increasing your daily activity should help (get up and walk, look at the sky and the grass and the trees a few times a day!).  Honestly this didn't occur to me at first due to OP suggesting the pain lasting for a few days and then going away.  Typically for me this has been a nerve pinch.  Repetitive muscle strain is usually something that comes on slowly and doesn't go away quickly either.  You may be able to tell if it's a muscle thing or a nerve thing by putting a warm compress on your neck (a warm wet towel), if the warm compress helps then it's probably muscle strain and not nerve damage.</p>
<p>NOTE: I am not a doctor.  I am a software engineer.  I get neck pain working at my computer, and I keep active in order to prevent muscle problems. I know about my own pain, that is all.  If you are experiencing pain that isn't going away or comes back often then go see your doctor please!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eli5: Your neck bones are like a tent staked to the ground. If you spin the tent a little it will still be standing but won't be right until you turn it back. </p>
<p>More info:
This is controversial so be the first to say username checks out. That being said it's an isolated rotation of a single cervical vertebra. This rotation is only a few millimeters but it causes increased pressure on the nerve root, and the misalignment will cause inflammation in the muscles and connective tissue that connects to that vertebra. </p>
<p>So here is my breakdown of what is happening you can decide if this fits your experience or I am a crackpot on your own. </p>
<p>You wake up with slight soreness and stiffness in your neck.
What happened - in your sleep you moved in some way that caused a vertebra to rotate in your neck.</p>
<p>As the first day progresses the soreness increases significantly, at some point it plateaus.
What happened- Inflammation is increased in surrounding muscles and connective tissue causing more pressure and pain.</p>
<p>For the next several days pain my slightly improve or worsen but it is never significantly better.
What happened- the cause has not been fixed so the inflammation continues.</p>
<p>One morning you wake up and the pain is 80% better miraculously.
What happened- you moved in the opposite way in your sleep and have fixed the rotation. Their is still some inflammation that will take a few days to resolve completely.</p>
<p>Source: I am a physical therapist assistant that suffered from this chronically prior to getting my education. I read about this in an osteopathic journal and a realignment technique that I have successfully used to treat myself. This is borderline anecdotal so see below for others to tell you why I am wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a massage therapist so my answer may differ from other health care professionals.  Someone already nailed the relaxing muscles, spine shifts, wake up and it pinches nerve roots...
But I also see alot of muscle over reactions. Like spasm (guarding), constant tone, adhesions/trigger points (knots). These can be cause by dehydration, long term shortening of the muscle belly, whiplash, bone disorders/Injuries.... so many options...
But basically your muscle is like 'hey man, something is wrong, I'm really upset about it, I'm gonna stay upset and tense until you fix the problem, and make sure it doesnt get worse&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answers have covered this very well. I might just add that you can visit an osteopath and often they'll be able to remedy it. It can last much longer than days, even months. It can cause constant cervicogenic headaches and a litany of other symptoms.</p>
<p>You can try to avoid it by a) not sleeping on your front and b) buying a specialist pillow, with a dip in the middle that allows you to sleep flat on your back (in the dip) or raised on your sides. The goal is to try to keep your spine in a neutral position. Sleeping, studying, working, doing whatever with bad posture can and will really fuck you up one day, I don't recommend it. You won't have a warning, it'll just happen and it'll suck balls. Take care of your posture, your spine connects to everything so fucking with it can cause any and all pains, anywhere and everywhere in your body, at once. And it might never go away. Take care of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ayy I can use my work for this now.. this can happens in couple different ways. </p>
<p>-cold breeze towards your neck
-born like it
-or just simply having your neck in a weird position for the entire night. </p>
<p>What happens is that one side of your neck gets really stretched while the other side is in a contracted position. This is called torticolis or wry neck. Babies can have this as they’re born if things aren’t properly align when they come out. </p>
<p>This is pretty uncommon to have unless you do have bad sleep mechanics. But ultimately it does suck not knowing what happened and worrying because you can barely turn your head without feeling sharp pains on one side. </p>
<p>But the goods news is that it can resolve itself within 7-10 days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
