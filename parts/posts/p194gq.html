<p>Sport mode is typically just adjusted throttle response and shift points. The throttle will be a little more responsive/touchy and the transmission will hold a gear until higher in the RPM band before shifting. Eco mode is going to be the exact opposite of that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>What ECO-mode usually does is make the throttle softer and put power-hungry features, like air-conditioning, in a lower power state.</p>
<p>Sports mode depends more on your vehicle. If it has dynamic suspension, it will most likely stiffen up the shocks and maybe the sway bar, reducing roll in the corners. Some models also reduce the power steering for a heavier steering feel, increase the shifting rpm for automatic gearboxes, perhaps open a flap in the exhaust for sportier sound and change the throttle map so you get more power earlier in the pedal movement, making the car <em>feel</em> more powerful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends alot on the car and how advanced the modes are.</p>
<p>Suspension compression and/or rebound rates can be varied, I think commonly with electromagnets and reactive fluid in the shock. There could be other technologies as well.</p>
<p>Traction control can be turned on/off/varied. Could be through the differential locking/unlocking or by applying braking force to various wheels. </p>
<p>Ignition timing can be altered. Advancing the timing will usually be more of a performance mode but requires higher octane fuel. </p>
<p>The amount of fuel or number of cylinders used might be reduced in an eco mode. Some trucks will cut down to 4 cylinders when cruising at a steady speed. </p>
<p>Some cars have launch control, which will hold the car at a high rpm to get a faster drag racing type launch. This could be done with a proper trans transbrake, but I think this will often use the vehicle brakes. </p>
<p>Shift points on automatic transmission could be changed, generally for economy you'll shift sooner for acceleration you'll shift later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the car but most likely gear your car will run on. </p>
<p>If it’s on eco mode, it’ll try to keep the rpm as low as possible to save gas but acceleration won’t be as good. </p>
<p>On sports mode, most likely keep gear low to maintain high rpm, giving you higher acceleration</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>When you are stopped at a light, eco mode in newer cars will often turn off the engine and lower/stop the AC, heater, seat heating, and usb power. Sport mode and often normal mode (but not all cars, some match eco) will leave the engine on and not adjust climate and power. As soon as you take your foot off the brake and/or the car begins to move, the engine immediately starts back up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
