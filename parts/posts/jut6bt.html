How do the really tiny birds not blow away in the wind?  Do they hide in a nest and grip onto it to stay still?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Birds are blown around when the wind blows.  Watch one when it flies past the edge of a building, and you'll see the wind blow it.  </p>
<p>Birds can fly, and wind is always a potential thing, so they just learned to deal with it.  If the wind blows one left, they just steer back to the right to compensate.</p>
<p>To remain still, birds need protection from their nest, or the tree the nest is in, or the building next to the tree where the nest is located.  Birds pick places to hang out during windy periods with these features in mind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bird feet have a rather distinct anatomical property in that should the leg joints be folded, the ligament and muscle structure forces the claws to clench. The only way to safely unclench the feet is for the bird to straighten out its joints again. It's like if you crouched down and this caused your toes to curl inwards. Presumably, this would be invaluable for them not to be easily dislodged by other forces like winds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What scenario are you thinking about?  </p>
<p>Nests can get blown away by the wind as can eggs and chicks.<br />
I have seen large seagulls fly backwards during heavy winds by the ocean so I believe smaller birds would seek shelter during heavy winds / unfavorable conditions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They get blown all over the place when the wind gets gusty.  As long as they aren't close to anything, they can just compensate by flying into the wind.  You'll notice though, sometimes they will have a pretty hard time landing on small targets like branches when the wind gets bad, and at a certain point, the wind is just too fast for them to fight it, and they find somewhere sheltered to wait it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As with rushing water, you can compensate for greater opposing forces by swimming (or flying in this case) at a 45 degree to the wind. You still get pushed around, but your net gain for energy expended is acceptable. Short answer, they still get blown around, but if you have the right technique, which I assume a bird would, you can still make progress.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
