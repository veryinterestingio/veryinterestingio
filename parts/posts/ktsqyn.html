		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body needs moisture to work properly. So the grip of your hands is kind of determined by all the ridges, and their ability to sell swell and squish. All those little lines, like your fingerprints and such, they fill with water when there's moisture, and then when you grab things, they are able to apply extra pressure, creating better grip. Obviously this swelling is near microscopic, but have you ever stayed in the water until your hands prune? That is your skin swelling to give you grip in such a wet environment. </p>
<p>I'm using this to train for teaching my kids(1yr), hope this is good. </p>
<p>EDIT:: Apparently this is not true, some say at all, some say partially. I really appreciate the likes and awards, but I hope all you people that are calling me out for being wrong are also down voting this, and upvoting the correct answers.
This is what I learnt through my life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two forces at work here when it comes to wet grip: Surface tension and Friction.</p>
<p>Water molecules want to cling to things. When water is surrounded by water, it clings to the surrounding water. The surface of water, however, can't cling as much to surrounding water and thus will cling to anything that touches it.</p>
<p>So, if you have a thin layer of water on your hands, the surface tension from the water will cling to things, which will feel a little grippy. But, if you add too much water, the water below the surfaces will cling to itself and become slick.</p>
<p>The stronger force from grip comes from friction. Friction comes from frictional coefficient and force. Water lowers the coefficient of friction, so water will always make grip from friction weaker.</p>
<p>So: Having slightly wet hands will provide grip to things that don't require force (like opening a plastic bag, which is really pulling the two parts of the bag apart, not gripping them) The surface tension will provide some cling. Too much water, however, and surface tension is negated by the slickness of the water under the surface.</p>
<p>However, any wetness will reduce grip generated by friction, which is our main gripping ability, as we can control friction by pushing harder. So overall the grip &quot;from a little wet&quot; is only useful in certain circumstances, in almost every other case dry hands will aide grip more.</p>
<p>Edit: I missed one thing: skin (and some absorptive fabrics and materials) soften when wet. This leads to a higher coefficient of friction. However, most non absorptive materials, when wet, have a lower coefficient of friction. Additionally, as I stated, too much water acts as a lubricant and lowers friction on most materials. So... It really depends on the materials and how much water there is water will make two materials grippier or slipperier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water sticks to water, making wet things stick to wet things. If the layer of water is thick the surfaces can easilly slide because water easilly slides across itself. </p>
<p>However, if the water layer is thin and the surfaces aren't smooth then the surfaces can still touch in a lot of places. The water can still stick the surfaces together, but not be thick enough to make sliding easy, and the sticking caused by being wet makes sliding even harder than if the surfaces were dry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A little bit of water (like licking your fingers to open a plastic produce bag) can help with grip in some circumstances but not all--this is why, for example, athletes sometimes use chalk bags. </p>
<p>If you're talking about circumstances like opening a produce bag, then it's more to do with surface tension than with any potential softening of the skin layer, I believe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water has a high surface tension. Think of this as water molecules being so attracted to themselves that they minimize the surface area at any water/air interface. This is why water forms into beads or droplets. If you add a little bit of water to your finger and apply it to a plastic grocery bag or book page, when you pull away the top layer of the bag or book page will move with your finger. Separating from your wet finger would require that the water/air surface area increases against the surface tension force which is trying to minimise the area.</p>
<p>If there is enough water to produce a thin film between two sliding surfaces lubrication will occur. Some good examples of this are bearings, air hockey tables, or walking on wet brick. You would only notice this briefly while walking, but the thin layer of water would cause you to slip before your shoes contact the ground.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
