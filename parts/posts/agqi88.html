		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said,  raw resources like water,  hydrogen,  metals,  and silicon are readily found throughout the universe so it's unlikely that they would come for those especially since interstellar travel would already take tremendous amounts of resources.  They'd likely have self sufficient food, water, air and manufacturing production easily solved long before leaving.   </p>
<p>I don't really buy aliens attacking without provocation any time in the near future since we're many generations away from being able to attempt interstellar travel,  let alone being able to threaten another planet.   Maybe they've been attacked themselves and view any life as a potential existential threat or maybe they're thinking on such long time scales that we can hardly fathom what they would consider important.*</p>
<p>However, if their homeworld orbited a dying star or they faced a similar catastrophe then earth would be a mighty tempting target.  Other redditors have posted illuminating discussions that explain why alien life might very well be more like us than not (regarding how unique and flexible water and carbon are and why other elements are not) so it wouldn't surprise me if an alien visit were to be by carbon and water based life.   </p>
<p>*I love the other theory about them wanting our biomass but that verges into sci-fi speculation, along with any other explanation based on them having entirely alien and unrelatable motivations.   Sure,  maybe they want to assimilate us or forceably evolve is into a more advanced species but we should focus on the reasons that make sense to us first. </p>
<p>Edit 1: Comments on this post have been insightful and are well worth a read.  Very good points were made that aliens could want to wipe out <em>any</em> life they find to eliminate future threats, that intelligent life is what makes Earth so rare so they'd come to exploit that, and my personal favorite: that an alien race could have set out to a habitable planet with no malicious intentions and after tens of thousands of years they arrived and found it occupied.  Without the prospect of a return trip and facing extinction they would simply take it by force since it's us or them.  </p>
<p>Edit 2: I want to clarify that my answer is based on a strict interpretation of the question - this is about an <em>invasion</em> so I've downplayed things like them wanting to obliterate us from afar because we might become a threat or why they'd want to come peacefully. </p>
<p>Side note edit: I personally feel that interstellar travel takes so long and consumes so many resources that the likelyhood of <em>any</em> type of first contact is quite low.  Moreover, a species advanced enough to make the trip probably doesn't really need anything that we have that they would have to take by force.  Still an awesome discussion to have.  </p>
<p>I like to believe that peacefully seeking out alien life is the natural apex for a species that has fully developed itself and that is what could drive them to explore the stars.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the most interesting ideas I’ve read about (posited by the author Iain M Banks) is one of alien tourism.  The idea is that it is super rare to have a moon that’s the same size as the sun when you’re standing on the surface of a planet, and that the total solar eclipses we get would draw intelligent, curious alien species here to view them.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
