		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It comes from the French revolution when the common people (or more accurately the upper class merchants who were not part of the nobility or the clergy) started to get upset with the situation in France. As a prelude to the revolution they split from the traditional body of discussion after being told they would essentially have no power in it (the nobility and clergy would run everything) and formed a new body called the National Assembly.</p>
<p>Within the National Assembly there came to be two major groups. One group thought that liberation from the monarchy/king was important (&quot;liberals&quot;) while another group wanted to keep or conserve the monarchy/king (&quot;conservatives&quot;). Like minded people started sitting together at the assembly so that the liberal favoring ones where on the left side of the President/moderator while the conservatives sat on the right. This led to the press starting to call them the &quot;left&quot; and the &quot;right&quot; when discussing the political situation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, it was incidental to the National Assembly during the French Revolution. Pro Revolution members sat on left, Anti Revolution members sat on the right. As the Revolution progressed this remained consistent. Those insisting on further reform continued to sit on the left, while those satisfied with the revolution or those who thought it went too far moved to the right. Lafayete famously made the trip all the way from the far left to the far right before fleeing Paris. </p>
<p>The identification of the left with socialism didn't happen until the revolutions of 1848, when they first held seats in European assemblies. That was before Marx started writing and they were mostly defined by their allegiance to full &quot;social&quot; revolution rather than merely political revolution promised by contemporary democrats. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the French Revolution, they held a big meeting to determine the future of the country.  The liberals (who wanted to change things radically) sat on the left while the conservatives (who wanted to keep things close to how they were under the monarchy) sat on the right.  The newspapers reported on &quot;the left&quot; and &quot;the right.&quot;  And we still use it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
