<p>You can get some pretty cold days in summer that are cooler than some winter days! Can you clarify what you mean? That it never snows? But it's never 35 degrees in winter, either?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The hypothesis of your question feels wrong. I feel there are as many of both, and that you are just more picky to call a cold day in summer a &quot;winter day&quot; that you are to call a hot day in winter a &quot;summer day&quot;.</p>
<p>I mean, I don't know where you live. But where I live (Lyon, France), in winter it is usually 5°C (40°F), and we call it a &quot;particularly hot&quot; when it is 20°C (70°F), and in summer it is usually 30°C (85°F) and we call it &quot;particularly cold&quot; when it is 15°C (60°F). An both of them happens, and it didn't feel to me like one was more frequent than the other.</p>
<p>[Excluding global warming that makes winter of nowadays slightly hotter in average than few decades ago]</p>
<p>Even moving through France, I never had days in Winter that were like hot days in Summer. The only reason why some days feel hot is because I'm not in Summer clothing so 20°C in winter clothing feels hot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This very much depends on the climate of where you live. In Canada, where I am, winter temperatures are usually around -10C. You might get a day of +5C in winter, but you would <em>never</em> get a day that's 15-20C like you get in summer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
