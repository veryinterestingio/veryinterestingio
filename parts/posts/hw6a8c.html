		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The frying oil removes moisture from the outside and creates a crispy shell. The moisture that is inside is now trapped and heats the inside to a fluffy consistency.  This makes a crispy outside and fluffy inside... the perfect french fry. </p>
<p>After as little as 8 minutes outside of the oil, the moisture inside starts to redistribute through osmosis, rehydrating the crispy shell, making the fry soggy and limp.</p>
<p>If you were to put fries into a refrigerator which is a very dry environment, the moisture is lost and you get the &quot;cardboard&quot; fries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they are fluffy due to moisture. Once they dry out they become very dense and &quot;cardboard&quot; like, even though they are still just as much food as they were before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
