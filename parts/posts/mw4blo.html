		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have given good answers, I just want to point out that Canada has, by and large, the same latitude as central and northern Europe, certainly not southern. Like 80pct of Canada is above the 49th parallel (which defines most of the Canada-US border). If you Google a map of Europe with the 49th parallel drawn over it, you can see Canada in general doesn't overlap with any southern European states</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s not just the gulf stream.  Southern Europe being Spain, Italy, Greece, South France, warms up too because of the Mediterranean and the Mountains in central Europe blocking cold weather systems from the North from rushing in.  The desert areas of North Africa also provide stable high pressure that is hot and arid.</p>
<p>Canada has similar weather in Coastal areas such as Victoria, Vancouver.  Due to the same coastal mountain landscape.</p>
<p>Although there is more precipitation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all southern Europe is not on the same latitude as Canada. <em>Lake Superior</em> is on the same latitude as Austria (Same size too). Not realy southern Europe.</p>
<p>Secondly, southern Europe is as warm as it is, because it has a maritime climate, caused by the Mediterranean sea. The Mediterranean is very warm because it has little movement of water.</p>
<p>Additionally the gulf stream heats up northern Europe. Which certainly has an impact on all of the Continent.</p>
<p>There are the Alps, which have a large impact on European climate.</p>
<p>There is the Sahara, which often blows warm winds our way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is it at the same latitude though? Most southern point of Belgian (not south Europe and hardly warm) is the same as the big straight US/Canada border at 49°N. So I guess with Canada you mean the 2% most southern part of Canada?</p>
<p>Edit: oké oké, the 'hardly warm' part wasn't completely necessary since OP didn't say 'warm' but 'warmer'.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
