		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This post has CoViD-19 in the title but is a question regarding the human body and how it handles common colds and flu strains which are commonly received and dealt with throughout a normal life.</p>
<p>Is there any permanent damage caused, or is it simply temporary or none at all? Thanks!</p>
<p>Edit: I had a feeling common colds and flu strains had long lasting effects, but the fact that I didn't realize it until I was reminded and clarified by you all is a very important distinction that this isn't something we think about often. I hope moving forward after CoViD-19, the dangers of simple common illnesses are brought to attention. Myocarditis is something that I have recently learned about and knowing how fatal it can be is something everyone should be aware about.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a generally held strong suspicion that a lot of autoimmune chronic disease is cause by as yet unidentified viruses or bacteria - Most likely ones we're already aware of.  There's a Nobel prize in finding the links.</p>
<p>For example there's a few big trials at the moment looking at the link between dementia and chronic coldsores (as opposed to primary herpes, which is harder to do big long term trials on) , and whether antivirals can protect against dementia - Would be big if true, particularly as the drugs are cheap.</p>
<p>Edit: To everyone in comments asking if their X infection could have caused Y.  This is the internet, someone will come at you with a great anecdote or mechanism telling you that your Y is clearly caused by X.  Don't give into the temptation to strongly agree, most autoimmune disorders have not been shown to have clear causes at this time.  You're human, you want to see patterns in noise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Happened to me in my mid-20’s ... one day I was fine, the next day I was completely deaf on one side and couldn’t even walk. It took months to recover my balance and my hearing is still severely compromised, although I did regain the high frequencies. Weirdest thing is going outside during a raging thunderstorm and all that ear can hear is the soft sound of raindrops. Low frequency sounds just ... don’t exist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>There is a large body of observational and clinical trial evidence that shows that influenza vaccine protects against AMI. Estimates of the efficacy of influenza vaccine in preventing AMI range from 15% to 45%. This is a similar range of efficacy compared with the accepted routine coronary prevention measures such as smoking cessation (32–43%), statins (19–30%) and antihypertensive therapy (17–25%). </p>

<p>Many viruses are commonly associated with myocarditis, including the viruses that cause the common cold (adenovirus); COVID-19; hepatitis B and C; parvovirus, which causes a mild rash, usually in children (fifth disease); and herpes simplex virus.</p>
<p>Gastrointestinal infections (echoviruses), mononucleosis (Epstein-Barr virus) and German measles (rubella) also can cause myocarditis. It's also common in people with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
