		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most astrophotography is done using cameras/telescopes with motorized mounts/tripods. Using computer software you can 'lock-on' to specific celestial objects, and the mount will track the object as it moves across the sky.</p>
<p>Long exposures are done by capturing light over multiple nights and then using imaging software to 'stack' the images, combining their visual information.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, you need to use special hardware (EQ mount + tracker) to make sure your telescope moves at exactly the same speed as the Earth rotates, so you always have the same stars in focus.</p>
<p>Then, you take dozens of pictures that range from a few seconds to several minutes of exposure. The better you are aligned, the longer your exposure can be.</p>
<p>That process can be repeated several nights in a row, which is how you can get total exposures longer than 18 hours at a time.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The light you get is extremely faint, but by taking so many pictures, you can feed all that information into specific software to &quot;stack&quot; them and reveal all these details.</p>
<p>To give an analogy, imagine you had done all that process using traditional film instead of a digital camera. You have a full roll of 24 faint pictures of your subject. You could expose each negative one at a time onto a single sheet of paper to reveal all the hidden details.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand, these guys use telescopes with very fine servos / stepper motors programed to the motion of Earth / stars so that the telescope is pointing precisely. Now for daylight and light filtering I'd bet they use software to analyze and filter the colors post video / picture collection. So...bunch of data and processing in the end.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

As a PGA tour professional, he's definitely in the rich category. From what I can tell, it's easier to go from an astronomer to a photographer than from a photographer to an astronomer.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I dabble in astrophotography, I try to do it on the cheap, and I haven't had too much success! I've built a 'barndoor' tracker but it's a bit wobbly at the moment! One thing I don't understand - do 60 x 1 min exposure = a single 1 hour exposure? surely there is a number of photons that a pixel needs to register? if this isn't reached in a minute surely it doesn't matter how many 1 min exposures you take? The images on here are superb though, something to strive for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
