		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no struggle, the world has standardized on the international system of units, commonly called the metric system.  Even in the US, where feet and miles are still common, those units are defined, legally, in terms of their metric counterparts.</p>
<p>The adoption of the metric system by US consumers has been slowed by the stupendous cost of such a change, and the limited value to most users.  It's like moving to one language, or one electrical outlet, the sunk cost of the installed base is huge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, well we have been disagreeing on time untill recently too.  The Julian Calendar was replaced by the Gregorian Calendar, changing the formula for calculating leap years. The beginning of the legal new year was moved from March 25 to January 1. Finally, 11 days were dropped from the month of September 1752. </p>
<p>But to answer your other question - These are pretty much globally agreed upon units.</p>
<ul>
<li>Length - <strong>meter</strong> (m)</li>
<li>Time - second (s)</li>
<li><strong>Amount of substance</strong> - <strong>mole</strong> (<strong>mole</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>Electric current</strong> - <strong>ampere (A</strong>)</li>
<li>Temperature - <strong>kelvin</strong> (K)</li>
<li><strong>Luminous intensity</strong> - <strong>candela (cd</strong>)</li>
<li>Mass - <strong>kilogram</strong> (kg)</li>
</ul>
<p>But with regards to your seconds have been used for 2000 years. This is slightly wrong.... they did exist as a unit since like 3500BC ... but werent measurable and often were replaced with a pendulum swing or a hearbeat to keep count. In fact.... im pretty sure Galileo (who was born in the 16th Century), invented the pendulum so he didnt have to keep using his heartbeat to count. This could help keep things accurate to the minute level, and it would be nearly another century before we started measuring seconds using a pendulum clock. So the second did already exist before this, but we couldnt measure it until more recently.</p>
<p>As for the other SI units - <a href="https://www.simscale.com/blog/2017/12/nasa-mars-climate-orbiter-metric/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.simscale.com/blog/2017/12/nasa-mars-climate-orbiter-metric/" target="_blank">https://www.simscale.com/blog/2017/12/nasa-mars-climate-orbiter-metric/</a></a> </p>
<p>That is a link to a story which sort of explains why we still &quot;struggle&quot; with standardising units.... and how NASA were being stubborn with it, until they lost a probe on the way to mars because no one checked to see what units were being used by different agencies involved. And it also goes into a small amount of detail into why the different standards came about.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What struggle?  Most of the world operates under the metric system, and while large swaths of the world use imperial units, they tend to use metric units in many (most?) scientific, academic and commercial applications.  In other words, for most of the world, most of the time when it matters, we use standardized units of measurement in almost all things.  Not too many people measure in hogsheads per league or fathoms per fortnight anymore...</p>
<p>Of course, there are some (many?) in the USA who decry metric units as some sort of nefarious plot to impose a one-world government, but it's best to just ignore them until they become relegated to the trash bin of history (IMHO).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Setting aside that most of the world has standardized other units of measure, as others have pointed out, the way we measure the passing of time has been essentially the same in all cultures for at least a couple millennia: we mark the passing of seasons and cycles of the moon. These are observational from most everywhere on the planet.</p>
<p>We eventually mostly settled on seconds, minutes and hours as we know them today, but it took centuries to do so. Even as recent as the early 19th century the French under Napoleon were pushing the adoption of a decimal clock: 10 hours per day, 100 minutes per hour, 100 seconds per minute.</p>
<p>In truth we haven't entirely standardized everything: we don't all follow the same calendars. Most of the world follow the Gregorian calendar, but some countries don't. Iran and Afghanistan follow their own calendar, Ethiopians have their own, India nominally uses a different calendar, and many Islamic countries predominantly use the Islamic calendar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what time frame you go by.
If you're talking about hours, that's also been relatively standardized. Noon used to be, generally, when the sun was at its peak. So noon in denmark was a bit longer during summer than noon in italy. And subsequently shorter in winter. (to my understanding that's why it's referred to as high noon) I think the standard timezone was set in the 1800s in Greenwich and surprise, where the english colonization occured, the people would be forced to adopt that time frame or any trade partners with the english for easier business transactions. </p>
<p>If you are talking about years, that's still not standardized as different countries and cultures have different years (jewish, taiwan, china(?) and etc all have a different year). </p>
<p>I believe we have rome and more importantly caesar for the standardization of months. And that might help you understand why months were so quickly adopted because wherever rome concurred or traded, those countries would either have to or adopted this calendar system because the romans did it. </p>
<p>Not an expert, just my understanding so take everything with a grain of salt. But definitely some starting points for you to look into</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
