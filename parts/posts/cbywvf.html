		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A couple answers here are misleading. Even without air currents, the atmosphere wouldn't separate into pure layers. When you mix together ideal gases with different masses they just add together linearly, meaning the partial density distribution of gas A in a mixture of A and B is the same as the density distribution of A on its own. The atmosphere isn't really an ideal gas, but the density is low enough and the interactions between atoms are so weak that it's a decent approximation.</p>
<p>To get separated layers, there needs to be significant intermolecular forces that prefer for A molecules to be near other A molecules and not near B molecules. Otherwise the entropy gained by mixing will overcome the tendency to separate.</p>
<p>Edit: clearly my original answer was not clear enough, I'll try to improve it. Because heavier gases tend to settle closer to the surface, the relative composition of a mixed gas would gradually change as you go up in height with lighter elements becoming more common. However, this is very different from forming distinct, pure layers like oil and water. There are no sharp transitions between regions of different composition and no regions of purely one gas or another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The average motion due to diffusion and mass transport due to air currents exceeds any tendency to segregate via buoyancy.  The atmosphere is  well-mixed and the innermolecular/atomic forces are weak compared to the average kinetic energy of any atmospheric gas. Only at very high densities would one expect stratification to occur.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It does.  It is just that at the levels we deal with (significantly below 100km), there is a lot of mixing.  As you go out farther you get less mixing and more stratification.  If the earth's atmosphere was *much* , *much* thicker you would see more stratification.</p>
<p>As a side note that thickness would give us a much higher temperature, as the primary driver of greenhouse effects is atmospheric thickness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The gas is too hot, so diffusion forces are much, much greater than buoyant forces. If the atmosphere was as dense as, say, the Venusian atmosphere, we'd expect some degree of stratification, like we see on Venus.</p>
<p>Couple this with large scale convection (e.g. Hadley cells) and there is no tendency for Earth's atmosphere to stratify on mass.</p>
<p>Light gases are lost not via buoyancy, but by attrition. There's an equal mix of atmospheric gases in the thermosphere and ionosphere (and we have the samples to prove it!), but a solar proton hitting an N2 molecule isn't going to send that nitrogen very far. A solar proton hitting a H2 would accelerate it to escape (well, not escape but far enough away that the solar magnetic environment determines the molecule's path). This selective process is how Earth lost all its lighter gases. Earth has plenty enough gravity to hold H2 and He down, but not with solar particles hitting them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
