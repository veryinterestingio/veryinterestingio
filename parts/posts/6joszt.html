		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work at a vein surgeon's office. I actually asked him this.</p>
<p>Basically, when you are standing, blood flow slows and &quot;pools&quot; in your legs due to gravity. But when you walk, your muscles contract and push the blood in your veins and vessels back up into your upper body. </p>
<p>On the side note, seasoned military personnels are able to stand at ease for long periods of time because they are actually swaying back and forth very slowly in micro-movements  to contract their muscles and relieve the tingling and numb sensation you get when you keep standing for long periods of time.  </p>
<p>Edit: As others have suggested, not locking your knees is also key</p>
<p>Edit 2: As others have mentioned, micro movements could be flexing your calves, distributing weight back and forth between your heels and toes, wiggling your toes, etc. </p>
<p>Edit 3: If you have persistent leg problems even without prolonged standing and even after conservative measures (compression stockings, exercise, etc.), I would recommend getting a referral to a vein specialist from your PCP (in the US) to get it properly treated. You may just have bad veins. </p>
<p>Whoa! My very first gold. Thank you stranger ?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your leg veins have <a href="http://www.merckmanuals.com/~/media/manual/home/images/cvs_one_way_valves_veins.gif?la=en&amp;thn=0" target="_blank">one way valves</a> in them. They work when the <a href="http://www.theveincenterar.com/images/Picture4.jpg" target="_blank">skeletal muscles around them contract and release.</a></p>
<p>When you are walking around, the flexion/relaxation of the walking muscles are literally pumping the blood back to your torso.  When you are standing still, you aren't getting that pumping action naturally.  You <em>could</em> flex/release your legs intentionally, while standing, but it's not nearly as effective as walking is.</p>
<p>Hope that makes sense!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the answers on here are focused on blood flow which is great but it misses a big part of it. Your joints are lubricated by their joint fluid (synovial fluid). The way the get new fluid and nutrients is through movement. When you stand still the fluid is not refreshed and it tends to dry out in a sense. This makes joints painful and causes that stiff feeling when you try to start moving again. Shortly after moving the fluid and nutrients are replenished and things move again.</p>
<p>Circulation is a big part but joint movement is what provides the fluid flow. If you kept your joints still and contracted the muscles to get blood flowing you would still feel the majority of stiffness and aches.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blood in your body is pumped by the heart. This moves it out, away from your heart. The blood vessels that lead away from your heart have valves that keep the blood from flowing backwards. As blood reaches the farthest part of your body it is separated into many tiny tubes that supply all the parts of your body. This causes the blood to slow down A LOT. </p>
<p>When blood goes to return to the heart there are valves in the in those blood vessels which help to prevent blood from flowing backwards. Also, because it has now slowed down it does not move back to the heart very easily, the forward pressure is much lower than in your arteries. This allows gravity to overcome them and allow blood to flow backwards (this is less common in a healthy person). The tubes in your legs that send blood back to the heart are surrounded by your leg muscles. When you walk they are squeezed and this pushes the blood back to your heart. Without the extra pressure from your leg muscles pumping it can be difficult to overcome the force of gravity pulling downwards on the blood. </p>
<p>When you stand those muscles aren't pushing the blood so it becomes harder to move it. This means that the old, used up blood, is stuck in the lowest point of your body. This is your feet. Because the blood is used up it has no oxygen to keep the muscles in your feet healthy. </p>
<p>When your body senses there is not enough oxygen it sends signals to your brain that trick it into thinking there is pain. This causes you to try and move the part of the body that is in pain which ideally allows fresh blood to flow in with new oxygen. This is also why it feels like your chest burns when you hold your breath. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Walking increases blood flow. Standing causes it to pool in your legs. More blood flow means more oxygen to the muscles and more efficient removal of edit: lactic acid buildup. Standing also means keeping your muscles rigid, which is much more stressful on them than simply moving, where periods of contraction and release have points where less energy is being used. If you want an example, try doing slow curls vs fast curls. Your muscles will fatigue faster from slow tension than quick tension.</p>
<p>edit: This really applies to any muscle groups used in moving around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
