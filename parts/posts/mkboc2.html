		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your stomach gets punctured and fills with blood. Usually a stab wound releases a lot of blood internally with veins and arteries being cut. Things inside your body are usually pretty well contained, but once things get cut, blood can flood anywhere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It isn't realistic at all. It would be very rare for you to get stabbed in a way that causes significant bleeding, and for that blood to end up inside the airways or intestines, which is what it would have to do to get you to throw or cough it up. You might get small amounts, which you would cough up with mucus and saliva, but this wouldn't look like the pure blood you see in movies. Stab wounds in the major vessels around the lungs/throat/intestines would bleed into the chest, on the ground, or in the abdomen. I have never seen it happen like it does in movies.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To be exact in order to puke up blood the wound would have to open a hole in the stomach/lungs or at the very least the airway/esophagus. One a hole in made in one of those areas your body will try to expel the blood just as it would something like water or the like.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
