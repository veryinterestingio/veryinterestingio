<p>I am proud to also work for Unistellar, a private company whose goal is to create the largest network of citizen astronomers around the world, capable of reconnecting with the dark sky with a digital, smart telescope and collecting scientific data for space agencies.</p>
<p>I am pleased to announce new scientific results with the Unistellar network, where citizen astronomers helped derive the shape and size of an asteroid (<a href="https://seti.org/press-release/amateurs-reshape-asteroids-their-backyard" target="_blank">https://seti.org/press-release/amateurs-reshape-asteroids-their-backyard</a>). I recently did a SETI Live with citizen astronomers Rachel Knight and Brad Davis to talk about this project (<a href="https://youtu.be/lX0ff1jeF9s" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/lX0ff1jeF9s</a>).</p>
<p>You can also confirm TESS exoplanet candidates and help astronomers to observe the sky 24/7. From your backyard, your balcony, your roof, or far away from cities you can join a network of 3,000 citizen astronomers and help us to explore the cosmos. The SETI Institute is the science partner of Unistellar.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The concept of citizen science is wonderful and it's great to see it in action here! I have 2 questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How do you manage authorship when it comes to the publication? From the article, it seems that there were a few data points that relied on the citizen scientists, but I can't tell if they're identified on the paper (I'm on mobile)</p>
</li>
<li>In biology people have also used crowd-sourced analysis to solve puzzles like protein folding, but citizen science hasn't really gained traction (I might be wrong here, but I haven't seen a lot of talk about it in the past few years). What has made Unistellar succesful in getting people to participate and contribute?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
