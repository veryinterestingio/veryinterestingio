		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body never knows it's fully healed, it just stops sending a healing response when it lacks a signal saying you're hurt. When a cell is damaged it releases calcium, which then triggers a bunch of healing responses. Once the calcium has been removed (dispersed, taken up by other cells, bound to other things) the initial signal is gone, and then the secondary/following signals kinda just peter out. This varies widely based on the location/type/severity of the injury. There is no final &quot;tada&quot; signal saying everything's back up and running.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body has essentially three phases of wound healing.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Alarm phase where cells involved in the tissue damage release signaling molecules that recruit other cells to get their ass over and help stem bleeding and kill microbes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resolving phase where recruited cells begin to transition from an activated defense state to laying down new tissue and clearing debri</p>
</li>
<li>Resolution phase where final touches are put on the wound site and scab like tissue is transformed into normal or scar tissue.</li>
</ol>
<p>The transition between these phases is largely determined by what the cells see in the wound site. If microbe or damage persists, phase one may be longer and more intense. If wound is broken open or aggravated, phase two may be longer etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes your body doesn’t know — hypertrophic scars are an example of this, and keloids a more extreme example. These are caused by fibroblast proliferation and excessive collagen (building blocks of scars). Keloids must sometimes be managed with steroid injections, or other not so successful treatment modalities.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
