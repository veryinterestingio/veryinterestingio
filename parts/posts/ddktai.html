		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few things. Since this is ELI5 I'll keep them to short bullet points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Previous generations had an america centric economy where every other power was playing catch up, poor, or recovering from WWII. This is no longer the case. A lot of the jobs done in the west are now done elsewhere.</li>
<li>Because there's higher competition for those jobs, employers can get away with paying less. Because if you won't take it someone else will because we're all fighting for a smaller number of jobs.</li>
<li>Minimum wage hasn't kept up with inflation in a long, long time. A minimum wage worker in 1978 was making the equivalent of $14.71 at minimum wage, but their actual pay in 2019 is $7.25, or less than half as much. So the minimum is worth far less.</li>
<li>Cost of living has also gone up so those fewer dollars won't go as far. Big ticket items like cars and homes are increasing in price faster than the cost of living. A car was about $4,645.00, which would be a bit over ten thousand dollars in 2019 money, in 1978.  A modern car costs a little under forty thousand on average now.</li>
<li>This is also true of basic day to day items. Milk and bread have increased in price far beyond inflation. Gas has increased even more dramatically. So the fewer dollars you're getting are getting eaten up just getting by.</li>
<li>College tuition's have gone up to an even greater degree. More colleges are rebranding and remodeling to take in increasing tuitions that can only be paid for by student loans. College funds were common for a lot of households but even if they could hold on to that money it was basically irrelevant since an education costs as much as a new car. Which means you pay for a career you haven't started by taking on loans you hope you can afford later. Which, as we see for the first three points, is contingent on you getting a job that may not even exist when you graduate.</li>
<li>Gen Z came of age during and after the housing crisis of 2007. Even by those standards the economy was bad. Calling what happened a recession essentially underplays that it was essentially a second great depression that made all of the above worse. </li>
<li>As a result of all this heavy economic insecurity a lot of people just aren't marrying or having kids. You don't exactly need a house for one or two people and if someone is judging potential partners based on lifestyle(and implicitly or explicitly income) they're going to be screening out the people most affected by this. The amount of young people who aren't even sexually active, let alone in a relationship or planning for a family, has gone up dramatically in the last decade. If you don't have more people you also don't exactly need a newer safer car even if you're one of the ones who can afford it.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At it's most basic level; income has not kept up with inflation.</p>
<p>My dad - a blue collar tradesman - bought his first house at the age of 25 in 1990. Speaking to him now, when he looks at the income of the young people in his industry now there is no way in hell they could afford to buy a house.</p>
<p>Going further back, my grandparents raised 4 kids on the salary of my grandfather who was a police officer at the time. My grandmother was a stay at home mom. This was in the 70s and 80s. All 4 kids were put through school, never lacked anything and there was even enough money for annual family vacations. Absolutely no way you are even raising two kids on a police officers salary today and living the lifestyle my grandparents did.</p>
<p>I'm not American. I'm not even from Europe. This is a global thing. Gen Y got screwed. Hard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's three main things. Mostly.</p>
<p>One: Wages haven't gone up much.  For every dollar increase in the minimum wage since 1970, the price of an average item has gone up $1.36. When you look at most average people, their paycheque still buys the same amount of basic things at the store as it did 40 years ago. </p>
<p>Two: the things you mentioned cost much much more than they used to, but there isn't more money to pay for them. The only way most people make money is with their time, so that's an easy way to see how much harder it's gotten. </p>
<p>In 1970, you could work 755 hours a year at a minimum wage job to pay for a year of post secondary – that's 14 hours per week. You can work 14 hours a week and still do university.</p>
<p>In 2010, you would have to work 1,823 hours – that's 35 hours per week, otherwise known as &quot;full time work&quot;. It's very hard to work full time but also go to university. But 70% of jobs now want a university degree (40% in the 70's), so people go into debt to get a degree to get a job, but then they can't buy a house or a car because they have so much debt. </p>
<p>It's the same with houses: in 1970 an average house was $23,600. In 2011? $240,100.
Wages haven't gone up and paycheques still buy the same amount of stuff but a house costs 10x what it used to. </p>
<p>Three: The things you said have become investments that don't get shared as much. Our parents were much more likely to get a first car as a hand me down, or help getting a first house, or getting the family house when their parents retired and moved to Florida.</p>
<p>Now, our parents are living longer and better lives but they have less money, so they're not retiring and moving away, they don't give up their cars, and they don't have lots of money to share to help us buy our own.</p>
<p>Our grandparents got to ride a really great wave of lots of people making money and things generally getting better for everybody. So our parents got a really easy start to adult life with cheap cars and houses to buy early and lots of help to get settled.</p>
<p>But things slowed down by the time we were born, so our parents couldn't help us out as much. And when we became adults our cheques pretty much stopped growing, and everything has been pretty tough since then. There's no way to get ahead when you're spending all your money on basic stuff, there's no help from outside when your parents can't afford to give you big gifts, and any little disaster like an unexpected hospital bill can ruin everything when you don't have any savings or a house to sell. </p>
<p>That's long but hopefully basic enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>That said, Gen Z is starting to have the same problem with very similar conditions. TBH Gen Y and Gen Z are practically the same gen with very similar social context and culture.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
