		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How bacteria works in your mouth EL5: by itself bacteria floating around is not nearly strong enough to get through your enamel (hardest outer layer of tooth). But when bacteria is left around long enough they begin to stick together to form a biofilm. Now this starts as a soft biofilm called plaque, if you were to brush your teeth or scrape it with your finger nail you would be able to remove this soft biofilm (plaque) without much effort. However after about 24 hours that soft plaque begins to strengthen and harden into tarter. Now tarter is solid, no matter how hard you brush, it’s not coming off. That’s why you go to the dentist, they need to scrape the tarter off.</p>
<p>Think about the bottom of a big boat, the longer it’s in the water the more grimy the bottom gets, if it’s in the water for long enough barnacles will begin to form. No matter how fast you go through the water the barnacles will never come off, You have to scrape these barnacles off. Mouthwash is the equivalent of trying to go really fast in your boat to wash off the barnacles, it’s not going to do anything but maybe polish up the top layer of barnacle but at the end of the day there are still massive barnacles on your boat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a registered dental hygienist. There's different mouthwash for different needs. </p>
<p>There's fluoride mouthwash, which gives you am extra bit of cavity protection. There's anti-gingivitis mouthwash, which helps to kill even more germs in your mouth than brushing and flossing alone. There's even whitening mouthwash, which are typically peroxide based. </p>
<p>When my patients ask me which brand is best, I tell them that the brand usually doesn't matter. You look for what the mouthwash is doing for you (for example, after rinsing with a fluoride mouthwash, avoid eating and drinking for a half hour afterwards). </p>
<p>Do I recommend mouthwash to everyone? No. Only if I feel it could benefit them and their particular needs. </p>
<p>And yeah, they make your breath fresh too! But cleaning your tongue thoroughly will help with that too (use a tongue scraper!)</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks so much for the award! Much appreciated :)</p>
<p>Edit2: Thank you guys for the awards! ❤ I'm happy to help</p>
<p>Edit3: Wow, it's been a fun night! Thanks again for all the awards and for all your questions, but I have to head to bed!</p>
<p>Please don't forget to visit your hygienist every 6 months for a cleaning and checkup! Don't be afraid to ask them questions, that's what we're here for! And feel free to peruse my previous answers, I've answered a ton!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Brushing and flossing mechanically cleans away the plaque from your teeth, which prevents it from turning into biofilm and eventually decalcifying your enamel (i.e. create a 'cavity').</p>
<p>FLUORIDE-containing mouthwash can help remineralize the ename on your teeth, but it won't physically scrape the bacteria away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A soak helps, but it doesn't get everything, And if you're using a sponge you don't really need the soak, but it can be nice to use both</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
