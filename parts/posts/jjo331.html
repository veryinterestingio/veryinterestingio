		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Flu vaccines are typically manufactured by private companies and countries usually purchase a variety of flu vaccines from these various private companies operating around world. From <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/vaccines-immunization/canadian-immunization-guide-statement-seasonal-influenza-vaccine-2019-2020.html#II3" target="_blank">this</a> website it looks like these are the flu vaccines offered in Canada, and I've added who makes them, and where to the best of my knowledge:</p>
<p>Agriflu and Fluad, manufactured by Seqirus in NC, USA and Afluria in Australia.</p>
<p>Fluviral/Flulaval Tetra manufactured by ID Biomedical Corporation, Quebec, Canada </p>
<p>Influvac is manufactured by Abbott, they're headquartered in IL, USA but it's unclear to me if this is where they produce their flu vaccines as well. </p>
<p>Fluzone Quad and High Dose is manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur at either their Swiftwater, PA, USA, France, Mexico or China locations.</p>
<p>Flumist Quad is manufactured by MedImmune in MD, USA.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>For example, China, India, Cuba, Brazil, Denmark, and South Korea make many vaccines that are used in their own countries and exported to other countries.</p>

<p>This year, Canada seems to be using Agriflu, Fluviral, Influvac, Vacigrip, Fluad, Flulaval, Fluzone, and Flumist. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m a Canadian pharmacist for perspective - you’ve been given a lot of good info (but some misinfo about Fluad being available this year - this was used in seniors in the past, but this year Fluzone HD is the “seniors”shot). Fluzone HD has 60mcg of each of 3 strains of the flu and no adjuvant. (as opposed to 15mcg of 4 strains in the regular quadrivalent vaccine). </p>
<p>The vaccines aren’t necessarily made IN canada, but they are made FOR Canada (if you want more specific info I have it all at work and my brain is fried.....bc of the hunger games of flu shots). </p>
<p>Availability is a freaking disaster but I would think (hope? This is government controlled so who knows?) that LTC should be prioritized for HD. </p>
<p>I have the boxes and complete monographs at work. I actually had to call Seqirs today to verify there was no formaldehyde in the Flucelvax vaccine bc I have a patient who says she’s allergic to formaldehyde. I absolutely was speaking with an American company (I called the canadian number) and had to several times remind her I was in Canada and we had postal codes and we aren’t all pharm Ds or PhDs and I made damn sure she was looking at the canadian product......not sure where I was going with that story, but bottom line - made for Canada. Not necessarily in Canada.</p>
<p>ETA - flumist also not available this year in Canada. Some of the info people are finding is out of date.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
