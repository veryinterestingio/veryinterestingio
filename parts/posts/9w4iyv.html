		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in a toilet paper factory that makes tissue paper and we also transforme it (TP, kitchen towels, napkins etc)</p>
<p>99% of paper pulp made today comes from tree plantations planted with that end. They are put down and replanted in cycle and this is enough for our needs.</p>
<p>Tissue paper (the type you see in toilet paper) is whiten using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) so no pollution there.</p>
<p>The only difference from toilet paper to kitchen towel paper is that the last is treated to be humidity resistant and won't break that easily.
But toilet paper is basically celulose fibers pressed together.</p>
<p>One kg of tissue paper needs 1000L of water, (in closed circuit) this water looses all oxygen and needs to be reoxygenated before it's deliver to nature again.
The only treatment our water gets is reoxygenation with anaerobic bacteria and the fibers are filtered. There's really nothing more to do.</p>
<p>But:
We consume a lot of energy and I think that our consumption of oils and lubrification grease is very high since we have an all lot of  rolling parts in our machines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Once TP is flushed down the toilet it either breaks down into smaller paper components or gets caught in septic treatment strainers. If it makes it through the strainers it either settles in one of the feed settling tanks or makes it through to the aeration basins where bugs eat organics.  After some time the bugs are cycled out and pressed.</p>
<p>Either way the toilet paper gets to land fills either from the sludge press or strainers. There it likely degrades to methane gas over time if no oxygen is present or to carbon dioxide if oxygen is present. </p>
<p>Note: much of this information is extrapolation from my knowledge of septic treating systems. Any corrections or support would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Edit: many knowledgeable people have added that bio waste can also be used for fertilizer.  This waste is regulated into classes of waste and tested to ensure no contamination or heavy metals gets into the food market. </p>
<p>There was also a comment from Denmark where they burn TP as an energy source. </p>
<p>Also, thank you for the clarification.  Bugs refers to microbes used for breaking down organics. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Toilet paper is made of unweaved cellulose fibers from wood and (mostly) recycled paper.</p>
<p>It's structure is loosened to help it dissolve in sewer systems, avoiding clotting.</p>
<p>It mostly decays by bacterial processes and most of this disintegration emits methane.</p>
<p>The mass of toilet paper degraded that way could hardly emit more methane than digestive processes whose residues it is used to wipe.</p>
<p>TL;DR : Being formed off recycled paper and used in relatively low quantities to wipe residues from far more emitting processes, I think the impact of Toilet Paper is not significant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>About the same as paper. Likely the most damaging part is the manufacturing process where mono-stand forests are planted and harvested regularly. Toilet paper can be recycled and perhaps this is also easier to do that it is with paper as it is flushed and can be filtered.</p>
<p>*Bidets are off subject and nobody is being clever by saying it again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
