		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Muscles are made up of tons of tiny fibers that have like an &quot;on/off&quot; switch. Relaxed muscles are &quot;off&quot; but a chemical reaction in the body turns them &quot;on&quot; and causes them to pull tight. They all work together and allow you to do things like lift weight, however they require fuel to do this. As things like electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium,) run out, some of those fibers get stuck which causes shakes or may even cause the muscle to cramp. I understand that this is not a matter of lactic acid buildup. I'm pretty sure that's a myth. If anyone can demonstrate otherwise, I'm all ears.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Posting an answer by u/Pumpizmus from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1c9mkb/why_do_muscles_shake_while_under_strainpressure/" target="_blank">essentially the same question 5 years ago </a></p>
<p>Edit: I just realized im in ELI5. Sorry the below is more like ELI20</p>
<p>Biomedical engineer here, who did research and experiments related to this. I don't know into much detail should I go so I will start simpler and then try to answer follow up questions (with the help of others hopefully).</p>
<p>Chapter I - Muscle components and action. A muscle is composed of fascicles (bundles) of muscle fibers. Each fibre is a cell by itself - wiki pic. Each fiber consists of a protein structure that looks like this wiki pic. That is like 2 opposite 2-sided combs going on and on in a chain.</p>
<p>The inner comb (myosin) can be pulled into the outer one (actine) and thus contracting the fiber. There are protein &quot;hooks&quot; that litteraly grab the opposite protein and pull themselves in. Now this actually works in a spring action manner, i.e. the hooks are &quot;wound up&quot; and when triggered they grab, pull and release.</p>
<p>Now this trigger is actually a calcium ion Ca2+ touching the right spot of the hook. Therfore if you want to contract a muscle fiber, all you need is to pour some Ca2+ into the cell and then pump it out to relax.</p>
<p>Chapter II - Control. To pour the Ca2+ ions in you need to open the &quot;gates&quot; on the cell and the calcium that is plentiful outside the cells in the muscle structure just flows in the cell by concentration gradient. The gates are open by relatively standard depolarization of the cell's membrane by tickling it with acetylcholine which is released from the end of the neuron that is connected to this muscle cell. This release is in turn triggered by the incoming action potential throuoght this respective neuron.</p>
<p>Now there is a huge number of these fibers/cells in a fascicle, usually connected in groups of 1-100 to a neuron. Whenever a group is triggered it twitches as the proteins slide into themselves. Therefore, to produce a nice steady pull, you dont want them all to contract at the same time but it is more less chaotic/random. Millions of tiny irregular pulls together produce a smooth force.
Small side note: If you need finer control there are less fibers per neuron and more neurons(fingers), for more force you want larger groups. But the distribution is never uniform.</p>
<p>Which neurons fire when (for smooth start-up instead of a head-on jerk, then a smooth force and then a slow release) is a matter of the unconscious &quot;drivers&quot; in the lower brain structures that add the finesse to your willfull commands.</p>
<p>Chapter III - energy consumption. The muscle needs energy for two things, to wind up the myosine hooks after the pulling and to pump all the Ca2+ out against a big concentration gradient so it can flow in again to trigger next contraction. There is some energy reserve in each cell to do this repeatedly.</p>
<p>And finally to the point - the more force you need the less can the muscle afford distributing the single fibers' actions &quot;randomly&quot; for smoothness of the pull and needs more of them firing together for more force while all along the fibers still need some time to rewind.</p>
<p>This creates the more synchronous, shaking contraction that you observe.</p>
<p>Side note - as the energy reserves run out, it takes longer to rewind the springs and to pump out the calcium. Thus a situation arises when a fiber is told by the nerve to contract but is not ready yet and obeys only after a short delay. Alltogether, in the whole muscle contraction this means that the single twitches are further away and the mean frequency detected by an EMG can be observed to fall and the frequency distribution grows narrower. Therefore this effect in question comes earlier and is more intensive when the muscle is tired. Also the mean frequency of the action observed on EMG is a good indicator of the muscle's tiredness. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a greyhound, and if she bends over to eat or generally do something dexterous she &quot;vibrates&quot;. It's definitely not shivering, it's just general muscle twitchiness. Obviously, they're a specialized animal but I would think a similar biological process must be in play that doesn't include being hungry/thirsty/tired, right?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
