		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vaccines aren’t always viruses, we currently several types of vaccines </p>
<p>1) killed virus, basically you grow the actual virus then kill it and give it to people dead, this way they react to it without mounting infection. Problem with these is that the killing process can alter the protein so immunity is not perfect</p>
<p>2) live attenuated: the live virus but has been altered to be weaker, causing the virus to make a reaction but without full blown infection, problem with these is that it can cause disease in immune suppressed people, and can potentially become strong again</p>
<p>Both these types aren’t as commonly used these days, atleast not for Covid in the western world. </p>
<p>3) viral vector: a harmless but different virus that has been genetically modified to contain proteins of the virus you want to target, so you get reaction to both the vector and the disease causing virus. I think the Russian and Chinese Covid vaccines are of this type. Problem with it is that if you have the same or similar vector virus in a previous vaccine, your body may kill it too quickly to notice the new protein. </p>
<p>4) recombinant protein: you create a protein of the target virus in the lab and give it to people, problem with it is that the protein made in the lab may look a little different than the same sequence made in human cells ( it is not just the sequence but also how the protein folds is how the immune system identify them) </p>
<p>5) the newest type which is mRNA, these are the moderna and Pfizer vaccine, you just get a piece of Viral RNA (made in the lab) which your body takes abs creates the protein out of it probably for a couple days, the advantage here is that you get a more persistent exposure for the target protein and that protein is being made by your cells so it looks more like that produced by the actual virus ( the virus itself replicates by forcing your infected cells to make the new copies) </p>
<p>Now back your question </p>
<p>It is theoretically possible to create a contagious vaccine, of the above types 2 and 3 but that is a bad idea fir the following reasons </p>
<p>A) if the vaccine turns out to cause bad side effects, then your screwed, you just created a whole new disease running around</p>
<p>B) even a vaccine safe in most people can be unsafe in certain groups, like pregnant women, or immune compromised people, a contagious vaccine will reach them and cause damage there </p>
<p>C) Your contagious vaccine can mutate in the wild abs loose its effectiveness, the people will be immune to the vector virus and won’t respond well to other vaccines</p>
<p>D) People need to consent to receiving the vaccine, a contagious vaccine will be forced on others which is unethical</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can and do. There is a version of the polio vaccine that is a weaker strain of polio. It is not commonly given in Western countries but is still given in other places because it's cheaper and much easier to give. The idea is that people can vaccinate other people just by being around them. The reason this is not used in Western countries is that the virus can still cause polio.  It can mutate into a more active form, albeit at a lower rate. In fact, in many places, the majority of polio cases are actually caused by the vaccine. We initially accepted that because, as a whole, the vaccine prevents most cases of polio, but there is a (rightly) a movement to stop using that vaccine because there are safer ones.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR A contagious vaccine is just a virus.</p>
<p>Vaccine is generally either an attenuated live virus (so it's kinda broken somehow so it can't cause a full-fledged infection), an inactivated virus (so it can't infect cells or replicate at all, or immunogenic virus components (so basically a part of the virus that triggers an immune response, but not a whole virus).</p>
<p>In order for something to be contagious, you have to be shedding enough of it into the environment for another individual to be exposed to enough of it to infect them. This can only really happen if your body is producing a lot more of the thing, and that only really happens with a full-blown viral infection with lots of viral replication.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have done this at least once that I know of and something similar has happened a few times &quot;naturally&quot; with a couple of wild strains of viruses where one harmless strain spreads widely and immunizes the population against the harmful strain, but there are reasons it's not really practical.</p>
<p>So some vaccines are made using weakened viruses, but most aren't.  The oral polio vaccine is one example of one that is.  It actually causes a weakened version of polio that provides immunity but doesn't (usually) cause paralysis.  However it also spreads a bit in the community providing some extra protection against polio.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that sometimes it reverts to the dangerous form of polio and causes disease.  And this is an intrinsic problem with such forms of vaccination.  If the vaccine can reproduce in people, it becomes subject to natural selection. And natural selection will favor replicants that are better at reproducing, rather than ones that are good at being a vaccine.  So there's always a chance that some disease causing mutant will arise and spread and cause disease.  </p>
<p>There's also an issue that if the vaccine is reproducing in your body enough to spread, it could also be easily causing damage by performing that reproduction.  Most vaccines, like inactivated ones and subunit ones and even mRNA ones, you just put in the dose, and the body reacts to it, but the dose doesn't make more dose, nor does it do much besides present the antigens to your immune system. There's no live virus. But in a live-virus situation, where the virus reproduces enough to become infective, it's also made more of itself complicating dosing and maybe doing some direct damage in the process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
