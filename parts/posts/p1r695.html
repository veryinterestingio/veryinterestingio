<p>This of course is coming right in the middle of the Delta variant outbreak in the United States and other places.</p>
<p>In the greek alphabet, Delta is the 4th letter and Lambda is the 11th. So what happened to all the letters in between? Are there Epsilon-Kappa variants in other parts of the world that we just havent heard of?</p>
<p>If not, why did we skip those letters in our scientific naming scheme for virus variants?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Epsilon was the &quot;California variant&quot; identified roughly a year ago.  It had some interesting mutations at the spike protein that helped it evade a fraction of the antibodies fighting the pathogen.  </p>
<p>But since there are dozens and dozens of specific antibodies attacking dozen and dozens of specific sites on the spike protein, full immune escape wasn't nearly approached.</p>
<p>There were some implications for specific monoclonal antibody treatments.</p>
<p>But Epsilon basically died out (at least in the US) as people gained immunity to it either by vaccination or infection, especially with alpha or delta.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The greek-letter-naming is not scientific, it is bureaucratic. Scientific names are pango lineages (e.g., B.1.1.7 for alpha) or GISAID clade (e.g., GRY for alpha), etc. </p>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) &quot;names&quot; strains of particular interest to avoid nomenclature such as the &quot;British variant&quot; or &quot;Brazilian mutation&quot;. Bureaucratically each Variant of Interest (VOI) gets a Greek letter name handed out in the order they were designated VOI. The Variants of Concern (VOC) are Variants of Interest which have been &quot;upped one level&quot;. Not all VOI become VOC. Currently, the designated strains are alpha (VOI + VOC), beta (VOI + VOC), gamma (VOI + VOC), delta (VOI + VOC), eta (VOI), iota (VOI), kappa (VOI), and lambda (VOI). See table below:</p>

<p>In general, the media only mentions the Variants of Concern (VOC), and do not mention the Variants of Interest (VOI) according to the WHO. The scientific community does not use the WHO-designations since they are not scientifically meaningful. I.e., if you are interested in research on the &quot;alpha-strain&quot;, use B.1.1.7 and not alpha as a search term. </p>
<p>The current listing of international and bureaucratic names of SARS-CoV-2 variants can be found at <a href="https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/" target="_blank">https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/</a></a></p>
<p>There is a literal gazillion of strains which are neither VOI nor VOC.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A - the other variants have been identified and named. They just didn't mutate in ways that make them notable at scale.</p>
<p>B - Lambda was mentioned weeks ago as a major concern as it was clearly becoming dominant in South America, but it's only just now being mentioned here because it has finally begun to spread away from that continent. This also tells you something about our news cycle.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/" target="_blank">The WHO has a page dedicated to stats on variants</a>. It doesn't work well on mobile, but it shows that these evolutions are noted and monitored long before they ever hit headlines. Delta first reared its head in India last October.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
