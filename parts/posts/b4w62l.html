		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctor of Physical Therapy here. The crack you hear when you 'pop' a joint (called cavitation) is simply nitrogen bubbles being released in the joint's synovial fluid from the negative pressure of the joint being stretched. Quite normal, and not unhealthy. I use joint manipulation with my patients often as a method of pain relief.</p>
<p>I tell my patients, &quot;healthy joints crack, pop, and can make sounds, and that doesn't mean your joint is unhealthy or unstable&quot;. For example, every time I squat down, both my knees always loudly crack. Never had knee pain, and it's totally normal. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Regular knuckle “cracking” is the popping of gas bubbles in the joint, and has for a long time been said in an old wives tale that it causes arthritis.
There was one doctor in particular who cracked the knuckles on one hand for a long time and not the other and found his hands both ended up the same. Another big study confirmed this later.
Interestingly there was a study done in 1990 that showed that people who cracked their knuckles may be less healthy overall in that they were more likely to smoke, drink and have lower grip strength. It does not mean that cracking the joint is harmful, but perhaps done more frequently in anxious people, for example.</p>
<p>Edit: probably too many big words for most 5 y/o</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Every one of my joints snaps crackles and pops abnormally. So yes, excessive cracking CAN be a warning sign, but some cracking or popping is completely normal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
