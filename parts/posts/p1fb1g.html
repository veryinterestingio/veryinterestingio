What purpose does it serve physiologically, if any? Or, is it a side effect of something else?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s pain from inflammation. The pain itself doesn’t serve much physiological function beyond making sure you know something’s wrong with you, and thus hopefully avoid actions that would aggravate the inflammation site.</p>
<p>Inflammation is a common, physiological response to pretty much any damage to any part of your body (except a few special places where it is normally suppressed, such as your brain, or the inside of your eye globes), mainly mediated by your immune system, mainly for the purpose of facilitating further immune response and tissue repair. In the case of a sore throat, or in fact any infection, inflammation is induced by both the damage directly caused by pathogens, and by your immune response trying its best to fight off the pathogens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Viruses or bacteria multiply in the pharynx (throat), nasopharynx (connection of the throat to the nose) or in the tonsils, and the immune reaction is to inflame the region. Thus, mediators of inflammation are generated as part of the process, such as prostaglandins and bradykinins, which sensitize the sensory nerve endings of pain in the throat, thus, sore throat occurs, especially through the glossopharyngeal nerve.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Viral sore throats are caused by not only inflammation, but the death of your throat cells. A virus basically injects it's genetic information into your cells, and that cell starts manufacturing a bunch of viruses until it breaks open. Immune system cells search for these infected cells and kill them.</p>
<p>Macrophages are cells that come by and try to eat all of the matter that is accumulating, but they sometimes can not keep up, and that is why you have to cough. The get rid of the excess dead cell parts.</p>
<p>Fevers also usually raise the body temperature to a point that is no longer optimal for viral reproduction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
