		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is basically the Mott problem:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mott_problem" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mott_problem</a></p>
<p>It is the nature of quantum mechanics that the same experiment repeated exactly the same way will produce random, different outcomes that are drawn from a certain distribution of probabilities. QM allows us to calculate that probability distribution and thus describe the aggregate behavior over many repetitions but the outcome of any specific repetition is nondeterministic. In fact it can be shown and verified that that nondeterminism is intrinsic and can never be explained by some unknown-to-us &quot;hidden variables&quot; in our experiments. So called &quot;local realism&quot; is irreconcilable with QM and QM is experimentally correct</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is there actually a photon emitting source that isn't random/omni-directional in its most primitive form? </p>
<p>I'd assume that anything capable of emitting a photon has the potential to emit it in any direction and that it's merely the environment in which that source exists which determine where exactly it goes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Feynman addressed this question in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/QED-Strange-Theory-Light-Matter/dp/0691024170" target="_blank">QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter</a>.</p>
<p>If you shine a monochromatic light on glass, the glass will either reflect or transmit the photons.  The chance that a particular photon is reflected versus transmitted depends on the glass thickness.  The probability varies sinusoidally with the thickness ranging between 0 to 16% (assuming the glass is transparent to the chosen color.)  </p>
<p>Feynman explains the phenomena by saying that when an electron spits out a photon, the emitted  photon's energy determines the probable direction the photon will take. If you sum the probable emission paths, a photon will either emerge from the front of the glass or the back, again depending on the glass thickness.   The sine wave arises by adding together all the possible paths the photon can take and determining the most probable path.</p>
<p>To describe the photon energy determining the probable path trajectory, he said to imagine the electron at the center of a clock and the probable emission path acting like a very fast second hand. How fast the second hand spins depends on the photon's energy.  Vary the energy of the incoming photons and you vary how fast the second hand spins.</p>
<p>It's important to remember that you can't say with certainty which way a photon will go. You can only describe its likely emission direction.</p>
<p>If you're really interested, read the linked book. It's Feynman being incredibly clear describing a topic that a lot of people get wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
