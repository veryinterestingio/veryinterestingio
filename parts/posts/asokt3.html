		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The active ingredient in mouthwash kills 100% of all bacteria <strong>that it comes into contact with.</strong> When you swish and swoosh, there's a very good chance that you don't manage to get the mouthwash into contact with 100% of the bacteria in your mouth. For example, some of it is hiding in cracks or folds. </p>
<p>Another big factor is the fact that bacteria grows in piles. The bacteria on the bottom of the pile is sheltered from the dangerous mouthwash by the corpses of the bacteria on the top of the pile.</p>
<p>That 99% doesn't mean that 1% of bacteria are immune to the mouthwash, merely that about 1% of bacteria will hide well enough to survive the oral genocide.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's an excellent question, and a legitimate concern!  </p>
<p>Usually resistance builds up when bacteria with a slight resistance to a drug are exposed long enough for those without any resistance to die. The survivors pass on their resistance, and some of the future generations may develop a little stronger resistance just by chance.  </p>
<p>But bacteria don't have resistance to your mouthwash. That mouthwash (alcohol, I assume) kills 100% of the bacteria it touches, but there will always be some between your teeth or somewhere that aren't touched by that mouthwash.  </p>
<p>Imagine a forest fire that killed every tree it reached, but in the middle of the forest there's a lake with an island in the middle that the fire can't touch. In this case the fire kills 99% of the trees in the forest, but the survivors aren't spared because of some kind of flame resistance.  </p>
<p>Of course, this doesn't address exactly what the manufacturer means by &quot;germs:&quot; Do they mean just bacteria? Bacteria and fungi? What about viruses? They're generally silent on this subject.</p>
<p><em>Edit: Turns out, there are recent studies that show bacteria can develop resistance to alcohol. This is new information to me, and I'm really glad others have found those articles!</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not to make people worry, but it seems as though certain strains of enterococcus are becoming tolerant to alcohol-based disinfectants via variants/mutations in carbohydrate uptake and metabolism genes. So there may be some wiggle room in our previous theories regarding the “nuclear bomb” model of alcohol-based disinfectants/sanitizers. </p>

<p>Not sure if that is behind a paywall, since I’m currently on network in a hospital. Here’s the abstract;</p>
<p>Abstract
Alcohol-based disinfectants and particularly hand rubs are a key way to control hospital infections worldwide. Such disinfectants restrict transmission of pathogens, such as multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium. Despite this success, health care infections caused by E. faecium are increasing. We tested alcohol tolerance of 139 hospital isolates of E. faecium obtained between 1997 and 2015 and found that E. faecium isolates after 2010 were 10-fold more tolerant to killing by alcohol than were older isolates. Using a mouse gut colonization model of E. faecium transmission, we showed that alcohol-tolerant E. faecium resisted standard 70% isopropanol surface disinfection, resulting in greater mouse gut colonization compared to alcohol-sensitive E. faecium. We next looked for bacterial genomic signatures of adaptation. Alcohol-tolerant E. faecium accumulated mutations in genes involved in carbohydrate uptake and metabolism. Mutagenesis confirmed the roles of these genes in the tolerance of E. faecium to isopropanol. These findings suggest that bacterial adaptation is complicating infection control recommendations, necessitating additional procedures to prevent E. faecium from spreading in hospital settings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is true if the active ingredient in the mouthwash was an antibiotic. However most mouthwash is based on alcohol. And not the party type but the antifreeze type. It is basically poison to any living cells. It is impossible to build some kind of resistance to pure alcohol. The 1% of germs that survive does not survive because they can withstand the alcohol but because they are lucky and managed to only get splashed with a tiny bit of it instead of getting soaked.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So your next question is that if the mouthwash is pure poison why does it not harm you. Well it does. Which is why you should not swallow it. However your mouth is covered in a protective layer of dead skin cells. The alcohol does nothing to it as the cells are already dead and they are preventing the alcohol from getting to your healthy cells. Even if you do not follow the procedures and end up swallowing it or using it on wounds the amount of alcohol in relation to your body is minimal. So while it might kill some cells your body is constructed such that it will not reach many cells and your body can replace the dead cells with relative ease.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
