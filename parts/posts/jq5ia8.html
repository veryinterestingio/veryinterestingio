		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of my siblings is a low functioning autistic. Unfortunately because they are low functioning there's no way for me to tell how they view the world because they only verbally communicate when they want something, and it took years of special training to even get to that point. At all other times they are &quot;stimming&quot; and off in their own world. Impossible to have any kind of meaningful conversation. Even after 30 something years I've never really known them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its tough to say for sure. High functioning folks tend to be able to fit in with &quot;normal&quot; society pretty well. Their social skills may lack some, but nothing makes them stand out unless a stranger tries to engage them in a conversation (and even then, most can learn to fit in as they get older)</p>
<p>Low functioning autism generally brings with it a lack of communication skills and mental struggles that prevent them from really telling anyone what life is like for them. </p>
<p>You can extrapolate and guess, for sure. Fear of strangers and social situations, fear of change in routine, fear at being misunderstood and not understanding what's going on, etc. </p>
<p>But actually knowing what its like? Not an easy thing to find out without living it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have autism and as a child it was bad I was way off. Over time as I've grown up I've learned to fit into society for the most part. Everyone can still tell I'm autistic if they pay attention to my ticks but I'm functional. If you want to know what it feels like to be dealing with autism take a couple of tabs of acid and then at the peak try and interact with the world. Even just checking out at a store is horrifically difficult.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well first of all you'd need to establish some kind of commonality for how neurotypicals (people who aren't autistic) experience the world.</p>
<p>But even then, the answer is still kind of both yes and no. There are definitely some commonalities between many autistic people, although I think more so in certain ways, specifically sensory sensitivity rather than, say, social difficulty.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that not all autistic people have significant (or even any) issues with certain sensations, but of the ones that do, there are certain things that are relatable to damn near all of us, for example, tags on shirts. There isn't much difference in the way a high-functioning person rips a tag off a shirt compared to a low-functioning person, except for maybe how much care they put into not damaging the shirt. So it's pretty easy to tell that the root issue is the same. There might be some difference of scale (i.e. the high-functioning person might be less bothered by the tag than the low-functioning person) but that's pretty subjective.</p>
<p>One thing that is different between high-functioning and low-functioning people (and which I highly suspect is the primary reason for the classification's existence in the first place) is verbal skills. And that's a huge problem for figuring out how they experience the world, because verbal skills are incredibly useful for making your problems known, and by extension, getting them solved.</p>
<p>Consider two otherwise-identical people whose only difference is that one of them has difficulty speaking and writing. Now imagine that they're both kids being brought to a loud, bright place with sensations that are scary and uncomfortable. Maybe a grocery store, for a concrete example.</p>
<p>The verbal one can say &quot;Hey mom, I don't feel comfortable going in there, the lights and sounds are scary and uncomfortable.&quot; And if their mom isn't a terrible person, she'll say &quot;okay, you can stay in the car then.&quot;</p>
<p>The nonverbal one can only cry and scream when their mom tries to bring them into the store, which doesn't convey much information to her, and she just gets frustrated and tries to drag them in anyway.</p>
<p>So you can see how just a difference in spoken language skills, nothing else, can completely change how two people relate with others.</p>
<p>In short, my point is that it's <em>really, really hard</em> to determine whether two people's experience of the world differs in any meaningful way, just by observing the output of their actions.</p>
<p>That is, of course, aside from the trivial differences- the ones that are caused by the very differences in output that get someone classified as low- or high-functioning; and the ones that are caused by other people's <em>reactions</em> to those differences in output- obviously a low-functioning person is going to have a different time in special ed than a high-functioning person is going to have in the gifted program. But aside from those, I don't think it's even possible to find out whether there's a significant difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
