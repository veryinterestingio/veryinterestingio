		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Skin tags (aka acrochordons) have a tendency to develop on the body near folds, creases or other areas that may experience constant friction <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26577974" target="_blank">1</a>. This isn't always the case though. Some people are simply genetically inclined to getting them, while others may have predispositions due to health complications. For instance, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease are all considered risk factors (See <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6503204/" target="_blank">2</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29328028" target="_blank">3</a>). Note, however, that these are situations that are associated with being over-weight or obese which in turn can increase the friction and surface area of places prone to these tags. If a tag isn't removed properly, the &quot;nub&quot; can act like a starting location for it to arise anew. However, often times, the same place that was prone to developing a tag in the first place, is simply a good location for another to arise. People that wear improperly fitting clothing for instance, may find that tags in the groin area show up again and again. </p>
<p>As for what exactly they are, in many cases its just what the name implies: skin. Assuming a typical benign case not involving cancer or other disease, the tags are usually under the microscope appear as fibrous tissue (fibrovascular), hyperplastic epidermis keratinocytes with keratinization due to rubbing or friction, and a regular flat basal layer (Look up acrochordon histology). They tend to have vascular infiltration which can be a reason why they bleed a lot upon removal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Skin tags occur in areas of friction, but similar to many skin conditions, why they affect only some people (and why some people are more severely affected) is not known.</p>
<p>If skin tags are removed properly, the risk of recurrence is low-- but you would be likely to develop new lesions over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Skin tags  are thought to be related to irritation of the skin, so if that spot got irritated once, what's to stop it from getting irritated again?</p>
<p>Skin tags are also more common in people with certain medical issues (obesity, diabetes) or genetic conditions predispose them.</p>
