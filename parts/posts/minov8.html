This has always puzzled me. I would think that being a large ball of gas, an &quot;impact&quot; would be different from that of a solid planet, that there's nothing there to hit and it would simply plunge into a cloud of gas.
Does gas at that mass behave differently? Is the impacting object so large that it doesn't matter what it's interacting with? Or am I just fundamentally misunderstanding some basic aspect of physics/fluid dynamics?</p></div></div>

<p>If Uranus was spinning normally, west-to-east (let's call that angular momentum +1) , and something large came in fast retrograde (so, going east to west, so its angular momentum around the system's center of mass is negative), and they collided in <em>any way t</em>hat resulted in a single object after the dust settles, then the angular momentum of that final object will be the original +1, added to the incoming object's X, where if X is &lt;-1, you now get a backwards rotating planet. Uranus might not have been exactly this scenario, and of course the incoming object would probably have angular momentum around a different axis too, but, same idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Not quite! There are/were two competing theories on the origins of Uranus tilt. One is the impact scenario while the other is secular resonances with another planet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the tilt is just down to impacts then it is unlikely to have been a single impact. In fact, 2 Earth mass impacts seem to be more favourable than a single impact. The problem with collision scenarios is that an initially fast rotating Uranus has too large an initial angular momentum to change its tilt easily. If we wish to have an initially slow rotating Uranus then we run into the problem of removing enough angular momentum from the planet to put it into a state of slow rotation (the accretion at formation results in a rapidly rotating planet). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secular resonances can not only tilt Uranus but can also maintain the orbits of the moons about its equator (due to tidal interactions between the moons and the planet). Secular resonances would take on the order of 100Myrs while resonance kicks can achieve a lower degree of tilting but on the order of 10Myrs</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The conclusion is that it seems most likely that the tilting of Uranus was actually down to a combination of secular resonances/resonance kicks and impacts (plural).</p>

<p>The most up to date observations from Juno and Cassini suggest that giant planets (also known as gas giants) do not have a solid core. They have a mushy core with a gradient composition and no distinct transition to a solid core. This is a bit besides the point though as it is somewhat irrelevant if the planet has a dilute core or not. The reason being is no impactor, of a mass that is considered reasonable in the impact hypothesis (or the impact-resonance hypothesis) would survive to reach far into Uranus. Essentially it will break up once it breaches the Roche limit and the material that made up the &quot;impactor&quot; will become part of Uranus. It is possible for significant sized chunks to make it into the atmosphere but these would be subject to significant viscous stresses and increasing pressures so they would also be dissolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The angular momentum stuff has been covered by other posters. Basically the material from the &quot;impactor&quot; has some orbital momentum which has to be removed. But conservation of momentum says it must go somewhere, so it is transferred into the spin momentum of Uranus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Regardless of the type of objects, if two objects with no outside forces slowing them down (which is close to true in space) combine on impact then their final direction and speed will depend on the direction and speed of the initial objects depending on their mass. You add them as you would vectors. </p>
<p>If they don't combine then they will both change their direction and speed in a mirrored way, bouncing off each other. Imagine two balls or balloons bouncing off each other, or getting stuck together. </p>
<p>In all those cases both objects, or the combination of them, would change which direction they're going from the impact unless they were going the same way, in which case they would only change their speed. Since exact impacts like that don't really happen with celestial objects there will always be some change to the direction in the 3D space. </p>
<p>In most cases the change will be minuscule for many reasons, one of them being small mass of most objects hitting planets, another that most objects tend to orbit around roughly the same plane and the semi random distribution would mean they would cancel each other out more or less. To affect a planet an object would generally have to come from outside of the solar system, which allows for unusual angles and no randomised impacts evening out, and be massive. </p>
<p>At that point it will affect the planet whether it merges (which combines their momentums, imagine someone crashing into you while you're both ice skating and you slide together), bounces (you can imagine two balls bounce off each other). They could even affect each other gravitationally without an impact happening (imagine holding a magnet pulling an object, the object will be pulled and you will feel a pull in the magnet, but make both move too fast and too far apart to actually merge). Though anything big enough to affect a gas giant that way would likely leave a lot more traces than an impact. This website has some simplified examples, they're not of planets but the concepts remain the same.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The gas giant do have a rocky or metallic core that is likely solidish/molten. An impact could have cause it to lose its atmosphere but it didn't. We think the angle of the impact was not enough to do that. But we also think that Uranus is colder than it should be because of the impact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>But also, when you're talking about planetary impacts, the initial state of matter is a bit irrelevant: a collision big enough to significantly change the planet's orbit or orientation is going to deliver so much energy that the planet will liquefy anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
