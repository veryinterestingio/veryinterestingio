		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it's really big. It's so big, that it looks bigger on the sky than closer black holes.</p>
<p>We can talk about the &quot;angular diameter&quot; or &quot;apparent diameter&quot; of an object. This is how big it looks on the sky, rather than how big it really is. For instance, the Moon and the Sun have about the same angular diameter - half a degree - even though the Sun is much much bigger in actual size. This is of course because the Moon is much closer than the Sun.</p>
<p>The super-massive black hole in M87 is about 3000 times bigger than the super-massive black hole in our own galaxy, and it's about 2000 times further away. So its apparent size is a little bit bigger than our own super-massive black hole.</p>
<p>These two are the two black holes with the greatest apparent sizes. They're still working on releasing the image for our own supermassive black hole - Sag A* - but it's a bit trickier because there's more of our galaxy in the way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even with an 'Earth-sized telescope', the only black holes large enough to be viewed were the supermassive black holes at the center of Messier 87 and our galaxy (Sag A*).  This is governed by an <a href="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/680941f7a551ce5715e9e53fd55651b89be87daa" target="_blank">equation</a>, where a_r is the angular resolution, λ is the wavelength, and D is the diameter of the telescope.</p>
<p>The angular size of this black hole is about 0.0000397&quot;.  The &quot; refers to seconds here, instead of inches.  There are 3600 seconds in a single degree (°).  Radio astronomy is usually done in the millimeter of wavelengths (1 mm to 1 cm), and at 1-2 mm range you get a necessary diameter of around 6300-12600 kilometers (Earth's diameter is 12700).</p>
<p>Messier 87 was chosen because it was slightly larger in angular size than Sag A*, and because it was more stable.  We didn't use another galaxy because none had a bigger supermassive black hole at its core.  In order to account for the fact that the supermassive black holes at the core of other galaxies are thousands of times more distant than our galaxy's core, they must be thousands of times larger, like Messier 87.</p>
<p>Why not a smaller black hole?  Even if we had an active blackhole just 4 light years away (around Alpha Centauri) with an easily seen accretion disk, it would be smaller than Messier 87.  A 50 solar mass black hole would only have an event horizon about 147 kilometers in size.  That yields a .000000801&quot; angular size, which would require a telescope array 628,000 km in diameter.</p>
<p>So basically, we needed a supermassive black hole.  Our own galaxy's core was just barely big enough to see with a telescope the size of Earth at a 1-2 mm wavelength range, but there was one galaxy whose core had a bigger angular size.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This should do a pretty good job of answering your question. It was also co-written by Emily Conover, Adam Conover's (from Adam Ruins Everything) sister. </p>
<p>It's worth the read, but to answer your question as briefly as possible, the size and location of M87 (the black hole in the photo) made it ideal. Compared to the black hole at the center of the Milky Way, M87 was farther away, which helped with it appearing to be more still and cooperate, and it made up in size for being so far away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
