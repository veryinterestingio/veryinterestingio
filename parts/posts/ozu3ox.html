		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s not 25% the size, it’s 25% the radius, which is around 1.5% the volume, so it’s about right </p>
<p>To better explain this imagine the earth and moon as cubes, 25% the radius would mean that the earth is long as much as 4 moon cubes, but that’s just length, it’s still larger because you got also width, and height which are also 4 moon cubes longs, so in total need 4*4*4 or 64 moon cubes to make up the size of the earth cube</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cubed scaling and referring to radius when talking about ambiguous &quot;sizes&quot;</p>
<p>The moon is roughly 1/4 the <em>radius</em> of Earth, that means its 1/64 ( (1/4)^3 ) the <em>volume</em> so it'd be 1/64 the mass if it was the same density.</p>
<p>The reduced mass however means there's less squishing of the rocks towards the center so the rocks end up being less dense than they would be on Earth so the Moon's density is only about 60% so it should end up as roughly 0.9% the mass of Earth</p>
<p>The real radius value is about 27% rather than 25% which results in the mass actually coming out to about 1.2% but its easier to see with 1/4 than with (0.2727)^3</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you stacked four moons side by side they would stretch from one side of the Earth to the other. However, that would just be a line of moons. Not enough to fill a full circle. So you'd need a 4x4 grid to fill a full circle. But that is a circle, not a sphere. To fill a full sphere you need a 4x4x4 grid. SO If you wanted to fill the entire volume of the Earth with moons you would need 4x4x4=64 moons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a reminder that “25% of the Earth’s radius” is not the same thing as 25% of the “size” of the Earth, it might be helpful to know that the surface of the moon is smaller than Asia, about the same size as Russia and Canada combined.  That is big, but it is much smaller than a quarter of the Earth’s surface. You can think of the side of the Moon that always faces us as the size of Russia as a reminder that it’s a lot smaller than the Earth.</p>
<p>More numerically the Earth has a surface area of about 200 million square miles while the Moon’s is about 15 million square miles,  very roughly 16 to 1 instead of 4 to 1, but that might be less viscerally helpful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The moon is 1/4 the radius of Earth. Assuming the moon was precisely the same density as Earth (it's not, but w/e), that means you'd expect the moon to be approximately 1/64th the mass of the Earth, which comes out to about 1.5 and some change percent.</p>
<p>The remaining difference in mass is explained by the fact that the moon's gravity isn't as strong as Earths, thus it's not quite the same overall density, and the fact that the moon isn't quite as metal-rich as the Earth is (most of Theia's denser material ended up as part of the Earth).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
