<p>Thinking of <em>every</em> aspect of humanity and how, somewhere along the lines of bureaucracy, there's a human being slacking/messing up - doesn't that also apply for nuclear development of weapons? </p>
<p>While citizens can do nothing to help or prevent; are nuclear bombs and arms just 'safe' with their creation/storage methods to disallow accidents that could annihilate the world many times over?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can sort of chunk the history of US nuclear weapons safety into a few broad categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1940s through early 1950s: The early weapons were <em>very dangerous</em> once assembled. They had very few safety protections. They could be set off by lightning, fires, what have you. The main safety precaution was that the nuclear core of the weapon could be removed from the non-nuclear components and stored separately. So the odds of them going off were very low, because they weren't assembled until they were intended to be used. So in a sense these were very dangerous weapons (once assembled!), but very safe the rest of the time. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1950s through 1960s: The development of &quot;sealed-pit&quot; weapons made it so that the cores were now permanently part of the weapon. Safety procedures were relatively poor but not terrible — there were &quot;<a href="http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Mk-39-ready-safe-switch.jpg" target="_blank">ready/safe</a>&quot; switches that would interrupt the firing signal if it was sent inappropriately. They started adding &quot;environmental sensors&quot; that would making a firing order unlikely to complete if the weapon wasn't under &quot;realistic&quot; war conditions (like falling through the air). They did tests to try and make sure that if one of the conventional explosives did go off, the weapon was &quot;one-point safe&quot; and unlikely to generate a nuclear yield. (Not all weapons designs were, and sometimes engineering &quot;hacks&quot; were used to make them safer. One warhead had a reel of neutron absorbing material inside of its hollow core that could be withdrawn upon use; it turned out that this made the warheads very unlikely to fire correctly and they all had to be fixed.) This was a time of <em>many</em> nuclear accidents, fortunately none of which generated a nuclear yield. But it came close-enough that people started to worry about it very seriously in the late 1950s, and start creating better regulations and engineering guidelines to make them safer.</p>
</li>
<li>1960s to the present: Continual review of weapon safety, integration of technologies meant to make accidental nuclear use very unlikely, such as using insensitive high-explosives that basically won't detonate unless you set them off in exactly the right way. The integration of Permissive Action Links (PALs), electro-mechanical &quot;locks&quot; on the weapons, so that unauthorized use can't occur. Better creation of &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;weak&quot; links to make it so that under adverse circumstances the weapon won't possibly have a nuclear yield. Etc. I don't want to make it sound like everything from the 1960s onward was super safe — some warheads weren't — but they started taking this very seriously and started taking advantage of safety techniques so that they could be pretty sure that no matter <em>what</em> you did to a nuclear warhead, you wouldn't get a nuclear yield unless you were authorized to get one and were using it under the right circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a very readable overview of this history, see Schlosser's <em>Command and Control</em>. For a video version, Sandia National Lab's three-part <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQEB3LJ5psk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;list=PLouetuxaIMDrht4F8xiS4AY-oLvCq77aA" target="_blank">Always/Never</a></em> does a great job of explaining it, with the engineers and physicists who were involved talking about what they did and what they were afraid of happening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very simple explanation:  </p>
<p>So the core is required to be compressed in order to achieve a real nuclear blast. The core is a ball of reactive material, like plutonium. It is surrounded by shape charges that blast inward.
Out side of that is material that add to all detonation, but not relevant here.  </p>
<p>In order to to achieve total detention every shape-charge must be activated at the exact same time to press the core as small as possible.   </p>
<p>This requires a timing trigger since the wires aren't all the same length.  </p>
<p>The trimmers are what are placed in the weapons to &quot;arm&quot; them. At that point they are dangerous.  </p>
<p>Before that, if one was compromised it would be a fairly light conventions detonation with some radioactive debris. If that debris is in an underground silo, it's not so bad (from a contamination view) since it's contained.    </p>
<p>There are all sorts of safeguard based on material choice for housing, etc. But basically these things area designed not to detonate without the timing trigger being manually installed and activated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sandia National Labs is the primary lab for maintaining and upgrading the nuclear stockpile. They do the engineering of nuclear weapons where Los Alamos handles the actual nuclear package. Sandia has a three part series on YouTube that goes into great detail about the mechanisms in place to stop detonations from accidentally occurring. One of their mottos is &quot;Always, Never&quot; which refers to the requirement that nuclear weapons always need to work when authorized by the President and never work under any other circumstance. That motto is where the title for these videos come from. It's a time investment to watch these, but definitely makes one sleep better at night!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few ways to keep them safe:</p>
<ol>
<li>The nuclear material isn't inserted into the bomb until it's time to use it.  The result of an accident would be a conventional explosion.  The USAF transports nukes around the country all the time, but since those are practice flights, the core is not inserted.</li>
<li>The nuclear material is a sub-critical mass, and requires a <strong><em>very precise</em></strong> explosion to compress it into a critical mass.  If you watch video of the &quot;Trinity&quot; test (the 1st nuclear explosion), you'll see small pockets of asymmetry as the fireball expands.  Even with the most precise calculations and care while building the bomb, a few micro-seconds of delay by one segment during the explosive compression can significantly alter the outcome.</li>
<li>The use of a booster, such as deuterium or tritium; technically, the explosion <strong>would</strong> be a fission process, but the yield is smaller without the booster.  A &quot;Dial-A-Yield&quot; nuke might produce a 5kT explosion, but injecting deuterium/tritium into the core just before detonation can yield 50kT.</li>
<li>&quot;Fail-Safe&quot; devices in the electrical circuitry.  &quot;Little Boy&quot; and &quot;Fat Man&quot; required that the man arming the bomb removed wooden plugs and inserted metal plugs in their place, thereby completing the electrical circuit necessary for the bomb to detonate.</li>
<li>ICBMs have many fail-safes engineered into them, and most are classified.  A missile might detonate in a silo or a sub's launch tube, but that's not a nuclear explosion.</li>

<p>Many 10's of thousands of nuclear missiles and other nuclear ordinances exist throughout the world. Over the decades of their existence, none have detonated accidentally or through manufacturing defects. That doesn't mean it will never happen, but engineers have done a good job so far.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
