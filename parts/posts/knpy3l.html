These documents are basically a chain of custody for the substance and are legally required.  Any failure in compliance comes with steep financial penalties for the company, the individual and can result in both being excluded from the industry.  I'm not sure if these records are readily available to the public, but they are required to be available to inspectors on a moments notice.  Full disclosure - I've been part of an organization audited by the FDA as part of a routine inspection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So this was actually my career for about 7 years. In fact, a specific job I had while in this career was to ensure regulatory compliance for a biotech company within the supply chain.</p>
<p>As mentioned already, Good Manufacturing Practices apply to all stages of the supply chain. Moving the vaccine physically also requires it to be moved in an electronic ERP system as well, which tracks and shows the history including the physical location, the temperature, and the person that moved it.</p>
<p>Any country that the vaccine went to has the right to audit Pfizer and Moderna to check if they're following all compliance. Any company that has helped Pfizer or Moderna make the vaccine has the right to audit them as well. The FDA can literally go to Pfizer tomorrow and ask to see their paperwork and electronic records.</p>
<p>If you work in biotech/pharma, an easy way to get fired is to not follow GMP procedure on something, because the record of that mistake will always be there. Also from experience, if the company does the minimum to follow GMP guidelines, the FDA will most likely tell you to step it up. They don't want to see you do the minimum, they want to see you keeping up with the regulation, technology, and doing what you can to ensure quality and safety of your product. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They have to adhere to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), as all producers of medicinal products do. This is checked by local and federal authorities and is not publicly available.</p>
<p>Transport etc is done according to Good Distribution Practices (GDP), which will cover everything including the temperatures during transportation. </p>
<p>Application again is regulated in Good Clinical Practices GCP...</p>
<p>So, basically every step along the way is performed according to written and approved procedures, by trained (and tested) personel and again controlled by regulatory authorities.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>FDA doesn’t just regulate the formulation and trials used to evaluate the therapeutic itself, but also its production. These regulations are collectively called Current Good Manufacturing Practices or CGMP. Pharma companies must establish QA controls that ensure quality within set statistical boundaries. The same procedures must be used during the trial as afterward:</p>

<p>Companies must also maintain chain of custody controlled documentation for each production batch and throw out anything not within guidelines. The FDA then periodically audits all of this. </p>
