<p>Alpha still exists in the U.S. but is only about 2.9% of cases as of most recent update. It has been on the decline for a while. Delta is 93% of cases and rising. Beta and Gamma also exist in small amounts.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2_Alpha_variant#Table" target="_blank">Alpha has not been seen for months in many other countries.</a></p>
<p>I think it's important to talk a little about what these Greek letters even mean. Not all samples of Delta are identical; it is a virus lineage and a Variant of Concern. Many variations do not warrant a Greek letter. Theta variant was downgraded to Alert for Further Monitoring.</p>
<p>If it seems hard to understand all of these variants and what they do, the WHO and CDC are trying their best to apply labels to an ever-changing evolutionary soup of viruses so of course it's confusing. </p>
<p>Does the original still exist? If you download coronavirus genomes (which anyone can do, for free) you will see small differences between samples even in 2019. Evolution never stops.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>RNA Virus's are always evolving, every time it replicates there are  mutations, which as I understand it is due to how the RNA itself replicates, it's very error-prone.  </p>
<p>At any rate, the original virus in the exact same form, does not exist at this point, unless frozen in a lab somewhere, just the lineage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
