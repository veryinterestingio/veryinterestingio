Are there caves under the seabed of the deepest depths of ocean? Are there caves underneath any segment of ocean? I know the ocean is deeper than any known cave, but hypothetically, could there be caves? </p>
<p>If not, what <em>is</em> under the floor bed? Lava? Compact rock all the way down to the mantle? Tectonic plates? </p>
<p>If you dug 1000 feet below Marianas Trench, what would you come across, if anything at all?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiolite#/media/File:Ofiolite_sequence_EN.svg" target="_blank">schematic cross section</a> through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_crust" target="_blank">oceanic crust</a> illustrates that the upper portions of the seafloor are covered by sediment (typically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelagic_sediment" target="_blank">pelagic sediment</a>) and that directly beneath the sediments are a variety of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basalt" target="_blank">basalts</a>, then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabbro" target="_blank">gabbro</a> (chemically very similar to basalt, but cooled more slowly and so has bigger crystals), and then finally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peridotite" target="_blank">peridotite</a>, i.e. the mantle. The igneous nature of the oceanic crust reflects its generation at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-ocean_ridge" target="_blank">mid-ocean ridges</a>.The thickness of the (igneous) portion of the oceanic crust varies between ~7-10 km thick (and it systematically varies as a function of distance from the mid-ocean ridge, i.e. thin near the ridge and thicker away from the ridge, but controls on detailed oceanic crust thickness are complicated, e.g. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11001-020-09413-x" target="_blank">Zhou et al, 2020</a>), though sediment thickness on top of the oceanic crust <a href="https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/image/sedthick9.jpg" target="_blank">is more variable</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of caves in generic oceanic crust (excluding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_cave" target="_blank">sea caves</a> as these typically reflect formation near the ocean surface from wave action), the closest would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava_tube" target="_blank">lava tubes</a>. These have been described in areas around mid-ocean ridges (e.g. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01081757" target="_blank">Fornari, 1986</a>) and may be partly water filled. These would be restricted to the shallowest parts of the oceanic crust (i.e. in the billow basalt layer in the schematic from above) and from what I could gather, they are not likely that large (i.e. a few meters diameter at most) and they are likely short lived, i.e. after they are no longer actively transporting lava, they mostly collapse, leaving behind &quot;pillars&quot;, but not caves (e.g. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature02032" target="_blank">Perfit et al, 2003</a>). So you might expect to find shallow, narrow, partially water filled tubes near mid-ocean ridge axes, but by the time ocean floor has been translated toward a subudction zone (i.e. by the time it's old and cold enough to be subducted) these lava tubes are likely quite rare (though I at least could not find literature making a definitive statement to that effect).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
