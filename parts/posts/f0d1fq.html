<p>An SD card has millions of those little buttons. They can be pushed back and forth, showing up or down, (0 or 1).  They stay in the position they are in regardless of power.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way any type of flash memory works, uses what's called Non Volatile storage. </p>
<p>A common one is called NAND flash and here's a way of visualizing how it works. </p>
<p>To represent one cell, one 'bit' of storage, imagine there is a tank of water with a pipe leading into it, and a pipe leading out of it.  </p>
<p>Like this: </p>
<pre><code>     Pipe in===|       |=== Pipe Out 
               |       |  
               |  Tank | 
               |_  _ _ |
                   || 
                  Drain</code></pre>
<p>Imagine, normally, the tank is full. </p>
<p>So if you pump water into the tank, it will come pretty quickly out of the other pipe, because the level is full. </p>
<p>Let's call that a &quot;0&quot; state. </p>
<p>Now, you want to write data into that cell, so what you do is you drain a bit of the water level off, so the tank is sitting half full. </p>
<p>Let's call that a &quot;1&quot; state. </p>
<p>How do you determine what state that cell is in? </p>
<p>You pump in a set amount of water. If the tank is full, you'll get flow from the output immediately. If you don't, all that will happen is the tank will fill a little, but you'll get no output. </p>
<p>That way you know what's what, and once it's been set, it doesn't matter if there's power to it or not, it'll remain as it was. </p>
<p>That's not a perfect analogy, but it's roughly how the individual cells of storage work in flash memory. Instead of water, though, you have electrical charge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They &quot;cheat&quot; and there's static electricity in them. Microscopic amounts, but it's still there.</p>
<p>They work similarly to how you get zapped when wearing a wool sweater. Electrons get trapped in billions of tiny &quot;wells&quot;, which makes up the ones and zeros on the chip.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically they have a process (Fowler-Nordheim Tunneling) to trap electrons in an area surrounded by insulators, so the electrons can't go anywhere.  Now, if they have electrons trapped, it creates a change in the local electric field compared to if there weren't electrons trapped there.  They can use the electric field to switch on and off a current flow that is external to the trapped electrons.</p>
<p>So, because the electrons are trapped, and surrounded by insulators, you don't have to apply power, unless you want to read the memory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
