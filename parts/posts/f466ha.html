		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming you're taking about the U.S.:</p>
<p>There are a number of options. These apply to both candidates for office who drop out before the election, lose the election, or retire, and still have funds left over.</p>
<ol>
<li>The campaign can save the money in case the candidate chooses to run again.</li>
<li>The campaign can donate the money to PACs and SuperPACs</li>
<li>The campaign can donate the money to national, state, and local party committees</li>
<li>The campaign donate directly to other candidates election campaigns</li>
<li>The campaign can donate to funds to charities</li>
<li>The campaign can return the funds to the donors</li>
</ol>
<p>The one thing that's <em>not</em> allowed is for the candidate to keep the money for personal use.</p>
<p>Edit: Since people keep bringing it up, candidates can't <em>directly</em> transfer money from a campaign account to a personal bank account, but if they want that money, obviously there are some loopholes and unethical yet legal (or at least not illegal) ways to get it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
