		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, these can be made synthetically. They are not known to occur naturally. Muonic hydrogen and muonic helium are the two that we have worked with. The former can be used for low-energy nuclear fusion, because the muons allow the two protons to get closer together. The latter is interesting because if there is both a muon and an electron, the muon tends to be much closer to the nucleus than the electron, so the electron &quot;sees&quot; a single positive charge and chemically the helium acts more like hydrogen. Muonic lithium has not been made.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Muonic hydrogen - a proton orbited by a muon instead of an electron - has been studied a good deal.  Muons live for an average of about 2 microseconds before decaying, though, so these atoms aren't stable and have to be studied quickly.  In particular, it would be hard for these atoms to form chemical bonds before the muon decays, so there's little data &quot;muonic chemistry.&quot;</p>
<p>The biggest difference is that the radius of the orbit of a lepton in an atom is proportional to 1/mass, and since the muon has a mass about 200 times that of an electron, its orbit in muonic hydrogen is about 200 times smaller.</p>
<p>An interesting side note is that for leptons orbiting a proton, a small shift in its energy occurs that depends on the radius of the proton.  This is know as the Lamb shift.  The funny thing is that if you measure the Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen and calculate the proton radius from it, the answer differs from what you get when you calculate the proton radius from ordinary (electronic) hydrogen.  This is an outstanding problem in physics known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_radius_puzzle" target="_blank">proton size puzzle</a>.</p>
<p>In an effort to resolve the proton size puzzle, muonic duterium (a muon orbiting a nucleus of a proton and neutron) and muonic helium (a muon orbiting a helium nucleus) have been created and studied.  I'm not aware of any nuclei heavier than this that have been studied with muons, but it's certainly possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
