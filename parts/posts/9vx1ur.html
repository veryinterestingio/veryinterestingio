		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is my field! I'm a specialist in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_neurophysiology" target="_blank">clinical neurophysiology</a> (an &quot;electrical neurologist&quot; to Americans).</p>
<p>TLDR; Nerve damage isn't repaired directly, we try to fix the underlying issue if we can. Nerves are considered permanently damaged when function doesn't return after therapy or time has passed. Precise measurements are available for some nerves.</p>
<p><strong>How is nerve damage repaired?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>First of all, we try to remove or alleviate any outside factor causing bad nerve health. Mechanical compression may be relieved by surgery (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndrome" target="_blank">carpal tunnel syndrome</a>). Nerve-eating infections like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphilis" target="_blank">syphilis</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy" target="_blank">leprosy</a> are treated with antibiotics. Some chronic diseases can also be treated, such as  vitamin deficiency (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B12_deficiency_anemia" target="_blank">pernicious anemia</a>) or other disease affecting the nerves (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_neuropathy" target="_blank">diabetes</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraneoplastic_syndrome" target="_blank">cancer</a>). Critically ill patients often also develop <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome" target="_blank">nerve failure</a>.  Often, no cause is found and we can only try to make the body as &quot;normal as possible&quot; - well fed and exercised.</li>
<li>We don't have a general cure that can fix nerve damage. This would be a &quot;holy grail&quot; in neuroscience. Compounds such as nerve growth factor are understood to be important, but have no established role in treating nerve injury. We have drugs that can alleviate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropathic_pain" target="_blank">nerve pain</a> but these do not help repair any damage.</li>
<li>In severe nerve trauma surgery may be tried. One can attempt to bring severed ends of nerves together (nerve suture), or to move a part of a good nerve to where it's needed (nerve autograft), or &quot;artificial nerve&quot; may be attempted to fill a gap in a nerve (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_allograft" target="_blank">nerve allograft</a>). These are typically used in high-impact severe injuries such as  gunshot wounds, stab wounds, high speed impact injuries.</li>
<li>Nerves generally don't grow well, so it's important to remember ways to route around the handicap. Mobility aids such as crutches, splints and wheel chairs are commonly used temporarily or permanently to allow better parts of the body to take over function. Activities or therapies that strengthen neuromuscular function are important to keep what function you have. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroprosthetics" target="_blank">Neuroprosthetics</a> are an area of active research.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Is there a way to tell if nerves are permanently damaged?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, with some significant limitations. The usual period for nerves to recover from injury is up to one year. A nerve injury that has not improved over a significant period of time can be said to be permanent. We can measure neurological function with simple methods such as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wartenberg_wheel" target="_blank">Wartenberg wheel</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex_hammer" target="_blank">reflex hammer</a>.  These simple methods can't detect whether the problem is in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system" target="_blank">peripheral nervous system</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system" target="_blank">central nervous system</a> (or both). There is one widely available method that studies peripheral nerves directly. We can send electric current into nerve fibers and measure the signal at the other end (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_conduction_study" target="_blank">a nerve conduction study</a>). This can locate and measure the degree of nerve injury in large nerve fibers with reasonably high precision. We can also study motor nerve regrowth with a method called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromyography" target="_blank">EMG</a>. Nerve injuries follow a characteristic trend on the EMG study, so we can estimate to some degree if there is more potential for improvement after injury.</p>
<p>We have more limited methods available to study thin nerves (such as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_fiber_peripheral_neuropathy" target="_blank">small-fiber neuropathy</a>) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_neuropathy" target="_blank">autonomic nerves</a>. Some nerves are less available for study, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_root" target="_blank">nerve roots</a>. We generally don't get good images of most nerves. Images tell you how nerves look, but not how they work. Images (radiology) has a less important role than one might think.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Nerves are delicate but simple cable-like structures with the consistency of wet spaghetti. You have about <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25018" target="_blank">one million</a> nerve fibers to the limbs. Avoid nerve injury if you can. There are many different diseases and injuries that affect nerves. Some we can treat, some we can't. If you have a nerve injury, avoid new injuries. It depends and it's complicated.</p>
