<p>If the reaction is moving towards iron (fusion of small atoms or fission of large ones), then the reaction generally will release energy; if it's moving away from iron (fusion of large atoms or fission of small ones) then the reaction will absorb energy and will happen only if sufficient energy is provided e.g. by smashing those atoms together with extreme velocity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because the total energy contained in the atoms undergoing fusion is greater than the total energy contained in the resulting larger atom. So if you smash a few hydrogen atoms together, you get a helium. But there is a difference in total energy contained within the hydrogen atoms and the one helium atom produced. So according to the laws of thermodynamics, since energy must be conserved, the difference in energy between the hydrogens and the helium is released as energy. If it weren't for gravity, this energy release would blow stars apart.</p>
<p>Now that's a vast oversimplification but since this is ELI5 you'll have to forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>Fusion tl,dr: the combined mass of the reactants is greater than the mass of the products, meaning that some mass is converted directly into energy which is released.</strong></p>
<p>With fission, on the other hand, energy is released by breaking a large and unstable atom into smaller parts. There is a certain amount of energy stored in the bonds that hold the nucleus together, and when you rip the nucleus apart, this energy is released.</p>
<p>Edit* minor correction</p>
<p>Edit** Yes, this is a vast oversimplification</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/9x2wfw/eli5_why_smashing_atoms_together_fusion_releases/e9pdwc1/" target="_blank">This answer</a> is my favorite one, but just to dumb it down a bit…</p>
<p>Imagine the periodic table of elements in a line, arranged from the lowest numbers to the highest. Now imagine a pendulum suspended over that line. Fusion is to the left (towards Hydrogen (1)), and Fission is to the right (towards… heavier things like Uranium (92)). In the very center, when the pendulum is <em>exactly</em> pointing downwards, is Iron (26).</p>
<p>If you move the pendulum to the left (fusion) and let it go, it will release energy as it swings towards the middle (iron). Similarly, if you move towards the right, it will release energy as it moves back towards the middle. When the pendulum is to the left swinging back middle, elements are getting heavier (e.g. hydrogen (1) is fused to create (mostly) helium (2)). When the pendulum is to the right moving back to the middle, elements are getting lighter (e.g. uranium (92) fission resulting in, among other things, strontium (38)).</p>
<p>Just as with a real pendulum, you get more energy the further to one side you go. Hydrogen fusion produces exponentially more energy than helium fusion. Similarly, Uranium fission is radically more energetic than fission of a lighter element (e.g. you could hypothetically produce energy through fission of enriched Silver (47), but it would be a microscopic amount of energy compared to Uranium or higher). You can get an idea of how much energy is released from each point on the pendulum by looking at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion#/media/File:Binding_energy_curve_-_common_isotopes.svg" target="_blank">this excellent graph</a> on wikipedia.</p>
<p><em>Also</em> much like a pendulum, if you push it far enough to one side and release the pendulum all at once, it will swing <em>past</em> the midpoint (iron) and push energy into the opposite side, eventually slowing to a halt and then swinging back again. This is exactly how heavier-than-iron elements such as uranium came to exist in the first place: giant balls of primarily hydrogen under intense heat and pressure experienced runaway-fusion reactions that swung the atomic energy pendulum massively past the neutral point due to the massive amount of excess released all in a single moment. We generally call these reactions &quot;supernovae&quot;, and the balls of gas in question &quot;stars&quot;.</p>
<p>This is one of the ways that we know that our solar system (including Earth, all of the planets and asteroids and comets, and even the Sun itself!) coalesced billions of years ago from the remnants of an <em>older</em> star which violently exploded billions of years prior to that. If this weren't the case, then it would be impossible for us to find heavy metals such as uranium (or gold, or silver, etc) on Earth today, since such elements can <em>only</em> form during a particularly energetic supernova. We are are made of star dust, all of us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are four fundamental forces to this universe (this reality): gravity, electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force.  The distance that the forces work on decrease in the order I just gave.  Strong and weak forces are the ones involved in the processes of fusion and fission.  They work on the scale of the nucleus (strong force) or smaller (individual atomic particles; weak force).</p>
<p>Fission is mostly a weak nuclear force process (breaking of protons or neutrons into subatomic particles) involving very small distances (the size of a proton or neutron).  Lots of energy is involved and released when a proton or neutron breaks into smaller particles. Neutrons or protons completely disappear when this happens, and the energy you get is the energy that was used to make a proton or neutron in the first place from the even smaller stuff that is now released.</p>
<p>Fusion is mostly a strong nuclear force process.  Bringing protons together with neutrons to make a larger nucleus also releases a lot of energy (strong force acts over the size range of a nucleus).  The energy comes from combining two nucleii into one (more protons and neutrons in the same small space saves energy, costs less energy to exist than if there were two half-sized atoms, at least concerning the strong force).  </p>
<p>Fusion releases more strong energy than it uses to keep the darn protons from flying apart because of coulomb force (charge repulsion), until you get up to the element iron.  After that, it costs more energy to make the atom than gets gained by bringing pieces together. (charge repulsion &quot;wants&quot; the nucleus to fly apart even if it usually doesn't yet).</p>
<p>Mostly, fission works best (gives off useful energy) when dealing with elements beyond iron. Fusion mostly works best with elements lighter than iron.  Often, with very large elements, there are several steps involved, some involve release of a small atom (a helium nucleus) along with release of weak nuclear force energy and a bunch of the tiny particles used to make protons and neutrons.  The loss of a helium is basically reverse fusion, so there is not a major gain of energy (even might be some loss), but the weak force gains that happen at the same time are enormous and offset it.  At least with the big elements.</p>
<p>Fusion releases energy with smaller elements, mostly, and fission releases energy with larger elements, mostly.  Different forces are involved.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
