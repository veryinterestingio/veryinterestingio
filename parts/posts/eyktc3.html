		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Real atomic clocks use some gas of a specific element, like caesium or rubidium. The element has a natural resonance frequency, which means it interacts most strongly with microwaves of a specific frequency.</p>
<p>You stick the gas in a box and beam microwaves at it. You can then detect how strongly the gas interacts with the microwaves (e.g. by producing more microwaves or absorbing them, depending on the design). So you have a circuit generate the microwaves at an adjustable frequency, and then you have another circuit basically &quot;tune&quot; the first one until it finds the best frequency, much like you would manually tune a radio to a station until you get the best reception. After a while the whole thing slowly becomes very stable when the right frequency is found and narrowed down.</p>
<p>To count seconds, you have a third circuit just divide down the microwave signal. Since you know the frequency at which the gas should resonate, you just count up to that number and every time you reach it, a second has passed.</p>
<p>The store-bought clocks you find labeled &quot;atomic clocks&quot; are just normal clocks with a radio receiver that picks up time signals sent by a radio station that itself has a real atomic clock.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An atomic uses a clump of atoms of a pure element.  When excited, these atoms vibrate at a specific frequency that depends on the element's electron alignments.  By counting the vibrations, you can get a very precise clock that's stable over a long time period.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OP - you are not asking about the &quot;atomic clocks&quot; that sit on a desktop or a nightstand, are you?  If you are, those DO NOT have a cesium atom vibrating inside.  </p>
<p>Those clocks actually have radio receivers that listen for data transmission by NIST (in the U.S.).  Those radio transmissions are linked to the NIST atomic clocks which DO have a cesium atom vibrating inside.</p>
<p>Side note - I have 3 different desktop &quot;atomic clocks&quot;, no two of which display the same time, and none of which displays the correct time.  Admittedly, they are all quite old - 15-20 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
