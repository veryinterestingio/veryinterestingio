<p>x̂(t) = x̂(0) + p̂(0) t/m</p>
<p>is arrived at after applying the commutator value [x̂, p̂] = iħ to the Heisenberg Equation of Motion for position of a free mass which says</p>
<p>dx̂/dt = i[Ĥ,x̂].</p>
<p>In classical mechanics, x and p can be determined simultaneously with infinite precision, that is to say, the Uncertainty relation, the Quantum Commutator is at the heart of which, does not exist in CM, and yet the classical analogue of the Quantum Commutator, the Poisson Bracket {x,p} = 1, leads to the same equation as above for the classical position of a free mass after using a classical Hamiltonian.</p>
<p>So why do these apparent similarities lead to different (<em>for ex., the abovementioned uncertainty principles, which I know arises due to Cauchy-Schwarz inequality restrictions on the Hilbert vector space, but what prevents this in CM vector spaces?</em>) as well as similar (equation of motion) results? What actually makes CM different than QM?</p>
<p>And what are some more such examples where CM and QM differ in results?</p></div></div>

<p>The canonical Poisson bracket and canonical commutation relation look similar on the surface, but the interpretations of those equations are very different. Just look at the postulates of QM versus the postulates of classical mechanics (Shankar has a good comparison in his QM text). x and p mean very different things in QM and CM. In classical mechanics, they are continuous, real-valued functions, parametrized by time. And to find them, you just solve Hamilton's equations. In QM, these are Hermitian operators. Particles don't have well-defined positions or momenta, they have state vectors (or wavefunctions, in the coordinate representation).</p>
<p>As for how they differ in results, see any of the major experiments in quantum mechanics (double slit, Stern-Gerlach, etc.). Classical mechanics would not correctly predict the results.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The deeper I get into theoretical physics (now doing a PhD) the more similar Classical and Quantum mechanics look to me. The differences are in fact extremely subtle, so be very skeptical of everything you read. Replacing Poisson brackets with commutators does nothing on the surface, it’s still the same algebraic structure. The real difference is when the commutators are NOT just equal to the Poisson bracket (times i*h). And this is related to what’s called anomalies in quantization, which is a topic not covered even in graduate QM classes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best example I can give is in thermodynamics. It gives terrible results if we use classical mechanics to certain situations like temperature near zero. If we use quantum like properties, we approximate the classical to the quantum results. One difference might be considering particles throw their quantum numbers (spin angular momentum etc) instead of speed and position). No to mention quantum tunneling as an example of different properties. Energy is also a factor ( relativity Vs classical )</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
