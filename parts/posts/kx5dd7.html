		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Soil biologist here: Yes, the soil does run out of nutrients eventually. As the plant runs out of room in the pot, and as nutrients start to run out, the plant will simply not grow as much, lowering its energy demand. But the plant still needs some small amount of nutrients to sustain itself, even if it's not actively growing - so eventually the plant will die if the soil nutrients aren't replenished. This can be done with occasional additions of new soil or fertilizer. This is also why so much emphasis is placed on the soil microbiome (bacteria and fungi). The soil microbes can break down organic matter in the soil to provide new nutrients to the plant, extending the length of time that the plant can survive in that soil. The soil microbiome is really the reason most plants in nature can survive so long and why the soil (in a forest, for instance) doesn't run out of nutrients for plant growth.</p>
<p>Edit: as a disclaimer, my research focuses on soil microbes and how they cycle nutrients and associate with plants out in the wild. I'm not much of a gardener myself, so if you have questions about how to help your plants thrive, I recommend heading over to r/gardening or r/houseplants to get advice!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The soil does eventually run out of nutrients and the plant needs to be repotted.  Happens all the time.  How fast that happens depends on the soil, the plant, and whether you &quot;feed&quot; the plants or not.  Not all plants are the same when it comes to needs and consumption, and usually, potting soil is already a pretty nutrient-rich soil so most plants will survive quite a long time before facing problems.  It tends to be that nutrient depletion occurs pretty close to the same time as the plant becoming &quot;potbound&quot; (all roots) and suffers from water deprivation pretty fast anyway (water drains right through), so many people think the problem is water rather than nutrients.  The solution is repotting in either case, so the result is the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The plant only gets small amounts of micronutrients from soil. Things like fixed nitrogen, iron, and the small amounts of salt they need.</p>
<p>Every bit of macronutrients they get, all of the fuel for their growth and even the carbon that makes up their structure, comes from the air and the energy of the sun.</p>
<p>So the pot can run out of nutrients, but those are not the most important nutrients and it is very likely the plant can survive a pretty decent amount of time without them. Just like how a human can survive without vitamin c, but will have the symptoms of scurvy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plants don't eat earth.</p>
<p>Plants eat sunlight and bad air that has been breathed out by animals.<br />
They just season it with a tiny bit of earth.<br />
Thus relatively little amount of earth can og a long way.</p>
<p>Like how people only sprinkle a little salt on their food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
