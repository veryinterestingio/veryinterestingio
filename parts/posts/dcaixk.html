		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the dangers come from the glycemic response to these various foods.</p>
<p>Pure sugar with nothing to slow the absorption rate will spike your blood sugar. This causes your pancreas to release Insulin to counteract that spike, which in turn reduces your blood sugar below normal levels, so your body releases glucose into the blood stream to compensate, which spikes it again, causing your pancreas to release more insulin... Lather, rinse, repeat until your glucose levels have hit a steady baseline.</p>
<p>This yo-yo effect taxes your pancreas significantly, as well as has other downstream effects on your body. </p>
<p>The more effort it takes your body to absorb the sugars, the healthier it is for your system when consumed in moderation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Sugar&quot; is a slightly problematic term, because it is a term for a class of compounds. </p>
<p>Table sugar, which is normally what we have around, is sucrose, which is made up of two simple sugars stuck together. Your body has no issue splitting them up, so each molecule of sucrose becomes 1 glucose and 1 fructose.</p>
<p>Most sweet foods contain either sucrose directly, or &quot;high fructose corn syrup&quot; which, is a mixture of fructose and glucose all mixed together.</p>
<p>Carbs are mostly just long chains of glucose, and enzymes happily cleave off glucose from the chains and use it. So carbs become sugar, but mostly, become glucose. This is energy for the whole body, every cell.</p>
<p>The difference comes with fructose.... remember the sucrose is a source of it.... When your liver processes sugars, it makes fats and cholesterol. This is &quot;de novo lipogenysis&quot; which is just the fancy latin way of saying &quot;the creation of new fat&quot;.</p>
<p>The thing is, remember how I said glucose is food for your whole body? Because of that, only a small percentage &lt;10% ever gets processed by the liver.</p>
<p>Fructose however is not an energy source for every cell. Fructose is processed in the liver, and 90% of it goes there. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructolysis" target="_blank">Fructolysis</a> is the process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike glucose, which is directly metabolized widely in the body, fructose is almost entirely metabolized in the liver in humans, where it is directed toward replenishment of liver glycogen and triglyceride synthesis.[1] Under one percent of ingested fructose is directly converted to plasma triglyceride.[2] 29% - 54% of fructose is converted in liver to glucose, and about a quarter of fructose is converted to lactate. 15% - 18% is converted to glycogen.[3] Glucose and lactate are then used normally as energy to fuel cells all over the body.[2]</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few reasons:</p>
<p>1.) The amount of carbohydrates you get per-pound from more complex foods is much less than the amount from processed table sugar, and it also takes more time to digest. So, it's more difficult to overeat. A pound of table sugar will be stored mostly as fat, while a pound of chicken will need to be broken down and digested first. Whatever sugars are extracted will mostly be used, and only a minimal amount will be stored.</p>
<p>2.) Table sugar has virtually no other nutrients or minerals, so you won't be getting any of those either.</p>
<p>3.) It can be killer for your teeth, since bacteria <em>love</em> sugar.</p>
<p>Sugar itself isn't bad - in fact you need it. <em>Added</em> sugars are bad, because too much will cause your body to store it. This can lead to weight gain, heart disease, and a whole slew of other problems primarily caused by overeating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not all carbs do.  Some fibers get broken down to component parts only by the bacteria in your colon, at the very end of the digestive tract.  Others are somewhere in the middle but are still used mainly by bacteria without resulting in sugars that get absorbed.  These bacteria are very important for your digestive and nervous systems as a whole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What does it mean &quot;unhealthy&quot; exactly? It's a very vague term. A tablespoon of sugar is just too much sugar to be used immediately by the average human, so most of it becomes stored as fat. If that is what you consider unhealthy, then yes, it's unhealthy. But if you need the carbohydrates, because you are doing heavy work, then a tablespoon of sugar is &quot;fine&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
