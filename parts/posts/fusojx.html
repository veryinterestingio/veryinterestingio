		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because bleach breaks down into salt.</p>
<p>Bleach works because it is very reactive and it breaks down a lot of organic material it comes into contact with, but the bleach itself also reduces to salt.</p>
<p>Pure bleach breaks down over time which is why bleach that is a year old isn't as effective.</p>
<p>When you mix it with water, it breaks down faster and so isn't as useful the next day because there isn't as much bleach left.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>This was a nice read, and almost your exact question, with a little background.</p>
<p>tl:dr -  &quot;To simplify things for you, you could make a smaller amount (2 tablespoons diluted in 4 cups water)&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
