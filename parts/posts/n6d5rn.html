		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Antibody titres will eventually decrease. However, the cells that produce them (B-cells) should persist in your body for much of your life. They will slow down antibody production over time, but will reactivate, and proliferate should they detect a similar infection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So remember that antibodies are just proteins produced by a certain type of white blood cell--if you want to use a war analogy, think of them more like miniature mines left by the immune system that catch onto passing pathogens. They have a half-life of about one month (depending on the type), meaning after that time half of the antibodies in your blood have degraded.</p>
<p>Generally the mechanism by which we &quot;remember&quot; past infections is that during the initial immune response, a small population of the white blood cells that produced the antibodies sequester themselves off into lymph nodes and go dormant. However, they are ready for reactivation whenever they get the signal, which means you can react much more quickly the second time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The actual antibodies formed (physically) have a half life on the order of weeks. They are formed and then they are degraded. The cells that make them - plasma cells - are a bit longer lived but once your body is no longer exposed to the antigen, there's no reason for them to stick around. You don't want to spend your body's energy in mass producing antibodies that are useless. But that doesn't mean you lose immunity. There are memory B cells  that live on without producing antibodies. But when your body gets re-exposed to the antigen they are raised against, they differentiate and multiply into plasma cells and start mass-producing antibodies again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ul>
<li>
<p>You have cells against a lot of proteins, including ones against COVID19. They can be B cells or T cells, they have different functions, B cells develop full in the Bone marrow, T cells in the Thymus, hence the names. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These cells are very few (it could even be just one cell), the first time you get infected, they are told to multiply. B cells turn into plasma B cells which are the one that produce antibodies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Antibodies and plasma B cells don't live long, but as long as their target is present, there are a variety of signals that keep telling them to multiply. There are more new cells being made than old cells dying. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you defeat the pathogen, these signals aren't there anymore and the cells stop multiplying, but they keep dying so their number goes down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A low number of plasm B cells has receptors for substances that are constantly produced that tell them to survive longer and to keep multiplying at a slow rate, which is just enough to keep their number stable. These are called memory cells. </p>
</li>
<li>The next time you get infected, these memory cells can react faster than normal B cells, plus instead of starting from 1 cell, you start from a higher amount. This saves a lot of time and makes you able to reach an effective concentration of antibodies much faster.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is not known yet how long the antibodies stick around, it was thought initially that it was not that long, a few months maybe. Studies will be ongoing for some time. As others explained there is a lot of other cells involved in the immune response too.</p>
<p>I had corona last year end of March, and still test positive for post infection antibodies. I take part in a study where I get my antibodies checked every 4 weeks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
