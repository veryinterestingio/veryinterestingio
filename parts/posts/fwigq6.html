		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those are not your eyes, but your brains playing tricks. To see, we create an image in our head based on the pictures we stored. We fill in the gaps with our mind. So at night you fill in a lot.
This is also a reason why we see a face or person in other objects, like burned toast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A big part of it is the survival benefit of false positive vs false negative detection of a predator.   In the dark your brain is working to see something.  It will take any stimulus that looks fishy and alert you to seeing “something”.   It is usually a false positive I.e nothing there just a trick of the eye.   Occasionally (often enough to be a evolutionary driver) that slight stimulus is a predator about to pounce, in which your reaction could save your life.   </p>
<p>If your brain ignores all of these tricks there is a danger a predator would be missed and you get eaten.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, think about it. Your brain is designed to learn from patterns, and 100k years ago, identifying certain patterns was literally a life and death situation. So, let’s hypothetically say that your homo Erectus cousin Marcus died just yesterday in a dry savanna. Killed by a lioness that was covering herself almost perfectly on the dry grass. The only thing that stood her apart were the whites patterns of her ears, but your cousin decided after telling you that looked fishy, decided to “go check it out”, and died. </p>
<p>Next time you are in the same savanna, you WILL be looking for “ear shaped” grass with distinctive white patterns.  And will never go “check it out” again. In fact, you will teach your children to recognize the pattern. </p>
<p>Our brain does not know the difference between living in the Savanna and walking around in an apartment at night. It’s always scanning for patterns to protect us from shit. </p>
<p>I will end my rant with this. I read somewhere that our brain can recognize a snake on the floor even when our eyes haven’t yet. It is a instinctive behavior. This is so, even for children. So there, our brains are awesome.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So you see most color out of the center of the eye, and grayscale is mostly your side vision. At night, when there is little light to make color, you actually see better out of the corner of your eye than when you directly look at something. </p>
<p>So, actually, your boogeyman that goes away when you look right at it is probably there. Sorry, hypothetical 5yo child.</p>
<p>Edit: unless you're talking about things like closed eye visuals, then idk</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's evolutionary. Back when early species of humans were walking around the plains of Africa at night, making out the shape of what might be a predator was an evolutionary advantage. Because of this, your brain is programmed to create shapes that resemble common things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
