Crossed arms, pockets, on hip, lean against something, etc... letting your hands dangle seems to be avoided at all costs.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It comes down to mechanics and socialisation.</p>
<p>Mechanically speaking, arms just hanging are dead weight and so they feel uncomfortable on the shoulder after a while. Also when walking, swinging feels more natural as it works with the momentum of your body</p>
<p>Socialisation: body language. Your body language is most telling when you're doing something actively, hence the 'default' arms hanging down tells little. It makes more sense when still to keep hands in other ways for communication</p>
<p>Edit: it's worth noting that the mechanical reasons don't affect everyone the same way. Technically speaking, an arm straight down acts as a pivot that comcentrates mass downwards, and also makes it harder for blood to pump upwards. However, this can vary due to various reasons. </p>
<p>A person with shorter arms will have less of a pivot/less distance to pump blood,</p>
<p>A person with muscular arms will have more weight for a pivot but possibly stronger heart to pump blood</p>
<p>A person with slouched or uneven shoulders will have their arms very slightly angled to their body as opposed to straight down, causing the pivot to be lesser but it's likely they have a weaker heart due to less exercise</p>
<p>A person with a missing arm may have the other arm swing more drastically or move more to compensate for the momentum the other arm cannot exert</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ah, neutral stance. Some presentation technique trainings will tell you to adopt this stance, especially when someone is asking a question, or making objections to what you're saying. It's supposed to be a posture that is not aggressive or defensive, but shows the other person that you are listening and open to what they are saying.</p>
<p>We're told to practice neutral stance; the hands must be absolutely dead: no shaking, no trembling, no fidgeting with something, no going into pockets, no grabbing the waist or the other hand, no folding arms... It is extremely weird and uncomfortable, but once you get over that hump, you'll find it to be very effective. At least until a global pandemic hits, and you're not allowed to be in front of customers anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A body language coach I had at a management course told me that people feel uncomfortable with their hands at their sides because it is an expression of confidence and a sense of comfortability with whomever you are talking with. </p>
<p>He said that you tend to notice that small children tend to have no problems with hands at their side, unless you are a shy kid. But as you age, people get used to adopting defensive postures with strangers - like crossed arms or hands to the front. </p>
<p>The most natural, unassuming and welcoming position is hands by side. You have to unlearn bad behaviours, but once you are used to it I think it makes a difference</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Arms are heavy.  Due to the nature of the joint it's reliant on muscle to stay in place (ball and socket joint)  vs your knee (hinge joint)  which is also stabilized taped together by ligaments.  Muscles fatigue makes the shoulder uncomfortable after a while,   repositioning is natural.  Also you gotta protect that soft underbelly with all the squishy organs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
