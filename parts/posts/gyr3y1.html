		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OMG! Finally something I can answer! Okay well I can only answer the first part. So your epiglottis is this small leaf-like flap in your throat that pretty much filters whether something goes down your esophagus (food tube) or your larynx (air tube), kinda like switch on train tracks. Sometimes when drinking water or eating food, our brain is either zoned out, or focused on something else and doesn't tell our epiglottis to close the track to our larynx, therefore leading to foreign substances going down the wrong way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I mean, considering how often you do these things, you actually have a wonderful success rate. You chew on average, let's say 100 times a day. If you bite your tongue once every few months, there's still multiple thousands of times that you didn't do that.</p>
<p>Sometimes you just get unlucky I suppose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These small “bugs” that effect humans and other species are simply not consequential enough to be bred out over a long period of time. </p>
<p>Think about it this way: </p>
<p>Does biting your tongue make you any less attractive to the opposite sex? Nope. So you’re just as likely to pass on your accidental-tongue-biting genes to your offspring. </p>
<p>Okay, so does biting your tongue make you more likely to die early? Also no, so you’ll continue living your life normally.</p>
<p>And then keep this cycle up for thousands of years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My mom went to a bite specialist and learned that about 60% of us have an underdeveloped jaw that can make our tongue sit incorrectly in our mouths and cause a multitude of issues. I remembered that aspiration was one of them because I do it all the time lol. I'm sure biting your tongue would also make sense if that were the case.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
