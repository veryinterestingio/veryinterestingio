		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a nuclear engineer. Elements can have different weights when they have different numbers of neutrons in their nucleus. A reactor is a neutron throwing machine. Certain atoms split into pieces when it absorbs a neutron, making smaller atoms, while others hold onto the neutron and get bigger. Generally, more neutrons make the atom radioactive, meaning it spits out energy and/or parts of the atom to be more stable, like a ball rolling down a hill. So, after running for 3-4 years, nuclear fuel has made some of every element in different weights. That includes toxic metals, which makes it chemically toxic, and many radioactive versions of atoms.</p>
<p>People have long been conditioned to be afraid of radiation, though compared with most industrial hazards it is pretty easy to manage. In fact, the atoms that decay slowly (&quot;they last for hundreds of thousands of years&quot;) release radiation slowly, and is of little risk. The real problem ones last a hundred to two hundred years, which is relatively easy to store.</p>
<p>The short answer is fear and lack of perspective. Basically, reactors make a chemical soup that is capable of putting out a lot of energy for a couple hundred years, and after that you're left with a weird mix of elements. We have multiple techniques for reusing, recycling, and safely storing the used fuel, but fear keeps hitting those ideas down and we're left in a weird limbo as an industry. Essentially, a technically challenging but solved problem is being confused with the politically challenging and unsolved problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The waste from current nuclear power plants is highly radioactive and also toxic. It is stored on site under a pool of water until the worst of the radioactive isotopes have decayed but some of the particles will have half lives in the thousands to hundreds of thousands of years. This means the waste remains dangerous for thousands of years. Finding a place which is safe to store it is difficult, convincing locals to let you build that storage is even more difficult and then you have the cost of actually building long term storage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Old reactors worked this way, definitely - they made spent fuel that is hard to safely store.</p>
<p>Modern reactors don't. Heck, some modern reactors can use old-school spent fuel as secondary fissile (fuel) material! And then the waste they produce is pretty inert (harmless), edit: at least the waste we don't recycle, I should say!</p>
<p>In short, nuclear science had come a long way, and modern reactor waste is not remotely as dangerous as old-school spent fuel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What really needs to happen:  refine it, reuse it.  This is possible and would save loads of money and prevent further spent fuel needing to be stored.  This is completely possible and done in some countries-France for example, and should be an environmental priority.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not here to argue. But I would like to share <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/pdopinion/2009/02/nuclear_power_vs_clean_coals_d.html" target="_blank">this article here</a></p>
<p>Just scroll down to read the radioactive waste from a coal plant, and compare it to a nuclear plant.</p>
<p>That said? Green all the way. Nuclear would be a <em>great</em> step away from coal though to help bridge the gap as far as carbon emissions go however. The article I'm sharing though is just to illuminate <em>how insanely bad coal is</em> compared to literally the most though of radioactive producer that actually isnt. Nuclear power just concentrates it incredibly.</p>
<p>Now, compare coal to green, and ask yourself why people still argue for coal....</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
