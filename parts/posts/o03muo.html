<p>The Earth reflects enough of the Sun's light that it illuminates the Moon just a little bit. So the side of the Moon facing the Earth is never completely dark, even at &quot;night&quot;. With a long exposure camera, you can actually take a photo of the crescent Moon and see all the craters and stuff on the dark side, while overexposing the lit crescent.</p>
<p>There are some nice pictures on the internet:</p>

Now imagine how bright the Earth must be at night on the moon! That's what you're seeing. It's the Earth's reflecting sunlight back to the moon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's real earthshine! Through a telescope, you can even faintly make out the maria and bright spots on the Moon, when you put the bright part out of the field of view.</p>
<p>When the moon is a crescent, the near side of the moon is looking back at an almost full (so very bright) Earth. So it is illuminated dimly by earthshine, which then gets reflected back at us.</p>
<p>But when the Moon is nearly full, looking back at the Earth, the Moon sees a crescent or &quot;new&quot; earth, so there isn't much earthshine to illuminate the moon, so the thin sliver of dark part of the moon is pitch-black (or at least, the same color as the background sky)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on where you're at, I think at certain latitudes you can see crescent moons higher in the sky while they're still receiving large amount of Earth shine. For example, here in Florida, the recent razor thin crescent moon had an extremely visible earth shine effect, you can see the entire moons circle shape extremely well outside of the sunlit crescent portion. The effect is stronger when the crescent is smaller, and the smaller the crescent the sooner it sets in the evening (for a waxing moon), or the sooner it rises in the morning (for a waning moon). So the thin of the crescent, the less it's visible before it sets or before the sky starts to brighten from the sun. Your latitude often decides how well you can see the smallest of crescent moons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
