		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pollution is not a major factor anymore.  There are still some pollution problems in US ocean waters, but they're not things that make the water <em>visibly</em> dirty.</p>
<p>The biggest factor is phytoplankton.  Contrary to what you might expect, Caribbean waters are very low in nutrients compared to the Northeast US, and so fewer microscopic plants grow in Caribbean waters.  Abundant plant life makes US east coast waters murky and green.  You can see the difference by satellites which measure the amount of chlorophyll in the water:</p>

<p>This may seem backwards, after all, isn't the Caribbean known for scuba diving and abundant coral reefs?  Well yes, but there's actually a lot more critters living off the coast of Massachusetts than the Bahamas, they're just boring to look at, hard to see in the murky water, and the water's too cold to make for fun diving.</p>
<p>The other major factor is weather and sunlight.  The Caribbean gets more direct sunlight, and it more often shines straight down into the water, which gives a bluer color, especially when the water is bluer to start with (see above).  Gray overcast skies in the Northeast make for gray-looking water.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>color of the ocean depend on what's in the water, how deep the water is, and what is under it. </p>
<p>To get classic light blue look, you need shallow water, sandy bottom and very few particles in the water. </p>
<p>Rivers carry mud into the sea, swampy shoreline also lets mud leak into seawater.</p>
<p>Edit. Look at sattelite image of any coast, e.g. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fort+Lauderdale,+FL/@26.1961345,-80.1122519,11931m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x88d9012720facaf5:0x7602be7540bf8ebe!8m2!3d26.1224386!4d-80.1373174" target="_blank">Ft. Lauderdale</a>.<br />
As you move around, you see that color of the water changes, and it is greener near river inlets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The top answer also fails to point out that the depth of the waters is also a factor.</p>
<p>The Atlantic is significantly deeper on average. The blue sky is going to be reflected when you can see the bottom of the ocean. Further the color of the dirt at the bottom of the ocean is another huge factor when reflecting light.</p>
<p>The Caribbean is full of white sand - while much of the Atlantic basin is darker mud (due in large part to river sediments from the continents - the nutrient content mentioned in top answer).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
