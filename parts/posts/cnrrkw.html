<p>How do we account for these differences? Are there animals that have consistently had similar toxicities as humans that are used (mice? pigs?)? Are compounds tested in many different species? I know they can be tested on human cell lines, but that doesn’t necessarily equate to the whole system.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even though it's true that different species may have different response to a certain toxic substance, it's something that we are aware of and can adjust for in toxicology studies. It's also a matter of which model is more suitable for each case. As a rule of thumb, the closest the animal is to us, the more reliable the results will be. So the best models would be large apes, like chimpanzees, gorillas or orangutans, but they are rarely used for obvious reasons. Instead, one common technique is to use two animal models, one rodent (rat, mouse, guinea pig) and one something else (dogs or pigs, for example). If both show the same toxic effect its more likely that humans will suffer it too. In any case, any LD50 should always include the model used to determineit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to the other post about testing in multiple species like mice, dogs, and pigs, knowledge about the toxicity mechanism and pathways help to establish how universal the initial finding is going to be.</p>
<p>Toxin A is a synthetic chemical that interferes with a central cell function of an animal model, say DNA replication. These central functions do not vary much throughout the animal kingdom, so the likelihood is increased that it will be toxic for humans. If you then find that it's chemically simple and can slowly diffuse throughout the body without assistance, the likelihood increases further. If the body can't break it down, it must flush it out/store it somewhere out of the way, if it can. Etc. These are the kind of characteristics one would find in a universal toxin.</p>
<p>Toxin B is made by an spider who hunts by injecting it into prey, or defend against a predator. It then acts by paralysing the victim, by blocking nerve signals. This mechanism is more specific, but since we all have nerves there is typically an LD50. This value is different per toxin because there are small superficial changes between our evolved components. Also, many spider venoms are proteins that would just get digested if eaten. So, animals eating a spider will tend to be fine if it doesn't get bitten in the process.  P.S. don't feed your pet, just in case. Exceptions always occur.</p>
<p>Toxin C is made by a plant, which tend to be esoteric chemicals. From a survival perspective, they don't really care if the stuff kills you or just gives you a bad itch. So the results can vary a lot. Ones like oxalic acid are tiny and easy to make by the plant, which technically has an LD50 but you'd be okay if it was a small amount. Many plants make these. Others like theobromine (chocolate), caffeine, and capsaicin (chili) are larger and  somewhat more difficult to make, but are still meant to be some sort of neurotoxin to tell a herbivore that they are not supposed to eat the seed. As it turns out, humans have developed a taste for such toxins and a metabolism to break them down. Dogs have not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is work being done right now to get around some of those limitations, such as humanized mice. They have cells or tissues from humans that supplant their normal cells or tissues. For instance, there are mice with livers made from human cells that should metabolize drugs more similarly to humans.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the most part LD50s are not really conducted today like they were years ago.  Additionally, testing would be controlled for a single cmpd or so, therefore no studies would be run with raisins, they’d probably extract whatever chemical they were interested in or expected to see toxicity with, to verify its range.  So if you’re talking about toxicity testing within Pharma, here’s how it’s broken down.</p>
<p>Early Discovery type studies, like MTD (maximum tolerated dose) studies will be conducted to verify if the animal model being used will be tolerated and the animals will survive the planned dose regimen.  Those are generally rodent models, and are looking to maximize exposure to maximize the efficacious effect they’re exploring.  Scientist will then look at the exposure vs efficacy and plot that against predictive models in humans.  These predictive models look at modes of clearance/metabolism in humans and the prediction of how well it binds to the human target vs in animal.  Additional efficacy studies will be conducted and when they have a cmpd of interest it then goes to Nonclinical Safety testing, which I think is what you were really asking about.</p>
<p>Nonclinical Safety studies are required to be conducted via strict regulations governed by the FDA (in US).  The pharma companies are required to provide safety data in at least 2 species, one being a rodent model and the other non-rodent (eg dogs, pigs, primates).  They will conduct numerous in vitro binding assays to determine the most sensitive species, so the animal models will contain similar efficacious sites of binding as humans, and they also have to show that there is adequate exposure (meaning drug actually gets into system and isn’t just expelled).  If for some reason there isn’t a second species which show exposure, or there is no active site in the animal models, you can provide scientific justification to proceed with a single species, if warranted.  Once you have your two species chosen and start conducting Tox studies, you take a step wise approach, a single dose acute study, to a 7day Tox, to 14 day Tox, until the pivotal 28 day IND studies.  At each of those steps you generally have 3 different dose levels you look at (low mid high) vs a control group.  The idea is to have toxic findings in high dose groups, a clean low dose, with the mid dose helping to figure out thresholds.  We never want any animal deaths on these studies, as that would lose important data.  So toxic findings in the high dose should be more like tissue damage identified after histopath evaluation following the necropsy, not overt adverse clinical signs.  There are many known common findings in these animal models that are known to be species specific, so we can discount them effecting humans right off the bat.  Next we see if we’ve identified similar toxicities in both species, and if so, then the likelihood of it occurring in humans goes up.  If Tox is only in a single species, then you look at the genetic makeup of what you’re hitting, and is it similar enough to humans to cause an issue.</p>
<p>So once you e identified all potential toxicities, you’re then looking for an efficacious drug that has a clean toxicity profile to allow it to next move into human clinical trials.  The threshold is generally a 10x safety margin, so any adverse finding you discovered in your Tox program, would need to have occurred at drug levels that were 10 times higher than what you expect to reach in humans.  Additionally, those identified toxicities may have associated biomarkers that can be included on the clinical trials to ensure safety.  An easy example is that if liver damage is a known finding, a simple blood test for LFT markers are easily done and highly accurate.</p>
<p>So in essence, there isn’t a 1:1 correlation between animal models of toxicity and humans, but there is a rigorous science behind how we keep humans safe in pharmaceutical trials and ensuring large safety windows.  </p>
<p>Hope I didn’t miss the mark with this, i tried keeping to a basic response, but there are thousands of nuances in there.  Feel free for any follow up questions, I do work directly in Nonclinical safety, and would be happy to provide more detailed answers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, multiple species are used.
In addition, there are precautionary principles whereby you will (at the most) start from a small percentage of the LD1 for dose finding phase 1 human testing.</p>
<p>Obviously this is a complex topic and there are differences between compounds. You will always look at all the data available and take a holistic approach.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
