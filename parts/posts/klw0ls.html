		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm guessing you've stuck a flashlight under your palm or your finger so you could see the other side of your hand light up bright red. Oximeters work on a similar principle. Oximeters have a light on one side and a sensor on the other. When light strikes the molecules in your blood on its way through, it passes on energy and those molecules get excited. Molecules don't like that so they expel that excess energy. Here's the cool part, that energy gets expended as light but different materials (oxygen molecule or iron molecule) get rid of that light as different colors (sort of like how fireworks get different colors by burning different materials). If we know the color of the light going into the hand and the colors going out, we can use some handy formulas to figure out what percentage of your blood has oxygen bonded to its red blood cells.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm getting a few corrections in the comments. This is not a complete answer, it's the ELI5 to demonstrate a principle at work. Spectroscopy is awesome stuff as is optics in general. If you're interested, go study up and see all the cool stuff they're doing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They pass a light through your finger, and the color that makes it to the other side is dependent on the oxygen content of your blood. A little math to get a percentage, and presto, you've got some biometrics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually worked on this for my senior project in undergrad electrical engineering. In the device they put on your finger, there are two flashing LEDs. One is red and one is infrared. They flash in an alternating fashion very quick. So quickly, that you think the red light seems on constantly to the naked eye. On the other side of your finger is a sensor that detects the amount of light being transmitted through your finger. You only need 1 sensor to detect the two lights. Because the software controls when to turn on red or infrared at a known frequency, the hardware/software can determine when the sensor is seeing the response from the red led or the response from the infrared led and extract two readings. Based on the transmission ratio of the red and infrared light, it corresponds to how much blood oxygen you have. There’s a formula and a lookup table to figure out the level based on these two readings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay so you know how you can see through glass but not through tables? And how x-rays also see through body but not through bone? You can do the same thing with oxygen rich blood (oxygenated) and deoxygenated blood. They use two different colour lights and see how much of each type is absorbed then through the magic of maths calculate how much of your blood is oxygenated vs deoxygenated!</p>
<p>A rudimentary pulse oximeter can be built for like less than $ 20 If you <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=pulse+pximeter+kit&amp;rlz=1CDGOYI_enAU814AU831&amp;oq=pulse+pximeter+kit&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0i10l5.4961j0j4&amp;hl=en-GB" target="_blank">Google around</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
