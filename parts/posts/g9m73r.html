		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Optometrist here. The vessels dilate so more blood can flow through them, bringing in oxygen. Happens when our eyes are opened for too long or we are wearing contact lenses too much or just eyes dry. The eyes from far away appears to be pinkish/red due to these vessels being more visible than before.</p>
<p>I don't think this was really discussed at school at all actually but that's the train of thought!</p>
<p>Edit: Someone mentioned the use of visine, EXCELLENT POINT that i want to add (because i&quot;m constantly telling people): DON'T OVER USE VISINE. Tetrahydrozoline is the decongestant ingredient. Overuse causes REBOUND REDNESS, the opposite of what you want. Visine makes your blood vessels constrict, which sounds like a good idea since vasodilation is  the culprit. But keeping a constant blood vessel tone is a delicate balance between vaso constriction/dilation. The constant Visine use tricks your eyes into thinking that it already reached that balance of vaso constriction/dilation, so now when you take the visine away (which did the constriction), your eyes will vasoDILATE because there is nothing to oppose it, causing the rebound redness. It's great if you use it once in a while for allergies/occasional redness, but it's not for long term. Also don't use it if you have family history of glaucoma.</p>
<p>Go for something more natural. Like artificial tears. (no specific brand recommended because YMMV for most of them).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tired eyes tend to be bloodshot eyes. That's because a lack of sleep can decrease the amount of oxygen that reaches your eyes, which in turn causes blood vessels in them to dilate and appear red.Another factor that leads to redness comes into play as well. “If your eyes are kept open for a long time because of lack of sleep, it prevents the cornea (the surface of your eye) from being well lubricated, and this can cause dryness and redness,” says Dr. Lee. “The best way to calm them would be to get more sleep, and use artificial tears and cool compresses to ease the discomfort.”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Small blood vessels of your eyes become dilated with lack of sleep because they are dry. Period.</p>
<p>Lack of sleep does not cause a decrease in the amount of oxygen that reaches your eyes. If this was true, your body would increase your rate of breathing when you lack sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another data point (and please correct me if I'm wrong): eyes, the external part, get some oxygen directly from the air. If they're dry, maybe this doesn't work as well so it's supplemented by blood vessels. As for why when tired... Maybe you forget to blink as much and so your eyes get dry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
