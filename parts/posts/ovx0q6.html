<p>claims 10-15 outside air changes per hour.  Double that for interior filtered air.  Roughly 5 times that of an office building.</p>
<p>Mind you, an office building has a much lower occupation density.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Long story short, there are some published studies suggesting that you have relatively low risk of COVID transmission on shortish flights. To my knowledge, much of the data from published studies to date don't include the delta variant which has substantially increased transmission among vaccinated or unvaccinated individuals. Airlines are also packing flights now to make up for pandemic losses, but I'm not sure if that's been well controlled either. My takeaway, don't fly unvaccinated and wash/sanitize your hands frequently. I assume there will be more publications as more data are collected including vaccinations and the delta/other variants.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I understand correctly, studies point to air travel as not being high risk but that the opportunity to catch COVID becomes more likely at the airport itself, prior to boarding.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I researched this in depth several months ago, I discovered the following in the research literature:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Multiple cases of significant, multi-person transmission prior to about March 2020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since the implementation of travel restrictions, masking on planes, etc., there were next-to-no cases of transmission on planes</p>
</li>
<li>Risk is higher on longer flights (a 1-2 hour flight is safer), and significantly higher if people took masks off for any period of time. </li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, flying seemed incredibly safe so long as everybody is screened and wears masks, and short flights posed almost no risk if you were careful. Even more so if you were vaccinated. </p>
<p>Note that as this was a few months ago, I am not aware how the Delta variant or other changes might've affected the numbers since then. Additionally, risk always depends on prevalence (e.g. flying between two communities with high rates of COVID and anti-vaccine sentiment increases your risk, though I don't know by how much)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
