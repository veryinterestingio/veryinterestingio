		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's partially just easier to have the engines be below the wing from a construction and maintenance perspective.</p>
<p>In addition, with the engines below the wings, when the engines spool up that tends to pitch the nose of the plane <em>upwards</em>. Conversely, if you mount the engines above the wings, that'll tend to pitch the plane <em>downwards</em>. The upward pitch is more preferable so long as you don't stall the plane.</p>
<p>Edit: I should mention that the above comment on mounting the engines relates to when you mount the engines <strong>directly over or under the wings</strong>. There are aircraft with engines mounted above the wings in service, but they tend to have engines mounted as far back on the aircraft as possible (typically on the tail structure), which achieves the same kind of upward pitch because of how the engines interact with the planes center of lift and center of mass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll give two more reasons that I didn't see other commenters add:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For commercial airliners, passenger comfort is a big deal. Having the engines below the wing and away from the cabin mitigates the noise.</p>
</li>
<li>If the engine were to detach in flight then it's better for it to be able to fall away cleanly rather than potentially falling onto the wing or worse hitting the control surfaces at the rear.</li>

<p>I'm not an AeroEng but I'd think that you would not want to break the air flow over the top of the <del>where</del> wing where 80% of lift is generated.</p>

<p>The Honda Jet is unique but there can be an aerodynamic benefit to putting the pod above the wings. The Cirrus Jet mounts the engine in a weird location as well; </p>

<p>The big caveat to this is that these are small engines with (relatively) low fuel flow. It would be hard to fit a GE90 on top of the wing because of how cartoonishly huge the intake is. It would have to be up and out and the structure of the wing would have to be totally redesigned. Probably the most obvious reason is that maintenance is a lot easier with the turbine closer to the ground.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
