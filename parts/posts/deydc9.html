I've studied octopuses for more than 20 years and recently raised a day octopus in my living room for a documentary. The octopus was named Heidi, and she came to recognize me and my daughter and would play with toys and display other remarkable signs of intelligence. </p>
<p>I also caught her changing colors while sleeping, you may have seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vKCLJZbytU&amp;t=" target="_blank">this clip</a>.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as I understand with regard to animal intelligence, certain species of gorillas have been taught sign languages, and dogs can understand vocal commands such as &quot;sit&quot;, recognise their own name, or even know that pointing is indicating a direction.</p>
<p>How much communication is possible with an octopus? Can they learn what is meant by certain human body languages/expressions/sounds? Do they have the capacity to learn how to communicate certain things to us, and how would they go about this? For example, in the way a dog can be trained to communicate it wants to go out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know that octopuses live relatively short lives, but are highly intelligent. At what age do they develop an “adult” level of intelligence? Do they go through recognizable cognitive development stages analogous to human cognitive development? Do they keep getting “smarter” or do they plateau?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
