It doesn’t make any sense.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stress activates our fight or flight response, which causes our muscles to tense because tense muscles react more quickly, which means we can get away from any possible danger quicker. This was an evolutionary trait that allowed us to escape the dangers of the natural world better. In today's world, stress is less caused by things like an approaching predator and more caused by things like our jobs. Even though we don't need to jump out of the way of things, every day stress still makes our bodies tense because that's what they were trained to do over centuries of evolution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It might be easier to understand it like this.</p>
<p>Tension is a symptom and affect of stress.
Much like when we frown when sad or droop our shoulder and posture, Stress has phsyically identifiable characteristics.</p>
<p>The reason we hold tension unlike how stop frowning when no longer sad is that we often dont even notice we tensed in the first place or that we are still tense!
Eventually the tension becomes a habit that we never learned to undo. </p>
<p>This is why so many relaxation techniques involve checking different parts of your body for tension.
As you get better at noticing the signs of stress youl get better at undoing the tension to!</p>
<p>Also you might be stressed pretty often!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Woah…the bio exam I just took for Uni might actually pay off lol. </p>
<p>First, here is some background on stress: </p>
<p>Basically, in our bodies we produce hormones. There is a specific hormone called Cortisol which is responsible for LONG-term stress. The more you produce the more stressed you are. This is different from Epienephrine aka Adrenaline, which is your SHORT-term stress hormone, ie “fight or flight” (i noticed a lot of people were mentioning “fight or flight” but I wanted to explain the difference between the 2 hormones, because in your case I don’t think your body is in a “fight or flight” state). When epinephrine enters the bloodstream, it eventually wears off anywhere from minutes to a few hours, hence why it is short-term.</p>
<p>Obviously, when stressed (especially long-term stress) your body has to have a way to deal with it, which is where your subconscious jaw clenching and things of that nature may stem from. You can always consult a doctor to get your Cortisol levels checked or any other hormones you’re worried about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not an actual answer to your question, but if you notice you hold so much tension in your body, you might want to investigate where it comes from. Some triggers can be avoided, but even if they can't it is usually helpful to understand it better. I can't really avoid work stress but just acknowledging that work gives me stress and thats okat helps me to unwind when I am not working. </p>
<p>Also: moving is a better way to deal with stress than relaxing! It gives the fight/flight mode in your brain the idea that you already acted on the actual danger, helping to decrease the cortisol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You may have developed bruxism. I have it. What solved it for me was learning to sleep with a mouth guard. I just bought a cheap home kit from Amazon but I'm waiting for a dentist appointment to have one custom made. I only sleep with the upper guard, btw.</p>
<p>It has changed my life. That combined with making sure I drink at least 750ml of water every three hours has turned everything around. I no longer clench my jaws when I sleep and therefore don't wake up with a headache each morning. If I find myself clenching during the day I drink water. It's been such a stupidly simple way to improve my quality of life. Even my face looks younger and my jawline is shrinking because I don't have monster facial muscles from all that clenching anymore lol.</p>
<p>Oh and if you have a desk job, go ahead and splurge on a proper chair. It'll help you relax your shoulders if you can sit straight and still feel comfortable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
