		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former zookeeper here: I’ve only personally worked with lesser apes, but from my observations they either squat to use their urine to scent mark, or just pee from their perch. No hands involved. Ring tailed lemurs (not an ape, but a tangentially related fun fact) will pee on their tails, then flick the scent at each other. </p>
<p>The rest of the great apes have much much smaller penis to body size ratios than humans do. Gorillas are only about the size of your pinky. Also unlike humans, most apes have a penis bone, which means their flaccid penis is much less “floppy.” So humans have a much different penis anatomy than other apes, which could lead to the behavioral difference of holding it while you pee.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human male penis size relative to body size is VASTLY greater than other apes (and almost every other mammal). This is likely due to a number of reasons, although it’s important to understand that physical evolutionary traits are not being governed by some conscious force trying to get optimal results, so it could just be a random genetic mutational accident that we have since compensated for (as long as it doesn’t seriously inhibit reproduction then a trot won’t be selected against).</p>
<p>First, is that we have a very low degree of sexual dimorphism compared to other apes (and many mammals in general). A male gorilla with a penis the same proportions as their body compared to humans would potentially cause a lot of pain from ripping and tearing the relatively much smaller female gorillas, for example (especially considering they don’t generally give the female any time to “warm up” and get the natural lubricant flowing).</p>
<p>Second, female sexual pleasure is an important part of human mating, and encourages more frequent reproduction opportunities compared to animals that don’t have this trait. Other traits that contribute to this effect in humans are frequent menstrual cycles concealed estrus. Instead of a yearly period of “heat,” human females are available for insemination at regular, frequent intervals. It’s apparent in other species when the female is fertile, but human females do not exhibit engorged and discolored labia, nor do they exhibit strong pheromones during their period of receptivity to being impregnated. All of this contributes to increased mating opportunities. It also contributes to a confusion about paternal parentage, which seriously reduces the amount of babies killed by dominant males that only want females to spend their time and energy caring for their children (since any of the kids given birth to by a female they have mated with could be theirs), which would otherwise be common, and is still frequently seen when males from outside a group take over that group (they can safely kill all the kids because they definitely aren’t theirs). But that’s not relevant to the current discussion; I just wanted to point out how these things aren’t only related to the same root causes as increased penis size, and how they may not really be related to penis size at all. Some of these factors are also present in other primates, not just us.</p>
<p>Third is the phenomenon of a sperm arms race, due to the aforementioned incentive for frequent copulation of females with multiple males in the same general time period. When multiple males inseminate a female around the same time, the one that gets their sperm the furthest in has a better chance. Ejaculation velocity and sperm “swimming” speed are also important, but sperm can be relatively slow to get going through the first parts of the vagina, so those things being equal, a longer penis equals enhanced reproductive capabilities. Gorillas, for example, typically only have one male attempting copulation within their harem at any one time, so there is no need for sperm competition.</p>
<p>If you look outside apes to other primates, there are a bunch of monkeys that have similar penis ratios, likely for similar reasons, so we’re not exclusive with this particular trait. We do have very small testicles relative to our body weight, compared with other apes, but I haven’t studied the reasons for this as much so I’ll just leave it at that, except to say that chimpanzees probably have even more sperm competition than humans ever did, but they don’t have larger penises, and that’s probably because their testes are over 33% the size of their brains, while ours are a paltry 3%. This is because their solution to this sperm competition is to use their massive testicles to copulate with females many times a day, every day, whereas if humans attempt this, their sperm count drops drastically after only two ejaculations a day.</p>
<p>There are a variety of other factors to consider, such as our tendency towards monogamy and how it clashes with some of these other theories. We could have moved closer to monogamy relatively recently, but conflicting with that is the fact that Humans have remarkably smooth penises, which is generally found in monogamous species. Polygynous species usually have odd proportions such as huge heads that act as a plug, or bumps and ridges and extreme curvatures, etc. Human males also are quite a bit bigger than females, just not as much as some other species.</p>
