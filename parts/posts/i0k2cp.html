		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Last Thursday the <a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/department-energy-unveils-blueprint-quantum-internet-event-university-chicago" target="_blank">U.S. Department of Energy laid out the strategy</a> to build a national quantum internet. This #QuantumBlueprint is meant to accelerate the United States to the forefront of the global quantum race and usher in a new era of communications.</p>
<p>In February of this year, DOE National Laboratories, universities, and industry experts met to develop the blueprint strategy, laying out the essential research to be accomplished, describing the engineering and design barriers, and setting near-term goals.</p>
<p>DOE's 17 National Laboratories, including Argonne National Laboratory and Fermilab will serve as the backbone of the coming quantum internet, which will rely on the laws of quantum mechanics to control and transmit information more securely than ever before. The quantum internet could become a secure communications network and have a profound impact on areas critical to science, industry and national security.</p>
<p><a href="https://computational-rd.fnal.gov/wenji-wu/" target="_blank">Dr. Wenji Wu</a> (Fermilab Scientific Computing Division) and <a href="https://www.anl.gov/profile/gary-wolfowicz" target="_blank">Gary Wolfowicz</a> (Argonne National Lab's Center for Molecular Engineering) will be answering questions about Quantum Computing and the Quantum Internet Today at 2 PM CST (3 PM ET, 19 UT).

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are you using quantum computers for your quantum communications, or are you communicating between traditional computers using quantum states of particles? </p>
<p>If I understand correctly, it's physically impossible to intercept quantum communications without being detected? And are you using satellite or ground based communication? </p>
<p>Thanks for doing this AMA. I don't think many people are aware of the awesome things you can do with this sort of stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As outsiders, we can't really know exactly what kind of issues you will be facing; what interesting problems in quantum communications do you hope to tackle as you are launching this project? Do you foresee as  many engineering challenges, or more?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
