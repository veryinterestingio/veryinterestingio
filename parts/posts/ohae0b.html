I figure the more it swallows, the bigger it gets, the bigger it gets the more things are attracted to it, creating a universe sized cataclysmic tear in the fabric of space-time. Tell my why that doesn't happen.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Black holes aren't cosmic vacuum cleaners that just suck and suck and suck. Things orbit around them just like our moon orbits the Earth, and the Earth orbits the sun. The difference is a black hole is so big that once you get too close you can't escape its pull no matter how fast you go, you fall into it. Galaxies are really big and mostly everything in one is much too far away to just fall into the black hole. </p>
<p>In short, space is really big and mostly everything is really far away, even for things as big as black holes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Black holes aren't special in terms of how their gravity works, they use the same kind of gravity as our sun and earth does, with the same limitations.</p>
<p>So its the same reason why the Earth isn't particularly sucked into say the sun or why an asteroid can fly past the Earth and not hit it, stable orbits or misses with escape velocities are perfectly possible and actually more likely than being sucked into the black hole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Notice how none of the planets in our solar system have been sucked into the Sun. Same thing. things can orbit black holes without being sucked in just like things can orbit stars without being sucked in.</p>
<p>other stars (not counting binary pairs or other near neighbors) are also far enough away that they don't have the risk of being sucked in</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The common misconception is that black holes &quot;suck&quot; thing. That's not the case at all. Black holes are just a very small sphere of incredibly high density. Imagine if you compacted the Sun into the size of a city, but kept all of its mass. The gravity the Sun black hole would produce would be identical to the gravity of the normal Sun, so the planets would continue orbiting like nothing ever happened.  </p>
<p>Whenever things collide with black holes, they do increase in size. But only by as much matter as they &quot;consumed&quot;. Since most black holes are already millions or billions of times the mass of our Sun, a little extra matter falling into it barely makes it grow. Moreover, things tend not to &quot;fall&quot; or &quot;get sucked&quot; into black holes. They actually orbit the black hole, then their orbits decay veeeeery slowly. Think, for example, about satellites around the Earth. Because the Earth's atmosphere extends so far into space, some satellites experience a bit of air resistance/drag, which &quot;slows&quot; them down, making them get closer and closer until they burn up in the atmosphere. It's the same thing with black holes, except that the time it takes for things to slow down is much, much longer.  </p>
<p>TL;DR: black holes are actually just very dense remnants of stars, space is too big, and things take a long time to come together. By the time a black hole consumes something, it basically cleared its own neighborhood for millions of years. And with everything in space moving away from everything else due to the expansion of the universe, most black holes will just end up isolated from one another for uncountable eons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other things people have said, black holes also slowly lose mass to evaporation.  It takes a long time, but if they have already absorbed everything in their immediate area, the surrounding vacuum might contain less mass than the black hole loses to evaporation, so they can actually shrink over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
