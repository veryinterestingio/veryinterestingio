		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Escape velocity of the solar system at the earth's distance from the sun is sqrt(2GM/R) where M is the solar mass and R is 1 AU. This speed is about 42 km/s. Anything orbiting the sun (ie gravitationally bound to it) cannot be going faster at than this speed when it is at earth's distance from the sun. The orbital speed of the earth is sqrt(2) lower, about 30 km/s. The greatest collision velocity would be a head-on collision, the sum of these two speeds (72 km/s).</p>
<p>Of course, you did guess that something traveling greater than escape velocity could go arbitrarily fast, which would be true of an object that fell into the solar system or was scattered to high speed through multi-body interactions with planets, but this would be rare and would have only one chance to strike the earth, compared to asteroids on earth-crossing orbits which get many many chances.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doesn’t it depend on the orbit?  Comets, for example, with narrow elliptical orbits, can achieve speeds of nearly 500km/second when rounding the sun. Surely they are still moving at a fast clip when passing earth’s orbit?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The more it speeds up, the closer to the sun it has to be to stay in orbit. The further, the slower. Ignore this inverse relationship, and it either escapes its orbit, or simply falls into the sun. </p>
<p>To answer your question in particular: although in theory the apogee of an orbit can be endlessly high, the perigee can only be so high as the surface of the object around which it orbits. In other words: orbit too low and you'll hit a mountain or scrape the ground.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of very accurate answers here that rely on calculation and geometry, which are great, but they don't always give you the perspective to see the question in such a way that the answer is suddenly obvious, which I think is very useful.</p>
<p>You may have seen illustrations of gravity using as rubber sheet with heavy weights stretching the fabric and pulling it down. This is near enough to what gravity is for the purposes of your question.</p>
<p>If you have a baseball sitting on that sheet, and you place a ball bearing near it, the ball bearing will &quot;fall&quot; toward the baseball. Now, put the ball bearing near the beginning of where it seems to start stretching and give it a slight push to the side. It starts orbiting the baseball, right? Ignore the fact that it's slowing down, gravity doesn't have friction.</p>
<p>Now, if you were to push it REALLY hard, it would go into that dip and leave around the other side.</p>
<p>But there's something interesting you may not have realized, the amount that the ball goes up and down. If it's going too fast, it'll get back up to the level of the rubber sheet, and if it's going too slow, it'll never reach that. 72km/s is fast enough that no matter where you put something in the solar system and what direction you give it, as long as it's going fast enough, it has to leave the solar system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
