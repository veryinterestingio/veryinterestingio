		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Window glass is the coldest part of a wall. When warm room air hits it, the air cools, and cool air sinks. The movement of cool air creates floor drafts that most people find uncomfortable. The placement of forced-air heat registers or baseboard heating units under the windows counteracts this process by sending up warm air to mix with the cool. The end result is that the room feels more comfortable.</p>
<p>At one time, builders didn't understand this process. That's the reason that one of the stereotypical descriptions of old houses is that they're &quot;drafty&quot;.</p>
<p>EDIT: I'm not in construction. I copied this from the This Old House website.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People here also forgot to mention that the outside wall is where a majority of your temperature change in the room comes from, especially if it has a window.  That means that there is a temp difference from what it is outside vs inside is greatest near your window and gradually changes to meet your thermostat temp as you move inward (the rooms temperature gradient).  By dropping your conditioned air (either warm or cold) near the window, you are putting the biggest effect from that air where it is needed the most.  Then it mixes with the room air, and the air that is making it back to your thermostat is a mix of what is in the room.  The further you move the vent away from the outside wall that is causing the temp difference, the more persistent that difference will be because you are mixing conditioned air with air in the room that is not at one end or the other of your temperature gradient.  When your ac unit kicks off because the thermostat says the room is at the correct temp, you will still have a spot near the window that is either too hot or too cold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In cold climate areas like mine, the vents near the windows not only circulate the air better but they also prevent windows from frosting up when it gets really cold. Constant air hitting them keeps the moisture from building on them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to what's been said already, the primary goal isn't &quot;efficiency,&quot; but rather &quot;efficacy.&quot; Yes, use less energy if you can, but the primary objective to provide consistent, comfortable temperatures. For reasons explained by other comments, placing the vents near the problems areas (windows, doors, etc) is more <em>effective.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you place it by the drafty door or window, you ensure that the hot/cold air is getting circulated through the room. If the vent was in a corner, the hot/cold air would build up there and create a localized hot/cold spot. And I'm the meantime, your HVAC will be running continuously until the treated air finally reached the thermostat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
