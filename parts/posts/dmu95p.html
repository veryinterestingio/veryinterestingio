		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what others have said, globalization means that you are not just competing for real estate or rentals against locals if you are somewhere thats attractive job, economy or lifestyle wise. You are competing with highly educated, affluent people from all over the world who want to live, or invest in property where you live. Thats a big reason for the price increases in places like Vancouver, San Francisco, Sydney, London and so on.</p>
<p>Restrictions on owning property as a foreigner have been loosened since the 70s, and people &amp; capital have become a lot more mobile.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ten people had a field and produced 15 apples. Everyone got one, the best worker got 2 more and the guy who had the idea of planting apples got three more: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,4.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Then, they learned how to produce 25 apples in the same field, but changed their economic system and the new distribution is:<br />
½, ½, ½, ½, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 16  </p>
<p>Yes, as a society we perform better, and 6/10 people are equal or better than before. But to generate two rich guys and a megabillionaire we decided to destroy the lives of the other 4/10.  </p>
<p>And in a democratic election, 6/10 people still agree with the new system. 3 because they are richer, 3 because they hope to be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason is that the Boomers are at peak wealth right now. They're all just at the cusp of retirement, which means that the vast bulk of them will never have more money. But you're really asking the wrong question: The important question is this: Why is the price of housing so stubbornly high? After all, it's a market with highly inelastic demand, so you'd think that it would be easy for businesses to take advantage of that predictable demand and build their way to profits.</p>
<p>The answer, put bluntly, is <strong>ZONING</strong>. Land use law is incredibly arcane and complicated, and with most of the employment centers being crammed into densely populated urban areas, the normally fraught problems of getting permission to build housing, especially the high-density housing which the market needs, has become completely insane.</p>
<p>If you really want to help your community provide more <em>market rate</em> housing (ie: something everyone can use, not just a handful of indigent people), you need to pay attention to your local elections, and support candidates who want to make it easier to build. Barring that, save your money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After WWII there was one industrial country whose economy and/or infrastructure wasn't in ruins, America. Additionally the needs of the war meant we were left with excess industrial capacity. As a result everything was cheap and America was exporting like mad. Additionally government made a conciousness effort to continue military spending instead of fully normalizing back to a peace time economy. They did this because they feared a return to pre war economic conditions if the military  was returned to it's normal state. America is also really big, which meant land was cheap, now the areas around cities has been developed and land costs more.</p>
<p>As the rest of the world recovered and/or industrialized demand for American exports dropped. The American economy post war was a house of cards, now it is finally falling. The quality of life expected by Americans was never sustainable and as quality of life increases around the world America is regressing toward the mean.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have an unpopular, borderline crazy-person theory that I can’t shake. </p>
<p>I often wonder how it is that (Australia) had 25 years of uninterrupted growth, and something like 65 out of the last 70 years of overall economic growth... but i’m paying more for my degree now than anyone in living memory, and this degree will open fewer doors than ever before. How could this be? Surely with so much growth we could afford a bit more student support and mobility. </p>
<p>and then... it hit me. Like a diamond bullet. </p>
<p>We have had so much growth precisely because we <em>don’t</em> support students or the working class. If you want an education (or rather, if you want to pay off your education in a job that challenges you) you have to be ready to fight, fight, fight constantly. </p>
<p>If people have been proven to be prepared to committ to a two income, 20 year debt to pay off a house, well, why would you expect it to just be given to them? </p>
<p>If people are prepared to put themselves into debt for the chance - just the <em>chance</em> - to join the middle class, why would you make it for free? If they indeed make it to the middle class, they will need to learn to kick down. </p>
<p>Aaaanyway. Edit: i’m full of anti-boomer bile, but its all complicated. Plenty of boomers weren’t nimble enough to get on the train, too, and it must be scary af to be a 60 year old single woman with no assets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
