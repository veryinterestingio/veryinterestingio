		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also taking from my ass, but forest fires generally have a very identifiable start point as the fire started there and went down wind.  It’s not hard to go up wind and find the start and look for a lighting strike, campfire, gender reveal party or meth den. </p>
<p>House fires are different. I still don’t have direct knowledge of this, but I have been told that fires that originate in the house usually have some evidence of where it burned the hottest because at the start there is more oxygen in the house.  This is a good clue to start.  </p>
<p>Also, metal doesn’t really melt in temperatures associated with a house fire, so a broken gas line etc will still look like a broken gas line.  A candle might be more subtle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact;</p>
<p>An ex girlfriend of mine worked in insurance, she told me the best way to set your house on fire without the fire department figuring out what the source is, is by setting a cat on fire and letting it loose in your house.</p>
<p>I always kept an eye on my cat when she was at my place. Hmm. Maybe not really a fun fact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the situation... In forests/wilderness fire tends to spread down the wind so you can generally find out where it started, and then you search for any leftover evidence that hasn't completely burnt out, like residue from an accelerant, metal pieces of a lighter etc. While fire does destroy a lot of evidence, there are often tiny bits that survive the fire, especially considering remains of different materials look differently, like plastic/metal which can mostly be easily recognized. So, simply said, figure out the way fire spread, go to the assumed starting point and look for any leftover traces of accelerants/starters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most fires are started by lightning. There are sensors all over which detect and record lightning strikes, so if a fire starts at the point where there was a lightning strike there's a good chance that it was caused by lightning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
