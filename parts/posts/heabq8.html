		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Referred itch is the phenomenon in which a stimulus applied in one region of the body is felt as an itch or irritation in a different part of the body.  It happens simply due to our nerves branching out. The
branches of a nerve may travel out in a much different path than the others and wind up in some far-flung part of the body. Again, the nervous system gets a little confused and a sensation at one end of a branch might feel like it's coming from another</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://youtu.be/LqiMis5leSY" target="_blank">I made a quick video to answer your question!</a></p>
<p>In case videos aren't your thing, I'll answer here too.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is called mitempfindung. Or 'Referred Itch'</li>
<li>Research on this started around the 1700s and isn't that extensive. It's thought that 1 in 4 people experience this.</li>
<li>Some of our nerves have paths that lead to various parts of body, and they can lead to far flung parts of our body. So when scratched it's possible they get 'confused' and send out a sensation to the wrong area.</li>
<li>Our parts of the brain that deal with sense and touch, overlap and process information in different parts of our body. So if you're scratching your arm, that part of the brain might get excited and cause sensation in the leg part of your brain.</li>
<li>It's thought that it's not able to be reversed, so if you scratch your arm and feel it in your leg. You won't be able to scratch your leg and feel it where you scratched originally!</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope that helped mate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Slightly unrelated but there was a case of a man who had lost his hand, but felt an urge to scratch the hand he DIDNT have, a phantom sensation.</p>
<p>So after what I imagine must have been an unbearable time, he met a person researching brain plasticity. Based on previous research, the doctor asked the person to try scratching or rubbing around different parts of his face, and he found the sweet spot which finally gave him relief.</p>
<p>The explanation is sort of like the part of his brain responsible for stimulus of touch in the lost hand had neurons mixing with the other closest part of the brain - the neurons of sensation in the face. So scratching his face helped him relieve his itch in the lost hand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Btw, the reason heart attacks are associated with left arm pain is because the nerve that signals left arm pain and the nerve that signals heart pain travel closely together, I think they enter the spinal cord at the same vertebrae or something. The reason your brain interprets heart pain as arm pain, and not the other way around, is because your brain is very much used to pain signals from your arms, and not pain signals from your heart.</p>
<p>Eli10:</p>
<p>Pain doesn't happen in your body - pain happens in your brain. When high-frequency signals travel from a body part to the spinal cord to the brain, the 'signals reception center' sends a message to your 'consciousness' saying 'there is an injury at the left toe!' and the way it says that is by 'projecting' pain into your consciousness. That's evolutionary and helps you alleviate the pain and stay safe. So when the heart/arm nerves send high-frequency signals to the brain, the brain tells your consciousness 'there's an injury at the left arm!' because for however long you've been alive, signals coming from that direction have always been about the arm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

I figured it had to with my nerves. I asked another guy if he felt that too and he laughed at me, so at least Iâ€™m not weird in that regard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
