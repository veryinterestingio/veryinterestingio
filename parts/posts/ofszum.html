		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't actually know how many people watched it. With broadcast TV you can't know who is actually receiving the broadcast and whose TV is turned on at that channel.</p>
<p>What they did was simply survey. Ask a large group of people whether they watched the moon landing on TV and extrapolate from there to the entire population. That's basically how TV ratings were measured.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Back then, there were services that would do statistical studies. Nielson which might have heard of was one. We would occasionally get a log book and were asked to track what we watched. At the end of the period, the books were mailed back. </p>
<p>There were some that had electrical devices that you pushed a button on to indicate if you were watching abc, cbs, or nbc. There were only a few Channels back then. </p>
<p>I can’t confirm this, but it would be possible for companies to take polls, much like politicians do today and ask questions like “Did you watch? How many people?l and then with a small sample size of 1000 or so, you can extrapolate a total. </p>
<p>The other measuring services used similar statistical models to guess the number of viewers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
