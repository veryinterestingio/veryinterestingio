		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My name is <a href="https://twitter.com/Michalea_King" target="_blank">Michalea King</a> and I recently completed my PhD in Earth Sciences at the Ohio State University. I am a glaciologist and most of my research focuses on how and why large outlet glaciers in Greenland are changing.</p>
<p>Also answering questions today is <a href="https://twitter.com/CassLGarrison" target="_blank">Cassandra Garrison</a>, a reporter at <a href="https://twitter.com/Reuters" target="_blank">Reuters</a> who <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/climate-change-arctic-idAFL1N2FG1I3" target="_blank">wrote about one of my latest studies</a>. The new study suggests the territory's ice sheet will now gain mass only once every 100 years -- a grim indicator of how difficult it is to re-grow glaciers once they hemorrhage ice. In studying satellite images of the glaciers, our team noted that the glaciers had a 50% chance of regaining mass before 2000, with the odds declining since.</p>
<p>We'll be logging on at noon ET (16 UT), ask us anything!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve read about how glaciologists have found that undercut seawater is leading to much faster calving and glacier melt. How much have these processes sped up loss mechanisms in glacier fronts?</p>
<p>Your paper in Nature discusses how most glacial loss happens due to the retreat of glacier fronts. Is there anything we can do to mitigate this loss? Either technology or process wise. </p>
<p>Lastly, I’ve heard some climate folks worry about the effects of melting glaciers, specifically those in Greenland, affecting ocean currents. Do you think it is feasible for a melting event to destabilize  thermohaline circulation? What would the effects look like on the globe? </p>
<p>Thanks for doing this AMA and for all the work you’re doing with our glaciers!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
