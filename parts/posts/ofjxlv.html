		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Itâ€™s aged in specially controlled rooms to maintain an optimal temperature and humidity level, but the exterior still does rot. However the way the interior meat breaks down makes it tender and flavorful. The rotted exterior gets trimmed off, and that loss of meat plus the evaporation of moisture from the meat help explain why the cost per pound for aged meat is so much more than un-aged meat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Beef that comes immediately from a farm and processed would be like chewing leather.  Therefore, slaughterhouses and butchers who butcher sides of beef (supermarkets get box beef that is cut into primals) hang the sides in a controlled environment like a cooler for a period.</p>
<p>The standard period is about two weeks.  During this time the pellicle forms and does protect the meat while the proteins break down.</p>
<p>Basically and frankly, aging means letting the meat rot in a controlled way.</p>
<p>If you go to the supermarket and see meats that are marked down because it looks greenish-gray, that is the aging process at work.  That meat is actually better tasting and more tender because of the concentrated flavor.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dry aging steak is a way to increase the beef flavor in the cut while adding complexity to the flavor. </p>
<p>A dry aged steak is placed on rack in a controlled environment. Both humidity and temperature are kept at a specific level to keep the steak from spoiling.</p>
<p>Over time, the outside of the steak or round begins to dry out. The moisture of the steak is being pulled out so the outside becomes a rather gross looking dark crust. However, through pulling moisture out, the beef flavor on the inside grows stronger.</p>
<p>The final step is to trim away the dried out crust. You end up losing a lot of mass in the process, so for that reason its recommended you buy an entire round of steaks, pre-cut. Once you trim away the exterior you should be left with a dark but healthy looking steak.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, beef flavor is increased in this process. You also add additional flavors to the meat through aging as well. Shorter age times result in a nutty flavor, while longer ages can take on cheese-like tones.</p>
<p>If you want to try dry aged steak without paying restaurant prices, you can buy a dry age steak bag on Amazon. The bag helps regulate humidity to prevent rotting. I'd recommend trying a 10 to 15 day age. Shorter ages can be more palatable as an intro to dry aging.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As long as the meat is properly preserved, typically with some kind of salt rub, and kept in a controlled environment, it won't &quot;go bad.&quot; It does start to break down but that just adds to the flavour and tenderizes the meat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
