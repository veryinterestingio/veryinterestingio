		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're on the right track, but as always, it's more complicated than that.</p>
<p>For starters, COVID may not have necessarily started from a patient X, it could have been a group of people.  Not sure if we know that for certain, but that's besides the point.  You're right in thinking that as long as someone has it, they can still transmit it to other people, but then we get into ideas like herd immunity and how COVID-19 exists in the environment.</p>
<p>For starters, herd immunity is the idea that so many people have had an immune response to a specific virus that if it were to become prevalent again in a specific community, it would not lead to an epidemic, because only a few people would likely show symptoms when contracting it, if any.  As others here have said, we are no where near that yet, that would likely take a few years to reach, especially here in the US.  Even so, this does not mean it can't infect people, there are always those who cannot receive vaccines due to a weakened immune system, hence the idea of herd immunity and actually being smart enough to get your vaccines to protect those who can't.</p>
<p>Secondly, we aren't sure how long our antibodies will last for this strain of COVID, much less if COVID has, or could, mutate enough to where the antibodies wouldn't be effective in fighting it off.  Certain diseases, like tetanus, we receive a vaccine for over certain intervals of time, this is could be due to a number of factors, one of which is that some antibodies are not forever, they vary on their length of effectiveness, or memory, within the body.  Another possible factor for other diseases is that the disease is so potent that we are only able to use dead forms of the microbe (or various other methods of making vaccines) in the vaccine which doesn't elicit as strong as an immune response as a weakened form would cause.  The strongest response your body will have in fighting off a disease in the future is to actually become infected, and sick.  This is obviously not what we want, but a similar magnitude of response often occurs because of many vaccines.  As mentioned above, mutations could also become an issue.  The reason why there is a new flu vaccine every year is because it mutates so rapidly.  In fact, the vaccine you get is an &quot;estimate&quot; of what scientists believe the flu may look like that year, so it could be entirely ineffective, or pretty spot-on.  Even so, sometimes the antibodies we have work against infectious organisms that aren't exactly what they were made for, but still work to some degree.  Effectiveness of this topic is somewhat controversial.</p>
<p>Finally, sometimes it's not possible to eradicate something entirely, because it still exists in the environment.  COVID-19 supposedly started in bats, then mutated to be able to infect humans, that means that even though we could potentially reach a point where humans aren't being effected by it, it could still cause problems in other animals.  There are serious consequences that could result from this as well, not even considering the fact that transmitting from 1 species to another indicates that it does have the ability to mutate into a new strain, and COVID-21 or something could eventually become a result of that.</p>
<p>TL;DR - Yes</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Possibly, but the difference between the hypothetical that you're suggesting and how this started is knowledge of it happening. When the first person became infectious, no one had any idea, it spread, those people spread it, and no one even knew there was a disease going around until symptoms started appearing possibly up to two weeks later, and even then it wasn't clear it was anything more than a cold until people started needing hospitalization.</p>
<p>Now, we know that this is going on, if we managed to contain and treat and contact trace people until we got to a point where only one person was left who had it, things would be different. Just to get to that point our behavior would have had to change to limit the spread, and while we may have relaxed from that at that point, enough would probably still be in place for this person to avoid spreading it. In fact, contact tracing would likely be necessary to get to this point, so even before a positive test result was received, they likely would know this person had likely caught it, and with the number of people infected being very low at this hypothetical point, we'd have the resources available to quarantine them until they were deemed no longer infectious.</p>
<p>So basically, now that we have a better idea of what we're dealing with and how seriously we need to take it, if we get our numbers low enough we can focus on isolating the few people who still have it until they've fought it off. The reason we can't do that right now is because the number of infected and possibly infected people is so high that it would be impossible to complete isolate them all, especially since many will require treatment to survive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how long immunity lasts. Under the assumption that a previously infected person is always immune, eventually it will go away, or mutate to allow people to be reinfected. </p>
<p>Even with this assumption, it's technically possible for it to remain in the population by infecting young people who have not yet gotten the immunity, and then cause another pandemic when the percentage of susceptible people is high enough. (Nobody born after this pandemic will have the same natural immunity). </p>
<p>Allowing enough people to get infected for herd immunity to have enough impact would mean millions more deaths and long term health complications, which will over time be much more expensive than temporarily closing some businesses. </p>
<p>If the immunity is not permanent, there's no guarantee that it would ever go away naturally, and it could remain endemic throughout the population for a long time, frequently spiking and starting other epidemics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Please take into consideration how long the virus is shedding and contagious and how many hosts the carrier is exposed to on a given day.</p>
<p>Pre pandemic I wouldn't think twice about going to a concert or stadium. I wouldn't have worn a mask. I might have made 1000s of connections a day linking the diseased individual to healthy hosts.</p>
<p>A virus can only multiply if it can infect new hosts faster than the hosts can fight them off. Covid is a very infectious virus that stays contagious got a long time. But it's still possible to get the rate of infection below 1. </p>
<p>New Zealand has no cases. If they test or quarantine at their border forever they can keep that going. But if the countries that they deal with regularly also show progress they can likely open borders without large repercussions. And hopefully we can all become like that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
