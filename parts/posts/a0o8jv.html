		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there are galaxies from which we will never receive any light at all. (Any galaxy beyond a current distance of about 65 Gly.) There are also galaxies whose light we have already received in the past but which are currently too far away for any signal emitted from us <em>now</em> to reach them some time in the future. (Any galaxy beyond a current distance of about 15 Gly.) The farthest points from which we have received any light at all as of today are at the edge of the observable universe, currently at a distance of about 43 Gly.</p>

<p>Yes, there are things beyond our view that are no longer &quot;in causal contact&quot; with your part of the universe. This basically means that nothing that happens in the parts of the universe outside our little bubble of observable things impacts us at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
