		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes there are surviving costumes or props or even sets that you can refer to to see what the original color was. Sometimes there are some color photos from the set, even though the film ended up in B&amp;W. And sometimes it's an educated guess based partly on how dark or light an area appears in the B&amp;W film, partly on what colors were fashionable at the time, etc.  </p>
<p>And sometimes they really just have to guess. And for things like skin tones, or settings, it's easy to figure out. Like if part of the film happens in a desert, you can pretty much guess what color the sand dunes would have been, or if it's a scene filled with working-class people walking home from work (as an example) we know that the average worker wouldn't be wearing fancy clothes to go work in a shipyard or a butcher shop, so we'd assume that their clothes are very basic colors.  </p>
<p>There are also loads of historical documents we can refer to, which can take a lot of time, but you can find really great info about clothing, building materials, popular paint colors, all kinds of good stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the most difficult things about this process with B&amp;W movies is that set and costume colors were not always chosen based on realistic colors. That is, they were chosen based on how they looked on the B&amp;W film of the time. So, something that they wanted to look a certain way on film might be bright pink, even though that item might not be pink in real life. This forces a lot of artistic choices during the restoration/remaster.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely related to the original question, but kind of a cool story so I'll put it here anyway.</p>
<p>There was a popular sitcom in England called <em>Are You Being Served</em> which ran through the '70s and into the early '80s.  Color TV was well established by that time so the series was entirely in color, with one exception.  The pilot episode had been recorded on color tape but when time came to archive it they transfered it to black and white film. This was done by pointing a film camera at a monitor and letting the color episode play while the black and white camera filmed it.</p>
<p>For a long time only this black and white version of the pilot was available, until someone got an idea.  The film took an image of the color monitor, including which phosphors were illuminated and when.  By mapping the correct phosphors to red, green, and blue they were able to restore the episode's original color!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjK-b4x9ZmQ" target="_blank">Here</a> is a brief video outlining the process, it probably explains it better than I can.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
