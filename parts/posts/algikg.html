		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The title says the most of it. I'm in the Midwest right on the Mississippi and to say that its cold out is something of an understatement. I went for a quick walk by the river to see what all the hype was about (I'm from the West coast originally and I've never been in temps anywhere near this cold).</p>
<p>I was outside for all of twenty minutes as tightly and hotly bundled as a human can be and my eyelashes froze and I thought I'd freeze solid if I had to stay outside for an hour. I could hardly see where I was going while I was walking into the wind I had to keep blinking and wiping the ice away.</p>
<p>All the while I saw dozen of birds out flying around, in the few patches of river that hadn't frozen yet and flying in the air above. It was -20 give or take when I went out, and that's peanuts compared to what it was overnight, but these birds clearly survived that. How do they manage it? </p>
<p>I guess for clarification, I'm talking about gulls, bald eagles and birds I am fairly certain were ducks. </p>
<p>Edit: Front page of r/AskScience? Alright! Thanks everybody for the responses, I can tell I'm not the only one curious about this. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some birds have a form of regulated hypothermia/torpor, where they can drop their body temps significantly to adapt to the cold (albeit by slowing their reaction times and movement), or can raise them short term to put off much more heat</p>
<p>Fluffed feathers can very effectively trap heat, hence we use down for warm blankets and jackets</p>
<p>Small things, like moving to sunny areas to absorb heat help. Birds may also flock very tightly on the ground to pool body heat</p>
<p>Edit: adjective to adverb. Whoops</p>
<p>Edit 2: As noted by many people below, extreme weather can also decimate bird populations; I was simply posting methods the survivors may use. Thanks for the clarification, everyone, I should've mentioned that to begin with</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also of note; many don't survive. State wildlife agencies work hard to track populations in order to allocate the correct number of licenses (or set the correct per-species limit). After particularly harsh winters it is often the case that licenses/limits are strongly curtailed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don’t see this being brought up much but <a href="https://www.audubon.org/news/how-do-feathers-keep-birds-warm" target="_blank">this</a> is why. Down feathers work so well that they do most of the work of keeping the bird warm. The other body functions like restricting blood to the extremities help but without down feathers it wouldn’t matter.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For waterfowl, at night they will roost in thick vegetation that will act as a heat insulator and thermal cover, preferably in locations that are surrounded by a treeline to act as a windbreak. This is one of the strategies employed for improving selection and survival of waterfowl in managed wetlands on state and federal property.</p>
<p>Additionally, birds will congregate to conserve heat and energy. Like mammals, they will also fatten up prior to winter and can on some occasions enter a state of torpor, which is like a shorter type of hibernation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
