		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although not necessarily the <em>physically</em> smallest organism, there are some species that have been demonstrated to have the capacity for learning and conditioning with fairly basic nervous systems.  The sea slug <a href="https://stevenefbrown.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/hah-toro.jpg" target="_blank"><em>Aplysia californica</em></a> has been used as a model system for behavioural study for a few decades, and it only has on the order of 10,000 neurons, which is less than 1/10 as many as a fruit fly (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK28212/" target="_blank">Source</a>).  Though not related to your question directly, there's been some really cool research coming out of this system, like showing that it's possible to effectively &quot;transfer&quot; some learned behviours from one individual to another (<a href="http://www.eneuro.org/content/5/3/ENEURO.0038-18.2018" target="_blank">Source</a>).</p>
<p>However, to more directly address your question, there are even some unicellular (well, technically unicellular, though they have many nuclei) organisms that potentially show evidence of learning, like slime molds (<a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2016.0446" target="_blank">Source</a>).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ah man I love this topic.  Ants are one of the few species that have documented <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/teacher-ants-show-student/" target="_blank">teaching behavior</a>.  For reference--teaching is pretty high on the cognition scale, and has specific criteria that differentiate it from run-of-the-mill learning, so that's a pretty big deal.</p>
<p>Just about every animal learns, as do many <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep38427" target="_blank">plants</a> and fungi.  Looks like we've even found a <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160427081533.htm" target="_blank">single-cell protist</a> that exhibits learning behavior.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a very broad question with a lot of different possible answers. Defining what &quot;learning&quot; is and then basing it off size is kind of tough. Would fungus be small or large? Does repeated behaviour count as learning? Intelligence is even harder, as it's  entirely subjective. It's very difficult to give one &quot;right&quot; answer to your question.</p>
<p>What I can say is that one very small organism that has shown adaptive behaviour (which is technically learning, I suppose) is C. elegans, a species of free-living nematode. They're less than a millimeter long, but they're model organisms for genetic and behavioural studies due to a variety of reasons. As an example, they have shown olfactory adaptation, wherein a group of worms was exposed to to a chemical odorant found in bacteria (their food) while bacteria wasn't present. After prolonged exposure, the worms were found to be less sensitive to the odorant even in the presence of food, meaning they had &quot;learned&quot; that the odorant didn't mean food. If you'd like to learn more about them, you should look at Dr. Brenner's papers (with which he won a Nobel Prize) or Dr. Bargmann's work. They're very interesting organisms, and they're used quite often in genetics as model organisms. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>But if a microbe modifies it's behaviour based on past sensory input, doesn't that count as learning? For example, following chemical gradients to find food implies extrapolation from past experiences to future ones. So the microbe has a generative model with prior beliefs for how the world works, and it updates the model based on what it finds, with the priors combined with data to get posterior beliefs. I would personally define this as learning. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unicellular organisms are actually capable of learning by horizontal gene transfer.</p>
<p>They will still &quot;simply react as they were programmed to by their DNA&quot;, but are able to adapt this DNA.</p>
<p>Scientists believe this plays a big role in resistance against antibiotics.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>From computer science perspective there is no reason why even smaller things could not learn.</p>
<p>For learning a complicated neural network is not needed.</p>
<p>All needed is a Turing machine</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing\_machine" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing\_machine</a></a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>DNA / RNA / Proteins could act as this Turing machine.</p>
<p>Anyway it all depends how you define learning.</p>
<p>Big neural networks will be more efficient learners in most domains then small simple systems.</p>
