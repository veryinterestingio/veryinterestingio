		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends. Most primates show their teeth clenched as a submissive gesture, a sign that they mean no harm.</p>
<p>Furthermore when we smile we also squint our eyes, which is often a mammalian way of showing non-aggression.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans have developed our own body language, independent of other species since co-operation and communication is far more essential for us to survive than other species. We have no claws, no real fangs or fur to protect ourselves, so we need the ability to communicate more with our own kind to survive.<br />
Even with humans, you can tell a difference between an &quot;enjoyment smile&quot;, a &quot;cringe smile&quot; and a &quot;I'm about to kill you smile&quot;. So even within smiling there's a hidden body language that most of us understand without stating its existence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short version is that smiling is not the same as bearing your teeth. Bearing your teeth in the classical senses includes growling most of the time but is a clear threat display that includes the teeth, sure but also includes the rest of the face and body.</p>
<p>Smiling likewise is a full face and body transaction and it may come or may not, include making the teeth visible.</p>
<p>And in southern cultures people smile with their jaws open. To Americans it looks really weird and creepy.</p>
<p>So you're only looking at part of the signal when you just look at whether or not teeth can be seen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It probably helps that human teeth aren't a very effective weapon. I mean, yes, you can bite someone's ear off if you're really determined, but human threat displays mostly involve presenting hands, not teeth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
