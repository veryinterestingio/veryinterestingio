<p>So what you call 'chemical properties' I'm going to call 'material properties' since technically these aren't atoms, so there's no chemistry! Still, lots of your intuition from chemistry may hold. For example, what is the electrical conductivity of nuclear pasta? It depends on how electrons (and to an extent, the protons) can move through it! If the pasta has very regular shapes with very long range order then that makes for good conductivity, but disorder like twists and bends and 'defects' can scatter electrons and cause electric currents to dissipate energy to heat. It's a very good analogy with defects in a crystal, like where crystal planes are misaligned or an atom is out of place. </p>
<p>Anyway, my most important point is that the physical/material properties ultimately depends on the microphysics, which can be influenced by the pasta geometry. </p>
<p>Similar arguments can be made for lots of different properties - like thermal conductivity. How readily can particles bump into other particles to transfer that heat? Or neutrino opacity - can neutrinos pass through easily like light through glass, or does the regular spacing between the pasta line up in just right way to scatter the neutrinos similar to light in a slit experiment? And the elastic properties - the energy of attraction/repulsion between protons and neutrons is partially determined by their separation, so resistance from squishing and squeezing depends on the density of the matter and also the spacing and shape of the pasta phase.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
