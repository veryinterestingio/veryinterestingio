		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that we don't exactly know yet, but we know a lot more than we used to.</p>
<p>The longer answer is that what we do know is that memories aren't stored in just in the hippocampus, a small section of the brain which we used to think was the memory center. The hippocampus still plays a role, but it isn't as singular as we thought.</p>
<p>More recent studies have shown we use multiple parts of our brains for the storage and compositions of memories. Brain scans have shown that multiple parts of the brain activate for memory recall, and the activated areas change depending on the nature of the memory. For instance, if you remember learning to work on cars with a parent, you might see activity in areas of the brain associated with knowledge about tools, emotional centers for thoughts of your parent, and your olfactory centers for thinking about the smells of the car fluids. This composite recall happens for 2 important reasons:</p>
<p>1) This has to do with how the brain processes information. As we learn things, and simply by thinking about things, our brains build and reinforce neural paths to connect parts of the brain associated with those thoughts, basically making as short a path as possible between sections of the brain. This allows the brain to use less energy to think about or do a particular thing. Very few sets of information is stored in any single part of the brain, which leads to reason 2.</p>
<p>2) By storing information throughout the brain, rather than in singular, organized locations, it allows the brain to maintain some functionality in the event of a brain injury. Imagine if all of our memories were stored in the hippocampus, as previously thought, and you got a concussion that damages it. Now, all of your memories are potentially gone. How could you still process anything other than basic, instinctual behaviors from infancy? But with how our brains evolved, we can still maintain significant amounts of neural ability even if we suffer an injury.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depending on the type of memory, it can be stored in the hippocampus, amygdala, dentate gyrus, entorhinal cortex, (the temporal and medial-temporal regions) or other neocortical areas.</p>
<p>We know that each brain region plays a different role in processing information, and also storing it. For example, if you look at the primary motor cortex of a lifelong piano player vs a normal person, they will have larger regions associated with finger control. This is a type of memory, and the same essentially goes for each region of the brain. But there are different types of memory:</p>
<p>Sensory memory and short term memory aren’t “stored” per se, but rather they are activations that persist for a short time. Short term memory or working memory are “stored” in the cortex, more notably the prefrontal cortex 1. But only for seconds, until it is either moved to long term, or replaced and forgotten.</p>
<p>Long term memory storage is what most people have in mind. And it is incredible in it’s capacity. People have been known to remember the skylines of entire cities after only a half hour, thousands of numbers, and the fact you can remember your first kiss or an early vacation in almost stunning detail is unparalleled.</p>
<p>But where is it stored? As you can see above there are many types, and we’re still working on solving that very puzzle. Short answer. We really don’t know, but we h</p>
<p>ave some striking evidence. For one, we know that the medial temporal regions are crucial for storage and recall. Every neuroscience and psychology student has heard of the famous H.M., whom has probably the most studied brain in the world, and as you’ll see, is the reason we think a lot about the study of memory the way we do. If you haven’t do a google search after this article, but I’ll touch on some highlights:</p>
<p>H.M. underwent a surgery as a last ditch effort to relieve him of some nasty seizures. The surgeon removed his medial temporal lobe, which includes the hippocampus and surrounding regions. The surgery was a success, but it left a lasting side effect: He could not form long term memories, or recall most of his life prior to the surgery.</p>
<p>But more impressively, only a certain type: his explicit memories. There was a study to see if he could improve tracing a star in a mirror, a difficult task that requires practice. Every day he would attempt it, not remembering the day before, but shockingly he improved. This led to the discovery that different types of memory, in this case the implicit/procedural, use a separate mechanism than the hippocampus. Of course this is an oversimplification, but read up if you’re curious.</p>
<p>We know the hippocampal regions are largely responsible for the conversion from long term to short term memory, and we’re getting closer to uncovering its mechanics. There are many theories, but some notable ones are that either the hippocampus stores the memories, then moves them to the cortex, or that it always keeps a copy, these two ideas are vaguely shown below:</p>
<p>Regardless, the “where” of memory storage is blended with the how: LTP.</p>
<p>This refers to the strengthening of synapses of neurons that fire together. Remember above when I mentioned that the areas of the piano players brains that control their hands is bigger than the average person? This is because the brain physically changed due to a neuroplasticity mechanisms called LTP. I won’t get into this much, but the repercussions of this theory is that we’re beginning to see that really, memories are stored in the weighted connections between each of your brain cells.</p>
<p>Whew. I didn’t even mention how memory is a reconstruction, types of amnesia, rat studies, and what my research focuses on currently, memory engrams. And this is just an introduction to the problem, so hopefully you see that this is a complex problem, but I would expect nothing less from such an interesting phenomenon.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My daughter has a mutation on the STXBP1 gene.  This is a binding protein that aids in the connection between neuron and the synaptic nerve.  In her case, memory pathways result in a &quot;shorted&quot; connection more often than they make a connection.   She was 3 before she could walk with assistance and at 8 she has a vocabulary of about 30 words but only about 20 that we can comprehend.  For example, this morning she would ask for mom and I would reply that she was at work.  She would look puzzled and ask again  and I repeated.  This went on for 45 minutes before she triggered what I was saying meant.  Then she went on with her morning.  We know of about 500 people in the world with this mutation, only a few have survived into adulthood with the oldest passing away when he was in his 40s.<br />
It seems that many with this mutation will slowly learn basic motor skills and minimal speech until their teens then begin to loss these functions as if all higher level neural connections have failed by that point.
Much left unknown.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
