		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can remember a face perfectly and put a name to it, but if someone asks me &quot;what does he/she look like?&quot;, I'm lost. &quot;But what nose shape does he have?&quot; No idea. &quot;How about his eyes?&quot; Are they close together, far apart?&quot; I don't know. I only remember the face as a whole, but I'm unable to describe the different parts separately.  </p>
<p>Edit: I think I've been misunderstood. It's not that I have the mental image of the nose but I lack the proper words to describe it (if that were the case, I would still be able to point at a picture of a nose in a collection of nose samples and say &quot;it looked like this one&quot;). What I mean is my brain is unable to form the mental image of one single part of a face. I look at a face and I know that's my neighbour from next door, but if I don't see him, I have no idea what kind of nose he has.</p>
<p>It's like a puzzle, the image only makes sense when all the pieces are in place. But looking at a single piece I can't make sense of it.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Recognizing a face is about pattern recognition. When you see the letters in this sentence, you can tell the t from the g at a glance, right?</p>
<p>How would you verbalize what you're seeing? You would need at least one or two imprecise sentences for each letter to try and convey what your eye can take in immediately, and even then, different people will conjure different images based on your wording.</p>
<p>Language did not evolve to precisely convey pattern recognition. That's not its purpose, and when asked to do it, it is a clumsy instrument. We have created shorthands &quot;Roman Nose, Widow's Peak, High Cheekbones, Full Lips, Deepset Eyes, Thick Neck, etc.&quot; that don't really paint the picture so much as narrow it down. That's about as much work as language can do to communicate the fine details pattern recognition gives us without an actual verbal label.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Memory recall, vocalization, and human facial recognition all occur in 3 different areas of the brain.</p>
<p>From an evolutionary perspective, each area developed for different reasons and at different times... The default connections between them can also be relatively weak without constant use or practice.</p>
<p>So recall of a face and a connection to a memory of a name is a pathway that is used consistently throughout everyone's life.</p>
<p>In internet terms, it's one of the pathways that may have started out as an 8-baud modem connection, but has been constantly upgraded through DSL, Cable, and Fiber.</p>
<p>Alternatively, recalling a face and actually <em>describing</em> a person is something that people tend to do a small handful of times at best. The lack of use tends to ensure that connection doesn't really get upgraded past our dial-up stage.</p>
<p>This is a connection that stays relatively undeveloped.</p>
<p>The brain is pretty amazing and flexible and with consistent practice, most people could become much better at this (as well as many other tasks.) This is the exact reason why practice is so darn important to become a professional at nearly anything.</p>
<p>Similarly, things that aren't practiced tend to remain very difficult.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, some people can't even imagine the abstract images you got going. Based on the Reddit posts I come across, it's fairly common for people to reach adulthood without realizing other people can in fact visualize things and &quot;see&quot; them in their head.</p>
<p>If you can't see things in your head, it's called aphantasia.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Words attempt to publicize the private (mind), among other things, but they're not very good at it. The thoughts, feelings, perceptions, memories, etc. are always richer and more vibrant and &quot;spicier&quot; than descriptive attempts to capture them. </p>
<p>I'm not sure that this a face thing any more than it's a sunset thing, an excellent-lay thing, a powerful-trip thing, etc. Language is just severely lacking, at best.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you have answered the question yourself: &quot;I lack the proper words to describe it&quot;. </p>
<p>Picture something blue. Now, tell me what that color is. Most people will describe it by comparing it to something most people are familiar with. You might say &quot;It's like the sky, but a little darker.&quot; That doesn't really precisely tell me what color you see.</p>
<p>Now suppose that we both have Pantone color samples close at hand. Now you can say &quot;It's Process Blue C&quot;, and I will know exactly what you mean. Pantone gives us a huge vocabulary (more words) to describe colors. </p>
<p>So it is with faces. You may not know the difference between a hook nose, a button nose, straight shape or convex, raised base or lowered, etc. But that doesn't mean that language doesn't exist. You just don't have it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
