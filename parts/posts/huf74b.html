		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>CEO's have an employment contract that covers all sorts of termination possibilities.  It would be in their contract.   </p>
<p>But most of the time, the bankruptcy is out of the control of the CEO.   If he's been with the company for years, everyone has known it was coming, and he would have negotiated his contract to reflect that.</p>
<p>If he's only been with the company for a short time, then he was hired specifically to try to guide the company through the process, or try to prevent the process, so his contract would cover either of those possibilities.  No one signs on to be captain of a sinking ship unless there is a fat paycheck involved.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on the type of bankruptcy. If it's liquidation, where the company is going out of business, any remaining payouts are just part of contracts and what the company owes, and there are legal processes in place to determine how remaining assets are distributed.</p>
<p>If it's a reorganization, that means that the company plans to keep going in some way, and just needs to come to an agreement to discharge some of its debts. Trying to take a company that is going through this and ending up on the other side with a working, profitable company can be difficult and requires good leadership, which can be the justification for paying a CEO a lot of money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While a company's executives usually have an employment contract, that contract is converted into an unsecured bankruptcy debt - meaning that the executives are the last people to get paid out of the bankruptcy funds.</p>
<p>However, when a company declares bankruptcy its shareholders lose their ownership interest in the company and it gets taken over by a combination of the bankruptcy judge and the company's creditors.  </p>
<p>The bankruptcy judge and creditors don't want the company to just collapse.  They want to either take the company over or to liquidate the company's assets in such a way as to maximize how much money they get.  Telling the company's executives to get in line behind the company's other creditors is a bad way to do either of those things.</p>
<p>Bankruptcy isn't a quick or easy process.  It takes a long time and requires a lot of expertise to pull off in any sort of an organized manner.  Doing that requires a management team that knows how to run the business.  The management team that best knows how to run the business is usually the company's current executives.  If the creditors want to retain those executives they have to continue paying them.</p>
<p>But beyond that the internet has a very skewed idea about how companies fail.  In most cases companies fail because the company's executives had a good plan for dealing with contingencies that were foreseeable, but some unforeseeable contingency occurred and the company wasn't able to respond.  What this means is that usually the company's executives did everything right and the company failed anyways.</p>
<p>The creditors aren't under the same delusion that the internet is.  Corporate creditors are sophisticated business people.  They understand that there isn't any fault for the bankruptcy of the company and they're not looking to punish anyone for what happened.  All the creditors want is to get as much money as they can out of the company.</p>
<p>What this means is that sometimes the creditors will give large bonuses to the company's executives if the bankruptcy proceeds especially smoothly and they pull more money out than was expected - which is the exact same reason that anyone gets paid a bonus, because they did a good job and business owners like to pay their employees extra if they do extra.  </p>
<p>But the most important part of this is that the people making the decision about how much to pay the executives are the company's creditors, who are the only people who are &quot;harmed&quot; by that action.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The company is a legal entity. The CEO is an employee.</p>
<p>The company is going bankrupt because it can't pay everyone what it owes them. The law determines who gets paid first, who gets paid last, and who doesn't get paid at all.</p>
<p>Employees are actually pretty close to the front of the line to get paid, and many CEO contracts have special clauses that put them in the front of the line.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One big misconception is that bankruptcy means a company is going to cease existing. What it really means is the company is going to court. With a judge the company makes a plan to eliminate their debts and become a profitable company again. This plan also includes what stores, products, etc. need to be cut in order to become profitable.</p>
<p>I believe it was in the Frontier bankruptcy they claimed they had to give their CEO and other high level employees a large pay check or they'd leave. A CEO wouldn't stay on with a failing company if they weren't being paid what they felt they were worth. </p>
<p>It's possible a bankruptcy could lead to dissolving a company. However, the intention is that the company will recover and be successful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
