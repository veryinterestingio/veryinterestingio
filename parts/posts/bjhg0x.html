		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During the day, there's a lot of background noises. Birds, traffic, people, televisions, etc. But we mostly tend to tune it out as it's unimportant. During the night, most of these noises are missing, so any noise sounds louder.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neuroscientist here. Your ear cells adapt to the noise levels of the environment around you. You may notice that your car radio seems much louder in the morning than at the same volume you set it to on the drive home the previous night. After a night of quiet sleep and a morning lacking the constant background noise you hear in public, or after having a quiet evening at home, your auditory cells have adjusted to the quiet, so any small noise seems much louder.</p>
<p>This effect is similar to how smells stop being smelly after you’ve continued to smell them (ie you can’t smell your own perfume/cologne after a couple hours, but others still can). Basically the more stimulus there is, the more desensitized our receptors become. After most of the noise of being in public subsides, your ears become sensitive to more quiet noises again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One, Its because you are hyper aware of every noise you make because you have the fear that you might disturb your sleeping roommates, so it amplifies every sound. Think of a skittish cat; they are constantly on the lookout for danger. Any sudden noise has them twitching or running. Same thing with you, except the fear of being attacked is replaced with the fear of waking your roommates. </p>
<p>And two, during the day, things are lively and active, and all that noise tends to blend in with the actions you make. Ex: cars outside, dogs, birds, airplanes, lawn work, etc. But at night, none of those things really exist. So all the “noise of the day” is shifted to the “noise of the night” and you’re the only one playing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
