		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ants leave a trail of chemical signals called pheremone wherever they go. There are a few different types of pheremone including one that tells other ants &quot;this way to yummy food&quot;, so when an ant finds a food source, she will eat her fill and head back to the colony, leaving a chemical &quot;road&quot; for her sisters to follow back to the food. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ants communicate via chemical pheromones</p>
<p>When the first ant goes up your pantry it leaves behind a chemical trail that serves no purpose other than to guide it back to the nest</p>
<p>once it finds food, it goes back along this trail but now it leaves a different pheromone that says &quot;hey dudes there's food here come grab it while it lasts!&quot; </p>
<p>Other ants rapidly pick up and follow the &quot;food is this way&quot; trail which quickly leads to the massive swarm in your pantry where you left some food out. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>24 hours is a lot of time for that. At 24 hours it's a full-on militarized settlement with an embassy and traders, a proper ant invasion only takes them around 10 - 20 minutes depending on how far the anthill is. That's just how efficient they are</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
