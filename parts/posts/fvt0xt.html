		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because our inner voice still stimulates our larynx and the regions of your brain as if we said it out loud. The inner voice sends small but detectable nerve signals to our larynx muscles as if we were speaking. We do'nt generate sound because air doesn't flow past the vocal cords. An area of the brain called Broca's area is activated when speaking out loud and during inner voice. Damage to that brain area also interrupts regular and inner speech.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thing is every sense is an electrical signal sent to our brain to cause a pathway of neurons to fire. This means that as long as that pathway gets activated, you’ll have that sense or experience. So speaking to yourself in your head just activates that same “hearing” part of your brain as hearing something does</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>I however, I have thoughts that UI can hear.  I have arguments with myself, etc.  My SO however, doesn't.  She doesn't have an internal monologue.  She has thoughts in shapes and colors, no voices.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that even hearing is very much using your brain. When you hear something, what's happening is that vibrations in the air cause your eardrums to vibrate, which sends a signal to your brain. But until it gets there that's all it is - a signal. Your brain is what decides that when your ears vibrate a certain way, you should experience something like <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0" target="_blank">this classic.</a></p>
<p>Again, the actual experience that you have is what your brain does with the signals from your ears.</p>
<p>So the short version is that your brain can do basically the same thing even without signals from your ears. Likewise, it can do the type of stuff it does when you talk, except without actually making you talk (though it will send some signals to your talky bits, just not enough /the right kind to make you actually talk).</p>
<p>Kind of like how you can tell a desktop computer to play music even if no speakers are plugged in, or to record without a mic - and, if you get fancy, you can tell the computer to virtually play music to be recorded by a virtual mic, without ever making or receiving physical vibrations in the air. (This is particularly useful if you want to, say, play yakety sax over voice chat when your team starts losing horribly in a video game.) The computer is doing the same (or similar) processing it does when it it actually listens over a mic or &quot;speaks&quot; over a speaker, just without the mic or speakers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
