		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The nutritional information on packaging is <em>roughly</em> accurate to the amount that the average person absorbs.</p>
<p>The process is silly, and involves explosions and poop. Food is basically just fuel, and burning fuel can tell you how much energy was in that fuel. Scientists freeze-dry food, crush it into powder, and <del>explode</del> burn† it inside a machine called a bomb calorimeter. Reading the energy released by burning the freeze-dried food gives a general idea of how much energy was in that food. </p>
<p>At the same time, other scientists feed that same food to people, collect their poop, and perform the same process. Freeze-dry. Crush. Burn. That gives an idea of how much energy a person does not &quot;absorb&quot; in the digestion process.</p>
<p>Subtract one from the other. Total energy minus unused energy equals energy absorbed.</p>
<p>Of course, this is a rough estimate, conducted for only certain foods. More complex items are just sums of the already-taken measurements for their component parts.</p>
<p>[[Edit: Of course these are &quot;standard&quot; values and the amount absorbed by any individual may vary slightly based on their own unique digestive tract &amp; the microbes living there.]]</p>
<p>†: [[Edit for clarity: You are <em>setting up</em> an explosion by burning the material inside a constant-volume steel container—the bomb. Rather than allowing it to actually explode, the expansive force is contained and measured. My ELI5 language was a bit too simplified—it's my first time commenting here—so at the request of one of the replies I have edited.]]</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's safe to assume that raw ingredients have accurate nutritional specs.</p>
<p>The processing (baking, frying, cooking, freezing, etc) of raw materials does have an impact on final specs.</p>
<p>The larger the company the more likely they have the money/budget to extract more accurate results out of the final product whereas a smaller company with limited scientific resources or skills may have a product calculated based on raw ingredient specs without taking into account the processing.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Take nutritional specs with a grain of salt. They exist to prevent scurvy and other nutrient deficiencies.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The amounts on the packaging are still accurate. This is why packages say &quot;the average adult daily energy intake is 8700kJ. Yours may vary&quot; or something to that effect. They can't account for individuals metabolism. But they can give exact measured amounts of what's in the food. If you know your metabolism well enough you can calculate how much/what to eat in a day by trial and error. Don't eat sugar ?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No it wouldn't be inaccurate, they have to list what's IN the food itself, they can't really tell you how much you'll absorb.  That would be subjective</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have spoken about macro-nutrients (proteins, fats, carbohydrates). Let me elaborate on micro-nutrients though (trace elements, vitamins). </p>
<p>There is less interest in them so the analytical methods aren't quite so developed. And the interactions between different compounds play even more of a role. We have quite good methods to determine amounts of vitamins (usually by LC-MS if you want to look it up) or of minerals in &quot;ash&quot; (whatever is left when you completely burn the food), its easy. But there is this parameter called &quot;bioavailability&quot;, it is the % of the compound that actually gets absorbed and people are sorely unaware of this. </p>
<p>Bioavailability is why, for example, you shouldn't drink caffeinated drinks while taking iron supplements - caffeine bonds with iron lowering its bioavailability by roughly 70%. Or why you should eat your steamed veggies with a bit of butter or olive oil so your body can absorb the fat-soluble vitamins. </p>
<p>Let me use a case study - spinach. I cant even count the times I got into arguments over spinach - every so often I stumble upon an article (usually some magazine for women or vegans) that says that spinach is a great source of calcium. Well, yes, spinach definitely is rich in calcium (about 100 mg/kg in raw spinach, compare to some 50 mg/kg in broccoli or 120 mg/kg in whole milk). BUT the bioavailability of calcium from spinach is about 5%!! (Compare to 50% from broccoli and 35% from milk). So from a kilo of spinach, you only get 5 mg of Ca (you get that from half a glass of milk or 200g of broccoli). Actually spinach is so bad that it is common to add milk to it when cooking larger quantities (like spinach soup) to catch extra oxalates so they form salt with calcium before they enter your body (they are a common cause of kidney stones).</p>
