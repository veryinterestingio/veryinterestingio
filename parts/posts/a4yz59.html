		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You pull a hair out but the follicle that grew the hair is still there and grows more. Your body constantly loses hair and grows new ones on its own, even without them being yanked out. In your flower analogy a better comparison would be yanking a flower out of the ground but leaving the bulb, which can grow more flowers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hair is generated by the follicle inside your skin, which you aren't pulling out when you pull a hair.</p>
<p>There is a small chance you might damage the follicle though, which is why after waxing/pulling an area over a long period of time it seems to grow back thinner.</p>
<p>If you want a higher chance of actually destroying the follicle that is what laser is for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
