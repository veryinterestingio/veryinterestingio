		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol is removed from the body through the digestive system and metabolism. Both of these slow down when someone is asleep, which means that the alcohol is not removed as quickly or efficiently as it would when they're awake. </p>
<p>Alcohol also interferes with the quality of sleep, which makes hangovers worse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding of the science is that there are two factors at play:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The slower digestion/sleep issue mentioned by jezreelite</p>
</li>
<li>The fact that if you were awake for those 12 hours, you'd probably be drinking other fluids, whereas you get dehydrated while you sleep.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what other people are saying, if you're staying up long enough to sober up, you're likely eating and drinking something before you sleep.
