		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What's the best way to approach an anti-vaxxer with young children (when the topic comes up)? Is there a method of coversation that doctors have found to be the most effective into convincing them to get their kids properly vaccinated? Or has facebook ruined any ability to have a factual, evidence-based conversation with parents. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The effectiveness of the seasonal flu vaccine varies wildly anywhere from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/vaccination/effectiveness-studies.htm" target="_blank">as low as 10% to as high as 56%</a> within the last decade and a half. How big of a risk is there for influenza similar to the severity of the 1918 Spanish flu occurring and the effectiveness of any generated vaccine being low?</p>
<p>For example the 2009 H1N1 swine flu vaccine had an effectiveness of <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000388" target="_blank">72%</a> to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1006736" target="_blank">87%</a> if I'm reading these studies correctly. My understanding is that the lethality of influenza has mainly been reduced by our ability to better treat bacterial pneumonia which often occurred alongside flu infection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Is it worth it to get MMR titers checked or should adults who are fully vaccinated on the appropriate schedule just trust theyâ€™re covered?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
