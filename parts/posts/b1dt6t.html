		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, anything that naturally forms will at some point become so heavy that it starts forming an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. This causes a progress where most of the planet's mass ends up being hydrogen and helium, which turns it into an ice giant (like Uranus and Neptunus) or a gas giant (like Jupiter).</p>
<p>However, it is theoretically possible for some advanced civilization to construct, say, a thin spherical shell of rock in space, which could be of nearly any size without starting to attract hydrogen. It'd be a crazy engineering feat, and the resulting planet would probably have quite low surface gravity, but it's possible in theory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yeah - the problem isn't about a rocky planet getting too big, it's about a very large rock not becoming gassy, too. Jupiter itself may have a very large, rocky core, too - 20x the size of Earth. Or at least, a core made of of heavier elements that have been exposed to extreme pressure and temperature and can't really be called 'rocks' any more, but may have been once.</p>
<p>The overall issue, though, is that there's a LOT of hydrogen and helium compared to everything else. What makes Earth rocky is the abundance of iron, silicon, magnesium, and others that compose minerals. But they're outnumbered by hydrogen alone by a factor of 10,000:1 or more, on the scale of the solar system. So you need a way to not only get a bunch of rocks together, but have the atmosphere blow away.</p>
<p>With the larger gravity of a bigger world, it's much harder to lose the gas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>There comes a point where the mass of an iron-nickel blob is so great that it transitions from a solid to a degenerate gas. Somewhat counter-intuitively, a gas can be denser than a solid, since a solid needs to maintain some semblance of a lattice structure, while particles in a (fermion) gas can cluster right up to their quantum mechanical wavelengths.</p>
<p>This transition point can be calculated by setting the pressure at the core of a rocky planet equal to the pressure at the core of an electron-degenerate star (a state most famously attained by dead stars in the &quot;white dwarf&quot; stage) and extracting this transitional body's mass. Note that while white dwarfs form only after a large star dies, this is because you first have to get past the nuclear burning stage. You skip directly to a degenerate gas--do not pass go, do not collect 1 billion years of sunshine--if you cannot initiate fusion in the first place.</p>
<p>Remarkably (see page 4 of the link above) this transition point is set by the Planck mass (gravity), the fine structure constant (electromagnetism), and the mass of the gas particle. It's where gravity's preference to get more compact beats electromagnetism's preference to maintain a nice lattice. It happens to be about 1 Jupiter mass, ie if Jupiter were rocky, its core would be right at the transition point from solid to degenerate gas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Saturn and Jupiter are almost equal in size, even though Jupiter is vastly more massive. Every kg of gas that you put on the surface will end up compressing the interiour by approximately its own size. Something similar should be true for planets that consist only of rock, and as rock is heavier and denser, rocky planets should never be as big as Jupiter. Some white dwarfs have a composition that is similar to a rocky planet, and they are usually the size of Earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
