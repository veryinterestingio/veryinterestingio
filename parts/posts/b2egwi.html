		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've seen a lot of other answers, and they are getting close. But the correct answer to the specific smell &quot;before it rains&quot; is actually ozone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ozone—O3, the molecule made up of three oxygen atoms bonded together—also plays a role in the smell, especially after thunderstorms. A lightning bolt’s electrical charge can split oxygen and nitrogen molecules in the atmosphere, and they often recombine into nitric oxide (NO), which then interacts with other chemicals in the atmosphere to produce ozone. Sometimes, you can even smell ozone in the air (it has a sharp scent reminiscent of chlorine) before a storm arrives because it can be carried over long distances from high altitudes.</p>

<p>The wet earthy smell comes from bacteria in the soil, the sharper scent is the ozone as explained above. And if you're smelling it before it rains it's most likely the ozone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Petrichor (Greek ‘petra’ = rock / ‘ichor’ = ethereal fluid flowing in the veins of gods) was the name given to that smell by Australian scientists back in the 60’s. It’s the semi volatile compounds found in plant oils trapped in the soil and on the surface of rocks, metabolites of certain bacteria (geosmin as already mentioned) and ozone creation in the presence of electrical storms. </p>
<p>The Australian bush is amazing to experience the petrichor aroma in - there is often loooong stretches between rain, which means dense build up of the plants volatile oils which are then released with rare episodes of moisture. </p>
<p>And it’s such a nice word to say! Petrichor! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of the smell is from soil bacteria released when the rain drops start hitting the ground.  Some may be from ozone.  I was told once that a culture of Streptomyces erythraeus smelled very similar to rain, as it had been used to make erythromycin, the antibiotic, in industrial quantities.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
