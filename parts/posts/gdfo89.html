<p>Not only that, but is it possible to speculate whether the aquatic species that currently exist in the deep, undiscovered part of the ocean are the same as those which used to exist millions of years ago?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg, or sometimes still referred to as the Cretaceous-Tertiary, K-T) Extinction event killed off both marine and terrestrial species. You can get a sense of the variability of organisms which died out in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event#Extinction_patterns" target="_blank">wiki article on the extinction event</a>. As described there, in the marine realm, significant numbers of species of nanoplankton, corals, cephalopods, echinoderms, bivalves, and some cartilaginous fish went extinct (it was especially hard on nanoplankton). </p>
<p>For the latter half, are you asking whether it's possible there are organisms we think went extinct across the K-Pg, but are still alive in the deep ocean? If yes, in general, when considering the extinction of an organism, we're talking about it disappearing from the fossil record across a boundary. So it's unlikely that that an organism would disappear from the fossil record across the K-Pg and yet still be alive somewhere today (i.e. individuals of this species would have to avoid being fossilized for 65 million years of Earth history).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Generally it is though to have thrown up a huge amount of dust that blocked significant sunlight. This would affect photosynthesis and temperatures for years which would have very severely affected ecosystems through loss of food. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a mountain range in India that was erupting almost continuously for 25K years leading up to around the time where the K-T asteroid hit. The build up of c02 in the atmosphere, and subsequent acidification of the oceans, may have caused the majority of extinction of sea life.<br />

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ah tacking on to this bc I spend entirely too much time teaching this not to chime in! This is an anecdote, but it’s one of the topics I can get kids excited about when we do outreach events outside the lab.</p>
<p>There were a few concurrent (it’s an old debate) events on earth that also could have contributed to global change (huge lava flows and rapid sea level change) that affect organisms, even/especially those living in the ocean. To narrow to the asteroid though, the material, aerosols, and gasses thrown up by the impact blocked sunlight. Huge wildfires compromised the atmosphere further, and we know that any rain that fell was likely acid rain. Etc etc</p>
<p>Life in the oceans changed dramatically, just as on land. Most food chains depend on photosynthesis, so those were compromised. Those that rely on detritus probably had a bit of a boon, but ultimately that couldn’t have lasted either. It’s unknown how long the perturbation to the global climate lasted before coming back to a steady-ish state, but it was certainly long enough to affect populations. Life as a whole persisted, but was under a lot of pressure. Many species—most, even! At least those that we can see in the fossil record—didn’t survive.</p>
<p>Now for the anecdote: like most climate scientists, I spend a lot of time thinking about foraminifera, tiny planktic animals with shells that we can easily track in the fossil record (marine mud). In my group’s professional collection, we have a core from the Gulf of Mexico that shows the boundary super clearly. The forams from before the impact are large, many-chambered ornate critters, but after, they are noticing smaller (to the naked eye!) and simpler, with fewer chambers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
