We use a ridiculous amount of fat, salt, sugar, acid and alcohol in your food. Everybody knows about fat and salt, but especially the alcohol makes a massive difference. There are so many different alcoholic drinks that can enhance all kind of different foods, a good example would be Noilly Prat for fish dishes or a splash of sherry in your savoy cabbage. You'd never know it's in there, but it makes all the difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Try adding twice the spices to your at home cooking - the difference is incredible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If you can't replicate the taste of a restaurant dish at home then be aware that the three secret ingredients are always (more) <strong>salt, sugar and butter</strong>.  </p>
