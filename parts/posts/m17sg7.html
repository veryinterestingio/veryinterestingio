<p>Also, keep in mind that the biggest issue with COVID-19 is how quickly it overwhelms medical facilities. Even if the virus is not wiped out, if the most vulnerable and a good chunk of the population are protected, it will become just another deadly virus we live with like the flu.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We will still reach it.  Those that refuse the vaccination will benefit from the slower spread, but it will continue to spread and especially in their communities.  The vaccine does what the disease already does in terms of providing future immunity (for at least a while).  The vaccine simply does it with far, far, fewer bad consequences and far, far faster.</p>
<p>Almost all of them will eventually get it, most without symptoms, many with symptoms, some will become very seriously ill, a few (especially the oldest) will die.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The closer you get to the 70% threshold the slower the spread will be as well. If 70% is herd immunity, then 69% would be quite slow spread. The real victims in these under-vaccinated scenarios are those who cannot get the vaccine, either due to medical restrictions or because they are too young/disabled to make their own choices. It’s sort of everyone else’s responsibility to get vaccinated to protect these people in our herd, hence “herd” immunity. </p>
<p>Also, while it seems the immunity caused by contracting the disease may not be as effective or long lasting as the vaccine (ie it’s not as good overall), it does appear some individuals who have contracted the disease may get some level of at least temporary immunity. If this is true, it would contribute towards the 70% number for at least a little bit. Hopefully, other currently unwilling adults will begin taking the vaccine in the meantime and a version will be approved for children</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A couple things to consider are 1.) Polls aren’t always accurate and 2.) The 70% is an easily communicated estimate, among professionals the answer will be a lot more complicated than just a single number like that</p>
<p>You also have some level of immunity from infection that’ll take up some amount of those that refuse to get vaccines, as you’ll continue to have rapid spread in less vaccinated areas, immunity from infection is obviously not desirable for several reasons, one being it can kill you, harm you, put those around you that aren’t vaccinated at risk, and yields a weaker possibly shorter lasting immune response, plus it opens up more opportunities to yield mutations that are more contagious, more virulent, or evade immunity, but if they survive they’ll be left with some immunity in all likelihood that will slow spread through them in the future</p>
<p>Also, I highly suspect that vaccine hesitancy will decline, as people see more and more people around them who got the vaccine being fine, it’ll ease people’s minds. A lot of people don’t understand or trust how testing for safety works so just straight up seeing that a majority of the people around them is vaccinated and is doing fine will make it seem more desirable, I honestly think most people refusing at this time are in this camp.</p>
<p>Also, I think a lot of people like to say they won’t get it but totally will once it’s their turn or is more accessible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
