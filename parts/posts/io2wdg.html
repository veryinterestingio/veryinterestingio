		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you complete a quick, strenuous exercise, some excess hemoglobin is released from your blood cells into the lungs, which is then moved to your mouth during an exhale. Since hemoglobin is also made up of iron, that is what your receptors detect- hence the blood taste.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have exercise induced asthma and I get this sensation right before I get an asthma attack after cardio exercise. It’s such a strong blood taste I used to think I was going to spit out blood but when I spit it was always just saliva. So learning the science now helps it all make sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The taste that can be present in your mouth might be similar to the one of blood, or just metallic. Happens usually when performing hard exercises with not a lot of previous training or preparation, exercising at high altitudes or in cold and dry air.The taste is a byproduct of the fact that the heart is working way harder than usual causing pulmonary edema (buildup of fluids in the lungs), and with this there's an increase in pressure which causes a leakage of erythrocytes (Red blood cells) into your lungs. Haemoglobin (the molecule present in RBCs that allows transport of oxygen) are bound to iron ions and when RBCs have entered the lungs, haemoglobin can escape into the bronchi, then the trachea, larynx and finally reaches the mouth, where the taste receptors on the tongue sense iron and send a signal to your brain causing this metallic/bloody taste in your mouth.  </p>
<p>Edit: Might be a little too specific and complicated for ELI5 but I'll still leave it here</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
