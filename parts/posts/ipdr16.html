		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Reddit! I'm S. &quot;Bala&quot; Balachandar, a professor in the mechanical and aerospace engineering department at the University of Florida College of Engineering. Right now, I'm leading a study of aerosols and multiphase flow to determine how far droplets can travel and infect others. During the COVID-19 global pandemic, many safety guidelines currently set in place have been determined by outdated science that says we will be safe if we are six feet apart from a sick person.</p>
<p>I'm here to answer any questions you may have on the science behind virus travel, airborne transmission/host-to-host transmission, how inhalation and exhalation transmit a virus and the way particle sizes affect transmission.</p>
<p>At the University of Florida, my teaching interests are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computational fluid science</li>
<li>Large scale simulation of complex flows</li>
<li>Transition and turbulence</li>
<li>Multiphase flows</li>
<li>Environmental flows</li>
</ul>
<p>More about me:</p>
<p>I joined the Wertheim College of Engineering at UF after teaching in the Department of Theoretical &amp; Applied Mechanics at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign from 1990 to 2005 and after I earned my Ph.D from Brown University in 1988. I am a fellow of the American Physical Society and the American Society of Engineers as well as co-editor-in-chief of the International Journal of Multiphase Flow and associate editor of the Theoretical and Computational Fluid Dynamics Journal. I am also the Principal Investigator at the Center for Compressible Multiphase Turbulence.</p>

When does it become safe to occupy the space that someone else has previously occupied, both indoors and outdoors? For example, when advancing through a socially-distanced line, you could enter someone else's cloud of droplets once they move forward if not enough time has passed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If my friend was 10 feet away from me, but sneezed into a fan pointed at me - 6 feet wouldn't help much. So what's with all the advice to go outside? If the breeze is 20 mph, isn't it possible that viruses are coming towards me at 20 mph?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
