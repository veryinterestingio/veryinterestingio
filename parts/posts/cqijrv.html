		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hamsters were not bred for domestic life until 1939. In the wild they like to live in warm, dry areas, like sand dunes or the edge of deserts, which explains why the first hamsters were discovered in Syria. They also live in the wild in more diverse countries, such as Greece, Romania, Belgium and northern China.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several genera and species of hamsters, which live in various places across Eurasia (I'm not sure if any modern species occur in N. Africa).  The most famous domestic species is the Syrian Golden Hamster, which has a bunch of fun facts associated with it.  The Arabic name for the species means &quot;Mr. Saddlebags&quot; because of how it stores food in its cheeks.  The species is either quite rare or very hard to find in the wild...it takes extensive collecting work to get even a few (the species is currently considered vulnerable).  As a result, the vast majority of golden hamsters in captivity are descended from a single female and her brood captured in the 30's.  They are very inbred as a result.</p>
<p>Syrian golden hamsters, as the name indicates, live in Syria, as well as nearby surrounding areas.  Their range is quite small.  Some live wild in Israel, but they appear to have escaped from captivity there.  </p>
<p>Dwarf hamsters are also kept in captivity, they come from northern Asia...Siberia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and surrounding regions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Clearly you've ever provided a sand bath to your hamster or you'd be able to narrow it down a fair bit. </p>
<p>I had an hamster and found one shop selling scented sand for hamsters. I thought it was funny as we liked to &quot;spoil&quot; her and bought it.
The minute she touched sand she went crazy rolling on it as if it was something she'd done (when she never did) since ever and was a natural.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've had this same question about colorful tropical freshwater fish. In the US, even our predator freshwater fish (bass, lake trout) are colored at least along the top in a darker grey or green color to avoid being seen. But you walk into a (legit) fish store and they have freshwater fish and invertebrates of every impractical color under the sun. Where are those things native to???</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
