		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m not a scientist, so anyone who is, please correct my errors.</p>
<p>This may be related to what neuroscience calls the task-negative and task-positive networks.  </p>
<p>The brain has a task-positive neural network that’s focused on processing information that demands concentration/attention, like speaking or watching a movie.  </p>
<p>But it also has a “default mode network” (task-negative), which activates when we do things like daydream or think about the past or plan for the future.  Creative ideas seem to happen more frequently in this state as well.  </p>
<p>Perhaps that sudden snap of awareness is a shift from one network to the other.  You didn’t notice the slip into it, just the snap out of it back to the external world.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting idea.  It’s thought that this is how people cope with solitary confinement:  Rather than go mad in complete silence and isolation, they retreat into a rich inner world that no one can take from them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>there's a few similar phenomenon that you might be talking about:</p>
<p><strong>dissociation</strong>, which is an emotion thing. these are usually short, but can be hours long, episodes of feeling detached from your surroundings. you might feel like the world around you is not real, that you are not real, or that you are outside of your body watching yourself. these happen in response to stress, ranging from boredom to a traumatic event. they also can be induced by some drugs. even though it does not happen to everyone, it isn't usually a problem; when it is, we call it a dissociative disorder.</p>
<p><strong>micro-sleep</strong>, which is a sleep thing. these are 10-30 second episodes of non-responsiveness. you might feel sleepy, your eyelids may close, or you might not remember it happening at all. these usually occur when you're sleep-deprived, and can be dangerous during things like driving.</p>
<p><strong>automaticity</strong>, which is a habit and memory thing. this is when you do a task that you often do, and still feel normal and can respond to events appropriately, but you aren't occupied with the details involved. you might not remember the task at all afterwards, and you might do another task at the same time. for example, you arrive home and realize you don't remember walking there at all, only that you were planning dinner. this happens to everyone and isn't dangerous.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know it's supposed to be dissociation. Everyone dissociates, but some people do it as a response to stress and they just sort of shut down and can't move or speak or respond for a few minutes. Sometimes it's more minor. I don't think that's the only reason for it, but that's why it happens to me. I'm curious to learn more about this too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
