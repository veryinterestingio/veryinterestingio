		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember hearing something about this, but I’m not a professional psychologist or anything, so don’t take my word as law. </p>
<p>From what I remember, back when we were evolving into humans, stressful situations tended to be pretty dangerous (being hunted by a lion, nearly falling off a cliff, screwing up socially and being thrown out to fend for yourself). Generally good things to avoid. </p>
<p>A good way to help us avoid those situations in the future is to have very strong unpleasant memories associated with them. Then you won’t forget what lead to the situation, so you can make sure to stay far away from anything that could cause a similar experience. </p>
<p>Essentially, we’ve evolved to remember stressful situations really strongly so that we can remember to avoid them in the future.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Your brain wants you to avoid bad feelings more than it wants you to remember and repeat good feelings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bad memories stick because remembering them made survival easier when our brains evolved. Remembering where a tiger chased you is more important than seeing a pretty sunrise.</p>
<p>With people, because we are social animals, we needed to make sure we fit in and were at least tolerated by our group. Remembering cringe moments is a thing so that we don't continue making social mistakes and risk alienating people we need to rely on to survive.</p>
<p>Its only recently that people developed a society where we're not restricted to a single group, so our brain hasn't caught up to the ability to just move on when people don't like us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Then if tou want to avoid doing it again, what would be the best thing to do?
If the answer is &quot;reflect and think of alternatives&quot; then you already know the answer.  </p>
<p>Happy memories are good but they don't have a great purpose like the bad ones have. It would be a waste to remember them over and over.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
