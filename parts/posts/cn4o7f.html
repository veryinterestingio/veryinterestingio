		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The body does not recognize the foreign blood as blood, but rather as a suddenly invading foreign organism that is trying to kill you. It releases a massive immune system response, destroying and congealing the foreign blood as fast as it can, which can in turn kill you from the effects. But your body figures it’s worth the risk given the circumstances.</p>
<p>Interestingly, as your brain senses that it’s under massive attack and starts to mount a response that itself might be fatal to you, it often generates a <a href="https://www.medicaldaily.com/tranfusion-reaction-mismatched-blood-type-donations-create-sense-impending-397528" target="_blank">“sense of impending doom”</a> before the physical immune reaction actually hits. And doctors are trained to ask and watch for it as a sign that a serious mistake has occurred.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blood has anti other blood sensors on it. Type A has anti-B, type O has anti A and anti B, type B has anti A and type AB has neither. So following these rules, Type A can receive from only A or O. Type B can receive B or O.  Type O can only receive O. Type AB can receive O, A, B, and AB.  This is why type O is considered the universal donor while type AB is the universal receiver.  If they are not a blood match, the blood will attack the foreign blood. The reason someone is getting a transfusion is because they need blood. Adding bad blood triggers an auto response from the blood to destroy the foreign blood. This exacerbates the lack of blood issue by causing existing blood cells to die and destroying the transfused blood cells as well. Now the body not only has survive whatever trauma but also has to clean up the giant mess in the bloodstream now with multiple clots that can reach cause heart attack or stroke. Most likely it kills the patient if not caught immediately.<br />

Edit: Rh factor is another aspect of the blood. This is either you have Rh factor (+) or you don't (-).  Those who don't, don't want it and those who do don't care if they don't get more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I remember 9th grade bio correctly, it depends on the blood types. Some blood types clot when you mix them so you’d end up with massive clots that would eventually make it to your brain and heart and kill you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The receiver's immune cells will mount an attack against the incorrect blood. The white blood cells attach to the wrong-type red cells and make them burst, releasing their bits into the bloodstream. </p>
<p>The body believes it is under attack, so it quickly raises the body temperature causing a fever. In severe cases, the body will go into shock.</p>
<p>Additionally, the burst bits can get caught in the kidneys and cause damage there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
