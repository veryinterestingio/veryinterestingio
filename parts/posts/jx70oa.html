		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the vaccine</p>
<p>Live attenuated vaccines are generally contraindicated (BCG, yellow fever, OPV, vaccinia in particular, but also MMR and the live attenuated flu vaccine).  For live attenuated vaccines that can be transmitted person-to-person, like OPV, they are also contraindicated for the family members or roommates of an organ transplant recipient.</p>
<p>Vaccines should generally be given <em>prior</em> to solid-organ transplant, as response in the post-transplant period can be poor - when it's obvious a patient is headed in the direction of, e.g., end-stage liver disease requiring transplant, you try to get them fully vaccinated well in advance.  </p>
<p>Inactivated, toxoid, and subunit vaccines like DPT, Hep B, Shingrix, and Pneumovax are generally safe.  For many vaccines given after transplant, you check titers rather than assume that they made a sufficient immune response.  For some vaccines, post-transplant patients should get higher doses or accelerated schedules (this has been studied, for example, with the HBV vaccine).  Inactivated flu vaccine should be given annually. </p>
<p>Even if they make <em>less</em> of an immune response to vaccines, <em>some</em> response is still better than none.  So if the vaccines are safe, they will usually be given.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general if someone is on immunosuppressants vaccines will not work as well for them, since a vaccine still requires you to have a capable immune system. And some vaccines actually shouldnt be given if you have a weakened immune system. </p>
<p>However if everyone around them is vaccinated to the level of herd immunity they are less likely to ever be exposed to the disease in question. This is why getting vaccinated is so important, even if you’re healthy. There are a lot of people (elderly, children, cancer patients, transplant patients, autoimmune patients, etc) who dont have immune systems strong enough to fight a disease even with the proper vaccination.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you have a stem cell/ bone marrow transplant you have to be re-vaccinated once you have fully engrafted and regain immunocompetence. That can be 2 years or more following transplant.  </p>
<p>Your immune system is pretty much obliterated with a bone marrow/stem cell transplant, including humoral and cell mediated immunity. </p>
<p>Another interesting fact is that the recipient will become the donor’s blood type after transplant if the donor was a different type, and the recipient’s blood cells will have the DNA of the donor, while other cells still have the recipient’s dna!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
