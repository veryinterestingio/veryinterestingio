		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When people talk about the &quot;size&quot; of the black hole, they don't mean the distribution of matter, which as you correctly point out is at the singularity anyway in General Relativity. What they are referring to is generally the radius of the event horizon - there's no surface or material there, but it's the point you can't get any information beyond. Nothing special happens there to someone falling in, they just can't get back anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Firstly, it needs to be said that the mathematics of general relativity are outright invalid beyond a black hole's Cauchy horizon.  Therefore, any prediction of a singularity is simply not a valid prediction to begin with.  <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematicians-disprove-conjecture-made-to-save-black-holes-20180517/" target="_blank">[Source]</a></p>
<p>We have no valid theory which also matches general relativity in the regime where it is valid and experimentally-supported. So we simply don't know what happens inside a black hole.  All we have are hypotheses, many if not all of which are not falsifiable and therefore not strictly scientific, despite our best efforts to make them falsifiable and scientific.</p>
<p>Even if a singularity <em>were</em> a valid prediction, the &quot;problem&quot; you are asking about is not really a problem (although there are other more complicated problems that are real problems, such as loss of differentiability).  A black hole's &quot;size&quot; (event horizon) is not proportional to its density, it is proportional to its mass.  The density at the singularity may be infinite, but the mass is always finite.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The singularity isn't truly infinitely dense. Infinities in physics almost always indicate a problem. The problem here is that there is no way to measure the singularity and the effect is indistinguishable from an infinitely dense one. It is more helpful from an observational and mathematical perspective to think of it as infinitely dense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The growth of the black hole is just a side effect of mass increasing. If you add mass to something, it’s gravity increases. The event horizon of a black hole is where the acceleration from gravity is the same as light speed, so if you add more mass, that horizon moves outward.</p>
<p>In reality, we don’t <em>actually</em> know what happens beyond the event horizon, it’s mostly speculation. Our mathematical models predict an infinitely dense point, but usually in physics if you get an infinity, that means your theory isn’t perfect. It may be the case that the singularity isn’t infinitely dense, or it may be an exotic particle, or a swirling ball of space time fabric, or something so incomprehensible that our brains can’t even conceive of it. It’s hard to check, so we really just have to guess.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have a misconception about what &quot;size&quot; means regarding a black hole.</p>
<p>As you said, it's infinitely dense, with all its mass compressed into a single point (the singularity). What determines the &quot;size&quot; of a black hole is the surface of its event horizon, because anything that crosses that surface gets casually disconnected from the rest of the universe, but it is not an actual tangible thing, it's just the effect of the curvature of space around the singularity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
