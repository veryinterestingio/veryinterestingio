		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the DJ, some will premix a set of tracks at home or a studio, push play, and act the part. What most do, requires quite a bit of skill. DJs get a bad rap but it takes some talent to be good. What you have in front of you is a multi channel mixer. This is ELI5 so let's keep this simple, this is a 2 channel mixer. One song is playing on the first mixer, and the DJ is cueing up the next one on the other side. What he is hearing in his headphones is not what is being played to the audience but either the next song or both tracks at once, and he is trying to match the beat to the current track, find the right time to blend them together for a seamless transition, add pitch, tone, bass, effects, slow one track down, speed one up.. Ect. He/she is working on making sure the beat don't stop because that's what kills the party. Another point to make is he is watching, and playing for the audience, some things work some don't so the DJ has to be reactive to what he is observing with the crowd. Now multiply all that to 4 our even 6 channels and you got work son.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It helps to know a bit of the history behind what we now think of when we talk about DJing. Hip hop was invented when DJs like Grandmaster Flash developed techniques to match the beats of 2 songs, extend a breakdown using 2 copies of a record, rhythmic scratching etc. Those DJs were all about developing cool techniques to make a bit of a collage with their sets. Grandmaster Flash's Adventures on the Wheel of Steel was essentially a single-length version of one of these sets. Keep in mind that at this point, the records these DJs played hadn't been produced especially for DJs. This is in contrast to dance music, which is a different culture and different technique. Dance music sets were (and still are) about long, flowing sets, and playing the hottest new tracks. Dance music producers are made or broken by DJs, so they started to kind of standardise their tracks. Same tempo, same arrangement, same intro, same outro. This enabled DJs to very easily transition between tracks and make 6 hour sets. This is why dance music is split up into a thousand sub genres - they're essentially DJ templates. So no, dance music DJs don't do a lot. It's more about knowing the hottest new tracks, and picking the right tracks at the right times in your set. Beat matching 8 bars of music that already have the same beat and tempo is easy. Keeping a party going with 6 hours of music isn't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s kind of 2 types:</p>
<p>1: some DJs will pick the tracks as they go depending on a number of factors, including their read of the crowd. (Some tracks may be their own if they produce music as well, but often it’s other artists tracks). They’ll mix the tracks together as seamlessly as possible and maybe add in some tweaks here and there. This includes looping, key and beat matching and all that. Some DJs use vinyl, in which case the above are impossible (in the case of looping) or very difficult (key and beat matching)</p>
<p>2: they’ll do all of the above in private beforehand to remove any mistakes, then during the event just hit play and pretend to be doing things. Maybe a minor adjustment here and there. </p>
<p>TLDR: not much. Truly talented DJs will also produce their own music, in which case they’re more an artist than a DJ.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Do you know what tracks to play? Do you know what tracks people are sick of hearing? Would you know when people need a break, when people need a beat?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
