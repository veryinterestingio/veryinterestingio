<p>This is not an accurate description of what killed the majority of people at Pompeii/Herculaneum, it was a series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyroclastic_surge" target="_blank">pyroclastic surges</a>, which is one possible part of large, explosive eruptions. It did not come out of nowhere, it was preceded by a variety of smaller eruptive events and occurred ~12 hours after the beginning of the eruptive episode.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Couldn't it happen again in Hawaii or Japan or anywhere else with a city near a volcano?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pyroclastic surges, or more generally, explosive eruptions tend to only occur at certain types of volcanoes. This is tied to the type of lava that is erupted at these volcanoes, which in turn is tied to the tectonic environment. Basaltic volcanism, like that tends to occur in association with hotspots, at least those erupting through oceanic crust (e.g., Hawaii or Iceland) tends to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effusive_eruption" target="_blank">effusive</a>, i.e., lava flows without large, explosive ash columns, pyroclastic flows/surges, etc. There can be certain cases where basaltic volcanism can produce more explosive eruptions, usually when significant amounts of water are involved, i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phreatic_eruption" target="_blank">phreatic eruptions</a>, but as a a general rule, low silica magmas/lavas do not erupt explosively. That is not to say they can't be damaging, but damage tends to be more contained and slower moving. As silica content increases toward andesite or rhyolite, viscosity increases and gas content increases, both of which tend to lead to more explosive eruptions. Volcanoes associated with subduction zones (e.g., the Cascades in Washington/Oregon, most volcanoes in Japan, etc) tend to erupt these types of lavas and as such, are more likely to erupt explosively. </p>

<p>There are plenty of extremely deadly volcanic eruptions throughout history, though not as many in the western world, so they often don't get as much consideration in western perspectives of history (the destruction of Pomeii and Herculaneum are also probably one of the earliest, well recorded volcanic eruptions as well, which might also explain the fixation). The 79 AD eruption of Vesuvius that destroyed much of Pompeii and Herculaneum was not really that large, all things considered (i.e., a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_Explosivity_Index" target="_blank">VEI of 5</a>). Eruptions in more modern history like Krakatoa in 1883 (VEI 6), Pinatubo in 1991 (VEI 6), or Tambora in 1815 (VEI 7) to name a few were larger, and some were significantly deadly.  The eruption of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eruption_of_Mount_Vesuvius_in_79_AD#Casualties_from_the_eruption" target="_blank">Vesuvius killed upwards of 1,000 people</a>, at least based on the number of remains that have been found (though many estimates place it much higher), which is comparable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_eruption_of_Mount_Pinatubo#Death_toll" target="_blank">Pinatubo which killed ~847</a>, but the eruptions of Tambora (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1815_eruption_of_Mount_Tambora" target="_blank">&gt;10,000 dead from the pyroclastic flow alone</a>), and Krakatoa (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1883_eruption_of_Krakatoa" target="_blank">&gt; 36,000 people dead, though much of that was from tsunamis</a>) dwarf both of those in terms of casualties. And there are other direct analogues to the Pompeii-Vesuvius relationship, e.g. the 1902 eruption of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Pel%C3%A9e" target="_blank">Mt. Pelee</a>, which completely destroyed the city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Pierre,_Martinique" target="_blank">Saint-Pierre</a>. So <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_volcanic_eruptions_by_death_toll" target="_blank">Vesuvius is up there</a>, but it is certainly not alone in large, deadly eruptions.</p>

<p>It most certainly is. Large cities adjacent to active volcanoes continue to be a major hazard throughout the world. In the US, probably one of the most worrisome is Mt. Rainier, especially given that large swaths of the city of Tacoma are built on stacks of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahar" target="_blank">lahar deposits</a> from previous eruptions, but many of the Cascade volcanoes pose risks to nearby cities. Modern Naples and surrounding regions remain at extreme risk, both from Vesuvius, but also <a href="https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/campi-flegrei.html" target="_blank">Campi Flegrei</a>. Basically any location that is near a subduction zone related volcano has some risk of a large, explosive eruption. This is why we expend effort <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/natural-hazards/volcano-hazards/monitoring" target="_blank">monitoring volcanoes</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The city of Goma in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo is known as one of the most dangerous cities in the world due to the hazard of Mt. Nyiragongo, an active volcano with a lava lake directly north of the city. Part of the hazard of this volcano comes from the possibility of fissure eruptions within the city, as happened in 2002. The major hazard to Goma however comes from Lake Kivu, a major lake in East Africa that Goma sits next to. Because of volcanism in the surrounding area, there is a huge quantity of dissolved gasses (methane and carbon dioxide) sitting under pressure on the bottom of the lake which is extremely deep, as are other African lakes in this area. The concern is that a major eruption or landslide of Nyiragongo could cause an earthquake and disturb the gasses in the lake resulting in what is known as a Limnic eruption. If this were to happen, the entire population of Goma and all populated areas surrounding the lake could be killed by suffocation due to the released gasses. This is well over 1 million people. Most people there are aware of the danger but just go about their daily business trying to survive. The economic potential of the lake is a more pressing concern than its fatal secrets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We had a Pompeii happen in America in 1980 -- Mount Saint Helens.  Look up some pictures of the aftermath.  200 homes were destroyed and 57 people failed to evacuate in time.  They're buried in ash, fallen trees, and lava now.  You can't get much closer to Pompeii in modern times than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_eruption_of_Mount_St._Helens#/media/File:Reid_Blackburn's_car_after_May_18,_1980_St._Helens_eruption.jpg" target="_blank">scenes like this.</a></p>
<p>The good news is that these kind of volcanic eruptions are very rare, and modern geologists can sound an alarm with enough time to start an evacuation.  But it still happens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>One thing to keep in mind is that a volcano does not just wake up one day and decide to kill you. You always get at least days of warning, usually weeks or months. All you have to do is walk away when the tremors start.</p>
<hr />
<p>Once upon a time, there was the city of Saint Pierre on the Caribbean island of Martinique. Think palm trees, plantations, and a big volcano, Mt. Pelee.</p>
<p>On April 23, 1902, the volcano started producing constant explosions after months of increased fumarole activity. Climbers found that the crater was starting to fill with boiling sulphuric water.</p>
<p>The only scientist among them was a middle school teacher, who claimed that &quot;there is nothing that would warrant an evacuation&quot;. This was well received with the city officials who sent them, because there was an election on May 11 which the ruling party was likely to win, so they wanted to defer any possible evacuation until after the election.</p>
<p>The explosions continued, and on May 2, earthquakes and a massive cloud of smoke were emitted.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the wealthy were starting to buy steamer tickets and leave, most of which were Progressive Party members. This benefited the ruling Conservative Party, so it was perfectly fine as far as the governor was concerned. When Conservative Party voters tried to flee to other villages on the island, however, they were stopped by guards and turned around.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the governor asked his friends at the local paper to print articles claiming Saint Pierre was safe. This even convinced thousands to leave their own villages and move into the big safe city. It started to overflow with refugees, who would hopefully still be around to vote the governor back into power.</p>
<p>On May 5, the boiling water broke through the crater wall and caused a mudflow that destroyed a sugar mill and killed 150. An investigative committee claimed that Saint Pierre was safe, which was printed in the newspaper. More refugees arrived in Saint Pierre until ashfall blocked the roads.</p>
<p>On May 8, the volcano emitted a pyroclastic cloud. This was a phenomenon that was not well understood until then (and for a while was called <em>nuée ardente</em>, glowing cloud). Basically a volcanic cloud so full of lava droplets that it becomes heavier than air, and instead of rising up, runs down the flanks and disintegrates everything in its path. Saint Pierre was burned to its foundations in a flash with only a handful of survivors.</p>
<p>Official discourse was that NO ONE could have seen this coming and there was NO POSSIBLE WAY EVER to prevent this loss of life. The election did not take place.</p>
<p>There you have it. Months of warning, two weeks of constant explosions and still everyone died. Luckily, that was 118 years ago. We are much wiser now, and there is no way <em>today's</em> politicians would be able to get away with using fake news to try and prevent necessary actions to save lives from a looming disaster in order to get reelected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
