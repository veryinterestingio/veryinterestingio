<p>I hold our NHS in high regard. I cannot imagine a healthcare system which can leave people who have worked, paid taxes for 30 years+ and are all round good citizens in financial ruins. What exactly is Obamacare and why do people say it failed?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was a set of regulations, that among others, created a national marketplace system for offering/buying health insurance plans, introduced tax credits for those who couldn't afford insurance so that they may be able to, required everyone to have health insurance if they could afford it (or face a penalty that has now been set to $0/year), and also introduced regulations like the one restricting insurers from denying patients with preexisting health conditions and forced marketplace insurers to cover at least a set of declared essential health services.</p>
<p>One notable problem, at least in my state, is that just about every insurer except Kaiser dropped out of the marketplace exchange, leaving terrible options for those who wanted to purchase insurance using the marketplace tax credits.</p>
<p>A band-aid on the absolutely broken state of health care costs, but a welcome one at it I guess.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh boy.  Strap yourself in British friend, this is going to take a while.</p>
<p>Obamacare was the popular name for an acts passed by the US Congress and signed into law by Obama in 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (often shortened to Affordable Care Act or ACA if you don't like calling it Obamacare). This did a lot of shit, and most people on either side of the issue don't know what the hell they're talking about most of the time, but I'll try and cover the major highlights.</p>
<p>There were a lot of regulatory changes, such as the FDA being given authority to approve generic drugs, and drug manufacturers being given a 12 year exclusive license on drugs they develop before a generic can be introduced.  Restaurants (specifically chains of 20 or more locations) were required to show the calorie content of every item on their menus, although this part was dependent on further regulations by the FDA that I don't believe ever came to pass, many large chains got ahead of the curve and started doing it anyway. A 10% sales tax was placed on indoor tanning salons. And dozens more.</p>
<p>But the big one, the one that everybody thinks of when they think of the ACA/Obamacare, the insurance changes. I assume that you're aware that unlike your own and many other countries, the US doesn't have a universal socialized healthcare system, and we're not here to argue the pros or cons of our system vs. yours or anybody else's.  Some people look at the ACA as an attempt to create such a system, but that is absolutely incorrect.  Instead, it was a combination of regulation over the health insurance industry (banning lifetime or annual limits on spending for hospital stays and other essential benefits, requiring that children be allowed to remain covered by their parents' insurance until age 26, even if they're no longer dependents, a prohibition on denying coverage or charging more to insure a person with a pre-existing condition, and many others), along with an expansion of eligibility for Medicaid (something at least conceptually similar to socialized healthcare, but limited to low-income individuals), although states had to opt-in to this expansion and many did not, combined with the creation of healthcare exchanges allowing  people to shop around for insurance coverage, which was necessary because it was now (as of 2014), mandatory for all Americans to obtain health insurance, under penalty of something that was absolutely not a tax, because they couldn't legally do that, but was an additional sum of money collected from you by the IRS at tax time because it was absolutely a tax.  </p>
<p>Suffice to say that this came from the right place in the heart, there were a lot of good ideas and many of the regulatory changes were helpful, but it didn't help with any of the problems it was designed to fix, and is a major contributing factor to the election of Donald Trump, whose platform included dismantling the ACA.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was an attempt to get as close as possible to the universal health care system you enjoy in the UK, while operating within the constraints of the existing US health care industry.</p>
<p>The major challenge was that the US health care industry is huge and powerful.
Even if corporate lobbying weren't a factor, disrupting the careers of tens of millions of healthcare workers would be political suicide.  So Obamacare kept the private health care companies and insurance companies intact.</p>
<p>The core of the Obamacare compromise was this: first, everyone was <em>required</em> to have health insurance, or they have to pay a penalty.  Lower income people would get money for care from the government, which would expand Medicare (our government-funded, privately-delivered health care program).  Middle- and high-income people would have to buy insurance from private insurers, at government-negotiated prices, and the insurers wouldn't be allowed to turn anyone away.</p>
<p>So the hospitals get more paying customers, but have more cost controls on their services.  The insurance companies get a guaranteed pool of healthy customers to offset the more expensive ones they're now required to cover, and everybody gets health care, either from the government or at a (hopefully) fair price out of pocket.  Everybody wins, nobody loses their job.</p>
<p>The program fell apart in two ways.  First, the plan relied on expanding Medicare to cover people in lower-middle incomes who couldn't afford private policies, but Medicare is operated by federal grants to individual states, and many Republican states refused to expand coverage.  It was hundreds of billions of dollars of free money, and they turned it down in order to sabotage the plan.</p>
<p>Second, the Republicans argued that <em>requiring every American to buy something</em> was unconstitutional, but the Supreme Court argued that the penalty for not buying it was a reasonable exercise of the government's power to tax.
So the Republicans in Congress set the penalty to zero.  Now the requirement to buy health care is arguably <em>not</em> a tax so the government can't do it.  And if people aren't required to buy insurance, healthy people will not buy insurance.  This means insurance companies will have to charge more to cover the sick people that remain, and eventually <em>nobody</em> will  be able to afford private insurance.  Only way to solve that is to get rid of the requirement to cover everyone.... and now we're right back where we started.</p>
<p>In the end, I think both sides of American politics now agree that the effort to nationalize health care &quot;by the back door&quot;, without disrupting existing industries, was a failure.  It was a clever balancing act, but it turned out to be a house of cards.  Most agree that our choices are either some sort of full nationally-funded system, or the status quo.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have already covered the major components of the program, so I'll focus on the question &quot;why do people say it failed&quot;.</p>
<p>This is kind of loaded question because it depends on your definition of success. In terms of reducing the uninsured rate it was a great success: it got us to a 90% insured rate which is the highest it's ever been in history. It also established protection for pre-existing conditions and allowed young people to stay on their parents' plan until age 26 which are both hugely positive accomplishments. I will also add this was the first major change to the US healthcare system after <em>decades</em> of attempts, so just the fact that anything got passed is honestly a success.</p>
<p>Now where did it go wrong? For one thing it didn't really improve healthcare quality; it mostly focused on getting more people covered. For another it didn't quite go as far as people liked - it got the uninsured rate to historic lows but not to 0%, and it didn't help to stop the ballooning prices.</p>
<p>Why did it fall short? Largely due to politics. Democrats had to make major concessions just to get something passed. I don't really think it's fair to call that a failure because it's better to make some progress than no progress. One of the concessions was the removal of the public option. That part was critical for driving down cost. Basically the idea is if everyone is required to get insurance, and there's an affordable government option, then private companies would have to lower their prices in order to stay competitive. It's really too bad that this part had to get removed, and if we could get it passed it would really go a long way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The US has an insurance based healthcare system. You buy private healthcare insurance. One problem with that is that if you have preexisting conditions, no one will insure you. This means that you only get emergency treatment (as ER rooms have to treat you), and when you do you go bankrupt because of the cost, which never really gets covered anyway.</p>
<p>Many Demorats would love to introduce some form of universal healthcare, particularly single payer (ie: the government pays for everyone to get healthcare). Many Republicans hate that idea and strongly oppose it. Obamacare was a compromise, somewhat based a plan put forward by the conservative Heritage Foundation as an alternative to single payer.</p>
<p>It has several main points which are crucial:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No restrictions on pre-existing conditions. This means that people are both a) able to get coverage even if they have disabilities or chronic illnesses, and b) that when someone gets sick, they have some leverage with their provider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsidisation for those on low income: This allows everyone to get coverage. A big part of this was medicaid expansion, which is government provided. I think there were other measures as well to make it affordable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Universal requirement: Everyone has to get healthcare. This is crucial, as it means that the cost of healthcare is spread over everyone. Otherwise, healthy people don't get insurance until they get sick, so don't pay in until they are ill.</p>
</li>
<li>Minimal coverage requirements: This is crucial for the same reason as universal requirement, otherwise healthy people would get cheap useless plans and sick people would have to pay insanely high rates.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, Republicans did a lot of things to kill it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Several Republican states opted out of the medicaid expansion, leaving lots of people struggling to get insurance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Republicans effectively removed the universal requirement by setting the penalty for not getting insurance to $0.</p>
</li>
<li>Ended schemes to subsidise insurance for those on low income.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a lot of other details, but that's the basic gist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
