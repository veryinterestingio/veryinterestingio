		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the difference between broadcasting and internet type communication. </p>
<p>With a broadcast a satellite is just beaming out a high power signal, and people are receiving it on the ground. </p>
<p>There might be lag on it, how would you know? All you're seeing is the images and sound as they arrive. </p>
<p>With Internet communication there has to be a two-way communication going on. That's where it becomes more difficult, because the lag between you sending the signal up, it getting down to where it's going, and the response coming back is far more noticeable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Initial statement is wrong. TV dish antennas hav lag A LOT of lag. But audio/video is synced properly and shown as they arrive, so you dont perceive the lag. Where I live, I can hav the a match broadcast on radio and telecast on TV as LIVE but radio casting always has a few seconds lead. This is something you can try and see for yourself(if you can find one tho)</p>
<p>As for satelite internet.... That can hav pretty OK speeds but at the cost of latency.... most add a minimum of 500ms(0.5s) of delay.... And thats <em>just a minimum</em>. One senior(from UNI) got to stay at the Arctic, tried using sat net or something similar for playing online multiplayer, most of the time servers timed out on connection request before he could join, on the other hand skype works o.k. [similar question was being asked by a fellow gamer on reddit, who had the chance of going to Antarctica for some work] (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/ee3e6d/ping_from_antarctica/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/ee3e6d/ping_from_antarctica/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share</a>)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In laymans terms:</p>
<p>Lag is the time it takes for a signal to get from one end of the pipe to the other.</p>
<p>So in the case of broadcast TV, or a large file download, lag doesn't matter - you can get the signal 2 minutes after its sent, but as long as you keep receiving a steady stream, you'll never know you're 2 minutes behind.</p>
<p>But if you open a web browser and say &quot;show me Microsoft.com&quot;, and it takes 2 minutes for that request to get to Microsoft, and 2 minutes for the reply to come back, then &quot;your internet is slow&quot;. ... Even if it might be capable of downloading a whole episode of game of thrones in the next 2 minutes - it's the request/response delay that makes satellite internet suck.</p>
<p>Now, there are other factors, like that the satellite delay is 1/3rd of a second - so if you pay a lot of money you can get 'fast' internet response if you have dedicated satellite time; and that TCP/IP just won't work with 2 minute round trip times (even if you are streaming a big file.</p>
<p>... And there are a few tricks that satellite providers use to hide the problem (which is why satellite voice calls don't suck any more, and satellite internet is much better than it was).</p>
<p>But the crux of the issue is above, and it's caused by the time it takes light to travel 72,000km up to and back from a satellite in geostationary orbit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difference is between listening to someone with a bullhorn, and having a conversation. </p>
<p>Satellite is like having a guy on a soapbox with a bullhorn. Nobody can effectively talk back, and there’s no way for anyone in the crowd to control what the soapbox guy says or when he says it. But they all get the same message at once, really quickly. </p>
<p>The internet is like a cocktail party; all communication happens between two individual people at a time. Not only does it take a while for information to get across the room, there are a ton of unrelated side conversations happening, slowing things down. But it’s possible to talk back to someone, to request more information, or to request a different story altogether. </p>
<p>tl:dr; the internet is more flexible than satellite, and flexibility costs you speed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Satellite tv is basically one way transmission to everyone receiving the signal and you dont notice the lag.  Satellite internet is two way where you notice the lag.  Satellite internet is also extremely random, so the provider can't send the same signal to multiple houses to save bandwidth.</p>
<p>Satellite tv (dish, etc) need a telephone line connection to the receiver so the box can be activated and your ppv movies can be purchased.  That is very low bandwidth back to the provider, so any delay is not as noticeable and probably attributed to the tv/remote control lag.</p>
<p>Satellite internet has the high bandwidth stuff come down the dish, but your low bandwidth google search text, mouse clicks, etc going thru a 56k modem connection to the provider.</p>
<p>There is full satellite internet designed for very remote (in the jungle, on the mountain top) locations that does go thru the dish both ways, but it is extremely expensive to purchase the hardware and use (data fees).  Iridium has satellite phones which can text, but last time I checked, it was $3us per minute for phone calls and $20 for 100 texts.  No wifi hotspot or tethering available.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
