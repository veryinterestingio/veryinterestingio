		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Reddit! We are two behavioral ecologists who study the evolution, diversity, and function of animal weapons! Weapons such as elk antlers, beetle horns, and crab claws are fascinating (and badass) structures that puzzle us because of their extravagant sizes, shapes and colors. In the broadest sense, we use a combination of observational, experimental, and theoretical studies, to understand everything and anything that relates to animal weapons.</p>

<p>Although we both spend most of our time working with animals that are easy to catch and study, we recently studied one of the most charismatic animals in nature: the narwhal. Narwhal tusks are perhaps one of the most bizarre traits that exist today. Why bizarre? Well, the tusk is actually a modified tooth that can grow up to 8ft in length and protrudes from the head of male narwhals (females rarely have them). So, you can imagine how it would feel to walk about doing your daily business with a pool stick sticking off the top of your head.</p>
<p>Despite being bizarre, little is known what the narwhal tusk is used for. Some researchers suggest that the tusk is a hunting tool, while others suggest it is a weapon used during fights. Dozens of hypothesis regarding the function of the tusk have been proposed. In our study, we examined the growth and variation of 245 male narwhal tusks to gain insights on this mysterious structure. We found that that the largest male narwhals have disproportionately long tusks, and that there was immense variation in tusk length within males. These trends align with what would be expected of a structure that has sexual functions, whether it be as a weapon use in male combat, or a signal used in female choice (or both). Furthermore, we know that male narwhals often have a lot of scars on their heads, which may have resulted from &quot;tusking&quot; behavior, where two male narwhals will display and cross their tusk. This study is just one example of how we both try to learn about animals and their unique weaponry. So, if you are interested in learning about animal weapons, fighting behavior, and narwhal tusks, join us at 14:00 PST (17:00 EST, 21:00 UTC), and will try to answer as many questions as possible!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you uncovered any universal/general/convergent rules about animal weaponry or fighting behavior? They are so diverse it seems unlikely there are any fundamental concepts to be revealed, but it would be neat if there was!</p>
<p>For instance, what can a thagomizer tell you about nematocysts and vice versa? I'm guessing not much.</p>
<p>Mate selection seems like a complicated confounder for combat evolution, although I suppose intra-species conflict is driven almost entirely by sex, so perhaps they are one-in-the-same.</p>
<p>In the absence of predator/prey interactions, do weapons still evolve, solely for mate selection?</p>
<p>What do you think is the evolutionary pressure that drives some species towards violence in mate selection, and thus requiring specialized weapons, while others seem to do so peacefully?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
