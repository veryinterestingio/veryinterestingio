		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the Earth were a perfect sphere and you walked a &quot;horizontal&quot; path (i.e. <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hPosy.png" target="_blank">your path is a line in this plane which is tangent to the spherical earth at the point where you started</a>), then the first step you take will be off the surface of the earth by less than a hundredth of a millimeter, but you'd still be off the surface. As others have said, after a mile of walking, the ground would be about 8 inches or roughly 20 cm below your feet. </p>
<p>You could never take a single step of any distance along a tangent line to a sphere without stepping off the sphere. </p>
<p>In reality, the Earth is not a very perfect sphere from our reference scale, so the particular topography where you're walking has many orders of magnitude more of an effect than the curvature of the earth when you're walking around.</p>
<p>Edit: Someone else below asked how far they would have to walk before they couldn't reach the ground so I found a general formula for your distance from the ground after you walk any distance along the tangent line. Comment pasted below if anyone is interested.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I did a little algebra and found a general formula for the distance off the ground your feet will be depending on how far you walk. Keep in mind this is the distance straight down (i.e. in the direction of the center of the Earth). The farther you walk along the tangent line, the more it'll feel like you're walking uphill. This is always the distance straight down to the ground. </p>
<p>Let &quot;D&quot; be the distance in meters you walked along the tangent line, and let &quot;R&quot; be the radius of the earth in meters. R is roughly equal to 6,371,000 m.</p>
<p>In that case, &quot;X&quot; which is your distance from the ground in meters is:</p>
<p>X = R((((D/R)^2 + 1)^1/2 ) - 1)</p>
<p>If the formatting is hard to read, you take the square root of (D/R)^2 + 1, then subtract 1, then multiply all that by R. </p>
<p>If you want to plug in your tip-toe height difference as X and solve for the distance you'd have to walk, then just rearrange the equation to get this:</p>
<p>D = R((((X/R) + 1)^2 - 1)^1/2 )</p>
<p>You can use any units for D, R and X that you want. Just make sure they're all the same unit.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Earth has an average radius of 6371km.</p>
<p>The equation of that for a circle would be x^(2)+y^(2)=6371^2 </p>
<p>Lets say we want to know the x position where the y is 1m below the earth radius (max y where the tangent is -1m).</p>
<p>We can solve for x by this equation. x^(2)+6370.999^(2)=6371^2</p>
<p>The result is we would have to walk <strong>~2.74km</strong> along the tangent line for the earth to be 1m below us measuring perpendicular to the tangent line to the earth.</p>
<p>As for the actual question asked any distance however incredibly small will result in your feet being off the ground. The smallest distance you could walk to be off the ground would be probably the distance of the furthest electron shell between your feet and the ground.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
