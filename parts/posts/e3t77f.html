		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The part of your brain that is responsible for executive-centered tasks such as organization, prioritization, focus, and attention, is chemically under-stimulated. It is said people with ADD can not focus; this is totally wrong! We can absolutely focus, but we can not choose what to focus on. We are slaves to whichever channel our brain flips to in that moment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had this explain to me recently by someone over at r/ADHD. Imagine your brain is like a gas tank. only your gas tank is much smaller than other people's and in addition refilling it is harder as it requires much more specific fuels. </p>
<p>That directly equates to your missing dopamine. You have less of it firing and less things that typically trigger it than most.</p>
<p>Example I am motivated (refuel) by urgency and interest, but importance (like 5 page paper that counts for half your grade at the end of the semester) does not motivate me at all.</p>
<p>Furthermore things like stimulants, the most common way of treating ADHD, allows more dopamine (gas) through allowing you to function more normally but is often followed by a crash.</p>
<p>Edit: I just didn't finish before accidentally posting this.</p>
<p>Edit2: granted this does not explain all the symptoms of ADHD but it does explain the primary difficulties that most people are familiar with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An adhd-brain has less dopamine. Dopamine is a molecule that does a lot of things. One thing it does is to make us goal-driven and focused. Dopamine also makes us feel good; sex, eating, drugs, gambling and generally, just accomplishing stuff increases dopamine.</p>
<p>How is this decrease in dopamine connected to the behavior of adhd? People with adhd will go very far to increase their dopamine levels compared to a &quot;normal&quot; person. This is where the impulsivity of adhd becomes apparent: It's a condition which makes it much harder for the individual to regulate their behavior. Drug abuse is very common. Criminality is very common. We know about 25% prisoners have ADHD, and scientists predict the real number is closer to 40%.</p>
<p>If you wanna get more brainy, I recommend reading about how ADHD affects the development of the pre-frontal cortex. Hopefully someone here is better geared than me to make an ELI5 explanation of how the pre-frontal cortex is essential to understand ADHD. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/19621976/" target="_blank">This</a> is a quite simple explanation, but perhaps not ELI5:
&quot;the PFC is critical for regulating attention based on relevance (i.e. its meaning). The PFC is important for screening distractions, sustaining attention and shifting/dividing attention in a task-appropriate manner. The PFC is critical for regulating behaviour/emotion, especially for inhibiting inappropriate emotions, impulses and habits. The PFC is needed for allocating/planning to achieve goals and organizing behaviour/thought. These regulatory abilities are often referred to as executive functions. In humans, the right hemisphere of the PFC is important for regulating distractions, inappropriate behaviour and emotional responses. Imaging studies of patients with ADHD indicate that these regions are underactive with weakened connections to other parts of the brain.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most answers here are talking about lack of dopamine as a settled reason for the cause of ADHD - it isn't.</p>
<p>Such an answer conflates a scientifically proven treatment for the disease with a theory on it's cause - these are two different things and only the former is known to be true.  Put differently, a lack of dopamine is not proven to be the cause even though increasing dopamine can help. </p>
<p>This confusion is similar to the serotonin hypothesis for depression which similarly isn't standing up to scrutiny as a simple lack = causation.</p>
<p>The real answer is there are a lot of theories and treatments but we don't clearly know the cause.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
