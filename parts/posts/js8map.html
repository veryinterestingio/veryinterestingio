		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sinus problems are caused by the level of air pressure inside your sinuses being different from the air pressure outside. When the temperature changes outside the air pressure also changes as they are directly related. </p>
<p>The pain from you sinuses is the air pressure inside your head not be equal to the outside air pressure. In periods of stable weather or gradual change you won't ever notice this. Things that affect the outside air pressure drastically can out pace the bodies ability to equalize. Particularly changes in altitude (like driving through mountains) and big swings in the weather.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To those who also suffer from chronic sinus issues, it is worth noting that staying hydrated can help prevent and relieve these symptoms dramatically. I was in the migraine camp for a long time until when I met my Wife (who is an RN) asked how much water I drink everyday. My answer was a glass or two and coffee and other useless stuff. I started drinking 2 glasses when I woke up, 2 before bed, and I tried to squeeze 2 in every couple hours. This week when it went from 30-70 in Western New York, I would normally be debilitated, I only had one day of minor sinus issues. Not saying this will work for everybody, but it's worked for me! Good luck all, the pain is real.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a resident of the south east USA, I say we can get all 4 seasons in a week but annual pollen seasons are the main culprit.</p>
<p>Since the southeast is basically a forest, there is so much pollen in the air it will cause sinus issues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
