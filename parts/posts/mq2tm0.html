		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is common behavior among prey animals in general, especially small ones. Many predators--ourselves included!--see movement more easily than anything else. This is especially true for predators with less color vision than we have. Prey animals have evolved to freeze when threatened so that predators overlook them.</p>
<p>The thing is, animals can't always tell what is and isn't a threat. And it's all right to freeze when there's actually no danger, but not great if you <em>don't</em> freeze when there <em>is.</em> So rodents and other small mammals are constantly on alert, and anything that catches their attention as a potential threat is a reason to freeze momentarily while they check to see if it was actually something that might eat them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
