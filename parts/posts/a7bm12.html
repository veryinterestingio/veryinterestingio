		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've always heard about water specifically being incompressible, eg water hammer. Are all liquids incompressible or is there something specific about water? Are there any compressible liquids? Or is it that liquid is an state of matter that is incompressible and if it is compressible then it's a gas? I could imagine there is a point that you can't compress a gas any further, does that correspond with a phase change to liquid?</p>
<p>Edit: thank you all for the wonderful answers and input.  Nothing is ever cut and dry (no pun intended) :)</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Liquids are ‘incompressible’ in that they are only slightly compressible.</p>
<p>If we set ‘z’=1 where a fluid density doubles for a doubling of absolute pressure at constant temperature, liquids have a ‘z’ between about 0.001 and 0.05.</p>
<p>Gasses/vapors typically range from 0.4-1.6.</p>
<p>Z is compressibility.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All liquids are compressible. You just need much more pressure for a much smaller effect compared to typical gases.</p>
<p>If you compress a gas enough (and maybe heat it, depending on the gas) you reach the critical point, a point where the difference between gas and liquid disappears. The clear separation of the two phases only exists at &quot;low&quot; temperatures and pressures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a saying in mechanical engineering (and probably other disciplines) that goes &quot;Everything is a spring.&quot;.  Which is true.  /u/mfb- is absolutely right that all liquids are compressible, but it goes a step further.  All solids are compressible too.  Nukes, for example, are triggered by squeezing a solid ball of Plutonium so hard that it fits in half to a third of its normal volume.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work as an engineer running downhole tools on offshore oil rigs, one of the tools I use is called an accelerator, also known as an intensifier.  This tools is used in conjunction with another tool called a jar which is kinda like a big hammer, used when the toolstring gets stuck for whatever reason, to help get it free again.</p>
<p>Anyway, the accelerator is filled with silicone oil which is specifically used for its high compressibility, so when you take a big pull on the toolstring to fire the jar,  the oil inside it basically acts like a big fluid spring increasing the force of the jar hit.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid</a></a>, water is actually compressible, it just wont compress very much. That article actually covers damn near every question you have.</p>
<p>Im having a hard time finding any liquid that is truly incompressible (and from the article I linked, that is more or less a function of it being a liquid and its structure not being rigid).</p>
<p>It appears water is often considered incompressible from a larger scale standpoint because of how resistant to compression it is, and how little it can compress, but it is technically compressible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
