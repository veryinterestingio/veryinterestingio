<p>“Some people are more sensitive to large doses of carbs, which can lead to low blood sugar after a big meal,” says Dixon. “Their bodies can ‘overshoot’ a bit on insulin production in response to a carb-rich meal (especially if the carbs are simple).” The result? Blood glucose can drop too low an hour or so after eating, and this could be why someone wakes up super hungry after eating a big meal right before bed.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I go to bed hungry, mainly because I’m lazy, tired, or uninterested in food, I’ll wake up maybe a little hungry but if I eat a whole pizza before bed I’ll wake up starving.  The glucose comment makes sense.</p>
<p>I tend to fast a lot (mainly from being busy, or just not in the mood to eat I guess) and maybe eat one meal a day most days.  </p>
<p>It’s so difficult to convince anyone trying to diet to try fasting.  The “pain” of being hungry sucks but it goes away and your stomach shrinks.  When I was younger(and I’ve always been kind of skinny) I could physically eat 3x the amount of food I do now in one meal.</p>
<p>Now it feels like even when I’m starving, I get full so fast eating small amounts.  I can still occasionally gorge but it is not pleasant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
