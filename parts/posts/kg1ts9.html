		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All three are chemicals associated with &quot;rewards&quot; or emotional states in the brain. I'm not a neurologist or even a medical professional, but I've looked in to this for my own awareness; if you have specific concerns I'd go to a better source than Reddit. That said, here is my understanding if each of these three (naturally occurring) chemicals and their effects on your brain:</p>
<p>Serotonin: this neurotransmitter is actually mostly found in your gut! It affects your &quot;satiation&quot; - your sense of being full, satisfied, or content. Drugs that target this are SSRIs or SRAs, generally known as &quot;antidepressants&quot; or appetite suppressants which work by making your brain hold on to the serotonin longer or by dumping more into your system. It also has a lot of other uses and effects in your system, which is part of why these kinda of medicines can have lots of unusual side effects on things like sleep, sexual function, jaw clenching, etc. </p>
<p>Endorphins: these are actually hormones your body secretes! They are natural opioids, which means they feel like and behave similarly to addictive narcotics like heroin, morphine, and the like. They make you feel really good, loose, and relaxed - euphoria.  The key to understanding this hormone is that it <em>makes pain go away</em> - your body releases it when you are injured. However, exercise and extreme activity reads as muscle pain to the body, which releases the endorphins that make up a &quot;endorphin rush&quot; or &quot;second wind&quot; when conducting intense physical exercise or stretching after a strenuous activity. It also comes out to play after sex, while listening to music, enjoying really good food, or other kinds of euphoric activities. </p>
<p>Dopamine: Dopamine is the messenger chemical that does a <em>lot</em> of different things depending on how and where it's used. Think of it as emails that tissues send each other - generally, &quot;good job&quot; or &quot;reward&quot; messages for a particular activity or behavior. Since no individual part of our bodies is actually terribly smart, we just know what we're doing when dopamine arrives, and associate that with &quot;good job!&quot;  This is usually quite good for forming habits. Not all habits are good, however - this mechanism releases rewards for solving puzzles, but also for consuming cocaine or hurting yourself to get an endorphin push, for example. It's like scratching that perfect itch or perfectly accomplishing a difficult task. </p>
<p>So, in short: serotonin is about feeling satisfied, full, or content. Endorphins make pain go away, and therefore make you feel &quot;euphoric.&quot; Dopamine makes you feel rewarded, and can be used to regulate endorphins or otherwise form behaviors by triggering a &quot;yes, do that!&quot; reflex.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are all different and all work in different brain areas and overlapping functions as well.</p>
<p>ELI5 answer</p>
<p>Serotonin stops you overthinking bad thoughts by calming down the multiple brain areas. It can stop you getting stuck in cycles of bad thoughts.</p>
<p>Dopamine gives you motivation/energy/enthuisiasm and makes you feel good when something happens you like.</p>
<p>Endorphins reduce pain and can also give good feelings.</p>
<p>Ask if you need more detail, but some people have expanded on these in other comments</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR; no one really knows and there is reason to believe all are interconnected to one another in regards to function but again, no one really knows how because the mechanisms at play are complicated. People should not use them interchangeably or, at least, be very conservative with their use in day to day language especially when referring to mental health because misunderstandings can lead to irresponsible self-medication. </p>
<p>Disclaimer: Rookie neuroscientist here so my knowledge on all three molecules are limited to theories about them as neurotransmitters or in the case of endorphins, hormones that function like neurotransmitters in the brain. </p>
<p>The main difference is that serotonin and dopamine are catecholamines while endorphins are hormones. As far as function goes no one has a definite answer just yet. All three may play a part in &quot;happiness&quot; however the functions of each are thought to differ in different areas of the body and brain for example, dopamine may regulate sleep, and sleep affects moods like happiness, however dopamine also regulates expectations so dopamine also plays a part in anger or disappointment i.e. release of dopamine when you are happy or have feelings of well-being, but dopamine is also released when you are disappointed because you expected something that didn't happen based on previous experience. </p>
<p>The answer is we don't know, but here are general and widely accepted views:</p>
<p>Serotonin = stress, well-being, and emotions. Too little = depression, too much = anxiety</p>
<p>Dopamine = reward, inattention, and motor function but may also play a part in stress and expectations. Too little = inattention, inability to plan, inability to make goal-directed decisions, decreased motor function, too much = inattention, inattention, inability to plan, inability to make goal-directed decisions, decreased motor function. </p>
<p>Endorphins = stress, pain, analgesic, too little = depression and pain, too much = depression, sexual dysfunction. </p>
<p>Often times not a lot of people use them properly. Most definitions or theories regarding their function you hear today are from 50 years ago and there has been a lot discovered about their role in different systems since then. </p>
<p>It would be nearly impossible to sum all of it up here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are not &quot;happy chemicals&quot;. It's a big misunderstanding people have of neurotransmitters and signals - they do not do one thing.  For example, just the wikipedia intro description of serotonin: &quot;modulating mood, cognition, reward, learning, memory, and numerous physiological processes such as vomiting and vasoconstriction. &quot;</p>
<p>The difference between them is they do different things. There are different neurons in the body that use them in different ways. The specifics... well, I could research and write a few pages on the effects and neural pathways of each one, but it wouldn't be that interesting, and anything shorter wouldn't tell anything like the real story.  More of any one doesn't necessarily make you happier, just triggering the activation of certain pathways that might happen to use them does.</p>
<p>One of the interesting ones to me is dopamine, specifically in regards to Parkinson's. One of the main sets of dopaminergic neurons are in the substantia nigra (SN for short), a tiny bundle of neurons in the back of the brain that sends a kind of &quot;pacemaker&quot; pulse to the parts of your brain that regulate movement. Basically, these neurons are constantly giving a little &quot;boop&quot; signal to the neurons that will tell your arm to move (or any other movement). Then, when another part of your brain says &quot;arm, move now!&quot;, the neurons are already close to threshold and your arm moves. When you're asleep, these SN neurons stop firing, so when your dreaming brain tells your arm to move, it doesn't pass the threshold to move your arm.</p>
<p>In Parkinson's, the SN neurons die (for reasons, not important now). So it becomes harder to will yourself to move, hence the paralysis and shaking. Of course, the treatment, L-dopa, is basically just taking a form of dopamine that goes everywhere in your brain, basically triggering these movement neurons a bit in the absence of the SN neurons. This can lead to a lot of swaying and uncontrolled movement, as suddenly the threshold for movement is really low, but it can also lead to schizophrenia. Why? Another, completely separate part of your brain, responsible for hearing and seeing, ALSO has a similar system, where it tells your brain you heard or saw something, but it has to pass a threshold, also run by dopaminergic neurons. So now you see and hear things that aren't necessarily there.</p>
<p>Oh, and taking L-DOPA also leads to side effects like excess libido (since dopamine is also involved in sexual satisfaction pathways), as well as things like hypotension, anxiety, nausea, arrythmias, etc. etc. etc.</p>
<p>Because we only have 7 main neurotransmitters, and they run our brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. If 3 of them did &quot;happy things&quot; and nothing else, you'd run out of neurotransmitters well before you got to the neurotransmitter that let your arm move. Or made your heart beat. Or helped you learn, hear, understand writing, and so forth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several comments outline the difference between said neurotransmitters and hormones, but it might be helpful to understand the legacy of our understanding of brain chemistry.
As several people have mentioned, we don't really know what is going on in an active brain on a chemical level. The discovery of neurotransmitters is a perfect example of where we stand, see <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/chnt1.html#:~:text=Discovery%20of%20Neurotransmitters,that%20was%20filled%20with%20saline" target="_blank">http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/chnt1.html#:~:text=Discovery%20of%20Neurotransmitters,that%20was%20filled%20with%20saline</a>.
We are only beginning to to understand the organs outside of your skull that play a part, like opioid receptors in the digestive system.
It's exciting when you realize how much more we have to learn, but important to remember we are really fumbling in the dark hoping to find something.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
