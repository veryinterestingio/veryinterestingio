		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During sex, bacteria get pushed into the urethra (tube from bladder to surface) by the motion. Peeing helps flush them out. It’s more important for women because they a) have short urethras and are thus more prone to UTI’s and b) are more likely to have bacteria remaining in the urethra because of the anatomy of where the urethra is and because men flush it out a little with ejaculation. That being said, men also can get UTIs from sex so peeing is good both ways. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The efficacy of this act is not an absolute scientific certainty, but it doesn’t hurt to make it a regular habit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m a microbiologist that has worked on UTI-causing bacteria, and after reading through the comments I’m just going to add a few quick points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Clinical studies have shown that women who urinate after sex do not have a lower rate of UTI compared to women that don’t. Can’t hurt though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once UTI-causing bacteria have adhered onto the wall of your urethra, urinating won’t remove them.</p>
</li>
<li>Urine is not sterile, and the bladder has its own microbiota. In comparison to the gut, the concentration of bacteria in the bladder is pretty low, and they’re often hard to grow in the lab, which is why it was thought to be sterile in the first place.</li>
