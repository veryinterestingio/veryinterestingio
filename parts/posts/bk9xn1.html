<p>It can be pretty difficult to tell, but we think that a few percent of stellar systems are triple. Since 3-body systems are generally unstable, they only last for significant times if two of the stars are close together, with one far away (think Earth-Moon-Sun)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, in fact our nearest stellar neighbor Alpha Centauri is a trinary system. But gets even crazier. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_Scorpii" target="_blank">Nu Scorpii</a> is actually a septenary star system with 7 stars. </p>
<p>You should know that pretty much any n-body system with n&gt;2 is unstable. There are only a handfull known stable orbits for 3 stars to orbit each other in a stable configuration. None of these orbits would realistically occur in our universe. But what is possible is that you have 2 stars orbiting each other very closely and one star orbiting the other two stars from far away. That way it is approximately a 2 body system when the distance between body A and B is much smaller than the distance of A and B to body C.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, our closest cosmological neighbor is a trinary system called Alpha Centauri which is located a little more than four light years away. </p>
<p>Polaris (North Star) is also a trinary system </p>
<p>Gliese 667 is another example located in the constellation Scorpio. Which is composed of two K-type main sequences stars and a red dwarf where the potential habitatal super earth GlieseCc resides. The planet is most likely tidelocked with the red dwarf, but you could see a sunrise of the other two stars once a year (28 Earth days) there. </p>
<p>There are also star systems with 4, 5, 6 and even up to 7 stars in a system. Though there are two found systems containing 7 stars. One being Nu Scorpii (in Scorpio) and which is basically a trinary system and quintary system orbiting each other harmoniously. </p>
<p>They other septuple system being is AR Cassiopeiae</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes in fact, if memory serves, the Centauri system is trinary, with Alpha and Beta fairly close to each other, and Proxima orbiting them much farther out.</p>
<p>Most trinaries are going to be similar to that in setup, with two of the stars orbiting each other closely, and the third orbiting so far out that it's orbiting the center of mass of the other two.</p>
<p>Edit: it's Alpha Centauri A and B which are orbited by Proxima Centauri, not Alpha and Beta Centauri.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
