		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people in here talking about value, and what they're saying is true.</p>
<p>But a lot of the impacts of a recession are not about value, but about the velocity of money, and economic activity, and that disappearing.</p>
<p>You have $50. So you go and spend that $50 at the local barber. That barber goes to spend that $50 on a few bottles of wine from the local winery. And the vintner spends that $50 on groceries. And the grocer puts that money into savings because he's looking to buy a house.</p>
<p>That $50 creates $150 of economic activity (ie. our GDP = $150), and the velocity of money is 3.</p>
<p>But you are in shut down, and you google how to cut your hair yourself. You spend the money instead on groceries, and the grocer puts it into savings. The $50 is still the same $50. It never disappeared, but the velocity of money is only 1 this time. It's only created $50 on economic activity, our GDP is only $50.</p>
<p>This is an overly simplified example, but illustrates that how quickly we spend money actually has an impact on our GDP. The money never really disappears, it's just the economic activity it enables goes away.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I'm not going to say thank you for the gold because /u/SrGrafo <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/comics/comments/fob6ed/reddit_gold/" target="_blank">told me not to</a>. But if anybody wants to read up more about the history of money they should <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2714607-the-ascent-of-money" target="_blank">read</a> or <a href="https://www.pbs.org/show/ascent-of-money/" target="_blank">watch</a> the Ascent of Money but Neill Fergusson, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCQEbqDL8i40d83Au55lYMQ" target="_blank">Jacob Clifford on youtube</a>; or listen to the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/" target="_blank">Planet Money podcast</a>. These are all very accessible ways of learning more about economic concepts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, a recession doesn’t necessarily mean a lack of money. Sometimes, it’s just the lack of spending and liquidity. </p>
<p>When people are afraid, have low confidence in the economy, or are quarantined in their homes they tend to spend less money. The lack of spending decreases demand and lowers the profits for businesses. People start taking money out of banks, stocks, and other assets because they want cash on hand “just in case”. Businesses have a harder time getting  loans and are less likely to take risks. These things all interact with each other in a vicious cycle that essentially stagnates the economy. </p>
<p>What this looks like from the outside is high unemployment, low stock value, people spending less, businesses spending less, and just a lack of growth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It absolutely <em>can</em> disappear.  </p>
<p>Let's say you bought an apple for $1. Then one day Celebrity Doctor Dingus announced that apples cure cancer and your apple is suddenly worth $100.  You could make $99 profit! But you don't sell because you think the price will go higher.  Then the next day literally every other doctor on the planet says &quot;Celebrity Doctor Dingus is a dingus and an idiot&quot; and suddenly apples are worth $.50, you've lost $.50!</p>
<p>In the span of these two hypothetical days your apple has been worth everything from $.50 to $100.  But none of those numbers were real because you never sold.  It is the same basic idea as when a reporter says that the stock market lost $100,000,000,000.  Some of that might be actual money, but most of it is just the theoretical money that could have been made if people sold.  </p>
<p>So in summary - the money never existed so it does just disappear into thin air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>WEALTH disappears. MONEY stays around but stops moving.  Money is only a small fraction of the economy's net wealth.  Personal wealth is usually a small amount of real money in the bank and a much larger portfolio of stock and real estate.</p>
<p>Stock and real estate lose value.  That is a loss of wealth.  You may have had &quot;a billion dollar company&quot; that folded, but it never had a billion dollars on hand.  Its long-term income valuation said it was worth that much but due to economic collapse, that never happened.  Billions of dollars in wealth exist as stock value and real estate value etc and that disappear into nothingness at any time.</p>
<p>The money stops circulating, that's part of the problem of recession.  Banks do not want to issue mortgages to people with no jobs.  New businesses cannot get loans.  </p>
<p>Money breaks down into several definitions: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply#Empirical_measures_in_the_United_States_Federal_Reserve_System" target="_blank">M0 MB  M1  M2  M3  MZM</a></p>
<p>Some can disappear, some cannot.  You deposit $10K in the bank, they issue a mortgage and someone buys a house with it and a seller puts that $10K in his pocket.  Well now you have $10K bank balance on paper and someone is walking around with $10K in banknotes in his pocket.  The M2 supply is now $20K.</p>
<p>In prior times, before FDIC insurance, it was possible for the bank to go bust and you lose your $10K bank balance and that money would just disappear.  That one is not really possible now.</p>
<p>But now, you have a $200K mortgage on a house that was previously worth $300K but now you could sell for only $100K, your $200K stock portfolio is worth $50K, but your $20K cash balance in the bank is still a real $20K.  You have essentially lost everything, because money is only a small fraction of the total wealth.</p>
<p>You no longer have assets to sell, your wealth is gone.  You've still got $20K in cash and $50K in stock and a $100K house, but overall worth is -$30K, and I presume you lost your job.  Once the $20K runs out, you will be foreclosed on.</p>
<p>You'd think this is just inflation.  The farmer who wanted $1 for a dozen eggs will now sell two dozen for $1, and his chicken feed vendor is also desperate and $1 will buy twice as much chicken feed.    This should be acceptable to the chicken feed vendor as he can live off half-price eggs (and other half price things).  But the $100K mortgage the farmer has does NOT become a $50K mortgage.  He can no longer make payments and is foreclosed upon.  The bank wants that farm, because in 10 yrs after recovery it will be very valuable.  They will wait, the land unused or rented for whatever temporary use they can get.  The chicken farmer cannot produce eggs and is homeless.  The chicken feed vendor has no customer and similarly loses his home.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
