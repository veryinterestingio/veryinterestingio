		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of old games are hard-coded to expect a certain processor speed.  The old console had so many updates per second and the software is using that timer to control the speed of the game.</p>
<p>When that software is emulated that causes a problem - modern processors are a hundred times faster and will update (and play) the game 100x faster.</p>
<p>So the emulation community has two options: </p>
<p>1) completely redo the game code to accept any random update rate from a lightning-fast modern CPU</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>2) artificiality limit the core emulation software to the original update speed of the console</p>
<p>Usually they go with option 2, which preserves the original code but also &quot;preserves&quot; any slowdowns or oddities caused by the limited resources of the original hardware.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of it is how accurately you want to emulate. Take the game Space Invaders. You may recall there's many enemies and as you kill them they speed up. That was not coded in, it was a happy side effect of the processor being able to render fewer faster (and one super fast lol). If the emulator is not coded to run at the same speed as the old processor then you won't get this effect.</p>
<p>Edit: I didn't learn this from Game Maker's Toolkit, never heard of that show.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The games are not emulated, the systems are.</p>
<p>A chip has instructions on it, that can not be changed.  Software has instructions that can be changed.</p>
<p>What this means, is that an emulator &quot;emulates&quot; the system, not the game.  That includes clock frequency.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Accuracy of emulation. If the original hardware would have done it, your emulator should do it. Simulating hardware means reproducing all the features as well as all the limitations.</p>
<p>Some emulators have an option to overclock the emulated CPU or raise the sprite limit, but there are risks if the game isn't prepared for it. Behaviour of not running on the original hardware is undefined and you are in uncharted territory for the developers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly a super old game, but</p>
<p>Age of Mythology was made when computers only had one core, when they re released it on steam it had massive lag and gameplay issues and no amount of computing power really helped because the game could only be run through one of the computers cores.</p>
<p>What they needed to do was build it up from a bit further back so that the game couldn't utilise the newer computing power.</p>
<p>Could be totally wrong on this, as this is just what other community members have told me and I have no idea what I'm talking about haha</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
