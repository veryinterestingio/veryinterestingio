<p>For instance Cock comes from the Old English 'cocc' which meant a male bird.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Would you believe that it has nothing to do with what you're thinking of?</p>
<p>Too bad, they're entirely unrelated.</p>
<p>Tits come from a Scandinavian or Germanic word meaning 'small', from which we also derive the modern word 'tidbit'.</p>
<p>Boob and boobie, long before having anything to do with breasts, was slang for a stupid person, from the Spanish slang 'bobo'. Boobies got their name from that same slang, because they were stupid enough to land on ships right in front of hungry sailors.</p>
<p>As for cocks... yeah, you got me, that one is actually connected, but it meant rooster long before it meant dick.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cockrill's became associated with masculinity because of the way they strut around and the fact one Cockrill generally mates with lots of females in captivity. So a cock became a slang term for a masculine man, and it didn't take long for it to just mean penis. </p>
<p>Boobs and tits are really just a corrupted version of breasts and teats.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
