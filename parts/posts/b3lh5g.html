		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the stations don’t interfere with each other. 101.3 and 101.1 can be 2 separate stations but it would overlap with 101.2. </p>
<p>If you have the capability you can hear this happen if the station you want is 101.1 and you tune to 101.2 you can still hear a bit of the 101.1 through the static.</p>
<p>Why the numbers are odd and not even is arbitrary and chosen by the FCC. But they all remain odd because the FCC chose odd and they need to be .2 apart</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The bandwidth of a FM radio signal is 200kHz or 0.2Mhz.  In the US the frequency band for FM radio is 88-108Mhz so the first is 88-88.2 Mhz. The name of the channels is for the center frequency of the rang so for 88-88.2 Mhz the center is 88.1Mhz. The next channel have a center frequency 0.2Mhz higher so all channels have a odd decimal digits.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The channels also have a channel number and 88.1 id change 201 but the are seldom used outside the FCC</p>
<p>Commercial radio the range is 92.0 to 108 MHz</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>How the spectrum is distributed depend on the country and even decimal digit are used. I can for example pick up 7 odd and 6 even decimal FM station from my desk in Sweden</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT: mixed upp the start ad 80 instead of 88 for some dum reason.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some good answers but no one has mentioned yet that FM means &quot;Frequency Modulation&quot;.  The signal is sent by encoding the sound in variations in the frequency.  So a signal is not sent on one specific frequency, it's a range of frequencies centered on, for example, 100.3Mhz.  The stations have to be a certain distance apart on the spectrum to not overlap each other, and 0.2Mhz is the separation that works for FM radio.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If stations are close to each other, they will interfere. </p>
<p>The rest of my answer is specific to Melbourne, Australia (which given the frequencies you listed is probably where you are from too)</p>
<p>The regulators here decided to make them all 0.3 more than a multiple of 0.8</p>
<p>This is an arbitrary choice. The 0.8 is to leave enough of a gap between that they don't interfere (lower would probably work too as long as it was at least 0.4).</p>
<p>The 0.3 was an arbitrary decision but stops any of the stations having much 'better' numbers than the others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This is a screenshot of SDR#, a software to receive all kinds of radio broadcasts.What you can see in the screenshot are multiple FM radio stations.</p>
<p>Each peak is a station, with the highlighted one at 95.5 MHz.</p>
<p>The highlighting around the station is 240kHz wide, so basically 0.24 MHz.If you had a station at 100.3 and 100.4 MHz, they would interfere, because they are both wider than a 100 kHz step...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
