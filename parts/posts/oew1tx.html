<p>More broadly, specific heat capacity is defined by several intramolecular factors that confound thermal expansion too much to draw any correlation across different types of materials.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The phrasing of your question (&quot;heated to the point where it physically grows&quot;) makes it seem as though you think that the hypothetical cube of metal will suddenly increase in volume when it reaches a certain temperature. Just to be clear: this is not the case. The cube would gradually expand as its temperature increases. It's a continuous process. In fact, this is how most non-electronic thermometers work: the thermal expansion of a material is used as an indicator of temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This property, itself often temperature dependent, is measured in °C^-1 or °F^-1 , and is either volumetric or linear, either giving the % increase in volume or length due to temperature change. It is used a lot in engineering where temperature is a consideration.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
