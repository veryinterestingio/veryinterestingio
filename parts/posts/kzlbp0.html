		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Salt is used as a universal flavor improver because at low concentrations it will reduce bitterness, but increase sweet, sour and umami, which is desirable for sweet recipes. But at higher concentrations it suppresses sweetness and enhances umami, which is good for savoury things. It’s also easily obtained in a pure form without any interfering flavors.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's what I learned from a big science article.</p>
<p>We don't understand all the reasons why salt enhances taste, but we have a few theories, one of which is basically proven. The most proven one is this:</p>
<p>Salt decreases bitterness. Salt is made of sodium and chlorine, which can readily dissolve into sodium ions and chlorine ions in water. Taste buds detect different flavors by binding to food molecules, and different taste buds detect different flavors. (Turns out this isn't true. See final edit.) For example, there is a type of taste bud that senses bitterness. Sodium ions are able to bind to the parts of the food molecules that would connect to your bitter taste buds. This stops those bitter food molecules from binding to your taste buds, which stops you from tasting them. That's why recipes for sweets usually call for a little salt. You only need to add enough salt to saturate all the bitter molecules. If you add more than that, you'll just make the food taste saltier.</p>
<p>The less proven theories are these:</p>
<p>Salt may make liquids feel thicker by stimulating mechanical sensors in our tongue and mouth.</p>
<p>Salt may decrease a property of food called &quot;water activity.&quot; Many foods contain flavor molecules mixed in liquid water. Water has a property called &quot;partial vapor pressure&quot;. Higher pressures effectively distance flavorful molecules, making them less dense. There's no way to ELI5 here, but think of a balloon. Air at higher pressure will expand the balloon to a larger volume. Larger volume means lower density. Thus, higher water activity (partial vapor pressure) means the flavors in a food will be less dense, and therefore less flavorful. Partial vapor pressure is equivalent to the pressure of a liquid at a given temperature times the amount of that liquid in the volume (measured in % moles, molarity). But when salt is dissolved in water, its ions interact with water molecules, removing them from that equation. Thus, the partial vapor pressure drops, and the density of the flavor molecules increases, enhancing flavor. For a reason the article did not explain, this also has the effect of increasing the &quot;volatility&quot; of those flavor molecules. Volatility &quot;describes how easily a substance will vaporize.&quot; Basically, it turns some of those flavor molecules into a gas, which allows them to enter your nose and be smelled, further enhancing the overall flavor.</p>

<p>Edit - Some edits, because I didn't know things I really ought to.</p>
<p>Edit - Thanks for the Silver!!!</p>
<p>Edit - Turns out I was wrong about different taste buds responding to different flavors. All taste buds can taste all flavors. The idea that different parts of the tongue respond to different chemicals is an outdated myth that I learned in school and so took for granted when I was writing my post. Thank you to u/stefek132 for pointing this out!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's my theory. Nerve cells work by a electrical current being propagated by the movement of charged ions across the cell membrane. A salty environment provides plentiful sodium and chloride ions to help propagate nerve impulses. Taste cells are connected to sensory nerve cells. In the presence of high concentrations of sodium and chloride ions, they are at maximal excitability, therefore amplifying the neuronal response to a taste cell activation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I hope I’m paraphrasing Alton Brown correctly.</p>
<p>I think that salt is supposed to basically open up your taste receptors. This will naturally enhance the flavor of what your eating, even something sweet. </p>
<p>A little bit of salt will enhance sweet flavors rather than make your dessert taste salty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
