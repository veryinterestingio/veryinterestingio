		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>3.9 billion years of evolution friend. The human brain is an amazing feat of evolution one sure thing it does without question is reacts to our environment. Humans may be the #1 predator on earth today but we evolved from animals that would’ve been a tasty treat on the menu. So when you’re comfortable in your environment you immediately become okay with being vulnerable, relieving yourself makes you vulnerable to a predator so if you need to but feel like you can’t you’re in a state of stress. When we realize we can be vulnerable in our environment your brain switches from fight or flight to normal. You know your house is the safest place you can be so your normal urges such as relieving yourself come into the forefront of your thinking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe it has to do with the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. One is fight or flight when you're active and running around doing errands or exercising or your Adrenalin or anxiety is up your digestion is down. They are opposing systems so when you're home and comfortable the other takes over and you're relaxed enough for digestion</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is formed out of your habit loop, which is cue &gt; routine &gt; reward. When you’re at home your cue is the need to pee, your routine is going to the toilet and the reward is an empty bladder. </p>
<p>Because you’ve done this at home a million times your brain has stored this habit loop in the basal ganglia and it kicks in automatically. </p>
<p>But you were out, activating other habits such as your errands, so the cue to use the toilet goes further back in the queue of habit loop autonomy. When you got home again and saw familiarity the basal ganglia activated the need to pee.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
