		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are right in observing Venus does not have an intrinsic magnetic field. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11214-017-0362-8" target="_blank">However, solar winds interacting in Venus's upper atmosphere ionize particles</a> (an ionosphere). This ionosphere induces an external magnetic field around Venus which acts similarly to planets with magnetic fields and excludes solar winds. <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/336/6081/567" target="_blank">Zhang et al.</a> also provide evidence that Venus's externally induced magnetic field reconnects, which was previously thought not to occur. </p>
<p>Despite this, Venus still does experience some atmospheric loss due to solar wind pressures. Perhaps there is some geological process that replenishes Venus's atmosphere, but this is outside the scope of my study so I will refrain from speculating more on it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's a great question and actually central to my own research. Mars is often considered to have lost its atmosphere due to the absence of an internal magnetic field, presumably allowing the solar wind to strip the planet's atmosphere over the age of the planet. So why does Venus still retain 92 bars of atmosphere? Well, the rate of solar wind driven atmospheric escape as measured by our orbiters is about the same for both Venus and Mars, and really slow, on the order of about 0.1-0.5 kg/s. </p>

<p>Both planets lack internal magnetic fields that would otherwise generate an Earth-like magnetosphere, but they are still both screened from the solar wind by the formation of induced magnetospheres. These induced magnetospheres form due to currents in the upper atmospheres induced by the solar wind's magnetic field, and they appear to be very efficient in protecting the bulk of the planetary atmospheres from the solar wind. </p>

<p>In addition, Venus' gravity is too strong for other non-solar wind related escape processes to be active.</p>
<p>Edit: /u/ResidentGift and /u/galendiettinger asked about how Mars, and not Venus, could have lost atmosphere without solar wind driven escape. The answers are somewhat buried, so I'll copy the permalinks here:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Venus' atmosphere is largely carbon dioxide, which is a rather heavy molecule for a gas. This makes it easier for Venus to hold onto it with just it's gravity compared to other gasses like nitrogen or water vapour since it takes more energy for it to escape. Also, Venus's surface is only \~500 million years old due to a probable planet wide resurfacing event which would have had a dramatic effect on the atmosphere and most of the gasses released would still be in the atmosphere today. It could be that Venus looked much different prior to that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I notice comments saying Venus has a very weak magnetic field, yet is similar in mass to Earth.</p>
<p>This begs the question - given similar(ish) composition and mass, why hasn't Venus got a stronger magnetic field?</p>
<p>Is it the lack of plate tectonics or has the core solidified already?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gravity, that and the atmosphere is 96% carbon dioxide. </p>
<p>Carbon dioxide is heavy so it is harder for it to reach escape velocity. Escape velocity is the speed something needs to go to leave a planet.
Lighter elements like Hydrogen, Helium and Nitrogen are light and can be accelerated by the solar wind up to the speed necessary to leave Venus's gravity and so those elements have mostly have left.</p>
<p>The carbon dioxide still does get stripped off, it's just that carbon dioxide takes a lot longer to accelerate, so the process is slower. Venus also has very similar gravity to Earth at about 90% whereas a planet like Mars that has lost most of its atmosphere has about 40% of Earth's gravity.</p>
<p>You can also see that with Mars even though the atmosphere is mostly gone what's left is mainly the heavier CO2. The process to lose the atmosphere is slow, taking millions of years, and Venus has a lot of atmosphere to lose being more the twice as massive as Mars.</p>
<p>The magnetic field of Earth's doesn't completely stop the process either but it does help a lot, especially to hold onto the lighter elements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
