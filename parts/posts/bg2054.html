		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Reddit!! Marine energy is a huge, largely untapped energy resource. So huge that more than 10% of Pacific states' electricity demand could be satisfied by developing a fraction of the wave energy available off the West coast.</p>
<p>Imagine a future where we could harness ALL of our oceans' energy, including energy from moving water, like waves, currents, tides, and offshore winds. Renewable energy like this is not only immense, but its predictable nature allows power grid managers to offset more established, yet variable renewable resources such as wind and solar power. And on a regional scale, widespread marine energy has the potential to provide localized power sources in isolated coastal regions and areas susceptible to extreme events, such as hurricanes, flooding, and storm surge.</p>
<p>But are there environmental costs to widespread installation of marine energy devices in our oceans? How does marine life react to these devices? And is this approach safe?</p>
<p>At the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, we are tackling these exact research questions <a href="https://tethys.pnnl.gov/sites/default/files/publications/The%20State%20of%20Knowledge%20Driving%20Consenting%20Permiting%20for%20the%20MRE.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Ask us Anything!</p>
<p>We're looking forward to this! We'll be on at 9 AM PT (12 ET, 16 UT). Ask us anything!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi there! In terms of tidal energy, are there new technologies that will allow for the extraction of significant amounts of energy from a site that doesn't have a high range of tides such as provided by a whole ocean versus something channeled (e.g., the Bay of Fundy)? Are the environmental impacts of those different from these more &quot;traditional&quot; methods?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

How do you tackle the degeneracy of marine energy and produce enough power to be useful while still being cost effective? Dâ€™you think it will ever compete comparably with wind energy in this regard?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
