		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There actually <em>is</em> a name for this type of storm: a <a href="https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/02-met_concepts/02e-shear_at_aerodromes/downslope_windstorms.html" target="_blank">downslope windstorm</a>, where strong winds descend down a mountain slope or other terrain feature. While these storms are uncommon in central Utah (especially events of this severity), they are actually quite common in very specific areas, to the point where there are a number of different names for this type of event in different parts of the world:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Ana_winds" target="_blank">Santa Ana</a> in coastal California</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bora_(wind\)" target="_blank">Bora</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriatic_Sea" target="_blank">Adriatic</a> region</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinook_wind" target="_blank">Chinook</a> in central North America</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foehn_wind" target="_blank">Foehn</a> in the central Alps of Europe</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piteraq" target="_blank">Piteraq</a> in eastern Greenland</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taku#Other_uses" target="_blank">Taku</a> in southeastern Alaska</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on. In some areas of the world these types of winds regularly exceed hurricane force: for example, on the eastern side of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Range" target="_blank">Front Range</a> in Wyoming and Colorado. Particularly favorable due to the geometry of the mountain range is Boulder, Colorado, which <a href="https://psl.noaa.gov/boulder/wind.html" target="_blank">averages several downslope windstorms per year</a> where winds exceed 65 knots (hurricane force: 75 mph or 120 km/h).</p>
<p>Downslope windstorms can be caused by a few different processes, but in this case it was probably the simplest to explain. This downslope wind event was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katabatic_wind" target="_blank">katabatic wind</a>, which occurs when the wind is mostly driven by gravity pulling denser air downwards. The chain of events was that a strong cold front moved south into Wyoming and Colorado while most of Utah remained hot. Cold air is denser than warm air, and so can flow similarly to water in complex terrain, flowing around isolated mountains and pooling in lower valleys. As the cold air approached from the east, it was held up by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasatch_range" target="_blank">Wasatch Range</a> impeding its movement further to the west. Eventually enough cold air and high pressure built up on the eastern side of the mountains that it was able to start flowing over the tops of the mountains, and the combination of the denser air accelerating downwards due to gravity and the higher pressure behind the mountains &quot;pushing&quot; the air westward made for very strong winds flowing down the western slopes of the Wasatch Range.</p>
<p>The reason why this type of storm is not common in the Salt Lake City area is because of how typical weather patterns move in the US: it is quite uncommon for cold air to move in from the east rather than the north or west. The reason this storm was so severe was tied directly to just how strong of a temperature difference there was behind the cold front: in Denver, Colorado, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/t3bQLr3.png" target="_blank">the temperature dropped from 93˚F (34˚C) to 33˚F (1˚C) in less than a day</a>. This combination of factors make it extremely unlikely for such a storm to occur in that area, but nonetheless, it's simple meteorology and physics that drive it, so if the same very unlikely set of circumstances occur again in the future, you can expect to see a similar windstorm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Actually it has happened here every few years or so.  <a href="https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=53029513&amp;itype=CMSID" target="_blank">The last big one was in 2011</a>, but while like tornadoes, they don't happen frequently but every now and then.  <a href="https://www.weather.gov/media/wrh/online_publications/TAs/ta9909.pdf" target="_blank">There's even a National Weather Service case study showing how often they occur</a>.  And unlike tornadoes, we do get pretty good advance forecasts of them coming so people can do some preparations.</p>
<p>Just google &quot;downslope winds Utah history&quot; and you'll find more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
