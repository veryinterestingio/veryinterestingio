		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a fallacy pointing out how &quot;creating jobs&quot; isn't a free ticket into economic growth.</p>
<p>&quot;You know how we could just fix unemployment? Just have half of those people go around breaking windows and getting paid for it, and have the other half work in the window making industry!&quot;</p>
<p>The fallacy is that even though everyone would have a job, no value is being created (because it's being destroyed by the window-breakers).</p>
<p>It's the same message as the joke that goes: A salesman is trying to sell an excavator to a business owner, the owner says: &quot;If one man with an excavator can do as much digging as 50 men with shovels, I'd have to lay off a bunch of people, and this town has too much unemployment as it is.&quot; Then the salesman stops and thinks for a minute, then turns to the owner and says: &quot;Understandable, may I interest you in these spoons instead?&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The broken window fallacy (in reality) is that money spent to repair destruction doesn't represent a net benefit to society (in other words the fallacy would state that destruction provides a net benefit to society)... I will end this with a story pulled from investopedia that explores the idea. The main basis of it comes from the idea that if something is destroyed then money will be spent to replace it... That money spent will then go into circulation and stimulate the economy... However this makes an implication that destroying things will benefit the economy. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Bastiat's tale, a man's son breaks a pane of glass, meaning the man will have to pay to replace it. The onlookers consider the situation and decide that the boy has actually done the community a service because his father will have to pay the glazier (window repair man) to replace the broken pane. The glazier will then presumably spend the extra money on something else, jump-starting the local economy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems all well and good... But using the implications from that alone it would become justifiable to say that people should go around breaking everyones windows in order to stimulate the economy as then the local glaziers would get paid more and as such they would spend more... However if we continue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The onlookers come to believe that breaking windows stimulates the economy, but Bastiat points out that further analysis exposes the fallacy. By breaking the window, the man's son has reduced his father'sÂ disposable income, meaning his father will not be able purchase new shoes or some other luxury good. Thus, the broken window might help the glazier, but at the same time, it robs other industries and reduces the amount being spent on other goods. Moreover, replacing something that has already been purchased is a maintenance cost, rather than a purchase of truly new goods, and maintenance doesn't stimulate production. In short, Bastiat suggests that destruction - and its costs - don't pay in an economic sense.</p>

<p>Edit: for those of you saying to break the windows of the rich or the 1%, no that is not the moral. The anecdote isn't perfect but one of the big conclusions you can get from it is that if the broken window theory were true then it would be beneficial to constantly destroy things to stimulate the economy.... Therefore we should constantly blow up bridges because then a construction company is paid to repair it... But if you don't destroy the bridge you can save the money or spend it on other things, spread the money around... If you save money in a bank then that bank can give out larger loans to people and create more progress, if you have more money (because you aren't constantly paying to repair things) then you might save up and eventually buy things like a house which does more to spread the money around than buying a new window...</p>
<p>The logic behind this isn't perfect either... So I am going to steal (paraphrase) this from one of the replies that is on here (and I will credit the person afterwards): if you are 18 and you have saved up $5000 to go to college, enough for a couple semesters then you can spend that money, get an education (say in engineering) and get (hypothetically) a decent job that will work to stimulate the economy more... However if I come alogng and destroy your car with a baseball bat (break the windows, bust the tail lights) and you now have to pay $2500 to get it repaired then yes in the short term the mechanic that repaired your car did get more money but you are unable to pay for as much of your education which can put you in a detriment and to some extent the local economy in the long run. Beyond that, if everyone starts destroying cars then the mechanic will get rich and will get a lot of money (an uneccesary amount of money) and it might end up leaving circulation thus acting as a detriment to the local economy.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Odd there is another unrelated theory eith a similar name called the broken window theory. It  applied to social situations and expectations of prople in a community with viable damage. That is as a building is abandoned and its windows are broken its seen as ok to do further damage to the building and surrounding ara. Basically seeable damage encourages destructive behavior which snowballs into all sorts o f negative behavior.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a bunch of people on an otherwise deserted island. Every person needs to eat one fish per day, and with no tools, each person catches on average one fish per day. Everyone is fed, but they have to fish every day and can't do anything else.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If one person invents the fishing pole, which enables catching on average two fish per day and takes one day to make, suddenly the islands economy can grow. People can on average fish only every other day, and so they can spend every other day doing something else. The island's economy has grown.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Eventually, a fishing pole will wear out, so the fishing pole maker will need to produce fishing poles to keep the island supplied with fishing poles. Perhaps the surplus of fish is exactly enough to feed the fishing pole maker and let him make fishing poles full time.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now, imagine some other person thinks that &quot;oh look, we have a fishing pole maker and that has made us all better off, why don't we create work so that we can have one more fishing pole maker?&quot; and this person starts breaking fishing poles. At first glance, it might seem like the island is doing better because they now have two fishing pole makers working full time to keep up with wear and tear and the fishing pole breaking person.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But they really aren't. To feed two fishing pole makers, they need twice the population fishing all the time, but the one fishing pole maker can't make enough fishing poles to keep up with wear and tear for twice the population, and the other maker spends his days keeping up with the fishing pole breaker. Eventually, they'll run out of fishing poles and will starve.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
