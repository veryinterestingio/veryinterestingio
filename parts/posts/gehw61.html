		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! I'm Jane McGonigal. I'm the Director of Game Research and Development for the Institute for the Future in Palo Alto, California. I believe game designers are on a humanitarian mission - and my #1 goal in life is to see a game developer win a Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
<p>I've written two New York Times bestselling books: Reality is Broken: Why Games Make Us Better and How They Can Change the World and SuperBetter: The Power of Living Gamefully. I'm also a lifelong game designer (I programmed my first computer game at age 10 - thanks, BASIC!). You might know me from my TED talks on how games can make a better world and the game that can give you 10 extra years of life, which have more than 15 million views.</p>
<p>I'm also the inventor of SuperBetter, a game that has helped more than a million players tackle real-life health challenges such as depression, anxiety, chronic pain, and traumatic brain injury. SuperBetter's effectiveness in treating depression and concussion recovery has been validated in clinical trial and randomized controlled studies. It's currently used by professional athletes, children's hospitals, substance recovery clinics and campus health centers worldwide. Since 2018, the SuperBetter app has been evaluated independently in multiple peer-reviewed scientific articles as the most effective app currently in the app store for treating depression and anxiety, and chronic pain, and for having the best evidence-based design for health behavior change.   </p>
