		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was watching a video recently, and it talked about how a certain cultivar of bananas, gros micheal, was basically wiped off the face of the earth. And how the current popular cultivar, cavendish, is now being hit by the same disease.</p>
<p>The fact that we invaded honduras 7 times for bananas and coined the term banana republic for love of the fruit, yet we don't have a solution for this banana plague that is obliterating them from the face of the earth boggles my mind. I assume there is a good reason for this? A reason we can't give a tree a shot or inoculate a grain against blight?</p></div></div>

<p>Speaking generally, &quot;vaccination&quot; mechanisms for plants are inherently difficult to design because many of the conceptual features we're used to simply don't exist in plants.  There's no mobility in a plant's immune system.  There's no &quot;blood&quot; or any form of macrophages.  There may be cell-to-cell chemical signaling that might convince nearby cells to pull their equivalent of a drawbridge up, but nothing will ever come to the rescue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Plant pathogens employ diverse strategies to attack plants and impair plant growth and reproduction. Unlike vertebrates, plants lack mobile immune cells and an adaptive immune system. Plants mainly rely on two interconnected tiers of the innate immune system to perceive and respond to pathogen infections (Fig. 1; Jones &amp; Dangl, 2006; Boller &amp; Felix, 2009; Thomma et al., 2011; Spoel &amp; Dong, 2012). One uses cell surface pattern‐recognition receptors (PRRs) to recognize microbe‐associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) present in a large group of microbes and host‐derived damage‐associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) (Boller &amp; Felix, 2009). The other uses disease resistance (R) proteins to respond to effector molecules that are secreted by pathogens to help establish successful infections and suppress plant immunity (Upson et al., 2018).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking <em>pragmatically</em> - the effort to develop a vaccine would be indistinguishable from creating a new strain of banana resistant to the virus.  How would you actually inoculate a plant here?  The answer is to grow a new one.  </p>
<p>If it were possible to create your own sort virus that &quot;beats it to the punch&quot; and messes with the pathogen's ability to infect, you still have a huge deployment problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely on topic, but for what it's worth, Gros Michel wasn't even <em>close</em> to wiped off the face of the Earth. It's no longer suitable for being the primary global cultivar, but the Cavendish only replaced it in the Americas and most of Eurasia. It's still the primary cultivar in many countries, including the Philippines and Japan, and from what I recall it's incredibly popular in Oceania.</p>
<p>You can literally import Gros Michel bananas to the US at a number of online stores; it's spendy, but if you have $50-100 to spend you can get a bunch shipped right to you.</p>
<p>(Also to get ahead of this, it wasn't the basis for the flavor of artificial banana. That's just banana oil, which is in every cultivar of bananas. The reason artificial banana doesn't taste like banana is because banana oil is just the <em>primary</em> ester out of dozens, and the easiest to synthesize.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
