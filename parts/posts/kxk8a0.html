		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Take a close look at all the slight variations in way the RNA mutates over time (note: usually they make artificial DNA from the RNA because it's more stable). If two different cases share almost all the same mutations then they're probably closely related. when you look at the small differences between four or five you can begin track backwards which was the oldest in the banching tree of similarities and differences - and which are &quot;cousins&quot; and which have closer &quot;parent/child&quot; relationships.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They will mostly use a type of analysis called phylodynamics to measure evolution. There are lots of methods to use for the analysis. Phylodynamics can estimate at what point different lineages of viruses split off. So they'll be compiling human samples as well as samples from animals, sequencing them, and then running the analysis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
