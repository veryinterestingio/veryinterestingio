		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body uses a hormone called anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) to maintain sodium balance in your body. Increase ADH urinate less, decrease ADH urinate more. Alcohol suppresses the production of ADH which results in your kidneys creating more urine than the beer youâ€™d consume in a night of binging.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lot's of people are raising interesting point about the &quot;why?&quot;. I thought I would chip in that beer/ale with a low alcohol content is still going to hydrate you.</p>
<p>There are anecdotes where early ales were not very strong, and stranded sailors on merchant vessels would drink the merchandise  to survive.</p>
<p>If stranded in modern times, you may consider watering down a light beer to extend your water supply. I was taught that you can mix sea water in to achieve the same effect, balancing the mutual reduction in salt / alcohol to make a drink that will hydrate you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol inhibits the bodies ability to retain water. That's why you seem to pee so much when you are drinking heavily. Yes you are interesting water, but your body isn't holding on to any of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because alcohol tricks the body into thinking there is not enough salt in your system. Your body tries to maintain a balance between salt and water. Sense your body thinks it's out of balance it dumps the water (urinate) to reach what it wrongly believes the balance should be. This happens with any aloholic drink.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
