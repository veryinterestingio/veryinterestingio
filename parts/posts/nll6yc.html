		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Firstly, the liver is not a mechanical organ like the heart or kidneys. Itâ€™s functions are based entirely on chemistry, not on structure. Any liver cell anywhere can do what a liver cell does. So, if you remove a piece of the liver, the liver still works. This would not work for a mechanical organ like the heart, because the structure of the heart is absolutely key to how the heart functions. If you remove a piece of the heart, you fundamentally alter its mechanical properties.  </p>
<p>Secondly, the liver is primarily tasked with de-toxifying toxic chemicals, and so it is constantly exposed to toxic chemicals. This constant exposure to toxins causes constant damage to liver cells. So liver cells have to constantly replace themselves as they become injured or killed in the line of duty. </p>
<p>Put these two facts together (the shape and placement of liver tissue is irrelevant and liver tissue has a high rate of cellular regeneration), and it adds up to the fact that the liver can regenerate itself far beyond what most other organs are capable of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctor here, so the regenerative capacity of any organ depends on the presence of these cells that we call &quot;stem cells&quot;. They're present in quite a few organs like the skeletal muscle, to some extent in the heart muscle as well! They are called satellite cells too. These cells remain dormant for the most part. So everytime some cells die, it is the job of the stem cell to divide and replace the lost cells. Now this regenerative capacity is close to absent in the nervous system. There are claims that nerves may have some regenerative capacity but it's negligible. Muscular tissue has limited regenerative capacity. Now the liver, has the highest regenerative capacity as an organ.
This regenerative capacity stems from the concept of your DNA being able to get copied multiple times. As we grow old, the replications decrease and eventually, our cells die more than they replicate and we ultimately move towards senility. </p>
<p>So, if you were to have, let's say a benign tumour that was occupying a part of the liver, you can remove it and the liver would grow back to its original size. That's why liver transplants are so widespread. Not to say that it is an easy task, given how transplants CAN get rejected, so, it's still tough but very commonly done. </p>
<p>I hope this answers your question</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
