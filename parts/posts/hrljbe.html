		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We're Dr. Karen Kafadar, Dr. Richard De Veaux and Dr. Regina Nuzzo, all statistics professors with the world's largest community of statisticians, the <a href="https://www.amstat.org/" target="_blank">American Statistical Association</a>.</p>
<p>We are excited to discuss how statistical education is crucial for minimizing the public's susceptibility to disinformation. That includes journalists, who play a pivotal role in improving data literacy.</p>
<p>I'm Karen, and I'm a statistics professor, Chair of the University of Virginia's Department of Statistics, and 2019 President of the ASA. Ask me anything about how the statistical community and the media can help the public understand and be less influenced by fake news.</p>
<p>Last year, I helped champion ASA's &quot;<a href="https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2019/11/01/making-a-statistical-impact-with-text-data/" target="_blank">Disinformation Initiative</a>&quot; for statisticians and computer scientists to collaborate and address the challenges associated with this deception. I've served on several National Academy of Sciences' Committees, including those that led to the reports <a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/228091.pdf" target="_blank">Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward</a> (2009), <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK209412/" target="_blank">Review of the Scientific Approaches Used During the FBI's Investigation of the Anthrax Letters</a> (2011), and <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/18891/chapter/1#vii" target="_blank">Identifying the Culprit: Assessing Eyewitness Identification</a> (2014).</p>
<p>I'm Dick, and I'm a statistics professor at Williams College and the current Vice President of ASA. Ask me anything about how to communicate important statistical ideas in ways that everyone can use, especially during this time of disinformation and confusion.</p>
<p>I've written six high school and college statistics textbooks that have been read by literally millions of students. They've even appeared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=stats%3A%20data%20and%20models" target="_blank">Reddit</a> a few times. I give keynote addresses and workshops around the world and have appeared on radio (<a href="https://www.wamc.org/post/alan-chartock-interviews-williams-college-professor-dr-richard-de-veaux" target="_blank">WAMC</a> and <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2019/07/30/the-reality-of-a-massive-security-breach/" target="_blank">Marketplace</a>) and TV <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/video/prediction-by-the-numbers/" target="_blank">(NOVA and PBS)</a>. In my spare time I sing with the Choeur Regional de l'Ile de France in Paris (when I'm there) and have appeared with them on both CDs and French radio and TV. I'm also known as the &quot;Official Statistician for the Grateful Dead.&quot; Yes, you can ask about that. </p>
<p>I'm Regina, and I'm ASA's Senior Advisor for Statistics Communication and Media Innovation. Ask me anything about <a href="https://www.knowablemagazine.org/article/society/2018/when-courtroom-science-goes-wrong-and-how-stats-can-fix-it" target="_blank">non-traditional ways</a> to showcase statistics and how to communicate statistics to the public in an age of disinformation.</p>
<p>I'm also a professor at Gallaudet University and an adjunct professor at Virginia Tech. My work has been published in The New York Times, Scientific American and ESPN Magazine, among other outlets. My feature article on <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/scientific-method-statistical-errors-1.14700" target="_blank">p-values for Nature</a>, which won ASA's 2014 Excellence in Statistical Reporting Award, remains in the <a href="https://www.altmetric.com/details/2115792" target="_blank">top 5% of all research outputs</a> scored by Altmetric. I was also featured in PBS's <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/video/prediction-by-the-numbers/" target="_blank">&quot;NOVA: Prediction by the Numbers,&quot;</a> I'm particularly interested in how easy it is for us to <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/how-scientists-fool-themselves-and-how-they-can-stop-1.18517" target="_blank">fool ourselves and others with statistics</a> during data analysis and the scientific process, and how we should be communicating quantitative information in a way that our brains can &quot;get it&quot; more easily. </p>
<p>We will be on at noon ET (16 UT), ask us anything!</p>

I completed my master of applied statistics last year and when I was searching for a job I found alot of overlap between statistician jobs and data scientist roles.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What is the most important concept in statistics you think the general public doesn't understand?  </p>
<p>Do you think statistics being manipulated in the media and politics to distort facts is a problem? How would you counter this by educating the public?</p>
<p>I feel I often come across claims by politicians and journalists which seem to be founded in statistics, however, if you look deeper into the data and look at it in context it almost seems the data is used in a manipulative manner*. Somehow a lot of people just get away with just saying numbers, which instantly makes people think they are informed.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>*(E.g. country A has a growth of GDP twice as big as country B, and this is of course because [insert political agenda]. Then you look a bit at the data and see country B has three times greater GDP and at the current growth rate the &quot;distance&quot; is more-less maintained between the two.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
