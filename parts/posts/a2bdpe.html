		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are nearsighted, you can see close up but not far away - so to do something like driving that requires good vision means that you need an accurate pair of glasses to fix your far vision. If you have the wrong strength of glasses this means that you won't be able to see correctly at distance. As you may not be able to always change the distance between your eyes and something far away enough,  the prescription needs to be perfect to see (think about trying to look at a landscape where everything further away than 50m is blurry because your prescription isn't perfect).</p>
<p>Being farsighted means you can see things far away, but your eyes get worse looking at objects close up. If your eyes are such that you can see well a meter away, but cannot read a book sat on the table on front of you, a pair of reading glasses will correct your vision so that you can clearly see something that is closer to your eyes. The differing strengths will alter this distance to different degrees, so a weak pair of glasses will allow you to read 20 cm closer, a stronger pair 50 cm closer, and a pair that is too strong may adjust your eyes too far and make them worse. With something like reading however, you can easily adjust the distance between your eyes and the object you are reading - so while a pair of glasses that are slightly wrong may not allow you to read something 30 cm from your eyes (such as a book laying in bed), they may adjust your eyes just enough to read a book 40 cm from your eyes, so you can just hold the book 10 cm further away to compensate.
So if you find you need reading glasses, it is not so necessary to have a perfect prescription, and you can happily use glasses from the pharmacy (which are typically sold in half steps of strength, where prescription glasses can often be sold in far, far greater accuracies - steps of 0.01  rather than 0.5)</p>
<p>An optometrist will test you and prescribe reading glasses properly too, just this accuracy costs money and many people will happily make do with store bought generic glasses.</p>
<p>One other thing to mention is how people wear glasses and how easily damaged they will be - short sighted people tlypically wear glasses permanently, so when you put them on in the morning you wear them for the day. Far sighted people however will only wear glasses when reading, and will take them off when using distance vision (such as driving). Because they are taking them on and off regularly there is a far greater chance of losing then, forgetting them, or sticking them in a pocket and breaking them. If you have to replace them regularly then the cost of prescription glasses will add up very quickly, so cheap generic glasses will save your a lot of money. For a near sighted person that will often wear the same pair for years at a time without losing them the cost is far more justifiable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Direct Answer:<br />
It's more difficult to correct long distance vision accurately than it is to get &quot;good enough&quot; short distance vision.</p>
<p>Why:<br />
Long distance vision correction needs to be accurate because, for instance, if you're piloting a vehicle at 65mph down the road, you're going to need to be able to read the signs quickly and without strain. Short distance vision correction can be approximated since you're <strong>generally</strong> not trying to read a book flying by you at 65mph (I mean, I assume so but I won't judge).</p>
<p>Additional Details:<br />
Finally, there's a thing called &quot;astigmatism&quot;. Astigmatism can be summarized as that your eye (and lens in the eye) isn't perfectly smooth and round. These tiny variations in the eye have a significantly more pronounced effect on distance vision. As a result, generic lenses for distance correction really can't exist in a meaningful way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s because the drug store glasses are actually not for treating hyperopia (farsightedness), they are for presbyopia (loss of accommodation)- which is an age related occurrence where your lens looses ability to focus.</p>
<p>The drug store readers are geared toward people who essentially had “good” eyesight prior than hitting the age where they lost accommodation, therefore requiring them to only need a little magnification. </p>
<p>There are truly hyperopic and myopic people that the drug store readers will not work for.</p>
<p>So if you think of the “normal” vision people as starting at 0.00D, they just need a little bump to read (+1.00D to +3.00D or so), whereas folks who have had a perception previously may already have needed (say from -5.00D to +5.00D) so there are much less options in the drug store they can use to get them to the effective +1.00 to +3.00D that they need to read.</p>
<p>Also, for those folks who already need glasses to walk around, they likely have bifocals to “add +3.00D” or whatever reading modification they need.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So basically everyone commenting missed a huge thing, and that's over-accommodation.  It's very easy to use too much minus if you just put on a pair and look out.  Many people can focus through extra prescription to a point, but over time with extra minus you end up with lots of headaches and even an accommodative spasm.  Simply put, your optometrist/ophthalmologist/optician goes a long way to make sure you aren't getting too strong of a minus prescription, and you can really mess with comfort of your daily life by messing this up.</p>
<p>This does not happen with + lenses, as they do NOT stimulate accommodation (focusing).  Additionally, each eye will need the same amount of reading help, assuming the eyes are corrected for distance.  This is not the case with minus lenses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to be an Optician, so I'm gonna take a swing at this.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There are 5 common terms you need to know before I begin:</p>
<p>Hyperopia - far sighted</p>
<p>Myopia - near sighted</p>
<p>Presbyopia -  loss of accommodation </p>
<p>Astigmatism - Your eye is not perfectly round, but it is round-ish</p>
<p>Focal point: the place your eye is focusing</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The eye has a couple of components that allow you to see near and far. When there is a deficiency in these components, things are blurry. You have the Cornea, the pupil, the inner lens, the retina, and the optic nerve.  When a doctor measures your eyes, they check for the shape of the eye, and your sight strength, using what's called diopters, a unit that is based somewhat on the focal length or point.</p>
<p>When an eye is &quot;perfect&quot;, it has a power of 60 diopters and is round-ish like a sphere, but when your eye is deficient it needs to be corrected. A natural eye can be lacking by having either has more or less spherical diopters or being not perfectly round and more olive shaped in one way or another, which determines if you have Myopia, Hyperopia, or Astigmatism. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Myopia means you have a surplus of Spherical diopters, whereas hyperopia means you have a deficiency of power. To correct this, a doctor will write you a prescription for spherical lenses to make up the difference. A doctor will give you more or less power to bring your difference back to 60 diopters of power, so that you can see more clearly. If you have an Astigmatism, your lenses may also have a cylindrical shape cut into the lens at an axis (usually a number between 0 and 180) to change the light to a different focal point within the eye.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The prescription looks something like this:</p>
<p>OD (right eye)   +/- x.xx | +/- y.yy|  θ  |  Add +z.zz</p>
<p>OS (left eye)      +/- x.xx | +/- y.yy |  θ  | Add +z.zz</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>X are the numbers for your Spherical Power</p>
<p>Y are the numbers for your Cylindrical Power</p>
<p>θ is the axis for your Cylindrical Power</p>
<p>Z is the number of magnification you need if you experience problems reading up close</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Reading glasses that you find in a grocery store or drug store are intended to be used for people with Presbyopia. As you age, there is a lens just behind the cornea that, as you age, builds layers kinda like a tree trunk builds layers. Eventually, when you hit age of 40+, the muscles that flex that lens can no longer flex it because it has grown too stiff. These glasses aid in helping the object's focal point be closer to the eye so that the muscles don't have to work as hard. As you noticed, these glasses are strictly positive spherical power glasses.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>When you have hyperopia, you need positive power spherical lenses to make up your deficiency, which is why the reading glasses will somewhat work for your prescription. Also, when you're hyperopic, the eyes are instantly able to tell if the glasses you picked up off of the shelf are too powerful because your vision is just blurry. It's also very hard to get those muscles for your inner lens to loosen up more to bring your vision into focus. Side Note: this is also kind of how VR goggles work.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now, myopia needs negative spherical power. The eyes are more tolerant of having extra negative power than they need to focus for far away, but this will cause eye strain, fatigue, and sometimes headaches. This is because the muscles for the inner lens will stretch your lens thinner to help you focus through that extra power. But, this wouldn't be an ideal scenario for drug stores or grocery stores because it's bad for business if the customer is unhappy, and you wouldn't know right away if you picked glasses with too much power, unlike hyperopia.</p>
<p>I know this is a long reply, but I hope it helps shed some light on the eyes and how they work.</p>
