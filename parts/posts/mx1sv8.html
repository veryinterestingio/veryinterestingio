		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Sunburn&quot; is another name for &quot;nuclear radiation damage to millions of cells across a wide area of the body&quot;.</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a flurry of activity by DNA-repair enzymes and other repair processes.</li>
<li>Those cells with irreparable damage sense it and commit mass cell-suicide to avoid becoming cancer. Their &quot;bodies&quot; then need to be swept up and taken away.</li>
</ol>
<p>All together, that is a massive drain on your immune system and body energy stores. And at the same time, being sunburnt probably means you were outside a long time - which means you're likely dehydrated and maybe muscle fatigued from hiking, swimming etc. Add all that to the radiation damage and it's no wonder you're wiped.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit:  I didn't mean alpha/beta/gamma radiation, it's solar UV (<em>electromagnetic</em> radiation from a nuclear explosion) that causes sunburn.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you really want to be mind blown, getting large tattoos feels much the same, both in skin pain at the tattoo site, and the drained tiredness and malaise I associate with sunburn.</p>
<p>In fact, some even call the reaction &quot;tattoo flu&quot;.  Similar thing though, I imagine.  Damage to the body, trauma, mild shock, inflammation responses, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
