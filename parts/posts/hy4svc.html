		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Largely because of erosion. Almost all erosional processes that are important in mountain environments (e.g. rivers, glaciers, hillslope diffusion, mass wasting) have a slope dependence, i.e. the rate at which they occur is at least partially dependent on slope and they generally proceed faster when slope angles are greater. This really ties back to them all being ultimately driven by gravity.</p>
<p>Now, if we ignore other factors that influence erosion rate and just say that erosion rate in a landscape is proportional to slope and we imagine a high elevation, flat topped region with steeper slopes surrounding it (i.e. a plateau), it quickly becomes clear that this is unstable. At the boundary between the steep part and the flat part, there is a large erosion rate contrast (i.e. high where slopes are high, low where slopes are low) which will essentially 'eat' into the flat part pushing the boundary between the steep and the flat part into the flat part (and replacing flat topography with steep topography in its wake). Now, this isn't just happening in one place, it's happening in all places around the boundary between steep and flat terrain, progressively shrinking the flat part of the terrain. This is basically the process of cliff retreat, with probably the most clear examples <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-f7ljTqqTv0E/Vo6AiqbFPII/AAAAAAAACss/DaQ0_DanwkM/s1600/17.12.jpg" target="_blank">being what we see in areas with layered rocks</a>, though this example is complicated, as there is a lot of interesting dynamics happening in these types of landscapes. However, the same general principle applies to landscapes not built in layered rocks.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the sort of equilibrium condition for a landscape are boundaries between areas with different slope directions but with roughly equivalent erosion rates (i.e. if both sides are lowering at the same rate, the boundary between them will stay approximately in the same place). This tends to form ridges and occasionally peaks (which are often manifest as the intersection of several ridges).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Lay you hands flat on a table in front of you, with your thumbs touching. Keep your right hand in place. Slowly slide your left hand over to the right, on top of your right hand.  Your left thumb will pop up. The highest part forms a ridge.  Then your left index finger pops up as another ridge.</p>
<p>Now lay your hands flat . Keep your index fingers together and touching on the table. Now move your left wrist closer to your right wrist. The lower knuckle in your left thumb is now a peak.</p>
<p>This is what is know as thin skinned deformation.</p>
<p>Subsequent erosion can break apart the ridges and separate them by rivers, for example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s a concept called “angle of repose,” which means the angle something comes to when it is left alone and allowed to come to rest. Think about sand: if you drop a bunch onto the ground it will form a sloping pile. If you dig away the base of one side of that pile to try to make the pile “steeper” it won’t work, the sand will just fall and find its angle of repose again.</p>
<p>Angle of repose is a property of any building material. Sand, dirt, gravel, all have their own angles which are an intrinsic, emergent quality of the way the granules of the material are shaped and how they stack and about how steeply they can be piled up before they start to tumble. If you have a bunch of granules that are cube-shaped, they should stack at a steeler angle than granules that are perfectly round. Friction of the material also counts.</p>
<p>So why do mountains have a peak? Because the sides all fall away at their angle of repose, leaving a point. Why should the point be flat?</p>
<p>Also, mountains have peaks because when they don’t, we call them mesas. It’s just the definition of the word.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
