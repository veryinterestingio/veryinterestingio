			<a href="/posts/il19yt" onclick="return false">ELI5. How can games be so “addicting” and work not feel the same - even though work yields real life results and games are just virtual. How can one incorporate the rapid reward system into work?</a>

<p>Logically it seems silly  to be so immersed and devoted to a game, but wow sometimes I can’t sleep without just “one more level”. One more level just leads to one more level. How come work isn’t as addicting, wed all be rich !</p></div></div>

<p>When I work, it can be fun sometimes, but sometimes it isn't. I can't just say &quot;Nah fuck it, I don't like this level.&quot; and leave it. At work I have to perform, otherwise there might be bad consequences.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>games are like pure sugar for our reward centers. Real life accomplishments are always going to take more work and pay off slower. I'm wary of any system to &quot;gamify&quot; work, since I think quality work shouldn't be about immediate reward, it should be about dignified pay and the nom-rapid, long-term satisfaction of doing valued work within your community. When a job sucks, adding video game elements to work only distracts from these deficiencies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
