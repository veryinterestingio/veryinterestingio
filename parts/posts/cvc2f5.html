		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Google is an index.  They don't just store copies of all webpages, they store an index of keywords.  So if you search for &quot;bananas&quot;, it will go to the bananas part of the index and return the results.</p>
<p>Searching for files on your computer, there often isn't an index.  Instead it has to go into every folder and every subfolder and look at the files in real time to find matches.  This takes time.</p>
<p>Now on many systems you can create an index to make searching faster, but there are trade-offs to having an index.  Yes search results can be faster, but they can take up a LOT of storage space.  It also takes CPU bandwidth to actively create those indexes. (I frequently find myself pausing windows indexing because it makes my computer run slow.)</p>
<p>For google, their business is in having an index, and storage is part of that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, indexing versus scanning. Scanning is when you have to go through every file/record to see if it matches your search. Indexing is when you pre-sort all your related files/records into groups, which are often nested, then you drill into those groups to find what you need more directly.</p>
<p>A human example of scanning would be having a computer desktop covered in documents; To find what you're looking for you have to look at each file to determine if it's the one you want.</p>
<p>Whereas, a human example of an index could be if instead that desktop simply had folders that grouped the files by type (say &quot;pictures&quot;, &quot;spreadsheets&quot; and &quot;contacts&quot;), if you're only looking for images, you can save a lot of time by going directly to the &quot;pictures&quot; folder and ignore the &quot;spreadsheets&quot; and &quot;contacts&quot; folders because you know they don't contain any images.</p>
<p>Of course, indexes can be represented in far more complex ways that group the same data in many different ways at once. For example, you might index an image by it's size (eg: large images, small images), colouring (eg: black &amp; white, mostly red, mostly blue), the date it was taken (2017, 2018, 2019), etc. So then if you search for &quot;large black and white images from 2017&quot; the computer can eliminate results that don't appear in all 3 categories at once very quickly and only keep the ones that are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you go through your house once a week and jot down every single item name, size, characteristics, color, and place. Then you memorize the notes you've taken. This is what google and your computer do.</p>
<p>This means you can instantly recall every item when you need it. The cost is that it takes memory in your head and you need to do it again periodically since positions and items might move.</p>
<p>Now imagine you didn't do this and need to find an item. You'd have to go through every single space and inspect every item. This is slow. Plus you're not committing this to memory when you do it. So 5 minutes later when you need to find a different item, you need to go through every item in your house again.</p>
<p>Windows does do search indexing unless you turn it off, so searching for a file these days should take less time</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
