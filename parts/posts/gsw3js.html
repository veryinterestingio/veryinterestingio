		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some meat is muscle built for endurance like running, and needs a lot of oxygen. So it has a lot of special proteins that store and carry oxygen around, and these proteins happen to be red. So this meat is also red.</p>
<p>Other meat is muscle built for quick powerful movements like jumping, and needs a lot of energy. So it has a lot of special sugar that stores energy in it, and it happens to be white. So this meat is also white.</p>
<p>Edit: I am not a doctor or a biologist - so I don't really know if a duck breast can outrun a human thigh. Thank you for the gold kind stranger!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>SOME chicken meat is white, but they've got dark meat too.</p>
<p>Well, cows are simply nothing but dark meat.</p>
<p>Red (dark) meat is packed full of myoglobin, which makes these muscles a &quot;slow burn.&quot; These are the muscles that are constantly being used, at least a little bit. A chicken stands and walks around all day, so it's legs and back are dark meat, just like a cow and all of it's muscles that are used to maintain posture and just eat all day.</p>
<p>White meat is packed full of glycogen, which makes these muscles a white-hot flame. These muscles aren't used all the time, but when when they are needed, they have to work hard and fast (e.g. flying). This is why only the chicken's pecs and arms are white meat.</p>
<p>If cows were known to sprint full out for 30 or 40 miles at a time several times a day, then their legs and arms would be white meat too in order to power this high-drain, very energetic activity. But they don't, so they aren't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
