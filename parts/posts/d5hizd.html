		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I stutter and the one answer my therapist has: Nobody knows.
Sometimes I can talk all day without trouble. Sometimes some specific words are hard for me. Some days I can barely speak and every second word gets stuck in my throat.</p>
<p>It's also not black and white what triggers a stutter. I can be nervous as balls giving a presentation to a room full of people and I talk just fine just as I can be relaxed at home and not get out a single word talking to my girlfriend.</p>
<p>It is very, very weird. Symptons differ from stutterer to stutterer. I have problems with explosive words, those that start with your lips closed (mother, pen, bridge) or those that start with a vocal (auto, open). Some others may have problems with words starting with s or ch.</p>
<p>However. To every stutterer out there: There is no cure, you have to accept it and to live with it. You dramatically ovetestimate how much it bothers other people. They usually dont care and will have forgotten you and your face like the other 200 people they saw that day. Carry your stutter out and don't hide or avoid it. Nobody gives a shit and so shouldn't you either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A comedian I like says he avoids stuttering (still suffers it, but avoids it from happening) by just stopping speaking when he feels the next word is gonna be hard and looking for a synonim instead, or some other way of saying the same. Just avoid the (suddenly) difficult word. It's kind of weird how he makes pauses every few words, but it helps him. It kinda like using what the question says as a mind hack. </p>
<p>I hope maybe this can help someone!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My stutter came in at age 16 when reading along in a play in class. I chose a small part, and when it was my turn to read aloud I stopped on the word noble. Couldn't get the word out no matter what. My friends were concerned for me because up until that point I never stuttered.</p>
<p>Still have it, but I like to look up synonyms so I can quickly recover from it.</p>
<p>Also, I stutter when reading numbers mostly with nines and eights. At meetings when I say 1800, and start to stutter I have to say one thousand eight hundred, or 200 away from from 2000.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Legit, can talk fine sometimes. Other times I struggle and have to force myself to slow down.</p>
<p>No words really start it. I've also never really put much thought into what sets it off. All I know is that it's highly frustrating and embarrassing at times.</p>
<p>If anything, when I overthink what im saying...is usually when I studder the most.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My only expertise is that I've stuttered for 35-ish years, but perhaps hard consonants require your mouth (lips, palette, tongue, etc) to seal for a split second.  I sometimes feel like I can't even open my mouth with some words.  Compared to that same letter or letter combination showing up in the later half of a word where it just flows out since my mouth has already started moving.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
