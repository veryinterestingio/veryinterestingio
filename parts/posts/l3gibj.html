I have a buyer with a traditional financing arrangement (30 year loan) and a cash buyer. As the seller, I get my money regardless of whether a bank pays me or an individual cash buyer. Why do people get excited over the cash buyer?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cause the cash buyer has all the money ready to go. They don't have to then go ask the bank for the money.</p>
<p>That's an extra step that could go wrong. The bank might decide they don't like the house or think it's worth that much. It might take a long time and leave you tied up. There's a number of things that could go wrong.</p>
<p>Cash is just easy. Why risk the headache when you can just get your money now?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Real estate contracts do not become firm until a few things happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A time period for inspections, attorney review, etc passes. This is usually a few weeks. </p>
</li>
<li>The financing deadline. This is usually one month or more. If the buyer does not get financing,  the buyer can just break the contract and walk away from the deal with no penalty. If a buyer wants to walk away, he can usually manipulate it so the financing falls through and he walks away.</li>
</ol>
<p>In a cash deal, there is no financing contingency.  The contract is a sure thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cash buyers are guaranteed to close since they don’t need to get final approval from a mortgage lender. They can also close more quickly since they have the cash on hand rather than waiting for the 30-45 day underwriting period.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
