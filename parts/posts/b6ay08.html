		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Far from an expert, but logic seems to indicate:</p>
<p>Homeless or Homeless Person stresses 'homeless' so it migrated to Person experiencing Homelessness.</p>
<p>Disabled Person stresses 'disabled' so it migrated to Person with Disabilities.  To some from a logical perspective the migration shifted to Differently-abled to reduce the sting of the 'dis' marker. But it seems that <a href="http://www.unitedspinal.org/pdf/DisabilityEtiquette.pdf" target="_blank">Person with Disabilities</a> is the preferred nomenclature. </p>
<p>Similarly 'Colored Person' (initially referring to those with African ancestry) stressed 'color'. That shifted to the more inclusive Person of Color, and that has since shifted to '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racialization" target="_blank">Racialized</a>' to clarify that there is no default melanin content and the distinction (to some) my have an automatic separation/distancing involved.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Language is a mutable thing, and the &quot;pure meaning of the word&quot; or the dictionary meaning is not the only defining aspect of a language. Colored people were use a lot for the more segregated of USA ( colored people bathrooms, colored people places in the bus, and many other things), and it was more commonly used for black people.</p>
<p>People of color was an alternative that activists believed would bring more of the &quot;I'm not only defined by race yet it is part of my history&quot;. So, as most of our language, it's just how the history played out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is the standard &quot;conveyor belt&quot; for terms describing disadvantaged populations. Every new term is non-offensive for a while, then gradually takes on a condescending tone and has to be replaced, again and again.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The term &quot;colored&quot; was created by white people and was historically used to discriminate against them. The term &quot;people of color&quot; was coined by POCs so avoid referring to themselves with reference to white people, e.g. &quot;non-whites.&quot; </p>
<p>The &quot;people first&quot; aspect is true, but that is more about why it was coined. The actual reason it is not offensive is that the people who it is used of coined it themselves, and thus don't consider it offensive. They recognize a difference, and thus &quot;person of color&quot; doesn't carry with it the racist connotations of &quot;colored person&quot; or even &quot;colored.&quot; </p>
<p>Ultimately, that is how it always works. A term is offensive due to the people it is used against associating it with bigotry, and the least offensive term is one that the group coined for themselves. The exact forms this takes don't actually matter.<br />
