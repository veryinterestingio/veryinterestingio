		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So an explanation I've heard is that liver/kidney/adrenal stress is associated with eye bags. So if you're chronically low in sleep, then you hurt your adrenal/liver function.</p>
<p>Here are some other reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Other things that can contribute to dark circles under the eyes include: medication that causes blood vessels to dilate; scratching or rubbing your eyes excessively, such as during allergy season; regularly sleeping on your stomach; and in our best WebMD impression, you should know they can also be caused by liver disease… possibly deadly… And by possibly, we mean most likely. You had a good run. But now there are these dark circles under your eyes clearly indicating some life threatening liver disease you have. /WebMD. <a href="https://gizmodo.com/what-causes-dark-circles-under-your-eyes-1584754813" target="_blank">https://gizmodo.com/what-causes-dark-circles-under-your-eyes-1584754813</a></li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One explanation I haven’t seen here yet has to do with the orbicularis <del>oris</del>  oculi muscles. </p>
<p>These muscles surround your eye sockets and help you keep your eyes open. If you spend long amounts of time with your eyes open and concentrating, like when reading or using the computer, the orbicularis <del>oris</del> oculi muscles can become fatigued to the point where it looks as though you have bags under your eyes. </p>
<p>Edit: it is oculi instead of oris</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I thought eye bags were different from dark circles under eyes. Eye bags are when it’s all puffy, and/or saggy. You can have dark circles without the puffiness so  are they different things, maybe affected differently by sleep/lack of? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eventhought all explanations I have read are correct, dark circles under your eyes may also be caused by genetics. Some people have a thiner skin under their eyes then others, and if your skin is too thin, your vessels are visible which are purple/black .. so u can have dark circles even if you have a lot sleep, healthy life style and everything else.. it sucks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
