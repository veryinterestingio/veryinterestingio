		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So my flatmate once told me that this helps and I didn't believe him. </p>
<p>A few monts went by with no accident until we played some hockey in school and I got a full hit with the hockey puck in the sensitive area. It hurt bad..
Then I suddenly remembered what my flatmate said and tried it out. In less then a minute the pain was gone. </p>
<p>Can someone, who knows about this explain to me why and how this works? </p>
<p>Stay safe guys and gals ;)</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a scientist but likely it has to do with moving your body to alleviate both the adrenaline from the pain, and to spread the pain <del>hormone</del> more evenly throughout the area. Think of it as spreading butter over bread, except the butter is pain, the bread is your body, and the spreading is you shaking violently in agony. </p>
<p>Edit: pain is electrical firing of the synapses, not hormones, my bad. You're not spreading the electrical impulses out you're diluting them with more signals. </p>
<p>Sort of like how you can clench your thighs to alleviate a boner. You're just distracting the nervous system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you mean just stamping around, maybe increased blood flow around the area. If you mean REALLY stamping on your heels.....the body prioritises pain so if you make your heels send another pain signal it may well make your balls feel better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
