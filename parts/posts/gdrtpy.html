They’ve been on the east coast since I can remember (just turned 31). I even remember my grandma saying she was stung by one as a kid (she was born in the ‘20s) and that the pain was unimaginable and made her “see stars”. </p>
<p>It’s hard to find a picture in google but the closest thing I saw is an European Hornet. They look pretty similar. Have I been misclassifying these bees my whole life?</p></div></div>

<p>European hornets have been present in the US since the 1800s and have long since well established themselves on the east coast. They are quite commonly mistaken for Asian hornets due to their similarities. While their diets and general behavior (though many-myself included-consider European hornets to be a fairly docile species) are somewhat similar, the giants have a penchant for feeding on other eusocial insects. Their large heads power strong muscles, allowing them to prey on other hard-shelled Hymenopterans. In their native range a large portion of their diet consists of bees and wasps. </p>
