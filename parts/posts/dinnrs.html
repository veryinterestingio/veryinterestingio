		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to doctors. It spreads through the air. Particles of virus can float for up to 2 hours after an infected person passes through a room. People are contagious for 4 days before they have a rash and about 4 days after they get the rash. Because it's so easy to catch, about 95% of a population has to be vaccinated against the measles to stop it from spreading. In 2017, the latest year for which data are available, only 91.5% of toddlers in the U.S. were vaccinated, according to the CDC.  The number of cases of measles reported during 2019 is the largest number since 1992.  The effectiveness of one dose of measles vaccine is about 93% while after the two recommended doses it is 97%.  </p>

<p>EDIT: Thanks everyone for joining us! WebMD will continue reporting on measles. Five stories about how measles has directly affected parents, children, and doctors -- sometimes with devastating results: <a href="https://www.webmd.com/children/vaccines/news/20191017/measles-devastates-families-challenges-doctors" target="_blank">https://www.webmd.com/children/vaccines/news/20191017/measles-devastates-families-challenges-doctors</a>.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve read (and heard on “This Podcast Will Kill You”) that measles is an immune memory wiper.  Can you talk more about this and about why this isn’t blasting from the airwaves?  I was stunned when I heard that.  I would think that is a great message to get out to antivaxxers who believe their kids should just fight things with their natural immunity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>What causes a loss of immunity from vaccines and should people be rechecked for immunity at some point in their lives?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All my concerns about modern medicine were put to bed when my son was diagnosed and subsequently cured of Leukemia. So I don't have any questions.</p>
<p>Instead I just want to say thank you. I can't imagine how frustrating it must be to dedicate your life to quite literally making the world a better place, and then have people accuse you of being part of some nefarious plot to cash in on fear. My son's oncologist was regularly told that she was poisoning children just to make money, and it must have been heartbreaking.</p>
<p>So thank you. You are appreciated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a parent with two children too young to be fully vaccinated (2 year old and 4 month old, both on a normal vaccine schedule), we are trying to make sure all of the adults in their lives are fully vaxxed. I am aware of the waning efficacy of the TDaP, particularly the pertussis portion - dad and I, as well as the grandma that does our daycare received boosters. Is this something adults should be aware of for other vaccines (I had heard something about possibly the mumps component of MMR providing waning immunity over time)? </p>
<p>I know that many dog owners get titers measured instead of providing all their vaccine boosters, due primarily to costs - is this an option available to people, how common is it, and is it supported by insurance?</p>
<p>Another shout out to  “This Podcast Will Kill You”, who have done a great job talking about the science of vaccines. They have said they are most excited about the possibility of vaccines for malaria and possibly a universal flu vaccine (in terms of most helpful worldwide) - what vaccine possibilities get you most excited/optimistic?</p>
<p>And I'm excited to read your answer to rileyryebread, as I easily find the immune memory issues with measles to be the most terrifying part of that already-dangerous-and-super-contagious bug! Thank you for talking with us :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
