<p>Edit: Wow, thank you all for the responses this therapy is my next step in some things and your responses help with the anxiety on the subject.</p>
<p>I'll be responding more in the coming day or two, to be honest wrote this before starting the work week and I wasnt expecting this to blow up. </p>
<p>Questions I have as well off the top of my head.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is anxiety during and /or euphoria after common? </li>
<li>Which type of EMDR (lights, sound,touch) shows better promise? </li>
<li>Is this a type of therapy where if your close minded to it itll be less effective?</li>
</ol>
<p>And thank you kind soul for silver. I'm glad if I get any coinage it's on a post that hopefully helps others as much as its helping me to read it.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nobody knows <em>exactly</em> how it works. I wrote my masters thesis on EMDR and after a ton of literature research I still can't pin it down.</p>
<p>The core mechanic is <em>bilateral stimulation,</em> in other words an external stimulus is applied rhytmically from side-to-side. This is thought to enhance the accessibility to certain parts in the brain that store unprocessed negative memories, perhaps by inducing a mental state similar to REM sleep. Another theory is that <em>working memory</em> is retrieving the negative memories, but due to its limited capacity is reducing the negative emotions of that memory each time (because not the entire information can be retrieved) resulting in a modification of the memory towards one that is less negative over time.</p>

<p>***This one is specifically for phobia and differs a bit from PTSD, but it's the one that i used for my studies on arachnophobia.</p>

<p>***It's obviously going to be a bit different when done live in person with a therapist (less annoying for most people) but this is a good representation of what BLS is.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Am a trauma therapist who has worked with 5 year olds so I'll give it a go.</p>
<p>Sometimes when scary things happen to us, our minds protect us from our emotions by making us &quot;go numb&quot;. This helps us survive the scary situation.</p>
<p>In a perfect world, when we felt safe again, we would be able to then feel the emotion and it will leave our body.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, sometimes the emotion gets &quot;stuck&quot; in us, in our mind and we carry it around with us for years without realizing it. The emotion comes out from time to time, especially when we hear a &quot;trauma echo&quot;, something that reminds us of the scary thing we went through. So, if the scary thing happened in a crowd, we might be triggered by another crowd in the future and the emotion will come out.</p>
<p>It's tricky though because the emotion might mutate. So what was once fear may transform into anger so much that you can't recognize the original scary emotion anymore.</p>
<p>EMDR creates a trance like state by manipulating eye movement. Basically, what you're doing is allowing the individual to essentially go back to the trauma that caused the first emotion and allow them to process that emotion. This unsticks it from our mind and allows it to leave our body. We then will not be affected (or as affected) by our trauma echos in the future.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I am currently training in EMDR therapy as a psychiatric nurse practitioner... and overall I find various explanations describing the active mechanism of EMDR hard to swallow.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve taken EMDR a few times and it is really weird. I sat and started at these two big water droplets that reflected light off one side then the next second the reflection would go to the other side, idk if that makes sense but that’s what it was. And while your watching these two water droplets move you think about the trauma. Once you’re done it’s weird how much of a weight feels lifted off of you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot of psychobabble here, especially in regards to how EMDR achieves its outcomes.  Opinions are not science, unless those opinions are based on rigorous empirical assessment. There is a less polite turn of phrase to this effect. </p>
<p>“Regardless of the validity of its theoretical underpinnings, EMDR has empirical support in that it consistently outperforms no-treatment controls and demonstrates similar outcomes to exposure- and cognitive-based psychotherapies for PTSD.” [Source: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5126802/#!po=3.47222" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5126802/#!po=3.47222</a>]. </p>
<p>The creators of EMDR, and anyone else, can hypothesize all they want. That’s a long way from an actual theory. Many of the explanations posited here do not do justice to explaining how memory works. The neural mechanisms of learning, memory and exposure to trauma are barely understood. There is no “filing cabinet” or “hard drive.”  Trauma exposure itself has been demonstrated to have structural impacts on portions of the brain in the short term, but 2/3 of people exposed to traumatic events appear to recover spontaneously.  </p>
<p>There is also the element of individual variation of response to any form of treatment. Some will benefit from one form of treatment and others will not, and there are graduations of response within a useful treatment. </p>
<p>Any person — professional or lay — who states unequivocally that any treatment is 100% effective will conversely be incorrect.  Not knowing the actual mechanism of improvement is common in this field, but creating explanations without scientific merit or testability is not helpful, and can add to the snake-oil feel. </p>
<p>I’m a board certified licensed psychologist with 25 years experience in trauma and in trauma research.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
