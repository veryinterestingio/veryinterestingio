		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>we (as in NASA and ESA mostly) keep track of every particle that is larger than 2-3 cm diametre (roughly 1&quot; for those weird ones using the other system). the actual value might differ, it was in this neighbourhood when I still worked in that field ~10 years ago.</p>
<p>this is actually insane. we track tiny tiny pebbles in space from the ground and in the worst case tell the satellite to evade this pebble.</p>
<p>but even the smaller particles pack quite a punch at the speeds we're talking about here, which are often in the 10-20km PER SECOND range. (bullets from guns/rifles usually are in the 0,5-1km/s range)</p>
<p>for my work we simulated those impacts in a lab (with a friggin huge light-gas-gun), and yes, even a small aluminium piece with &lt;1cm diametre will punch a considerable crater in anything it hits.</p>
<p>the main way to protect yourself from these tiny particles is that we use &quot;walls&quot; to surround the important equipment. a honeycomb-like structure where you have 1 outer metal plate, followed by mostly empty space and then another metal plate (held together by the honeycomb-structure in between them). the particle punches through the outer plate, fragments and then the slightly slowed and smaller particles hit the inner plate and dont penetrate that one.</p>
<p>This way you got a tiny hole on the outside and a (mostly) intact inner plate. the likelyhood of another particle hitting that exact hole on the outside are basically zero (I think a satellite gets hit by 1-2 such particles per year overall)</p>
<p>If you used one thicker plate with the same weight as this structure, the particle would just punch through and you'd suffer damage. (and the primary limiting factor for bringing equipment into space is the weight, less so the actual size).</p>
<p>that still leaves the solar panels, you cant really coat them in this way. and the impact of a tiny particle actually &quot;melts&quot; the material where it impacts and creates a plasma for a few milliseconds. this can short-circuit your panels.
that's why most newer satellites (we had to understand this phenomenon first) have &quot;breakers&quot; so that the damage to the solar panels is limited to the actual impact crater (this is easily 10-15 times the size of the particle) and not the much larger &quot;short-circuited&quot; area (which would have been in the range of 50-100 times the particle size).</p>
<p>hope this answers your question</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kinda both. The big chunks we can keep track of, and try to avoid. And helpfully space is big. Very big.
Even if just in low earth orbit.</p>
<p>However... The smaller things we can't keep track of.
And there you can only really pray your not hit.
Given the chances are still low. Because space is so big.</p>
<p>That is only a major concern for humans in space, satellites can be replaced. But every satellite taken out by debris causes more debris.</p>
<p>Something called kessler syndrome. Its when the amount of debris keeps causing more and more debris until spaceflight is impossible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All parts of the spacecraft is designed to be bulletproof. They usually have layers of aluminium and kevlar in a design created to break up and deform any incomming debris and then capture it before it punctures the hull. This is very similar to modern tank armor designs. At this point the International Space Station is covered in tiny impact craters which is an issue for astronauts on EVA as these impact craters can have sharp edges that might cut the space suit. For bigger debris with more energy the spacecrafts is relying on ground based radars to warn them in time for them to change course. However after the cold war ended there have not been as much money available for these radar systems as they were primarily used to gather military intelligence on satellites and warn against incomming weapons. So many of these radars have been abandoned and others are in danger of having to close down due to a lack of funds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically they <a href="http://stuffin.space" target="_blank">track</a> it. There is a lot. Most of it is in LEO (low earth orbit).  Depending on size/weight, any lower and it gets sucked back into the earth any higher it can lose orbit and fly away but there is a zone packed with potentially dangerous clutter. So yeah they have to plan launches and missions to avoid the dense areas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
