		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With the news of the new DeepMind AI that can accurately predict the 3D-structure of a protein; this got me pondering about environmental factors that influence protein structure (e.g: Salinity, pH, Temperature, etc). </p>
<p>Are there examples of proteins with identical amino acid sequences but have a different 3D-structure and therefore the protein acts entirely differently? i.e: A protein in x-conformation acts as a Kinase in one environment but in y-conformation in another environment it acts as a carboxylase. Are these a result of specialized chaperonins?</p>
<p>I don't necessarily mean a protein that exists in both forms in the same organism, but also 2 different organisms and 2 different functions. Any examples would be amazing.</p>
<p>Edit: Thank you everyone for all your thoughtful and scientific responses.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many proteins undergo conformational changes and have different properties in the different conformations. &quot;Moonlighting proteins&quot; are ones that have multiple distinct biological functions, and many moonlighting proteins accomplish this by conformational changes. </p>
<p>One of the best examples is aconitase, which is an enzyme in the citric acid cycle. In order to fulfill its enzymatic function, it uses iron as a cofactor. However, under conditions of low iron, it changes conformation and acts to upregulate iron uptake genes.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Part of the protein folding problem is accurately predicting how a protein will change in its 3D structure under different environmental conditions.</p>
<p>One classic example of dramatic differences in protein function based on their folded shape is prions. We generally don’t know how prion proteins get “mis”-folded to begin with, but their presence catalyzes other properly folded proteins with the same sequence to also misfold in the same way, essentially becoming a transmissible disease to anyone exposed to those prions.</p>
<p>It is likely that misfolding happens relatively frequently and biological systems just deal with them except in the rare case of prions where the changes propagate and spread their effects to other proteins which causes enough distribution that we actually looked into the root cause to discover those specific examples of misfolding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Folded one way they perform their normal structural function in the brain. Folded another and they don’t work, and cause nearby proteins to also refold the same way, turning your brain into a useless sponge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there are many many examples of this.  Post-translational modifications lead to changes in protein secondary and tertiary structural changes (eg. voltage-gated ion channels).  Protein misfolding diseases (AD &amp; prions) are another group of examples of this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a way, haemoglobin does this. with decreasing PH, the structure of the protein undergoes a physical conformational change and a few alpha helicies rotate, having the eventual effect of releaseing any bound oxygen. When the ph returns to normal, the protein reverts to its inital conformation, sequestering any oxygen. I guess this is technically a difference if you are asking that? If you want to find more, I think a good place to start will be looking at proteins with multiple stable confirmations at different PH levels (like pepsin, although I dont think inactivated pepsin acts as a signalling molecule!), or proteins that change in different charged enviroments (things like gated ion channels).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
