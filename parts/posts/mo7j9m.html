		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Herb is the leaf of a plant, spice are seeds/pods/bark. So basil, cilantro, sage would be herbs but a peppercorn, coriander seed, cinnamon would be a spice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Someone else posted this, and I can’t remember who, but collectively they are all “seasonings”. Herbs are made out of the leafy parts of plants. Spices are made from other parts of the plant, but not leaves. Like roots and seeds and such.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Already a few correct answers herb=leaf, spice=other plant parts in both cases added predominantly for flavour. Thought it was of interest to add that coriander (cilantro) can be a spice (seeds) and a herb.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
