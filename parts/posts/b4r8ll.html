		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there’s ‘two’ nervous systems that usually work together. This is an example of where one takes over first.</p>
<ul>
<li>CNS = Brain. It controls the actions you think about so it takes longer to work.</li>
<li>PNS = No Brain. Controls reflex actions, ones you don’t have to think about, so it’s faster.</li>
</ul>
<p>The leg in hot water reaction would work something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Leg goes into water</li>
<li>PNS realises you are in danger.</li>
<li>PNS moves leg out of the water because it knows you’re in danger.</li>
<li>CNS realises leg is out of water</li>
<li>CNS realises leg is in pain and lets the brain know, meaning you only then feel pain.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope that’s simple enough, ask any questions if you need clarification.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think the other answers really get to the root of the question.  You have different types of nerves.  Big nerves and little nerves, insulated and non-insulated nerves.  Big nerves are fast.  Insulated nerves are fast.  There are two types of pain nerves, and both are small (one is insulated, the other is not). </p>
<p>As for why you move your leg: the nerves send a signal to not just your brain but also special nerves that live in your spinal cord.  These nerves (called interneurons) &quot;short circuit&quot; the system with a &quot;reflex arc.&quot;. It sounds confusing, but what it means is the signal going up to your brain is always diverting just a bit to nerves that can make decisions without the brain of they hit a danger threshold to protect the body.  It is the same system you see when doctors tap your patellar tendon at your knee (the brain kinda turns these off, and when you have an interview to the spinal cord, there is no off signal.... Just an on signal)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The central nervous system (CNS) is the brain <strong>and</strong> the spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is all the nerves that come off the brain and spinal cord (like in your arms and legs). Nerves are the way information in your body is communicated around (like a network).</p>
<ol>
<li>When your leg touches the hot water, a nerve in your leg 'senses' this heat and passes the info to your spinal cord (because that's where that nerve is connected to).</li>
<li>In the spinal cord, this 'sensing' nerve passed the info to a 'moving' nerve.</li>
<li>The moving nerve is connected to your leg muscles and when it receives the info, it makes the leg muscles move your leg out.</li>
<li>At the same time that step 2 and 3 is happening, the spinal cord is sending this information up to your brain for you to process. By process, I mean 'feel' the pain and scream.</li>
<li>Because it takes longer for the information to reach your brain than to go back to your leg (literally just compare the distance from leg to brain vs leg to leg), steps 2 and 3 will happen quicker than step 4.</li>
</ol>
<p>For a bit of terminology, we call this a 'spinal reflex'. This means you don't actually need your brain for this reflex to happen, it just needs to spinal cord. But our brain is there to process the info so we know next time not to put our leg in the hot water because it will hurt like hell.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh man!</p>
<p>None of these cover the real reason it <strong>burns</strong> when you take it <em>out</em> of the water rather than why it takes a while to feel. It's super interesting!</p>
<p>It burns because of the mixture of hot and cold feeling in the same area at the same time. </p>
<p>The body has pressure and temperature sensing nerves. <strong>But the body doesn't have a way to sense burns. Instead, it senses hot and the feeling of nerves not being able to send any signals because they're dying — which happens to feel like cold.</strong></p>
<p>Try this experiment:</p>
<p><em>Take out 2 butter knives. Run one under cold water and the other under hot water for a few seconds. Feel the full back of each on the underside of your forearm and notice the sensations: hot and cold right?</em></p>
<p><em>Now put both knives side by side so the flat parts are close together and touch the dull backs to your forearm at the same time. You haven't hurt yourself — but notice that it feels like it burns!</em></p>
<p>So when you pull your leg out of very warm water, what happens? The warm water starts rapidly evaporating a few seconds later. And evaporating water — just like sweat, cools down your skin sending the cold sensation at the same time that deeper parts of the skin are still sending the hot sensation. Just like the two butter knives, it feels like burning. </p>
<p>Cool right?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of information in other answers. Not all is true. Reflex arcs are a thing, however, the reason why the burn is felt a second or two after is because pain is conducted through different neuron fibers - the slowest. </p>
<p>Your body has evolved to conduct information like bodily position (proprioception), fine touch, vibration, crude touch and pain. It also has evolved to consider pain as the least important for of information and thus uses the slowest nerve fibers to conduct this information ( conduction speed of about 1-2 meters / second ) which. A lot of us are about a meter+ tall. This is why it takes a while. </p>
