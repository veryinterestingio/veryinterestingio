		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Coelacanth is a ancient bony fish believed to have been one of the precursors to land dwelling animals.  It has very bony almost arm-like front fins and was believed to have gone extinct over 100 million years ago until some fisherman caught one in a net in South Africa in like 1995.</p>
<p><strong>Edit: Since this has blown up I wanted to issue a couple clarifications/corrections since this post was initially based on my childhood memories of watching nature shows and hanging out in the library.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coelacanth was actually first &quot;discovered&quot; in South Africa in 1938 and many more have been caught since then.  Prior to that it was only ever described in the fossil record and was last found in fossils dating to the Cretaceous period of the Dinosaur era which ended 66 million years ago.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Also they are not actually a &quot;missing link&quot; creature between fish and land dwelling animals but they are a direct descendant of one such creature called the Lungfish.  Despite their appearance of having arm-like fins they do not use them for any sort of walking.  They have many more fins than normal fish though and can swim in all manner of strange directions including vertically and upside down.  They are very slow but highly maneuverable and eat mainly cephalopods and other slow moving prey.</strong></p>

<p>To respond to some comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was never &quot;officially declared extinct&quot; for the same reason Tyrannosaurus Rex is not officially declared extinct.  We &quot;know&quot; it is extinct because nobody has ever seen one alive that we know of and the only fossils we have of it are 66+ million years old.  This logic holds up great for 13 foot tall land dwelling predators but kinda fails when you're talking about small, bottom dwelling ocean fish as humans don't spend much time down there to see if they are still alive.</li>
<li>The fact that this creature allegedly died 66 million years ago and now still exists does not call into question evolution as a scientific principle.  Sharks, as a species, have existed for longer than Dinosaurs.  IN fact Sharks have existed, virtually unchanged, for longer than TREES HAVE BEEN ON LAND.  When you are perfectly adapted to your environment and your environment remains mostly unchanged for 400 million years there is no reason for you to evolve.  Everything is working A-OK as it is.  If it ain't broke don't fix it is probably evolutions #1 motto.</li>
