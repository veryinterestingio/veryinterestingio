<p>The TL;DR is that the hexagon will form naturally in a spinning fluid provided the spin is the correct speed. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: nobody knows for sure. But here's a likely hypothesis that comes from Harvard:</p>
<p>Essentially, think of Saturn as a bunch of liquid in a globe, and the globe is spinning. (Gas is a fluid, and the scale is big enough that this makes a decent toy model) The water at the very top is gonna be moving slower than the water that has to go all the way around the outside at the middle/equator.</p>
<p>Normally this wouldn't be too much of a problem, but the &quot;liquid&quot; in Saturn's atmosphere is actually bands of different types of gas. What we see as the Hexagon is the boundary between two of these bands. The difference in thicknesses (viscosities) and speeds of these two bands creates turbulence where they meet. This spawns mini-vortices just south of the barrier (in the less viscous gas). </p>
<p>These mini-vortices space themselves out evenly, and due to the magic of fluid mechanics, they push the boundary between the bands north a little bit wherever they are. This makes the polygon pattern. The folks at Harvard were able to get triangles and octagons too, with the right conditions. But the conditions on Saturn are just right to make a hexagon.</p>
