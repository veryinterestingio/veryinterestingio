		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is less of an earth science question and more of an economics / consumer psychology question (which as an earth scientist, I'm not going to be particularly able to answer). From a very basic level though, there are a lot of assumptions baked into this as a line of reasoning, e.g. that consumers (or most people in general) understand risk assessments, etc. The faulty (ha, pun not intended) line of reasoning could equally be applied to the continued existence / expansion of population centers in earthquake prone regions, e.g. 'If earthquakes are real, why haven't we seen a plummeting of real estate prices in Los Angeles as the time since the last major earthquake increases?'.  That being said, some quick browsing does suggest that there are the early signs of what you're describing (though none of these could be construed as a crash in real-estate prices at this point, more that there does appear to be a measurable influence of sea level rise on home prices), e.g. <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3073842" target="_blank">Bernstein et al 2018</a> showing that houses more in danger of sea level rise sold for 7% less than equivalent less risky homes or <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aabb32" target="_blank">Keenan et al 2018</a> showing a price premium being placed on homes at higher elevation in south Florida.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Almost all predictions of sea level rise says that we wont see anything large untill the next century so buying a water front property now means that even your grand children might be spared any real damdage from rising waters(exluding more frequent floods etc)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In nuclear engineering, we occupy ourselves with a lot of risk assessment and probability.</p>
<p>One thing I realized that people are not just bad at assessing risk, they are terrible. </p>
<p>You see the similar results from both people who are ignorant (underestimate the consequences) and people are are educated on the topic ( underestimate the probability).</p>
<p>Climate change is not unlike people who smoke and those who are worried about terrorist attacks. Some do not think the consequences will be that dramatic/that rapid, there are those who think the probability that <em>they</em> will be affected is not that high.</p>
<p>People in real estate, honesty don't give a shit. You will frequently hear them saying that the new developments takes into account of the sea level rise. No one really asks for the details.</p>
<p>I am not entirely if it's still true in in US, but private insurance does not typically cover flood and is in fact subsidized (?) by the government. Here too the insurance companies don't give a shit as long it's not them who bear the risk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
