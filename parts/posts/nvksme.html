		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When your body uses its fat deposits as &quot;fuel&quot; it does so by breaking the chemical bonds in the fat molecules which releases energy.  The byproducts of this are water and CO2.  </p>
<p>Water is removed from the body through urination and sweat.  CO2 is removed from the body by breathing it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When they say &quot;burning fat&quot;, from a chemistry standpoint, they're being quite literal.<br />
The fat is a fuel for your metabolism.<br />
You breathe in oxygen.<br />
The fat then burns into carbon dioxide, water and some other waste products.<br />
You then breathe out the carbon dioxide.<br />
The weight of your exhalation is higher than your inhalation.<br />
You are getting lighter one breath at a time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The fat itself is large molecules with lots and lots of carbon and hydrogen.  This is stored inside of fat cells.</p>
<p>When you burn that fat your body combines those molecules with oxygen.  The carbon winds up as CO2 (carbon dioxide), while the hydrogen winds up as H20 (water).</p>
<p>The CO2 is exhaled, while the water has numerous means of leaving your body, most notably sweat, urine, and moisture in your lungs/throat.</p>
<p>The hydrogen atoms are much more numerous than carbon, but the carbon are much heavier so they make up the majority of the weight you lose.  To lose more fat a strategy would be to breathe more, but to do that without hyperventilating you want to have a use for all that oxygen.  A sustained physical exertion will do that. This is just a roundabout way of arriving at the obvious conclusion that cardio exercise will help with losing weight (note however that people already breathe a lot, so raising that amount significantly takes a lot of cardio.  It's often easier to just eat less and let your normal breathing evict carbon molecules from your body).</p>
<p>The fat cells themselves generally stick around, but they're smaller since they have less fat in them.  They may die and be disposed of by your immune system, kidneys, etc, ultimately leaving through your urine.  Liposuction takes the direct approach here and just removes them from your body directly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mostly exhalation. You generally breathe it out.</p>
<p>There is excrement (poo) and urination (pee) and sweat that passes a lot of liquid and solids out of your body, but stored fat doesn't move back into your digestive tract to leave through the anus or urethra (butt or front genitalia).</p>
<p>Fat is broken down and, at least partially, exhaled through your breath. Probably small numbers of molecules are passed through sweat, but most of the actual &quot;weight&quot; (or mass) is exhaled.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
