		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's think of operating systems as human languages. You write a book in English and you want a Swahili speaker to read it. What do you do? Translate the book to Swahili. This is analogous to game available to both Linux and Windows.</p>
<p>What about Proton and Steam Play? Well, some books don't get published in Swahili so you'll have to hire a translator to read it to you. Some books are really easy to translate on the fly, but some use advanced concepts that the translator doesn't fully understand. So the translator makes some mistakes. They're obvious but you can still enjoy the book.</p>
<p>Now, try to give a book about theoretical quantum physics to a translator who works mainly with literary works. With all the hard to understand concepts and specialized words maybe they'll just say no to the job.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking. If the game is very old. Like, 2005 Or below. The game will work with no issues. There are exceptions to this though. Where the issues arise are with Proton to play games because, If theoretically proton got good enough to run almost all Windows games. There would be no reason for any developer to make a native linux version. And Linux would always be stuck with the \~ 5% performance loss in games <strong>except some games do run better on Proton than they do on Windows ironically.</strong>  </p>
<p>Also. There would still be services like FaceIT or ESEA where they wouldn't want you to ever use proton to play it and they'd figure out someway to detect it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
