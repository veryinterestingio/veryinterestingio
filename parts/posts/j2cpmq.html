		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One: Distraction - adding stimuli and movement helps to reduce the feeling of pain.</p>
<p>Two: Protection - the cause of the pain isn't exactly understood by your brain, so it starts an immediate reaction to deal with it. Some painful stimuli (hot liquids, acids, biting insects) can be flung away.</p>
<p>Three: Adrenaline - pain stimulates adrenaline, which gets your body wanting to move. </p>
<p>Four: Blood flow - Injuries can cause blood to pool, shaking your hands will help with blood flow and stop some of the pooling which can cause secondary damage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read somewhere once we do that to dislodge anything biting us, which is part of evolution since we were getting bit by things when our brains were evolving far more than burning ourselves or getting fingers stuck in doors. Same reason we scratch itches. Need to dig out whatever is on our skin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My guess is it's some instinctual thing evolved from the days things would bite onto our fingers, the &quot;shake off&quot; motion was literally used to shake off</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I get hurt in some small way, like hit my knee, I like to rub the hurt area briskly. It seems to relieve the pain. I always thought this was because rubbing brought blood or some other chemical to the area.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
