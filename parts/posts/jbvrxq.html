https://www.space.com/possible-space-junk-collision-leolabs-oct-15-2020">LeoLabs are predicting that two large satellites have an uncomfortably high chance of colliding at an altitude of ~1,000km on Thursday</a>. (EDIT: Looks like the satellites passed each other without incident, thankfully.)</p>
<p>Given their high mass and relative velocity, would a collision produce a flash capable of being seen from Earth, either with the naked eye or with a telescope (however powerful)?</p>
<p>Will debris at that altitude make space exploration much more difficult, and if so, for how long? </p>
<p>And a bonus question: what, if anything, could we do about it with such short notice, assuming we had access to whatever resources necessary?</p>
<p>Thank you, space boffins.</p>
<p>Edit: Sorry, I should have been clearer that the timezone for the collision estimate was reported in EDT, so the moment has now passed and it seems that the objects missed each other by as little as 10 metres. </p>
<p>That being said, I’m still interested to know the hypothetical answers to the above questions for when situations like this inevitably occur again in the future. </p>
<p>I’d also like to expand the scope of the “what could we do about it” question: rather than asking what we could do about this specific collision, in general what could we do about <em>any</em> potential collision of space debris?</p>
<p>How much time would we realistically need, given the current state of technology, to mount a response to cope with something on this scale?</p>
<p>How would that timeline change if, say, China, the US, and Europe all decided that avoiding a collision was priority number one and provided unlimited resources to solve the problem?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm unable to estimate if there will be a visible flash, but consider that the expected collision site is above the Antarctic peninsula. It will be below the horizon for the latitudes where most of human population is located. So, from the surface of Earth, I'm afraid we will see nothing.</p>
<p>Even for satellite tracking telescopes, I doubt there are any of them on site. At least the EU doesn't have any. I assume they will observe the aftermath, whether it is the entire objects (most likely) or the resulting clouds of debris (still uncomfortably likely).</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Exploration? No. It will still be possible to leave Earth since any spacecraft crossing the range of altitudes of the resulting cloud of debris will do so very quickly, with a negligible probability of collision.</p>
<p>Earth observation? Maybe. The risk of debris is mostly for satellites that stay in orbit.</p>
<p>There are two precedents for this, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_satellite_collision" target="_blank">the Kosmos-Iridium collision</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Chinese_anti-satellite_missile_test" target="_blank">the intentional destruction of Fengyun-1C</a>. These two events alone were responsible for the majority of debris in LEO.</p>
<p>For large fragments that can be tracked from Earth, satellites can use their thrusters to perform a collision avoidance manoeuvre. Smaller objects can be resisted by <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20060026214" target="_blank">MMOD shields</a>. But sometimes this is not enough, especially for intermediate-sized objects, too large to resist but too small to track.</p>
<p>If the collision does happen, it means satellites in the same range of altitudes will face higher threat, probably have to perform more frequent maneuvering. Some of the fragments might decay and burn up in the atmosphere within a few days, but others can be expected to stay in orbit for a thousand years. As usual, lower orbits remain relatively clean because higher density of residual atmosphere means that orbits decay more quickly. Satellites are periodically boosted to stay in orbit, debris isn't.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>what, if anything, could we do about it with such short notice, assuming we had access to whatever resources necessary?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing. Just watch.</p>
<p>One of them is a defunct satellite, the other a rocket body. If at least the satellite were still operational then probably its thrusters could be fired and the collision could be avoided. But since they are just junk, out of control, they will inevitably follow their paths as mandated by inertia and orbital dynamics.</p>
<p>Probably the question meant building some kind of robot to tug them out of danger. Such a robot is conceivable, despite the difficulties of RDV and docking with a non-cooperating target (which might be rotating at who knows which rate), but definitely impossible to design, manufacture and launch in a couple of days. It would take months or years to make one.</p>
<p>(And small note, &quot;8:56pm on Thursday&quot; is probably OP's timezone, this will be 00:56 UTC. For me in Europe it means tonight - I'll see tomorrow morning if something happened.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Why doesn't the &quot;creation&quot; of space debris sort of solve itself?  If you've got multiple orbiting satellites that somehow collide, why doesn't that collision itself really throw off their constant speed that keeps them orbiting, and therefore lead to the junk de-orbiting/falling back to earth?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There are two problems, tracking really small objects is hard, extremely hard, and gets harder for smaller the object. Radars today are designed for large aircraft &amp; missiles flying at Mach 3-5 near atmosphere, not 2cm objects moving at 30,000 kmph. This tech itself would add significant defense power to the country using it. </p>
<p>The real problem is if anyone develops the tech to de-orbit a debris, or clear the trash, there is nothing stopping from doing it to a working satellite as well. For example, DLR has developed a high powered laser to add vertical momentum to the debris, depends extensively on the ability to actually track it in the first place. However, this can be used on a in-service military satellite of Russia or China and be considered an act of war.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think there would be a significant visual event, there is enough energy in orbital objects to make it shine, but only if a lot of that energy is turned into heat. A re-entering object dissipates all of its velocity, as does a surface impact, but a collision in orbit is going to result primarily in two debris fields occupying similar orbits to what the intact satellites are in. The details are complicated and depend on the structure and materials involved, but they aren't going to transfer all their energy into each other.   </p>
<p>1,000 km is in low earth orbit, but its pretty high up, so there is only a very small amount of atmosphere up there. Eventually, that atmosphere will bring all the debris down as it slows its orbit, but it will take quite a while. And in the mean time, having debris in LEO increases the probability of other satellites hitting it and turning into their own debris field orbiting the earth, because it is spread out more. The worst case scenario is for basically everything in LEO to be destroyed, and we have to wait a few years or maybe even a few decades before we can put anything new back up. If we clutter up higher orbits enough for a full blown Kessler syndrome (the name for this cascading one collision's debris causing the next one in a growing chain reaction), things are worse, because it takes so much longer for the debris to de-orbit, and depending on the density of the debris, we might have just enough de-orbiting every day that the whole range is too dangerous to put anything up, but it can keep going for centuries or even millennia. There isn't enough stuff in orbit for it to be that bad, but it is something we need to keep in mind going forward.  </p>
<p>As for what we can do about it, there are a couple options, if we assume neither satellite has any delta V, in other words no ability to change its trajectory to avoid the collision, we could send a mission up to grab one and give it a push. We would need to launch about an hour and a half before the collision at the very latest, that would give just barely enough time to intercept before the collision, but you'd have to get it right on the first try. Starting from the surface is an advantage, because lower orbits have less distance to cover per rotation, and can get there faster. Even an elliptical orbit with one end at the target altitude and one end just outside the thickest part of the atmosphere will get around the planet substantially faster than a circular orbit at that target, so catching up to the thing isn't a problem (well, no more a problem than launching any rocket, which is always difficult). We don't have the capability to launch such a mission right now, the shuttle might have been able to pull it off with some of the robotic arms they had at some points, but a Soyuz or dragon capsule would need major modifications to be able to attach and then safely fire thrusters for significant course changes. Of course, if you can calculate precisely enough, and launch super far in advance, you could literally have someone go on an EVA and physically kick the thing to give it another .0001 m/s a bunch of orbits out, which we could definitely do with enough advanced warning (the exact time needed depends on the size of the target satellite and the leg strength of the astronaut).  </p>
<p>The current way we deal with this is by requiring all satellites have a plan for either a parking orbit out of the way if they are at high altitude, or to de-orbit if they are low. This isn't great, the high orbits are not infinite, and if we plan to keep using geostationary orbit for the next billion years, we might run out of space (especially if we increase our activity in space by a large amount, for example by dropping launch prices dramatically with re-usable rockets).</p>
<p>The option that I think we will adopt for the long term though is lasers. Not lasers strong enough to blow satellites up entirely, just strong enough blast a very thin layer off one surface of an object. Hit it in the front, and the small amount of material that ablates off leaves going forward faster than the rest of the object, so the rest of the object must slow down as a reaction. It doesn't take a big change in velocity to bring the other side of the orbit down into the atmosphere, which will do the rest when the satellite comes around and dips in. This does leave some very high velocity particles in orbit, but they should be small enough that the basic structures of satellites necessary to keep them intact during launch should have no trouble withstanding the impact, and certainly anything rated for human flight will be safe. These particles will be comparable to the exhaust particles from rocket engines, which are already something we have to contend with, as every de-orbit burn throws a slew of them into a slightly higher orbit than the ship was on. For really big dead satellites, we might still send a ship to go grab them and send them down into the atmosphere, but for small-medium stuff, a laser can probably do the job.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
