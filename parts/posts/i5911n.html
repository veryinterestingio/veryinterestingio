		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If F=G(m1*m2)/r^2 then the force between the earth an object will be greater the more massive the object. My interpretation of this is that the <strong>earth</strong> will accelerate towards the object <em>slightly</em> faster than it would towards a less massive object, resulting in the heavier object falling quicker. </p>
<p>Am I missing something or is the difference so tiny we could never even measure it?</p>
<p>Edit: I am seeing a lot of people bring up drag and also say that the mass of the object cancels out when solving for the acceleration of the object. Let me add some assumptions to this question to get to what I’m really asking:</p>
<pre><code>1: Assume there is no drag
2: By “fall faster” I mean the two object will meet quicker
3: The object in question did not come from earth i.e. we did not make the earth less massive by lifting the object
4. They are not dropped at the same time</code></pre></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are correct, heavier things will accelerate the earth more than light things. The acceleration of earth is equal to G*m2/r^2. For a 1000 kg mass on the earth's surface (~6 x 10^6 m), this translates into an acceleration of about 2 x 10^-21 meters per second^2 .</p>
<p>The very best accelerometers can measure things on the order of 10^-9 m/s^2 , so you're also right in that we cannot measure this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but you have to remember that since F=ma, a=F/m=(GMm))(r²m)=(GM)/r², the mass of the accelerated object is irrelevant; only the <em>relative</em> acceleration would be higher because the earth would accelerate towards the object at (Gm)/r², so the relative acceleration would be (G(M+m))/r²</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;problem&quot; to giving the right answer to your question seems to be that you are asking two of them, if I get this correctly :-)</p>
<p>It was said already, but it really depends on how you define &quot;falling&quot;. If you mean &quot;meet the earth earlier&quot;, then yes. If you mean &quot;move quicker to the position the big attractor initially was&quot;, then no.</p>
<p>Compare a golf ball and Earth 2, both several meters above the earth's surface (and ignoring friction anyways): Earth 2 will be accelerated just as fast as the golf ball, so the final velocity before reaching the initial position of Earth 1's surface would be identical, but this position of Earth 1' surface wouldn't have changed very much because of the golf ball's attraction, but of course just as much as Earth 2's surface position.</p>

<p>Thank you for this beautiful question btw :-)  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If by fall faster you mean 'get closer to the ground more quickly', then technically you are right because the acceleration of the Earth towards the centre of mass of the system is very slightly greater. This effect is so small as to be meaningless insofar as it in unmeasurable and tiny enough that you couldn't see the difference on your calculator.</p>
<p>For a calculation on dropping a ball from your hand, I suspect that it would be swamped by other very small (and also insignificant) factors like the change in the field strength between the surface and the object as it falls over a short distance, the roughness of the Earth and the fact that the Earth isn't a perfect sphere. Also the rotation of the Earth.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you replace the moon with a neutron star then you'll definitely notice the difference!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As long as we are dealing with minuscule, unmeasurable quantities, I am surprised that I haven't seen anyone talk about the relativistic  time-dilation for a heavier (denser) object falling toward earth. Surely time passes more slowly for the denser object. Does that mean that &quot;subjectively&quot; it falls &quot;faster.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
