		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All human embryos start as defaulting towards being female in the womb. The SRY gene on the Y chromosome plus testosterone is what later intervenes and tells your body to convert the proto-clitoris into a penis, convert proto-ovaries into testicles, etc. (And tells your body to do another round of growth in that same direction at puberty.)</p>
<p><em>(Edit:</em> /u/Michelangelor  <em>graciously corrected me below that “we all start as female“ is an outdated and oversimplified understanding. We start out as something in between, but we default to develop female unless male genes interfere around week 6. Please see their posts for a more accurate description. But for purposes of answering the question, the rest of my post still applies.)</em></p>
<p>But androgens like testosterone are just signals. They are not the actual building blocks. It’s the stem cells, etc. and other genetics that determine how that thing actually grows once they get the signal. Once those things have grown to their genetically pre-programmed limit for you, you can keep signaling as strong as you want -- nothing will happen because you've already &quot;spent&quot; everything you had.</p>
<p>It's similar to why adding growth hormone, etc. won't make adults grow taller. Yes, your skeleton is receiving the signal, but your bones are &quot;done.&quot; They can't get any larger. They've hit their genetic limit and capped themselves off. (Certain bones like your jaw will still respond, as in acromegaly, but they're the exception.)</p>
<p>In women, the &quot;potential&quot; building blocks for building the penis are still there in the clitoris to some extent, untapped. So if you start adding androgens, they will respond and start growing, even if it's too late to turn into an actual penis anymore. But adding testosterone won't make adult penises larger unless they are abnormally stunted from lack of signal and not at their natural genetic cap already.</p>
<p>By the way, it's similar in the opposite direction with women and breasts. Adding estrogen to men will cause breast development. But adding estrogen will not cause further breast growth in women, unless they haven't already hit their limit because they didn't have enough estrogen signal to begin with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It does cause growth of the penis in men, it happens during puberty and eventually stops. Females are not exposed to those amounts of testosterone during puberty and the clitoris can therefore grow if exposed to testosterone, but will also eventually stop if it has been affected by testosterone for long enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
