		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>95% of the time, the answer to questions like &quot;Why can't X cross the blood brain barrier&quot; is polarity.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In order for molecules to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) the must be fat soluble, and fat soluble compounds are generally largely non-polar. DMT in a neutral pH is pretty non-polar. So it crosses the BBB with ease. Serotonin, on the other hand, is quite polar, because of it's amine group, and the hydroxyl group on the other end doesn't help either.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Of course, when it comes to endogenous compounds (and yes, I know DMT is endogenous, but it's not endogenous like serotonin is) there are usually a plethora of enzymes sitting around ready to metabolise it. So serotonin in the blood is subjected to metabolism by monoamine oxidase in epithelial cells, as well as in astrocytes at the BBB, and to a lesser extent Aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase and Acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase. There are probably some other enzymes too that I don't know about. This is true for most neurotransmitters, dopamine, noradrenline etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trying to estimate polarity or how similar two molecules are by eye is very hard. As a chemist I can do it to a degree and I could see that serotonin and DMT would have different polarities but I would have to look up how much polarity is needed to cross the barrier. Part of the issue is how we draw structures with sticks and letters. If you could see a three dimensional structure it would give you an idea of how much an abstraction these pictures are. If you then layered a color gradient on the 3-D structure to show polarity it would make things much more clear that they are not in fact similar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
