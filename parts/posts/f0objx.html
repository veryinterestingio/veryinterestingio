		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I understand both concepts very well, yet somehow I don't understand how they don't contradict one another. My understanding of the Gambler's Fallacy is that it has <em>nothing</em> to do with perspective-- just because you happen to see a coin land heads 20 times in a row doesn't impact how it will land the 21rst time.</p>
<p>Yet when we talk about statistical issues that come up through regression to the mean, it really seems like we are literally applying this Gambler's Fallacy. We saw a bottom or top skew on a normal distribution is likely in part due to random chance and we expect it to move toward the mean on subsequent measurements-- how is this not the same as saying we just got heads four times in a row and it's reasonable to expect that it will be more likely that we will get tails on the fifth attempt?</p>
<p>Somebody please help me out understanding where the difference is, my brain is going in circles.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They both say that nothing special is happening.</p>
<p>If you have a fair coin, and you flip twenty heads in a row then the Gambler's Fallacy assumes that something special is happening and we're &quot;storing&quot; tails and so we become &quot;due&quot; for a tails. This is not the case as a tails is 50% likely during the next toss, as it has been and as it always will be.  If you have a fair coin and you flip twenty heads, then regression towards the mean says that because nothing special is happening that we can expect the next twenty flips to look more like what we should expect. Since getting 20 heads is very unlikely, we can expect that the next twenty will not be heads.</p>
<p>There are some subtle difference here. One is in which way these two things talk about overcompensating. The Gambler's Fallacy says that because of the past, the distribution itself has changed in order to balance itself out. Which is ridiculous. Regression towards the mean tells us not to overcompensate in the opposite direction. If we know that the coin is fair, then a string of twenty heads does not mean that the fair coin is just cursed to always going to pop out heads, but we should expect the next twenty to not be extreme.</p>
<p>The other main difference between these is the random variable in question. For the Gambler's Fallacy, we're looking at what happens with a single coin flip. For Regressions towards the Mean, in this situation, the random variable in question is the result we get from twenty flips. Twenty heads in a row means nothing for the Gambler's Fallacy, because we're just looking at each coin flip in isolation and so nothing actually changes. Since Regression towards the mean looks at twenty flips at a time, twenty heads in a row  is a very, very outlying instance and so we can just expect that the next twenty flips will be less extreme because the probability of it being less extreme than an extreme case is pretty big.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Consider the case where we have had 20 heads in a row.</p>
<p>Regression to the mean doesn’t suggest that future tosses will be biased towards tails in order to get towards the mean.</p>
<p>Rather as the number of tosses increases that initial 20 heads will have less and less impact on the average result, until at the limit it equals 50%</p>
<p>The gambler’s fallacy is to believe that you should get to the mean faster than is statistically called for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simplest way to think about it is sample size.</p>
<p>Regression to the mean basically says eventually the distribution will become what we expect. It may take a while but it will happen. </p>
<p>Gamblers fallacy basically takes the idea and says it must happen now. </p>
<p>If you start a coin tossing run with 20 heads in a row, you may not get to a close to even split until hundreds or more tosses. But gamblers fallacy says you should get there in the next 20</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of good answers here.  The OP seems to be interested in betting strategies, so I would add this:</p>
<p>Suppose you are betting on tails in the flip of a fair coin, and you get your bet for each tails that comes up.</p>
<p>After 20 heads in a row, the Gambler's Fallacy says that you should take the bet if the other person only offers you 99% of your bet in winnings (because the Fallacy says that tails are more likely now).  This is wrong, and is a bad bet.</p>
<p>However, if they offer to bet you that the next set of 20 comes up with fewer than 20 heads, and will give you only 1% of your bet in winnings should that be the case, then Regression to the Mean says that is a very good bet.</p>
<p>But I don't like thinking of Regression to the Mean in this way.  The key difference for me is that The Gambler's Fallacy is a <strong>predictive idea</strong>, and Regression to the Mean is an <strong>explanatory idea</strong>.  Regression to the Mean tells us not to infer causation when a notable performance is followed by a less notable one.  There used to be the idea of the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated_cover_jinx" target="_blank">Sports Illustrated Cover Curse</a>&quot;, in which players who had such notable performances that it put them on the cover of the magazine, would not be able to live up to that mark.  It was supposed that being on the cover caused their performance to dwindle.  However, Regression to the Mean suggests that such a reduction in performance is to be expected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gamblers Fallacy - past independent actions influence the future. IE flipping tails means the next flip is more likely to be heads. It should be pretty easy to see why the odds haven’t changed. Gamblers implement all kinda of superstition into their “craft” and this is just a piece of that. </p>
<p>Regression to the mean. This basically means as you expand a sample size you’ll be more likely to see the average indicates. As an example 2 coin flips sees you with a 50% chance of a 100%/0% split. 4 coin flips sees that drop to a 12.5% chance of a 100%/0% split.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
