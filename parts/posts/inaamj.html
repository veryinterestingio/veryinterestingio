<p>It's about the ancient sumerians (<a href="https://youtu.be/d2lJUOv0hLA" target="_blank">its incredibly well done and there's not a single mention of aliens</a>) and apparently they had a language completely new and unique to scholars, but somehow we were able to learn really fine details in their language, like the fact that there were several different terms for things like damns, irrigation, reservoirs, etc...</p>
<p>How could we know that?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the time they look for translations of such texts in languages they do understand. </p>
<p>The Rosetta Stone is an excellent example of this. Prior to its discovery archeologists and historians couldn't read ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs or script, but the Rosetta Stone contained an inscription in both ancient Egyptian forms of writing AND in ancient Greek, which is a language they DO know. From there it was all about putting the pieces together to rediscover this ancient writing system.</p>
<p>There are, however, some ancient languages we still have no clue how to translate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most if not all translations occur from finding partial translations then extrapolating the rest from there. In theory it would also be possible to translate a language from nothing using modern tech to sift through hundreds of thousands of sentences in order to find patterns. Then you could use those patterns to make educated guesses on what a sentence means then apply your guessed translation to other sentences to see if they also make sense. If they don't make sense keep making guesses until they do. Do this thousands of times and that should result in a  good enough partial translation to then create the full translation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are different methods you can use to try and figure out an old language.</p>
<p>One of them is by trying to find a language, or languages in the region that you do understand then make comparisons to the new language for things like loan words, or common origins.</p>
<p>Sabotage is a loan word from French, so if in like 2,000 years we lost knowledge about french, but we still knew english we could reasonably guess what &quot;Sabotage&quot; means based on what we know about that word in english.</p>
<p>Or you have root words, like pre or mono which come from latin and appear in English. So then you can try to infer meaning from that by tracing the evolution of various languages in or near the regions.</p>
<p>You can also try to learn stuff from context. Maybe you find art, or pictures, or tools that have words on or near them. So if you find a bunch of ruins that have the same word used on a building and within that building is always a dug out toilet, you might infer that word means &quot;Toilet&quot; or &quot;Waste Room&quot;.</p>
<p>Of course the holy grail is always something like the Rosetta stone, where you find a document that use multiple copies of a piece of text in different languages. Trade and management of regions is common, so sometimes it's necessary to have documents in multiple languages.</p>
<p>Then you combine all those methods to fill in the text, and when you have pieces missing, sometimes you can make a reasonable guess as to what the missing word is. An example would be, if you had a recipe in an unknown language but had the names of all the ingredients except what it was you were cooking, and the recipe looked exactly like one for shortbread cake. It's reasonable to believe that the recipe is for shortbread cake, and the word at the top of the recipe is &quot;Shortbread Cake&quot; or something to the effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what people have said about finding the same message in several languages, there's also comparing similar dialects that we do understand. </p>
<p>If hypothetically Spanish disappeared but French remained, we could use our knowledge of French to work out some basic Spanish similarities. Then one person will realize Portuguese is also extremely similar and people could use French and Portuguese to make a basic dictionary of Spanish, since the overlap is huge.</p>
<p>This is how we were able to assign sounds to Egyptian, by crossreferencing it to other languages that we do understand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
