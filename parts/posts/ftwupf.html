		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Soda is filled with sucrose which disrupts the hydrogen bonds in the liquid. Alcohol, sugar and salt all play a role in weakening these bonds which opens more pathways for carbon dioxide to escape. That's why champagne loses its fizz quicker than sparkling water as well.</p>
<p>Edit:
Hi ELI5 community; my inbox has been blowing up, and I've literally been at this post for 14 hours straight, so I wanted to add some things that may clarify additional (and repeated) questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Please remember, this is ELI5 and in that spirit I am painting with a VERY broad brush for a basic overview of these reactions. I didn't address this question on AskScience</li>
<li>
<p>Why do you keep saying hydrogen bonds and not surface tension and/or solubility?
Think of them as interchangeable terms (see item 1):

</li>
<li>Why do you say it's only sugar, salt and alcohol that breaks the bonds?
It's not, there are many additives and even water imperfections that cause the carbon dioxide to fall out of solution.(see item 1)</li>
<li>I don't like your second post analogy!
Sorry, but too bad... I'm not a writer. If you got the gist of it through either of the posts then it did the job.</li>
<li>
<p>Why do I experience X when you said Y?
Chemistry is testable, observable and repeatable in a controlled environment then it gets sent out into an imperfect world. I can't account for environmental variables, including: elevation (yes, that matters here), manufacturer's formulas (they very well can saturate the solution with more carbon dioxide than their competitor), cup you poured it in, ice you used, how much you hate carbonated beverages, etc...see item 1.</p>
</li>
<li>What about beer foam and champagne?
I'm not addressing head on beer, just the 'fizzyness' of the different drinks but protein chains help to form the foam structure;
&quot;Beer is a complex mixture of over 450 constituents and, in addition, it contains macromolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, polysaccharides, and lipids. In beer, several different protein groups, originating from barley, barley malt, and yeast, are known to influence beer quality. Some of them play a role in foam formation and mouthfeel, and others are known to form haze and have to be precipitated to guarantee haze stability, since turbidity gives a first visual impression of the quality of beer to the consumer. These proteins are derived from the malt used and are influenced, modified, and aggregated throughout the whole malting and brewing process.&quot; <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226773564_Protein_changes_during_malting_and_brewing_with_focus_on_haze_and_foam_formation_A_review" target="_blank">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226773564_Protein_changes_during_malting_and_brewing_with_focus_on_haze_and_foam_formation_A_review</a>
Champagne is served in a champagne flute for a reason, see /u/cab354's fun fact!</li>
<li>What about diet soda, why doesn't it fizz as much?
Diet soda uses sweeteners that are much sweeter than sugar, so less needs to be used. Less used, less nucleation sites.</li>
<li>What are nucleation sites?
Wikipedia</li>
<li>Why does ice and Mentos make things super fizzy/violent?
Ice isn't all that smooth, the water layer on top is what actually makes it slick (that's how ice skates work). The rough surface of ice, relative to tiny molecules, create nucleation sites in the water where the bubbles are able to form. If you look closely, there are tiny bubbles clinging to the surface of your ice cube, that's the carbonation. Add that to the general agitation of the drink by dropping a solid into it and you have fizz producing actions on two fronts.
Believe it or not, the Mentos reaction NOT a chemical reaction but the same physical reaction as ice, but the surface of a Mentos is super rough, creating more of those nucleation sites for the carbon dioxide to fall out of solution. There is no magic chemical in the candy, it's just a texture thing. It works better in diet Coke because there is less sweetener in it to naturally create these nucleation sites (aspartame is a very effective sweetener)
Here is an article on the Mentos and Coke reaction:

<li>How do you know all this?
It's highly related to my job.</li>
<li>Is there a better explanation than what you have given me?

<li>Why do you have so many grammar/spelling mistakes?
I've been at this post for 14 hours (and see item 4)</li>
<li>Do they have to be squares or can they be triangles? (in reference to my second post analogy: shout out to /u/dvorahtheexplorer)
They can be tetrahedrons if ionized, that's basically 4 triangles stuck together! 4X the triangles!</li>
<li>What was that thing about ionization?

<p>Why does my coke act differently than this when I pour it into my (alcoholic beverage of choice)
Introducing the solution to alcohol is different than having a carbonated alcoholic solution. The order chemicals are introduced to and in a solution are very important in chemistry. Here are a few starter resources as a jumping off point as I am only capable of this hyper-simplified explanation right now (been at this post for almost 12 hours straight):
<a href="https://www.chemguide.co.uk/atoms/bonding/hbond.html" target="_blank">https://www.chemguide.co.uk/atoms/bonding/hbond.html</a>

</li>
<li>So if you put X in sparkling water/seltzer/fizzy water it would fizz up?
Oh yeah, in any carbonated drink!
Here's a fun experiment to live vicariously through YouTube until your isolation is complete (and thanks for self-isolating, it helps me keep my team and me healthy and your power and water running!):
<a href="https://youtu.be/XczcDe7_sLE" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/XczcDe7_sLE</a></li>
<li>Aside from things that won't mix with water or rare exceptions, anything that isn't water reduces water's ability to hold CO2 with stability. - not a question but put so simply and elegantly by /u/Gibborim I had to include it!</li>
<li>Is this why sparkling water fizz feels a lot stronger?
Yup, mouth feel is a hell of a thing!</li>
<li>Anything medical:
Nope, not a Dr.</li>
<li>What about temperature?
See /u/ThMogget , A cold solution will hold their bonds much better than a warm one. Remember, temperature is one of the byproducts of atoms in an excited state.</li>
<li>What about fizzy mineral water?
Mineral water usually has salts and sulfurs in it, it's actually just a fancy pants way of saying it's spring water that hasn't gone through some sort of purification process (like reverse osmosis). These imperfections in the water break those hydrogen bonds just like sugar so depending on where the spring is and how many impurities (minerals) there are in the source, they could very well be just as fizzy.<br />
Good way to test the purity of beverages is to let them go flat, like completely flat, but protected from outside contaminates (like dust) and put it in the freezer for a few hours. If it's super pure, it will stay in liquid form until you agitate it (give it a knock). That will introduce nitrogen (most of the air we breathe) and create a nucleation point for the water to form crystals around. You will literally see ice rapidly form in front of you.
Check out these two super short videos:

<li>It's not the sugar!
It is the sugar. Now go brush your teeth.</li>
<li>But it's sugar free!
OK, but it's not additive and impurity free (see item 8 and still go brush your teeth)</li>
<li>You are misleading people by omitting X,Y, and Z!
See item freaking 1</li>
<li>Are you a teacher?
Nope, not anymore – but I was in Japan, Germany and Korea for a long time.</li>
<li>It's about the carbon dioxide saturation level.
Saturation of carbon dioxide is indeed a huge contributing factor, but it's not the mechanism by which it's released from solution.</li>
<li>
<p>Could you explain the effects with alcohol more? I’m a bartender and noticed how there are far less bubbles when the liquor is in the cup first (Shout out to /u/kitcatpaddywhack and first direct addressing of surface tension)
Basically all the same as sugar. The difference between bottles and open air is pressure. To go with the house analogy, the bottle (or keg, or can) is like a tarp over the holes that the termites ate in the roof. They keep the pressure in the house and help hold the roof together so the balloons can't get out.
Notice that if you pour some carbonated beverage on the ground, it goes flat much quicker than in an open cup, even though both are exposed to open air? That's because the gaps between the molecules are further apart allowing the pressure to regulate quicker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Part of that is probably because alcohol has a much weaker surface tension than water, meaning it isn't nearly as capable of holding bubbles. When you mix alcohol into anything, it'll go flat much quicker. That's why it's impossible to buy anything fizzy stronger than maybe 13%. (Shoutout to /u/XMilkyMoo)
Right, not only does it dilute the solution but it weakens the bonds (surface tension). For a more in depth dive, take a look at competition between van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds in relation to an alcohol solution (you will probably have to replace alcohol with ethanol for the right research papers). I know my wording is way off, but Google scholar will get the gist.</p>

<p>A lot of factors go into carbonation level and bubble generation...but high pressure, low temperature, high carbon dioxide, low additives, and few nucleation sites keeps the most gas in the solution.</p>
<p>As someone who likes to carbonate random stuff with dry ice, I can tell you that not all ‘carbonated’ liquids hold gas the same and you can add different amounts to it. Even among sodas, barqs has bite and mountain dew is smooth on purpose.</p>
<p>Really easy to make water and watery drinks like koolaid very painfully fizzy, while OJ and milk don’t hold it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
