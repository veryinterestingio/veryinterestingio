		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pi is an irrational number. This means pi cannot be written as the ratio of two integers. There are many proofs to show pi is irrational. but they are all pretty involved, and not really ELI5. There is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_that_%CF%80_is_irrational" target="_blank">wiki page on it</a>.</p>
<p>One of the properties of <em>all</em> irrational numbers (not just pi) is that they will always have non-ending and non-repeating decimal parts. The proof for this is much easier, but I'll work through a specific example, and the proof is just the general version of it.</p>
<hr />
<p>Proving irrational numbers must NOT end or repeat is the same as showing that every decimal that DOES end or repeat is not irrational (i.e. is rational).</p>
<p>EDIT to clarify 'repeating': By repeating I mean that eventually the decimals have a repeating sequence of digits, and once the repeating starts it goes on forever. </p>
<p>So 1.9876456456... doesn't repeat in the beginning, but eventually has the repeating &quot;456&quot; forever (and so it rational). And 1.2222229037... does repeat in the beginning, but eventually stops (so is irrational).</p>
<p>If the decimal ends:</p>
<p>Say x = 14.4245. Multiply by 10^4 = 10000 to get rid of the decimal part. You get 144245. To get the original number back, just divide again by 10^4: 144245/10000. Since both the numerator and denominator are integers, the original number was rational. You can generalize this to show any decimal that ends is rational by multiplying and dividing by the appropriate power of 10 to ger rid of the decimal part.</p>
<p>If the decimal never ends, but repeats:</p>
<p>Say x = 14.5124874874874... (the 874 keeps repeating). </p>
<p>Then</p>
<p>10^4 * x = 145124.874874...   (so only the repeating part is after the decimal)</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>10^7 * x = 145124874.874874...   (so there is just one repeating pattern before decimal)</p>
<p>Then subtract:</p>
<p>10^(7)x - 10^(4)x  = 145124874.874874... - 145124.874874...  </p>
<p>x * (10^7 - 10^(4))  =  145124874.874874... - 145124.874874...  </p>
<p>x = (145124874.874874... - 145124.874874...) / (10^7 - 10^4)</p>
<p>Since the numerator is an integer (the decimal parts are the same and so subtract away), and the denominator is an integer, x is a rational number. You can generalize this to show that any decimal that has a repeating part is rational by multiplying by the appropriate powers of 10.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Words to know: an irrational number, like pi, is &quot;endless.&quot; A rational number, like 1/2, can be expressed as the ratio of two whole numbers. Irrational numbers are everything else. All numbers are one or the other, but not both. 1/3 is rational even though if you write it as a decimal the decimal never ends.</p>
<p>Short answer: A common way is what is called proof by contradiction. We pretend that the irrational number is actually rational and show that means something impossible is true (like 1==0). Since that can't be the case, the number isn't rational. Therefore it is irrational.</p>
<p>Such proofs tend to be fairly technical so it's hard to do an ELI5 for them. Wikipedia has several proofs for sqrt(2) being irrational. I remember a fairly straightforward proof by contradiction in my abstract math textbook, but I no longer have it and I don't see it on the wikipedia page. I think it was similar to the proof by infinite descent but its been years.</p>
<p>EDIT: Yes, your &quot;I'm only five&quot; comments are all original and hilarious. Rule 4. There is a reason we don't teach abstract math to actual 5 year olds. But I can add a less complete explanation that hopefully gets the point across:</p>
<p>To prove an irrational number c is irrational, we assume that it actually wasn't irrational. This means we can find two counting numbers a and b, where a/b=c. We then do some math with a and b to show that if a and b exist, 0=1. Since 0 does not actually equal 1, a and b can't exist. So c has to be irrational.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Math is like a game where you can pick your rules, but you MUST play by them wherever that leads. So, this game starts with the normal rules we learn about numbers.</p>
<p>We imagine what pi would be like if it did have an end, and then look at things that MUST be true for this pi-with-an-end. Pretty soon we'll see one of these facts says the opposite of one of the rules we were working with in the first place, so we can't have pi-with-an-end in this game without dropping a rule we need or adding an ugly exception for no good reason.</p>
<p>This is similar to when people say dividing by 0 is undefined. We could add a rule to make it mean something, but one of the consequences for the game is that we can then prove ANY number to be equal to any other number, like 1 = 2. A game with those rules doesn't have much else to do, so nobody plays in it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ooooo! Something I’m qualified to answer.
You prove it mathematically! The math is rather involved so I’ll give a high-level explanation and link a proof if you want to dive deeper.</p>
<p>For this specific proof you pretend that it is a Rational number and then set up a case where you can show that the math breaks down into impossibilities. For example in <a href="https://mindyourdecisions.com/blog/2013/11/08/proving-pi-is-irrational-a-step-by-step-guide-to-a-simple-proof/" target="_blank">this proof</a> they show that if pi is rational, then the function they set up evaluates to a number that is both between 0 and 1, and also an integer. Which is clearly impossible. And since the only assumption being made is that pi is rational, you know it’s false.</p>
<p>In general, this strategy of proof is called a proof by contradiction. You assume that A is true and then prove that If A is true then it leads to something that isn’t possible. You’re looking for holes in your own theory. </p>
<p>Yeah I know this isn’t exactly explaining the math, it’s just more of a breakdown of proofs in general. I still think it’s a decent explanation of how we can KNOW that pi is irrational.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
