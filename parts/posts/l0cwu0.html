		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lysosomes need low pH because pH has an effect on protein folding. At neutral pH, the enzymes in lysosomes aren’t folded in a shape to do anything (it is sequestered, active site is being hidden away due to its shape). At low pH, it folds into something that reveals its active site and then can start breaking down stuff. </p>
<p>This is important because you don’t want the enzymes to be active at neutral pH like the cytosol because it can mess up the cytoplasm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Acidification ist also needed for protein sorting from the secretory route. When are bringe Transportes from the ER to the golgi apparatus the compartments slowly become more acidic. Proteins that are normally located to the ER, but now are in the ERGIC or cis-golgi can bind to a certain receptor, that will be recyceled to the ER. This binding only occurs under mildly acidic conditions and the proteins lose their affinity for the receptor under ER conditions.   </p>
<p>Furthermore some lysosomal proteins are not even stable under non lysosomal conditions, so they simply do not degrade cargo, that ist not meant for degradation (not become active prematurely).</p>
<p>Another function of acidification ist most relevant for professional phagocytes. Low pH helps Rhode cells kill internalized pathogene or reduce their vitality.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Low pH in lysosomes also traps many basic molecules inside the lysosome. Many marketed drugs are slightly basic and under acidic conditions in the lysosome they drugs become protonated and bear a positive charge. Charged (polar) molecules do not partition through lipophilic membranes very easily and are trapped in the lysosome for degradation. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is known as pH &amp; pKA partitioning theory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because at that low pH the enzymes inside the lysosome have an appropriate geometry to reveal its active site and in order to degrade proteins. And why doesn't it just have enzyme that work at neutral pH? Because if it did, when the enzymes were released into the cytosol, they could destroy proteins that are needed for the proper functioning of the cell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Proteins denature at low pHs--to be more exact, individual proteins have an optimal pH where they can exist and function. Outside that range, they denature. Extremes like low pH would certainly disrupt hydrogen bonds that keep the protein folded, which would then cause the proteins to unravel and allow more surface area/direct target for lysosomes to break them down. The lysosome itself has several digestive enzymes that are optimized to work in this low pH so that they can break down other proteins.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
