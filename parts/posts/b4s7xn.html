It makes it so that being deliberate with your thoughts is more difficult, giving way to automatic thought, which for some people is unhealthy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s something called “sundowning” in patients with Alzheimer’s and dementia where the longer the day goes on, the worse the symptoms become. I have a handful of co-morbid mental illnesses and I experience the same things you do. As soon as the sun goes down, my thoughts get dark as well. I wonder if it has to do with often being more isolated at night or if it’s just fatigue. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>your brain needs to recover from being busy which is what sleep is for. the longer you don't sleep the less control you have over yourself making you more prone to have slip ups. sunlight also effects the mood, which obviously is absent at night. another thing that happens is that people are less distracted at night because during the day there are more things to do, when you have nothing to do its harder to distract yourself making thoughts more intrusive and symptoms less manageable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who deals with their mental health too, I think it also has to do with how when night comes people sleep. When you are having mental health issues, these issues impact <em>you</em>, and you might need other people to help you. But when these people are inaccessible at night, you can become lonelier or fall into thought loops that others during the daytime might help you to stay out of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has also to do with the fact that at night we are generally relaxing. It may seem paradoxical, but during the day you're doing so much usually that all that other stuff gets shoved out of your awareness. Then you get home and begin relaxing. Your defenses are down and now everything can &quot;bubble up&quot; a lot more easily. </p>
<p>I'm a therapist and I used to have a client that suffered from awful, nightly panic attacks. They only happened when she came home from work and began relaxing, which then of course made her scared of relaxing and increased her anxiety and the cycle fed itself at that point. So the focus of our therapy came to be about how she could take care of herself during the day and provide mental reprieve for herself through her day to day routine so she wouldn't be stuck with a barrage of anxious thoughts and feelings she had just shoved away to deal with &quot;later.&quot;</p>
<p>I hope this helps and makes sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
