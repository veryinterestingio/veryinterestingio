What exactly makes it more transmissible and does that change the currently accepted measures (masks or distancing making less of a difference for example)?

<p>That figure was based on <em>computational modelling</em>, which provided values with large confidence intervals. The more information we get, we can reduce those confidence intervals. The values are now around 30-56%</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Besides what I said in the other comment (again this is related to the old &quot;new strain&quot;; D614);</p>
<p>Another paper suggests that the new variant <strong>has a greater production of the spike protein</strong> so perhaps this results in an increased chance to &quot;hook&quot; onto one the host's cells during infection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>this increased entry correlates with less S1-domain shedding and higher S-protein incorporation into the virion.  </p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33243994/" target="_blank"><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33243994/" target="_blank">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33243994/</a></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Vis-a-vis the newest mutation:</em></strong></p>
<p>However this does seem potentially relevant to the newest strain (which most people. focus on the fact that it contains the N501Y mutation) which might result in the <strong>spike protein being more frequently in the open state - which is required for viral entry</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The predicted <strong>occupancies</strong> for the N501Y mutant compared to those of the wild type (in parenthesis) are 54.3% (25.8%) and 45.7% (74.2%) for the open and closed states, respectively. Therefore, the <strong>N501Y mutant shows a doubling of the occupancy of the open state</strong> with the concomitant decrease of the occupancy of the closed state. Therefore, the N501Y mutant shows a doubling of the occupancy of the open state with the concomitant decrease of the occupancy of the closed state. Additionally, this mutation was shown to also increase binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor relative to the wild type with a Î”log10(KD,app) of 0.24 [53]. Therefore, we predict that N501Y has a strong potential to contribute to increased transmission. The calculations above were performed in the context of D614. However, the double mutant representing the N501Y mutation in the context of G614 has equally shifted occupancies with values of 35.06% and 64.04% for the open and closed state respectively.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other comments have explained the ACE2 binding change well but I would add this on the prevention measures:</p>
<p>There's not yet evidence that social distancing measures would be less effective in mechanical terms (i.e the distance the virus travels through air or time it remains infectious on surfaces)</p>
<p>But social distancing is generally not followed perfectly and increased transmissibility means the consequences of that are worse because the Rt transmission rate (average # each case infects) is higher. </p>
<p>The Davies et al paper basically suggests that measures that could keep the Rt of the previous variant to 0.9, for example, may not get it below 1 for the new variant because the increase in infectiousness translates to a significant rise (not sure if proportionally the same, i.e. 56%) in Rt under the same conditions. </p>
<p>This may partly be because people seem to become infectious quicker after the virus gets into their body, making asymptomatic transmission more likely. </p>
<p>However total lockdown measures might work better, they suggest, because of this earlier infectious period, which is by definition likely to end sooner after exposure if severity remains the same.</p>
<p>In essence Davies and co say social distancing will have to be much more strongly enforced to get Rt below 1 - they seem pretty set on school closures.</p>
<p>Faster vaccination is necessary to mitigate the effects of the variant because total lockdown is economically &amp; ethically unsustainable (afaik they didn't model further than 6-month effect of lockdown for January only)</p>

<p>Our scientists believe the mutated viruses have a higher affinity (and thus probability) of latching onto ACE2 receptors, and as such infecting a cell. Furthermore, there seems to be 2 other mutations that might create antibody escape (repulsion?)... but that is still to early to confirm. The bottomline is higher viral loads, and as such, higher ability to spread (especially pre-symptomatically).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
