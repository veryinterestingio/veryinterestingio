		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the sound you're hearing is sound coming out of a round chamber. When the glass fills with water, the size of the chamber changes, so the pitch changes. Large chamber, low pitch. Small chamber, high pitch. It's why digieridoos are deep and rumbly while ocarinas are high pitched and whiny.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another interesting thing is the temperature of the water can change the sound of the pour. Like, enough that people can tell if the water is hot or cold by listening to a recording.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An empty vessel like a glass or bottle is essentially a sound chamber with a resonate frequency (think of blowing across a bottle top to make it ring).</p>
<p>The distance between the bottom and top of the vessel determines the vessel's resonate frequency (where sound waves of corresponding length vibrate longer than than others). </p>
<p>As the water rises, the distance between the bottom and top of the vessel decreases, which means shorter waves will vibrate longer. Shorter sound waves equals higher pitch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sound is bouncing off the glass, and the pitch gets hugged as less of the glass is above water level. This is why people can play music on the rims of glasses filled with different levels of water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
