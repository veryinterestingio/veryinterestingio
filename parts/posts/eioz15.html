		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a variety of factors</p>
<p>Australia's geographical position has a lot to do with it. Australia is south of the high-moisture tropical belt that Indonesia and New Guinea are in. It sits under the subtropical high-pressure belt, which prevents the lifting of air required for rain.</p>
<p>Another factor is sheer size. The coastal areas of Australia actually get a lot of rain, but this drains the moisture out of the air so there isn't any left to get to core of the continent. Where-as New Zealand is much narrower so the clouds get a chance to rain on the whole sub-continent.</p>
<p>The other part of this is mountains, or the lack there of. Australia doesn't have any significant mountain ranges so there is no geography to force moisture laden air upwards to seed mountains and glaciers with snow. This prevents river systems from forming like we get in North+South America. The Amazon in the South and Prairies in the North only exist because of the climate caused by the mountain ranges to their West.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something I haven't seen mentioned here is that parts of Australia <em>are</em> lushly forested. I live in Far North Queensland, closer to PNG than Brisbane, and the whole coast up here is tropical rainforest. We get about 2000mm of rain a year, mainly during our monsoon season (November to May).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think anyone has mentioned that Australia is an incredibly old continent with almost no geological activity. Volcanic action replenishes the soils, turning up and cycling nutrients. But Australia hasn't had any of this in a very long time. So the soils loose all their nutrition and only very hardy, long lived plants are able to establish and grow. This little vegetation means that when it does rain in the dry areas (yes, the centre of Australia does indeed flood), the water isn't &quot;held onto&quot; by anything and basically just washes away and gets evaporated.</p>
<p>Country's like the ones you've mentioned, especially NZ experience a lot of volcanic activity, so they rich soils for vegetation. The east coast of Australia is the youngest part of the country and has experienced the most recent volcanic activity, so has the best soils. It's also the wettest and most lush.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tasmania is part of Australia, FYI (I’m sure you know this but the way you phrased the question made it unclear).</p>
<p>Tasmania has recently seen one of the hottest days in recorded history at 40.8C (that’s 105.4F). Like Victoria &amp; New South Wales, Tassie has also been affected by fires, like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2019/dec/31/tasmanian-fire-burns-through-the-night-video?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other" target="_blank">this</a> one, not far from the state capital, Hobart.</p>
<p>I think some of the images commonly seen on Reddit depict Tassie as mostly rainforest but rainfall varies dramatically across the island state with Hobart the second driest capital city in Australia (after <a href="https://www.discovertasmania.com.au/about/climate-and-weather" target="_blank">Adelaide</a> ). Even the rainforest in Tasmania has caught fire &amp; burned <a href="https://firecentre.org.au/the-2019-tasmanian-fires-so-far-what-has-burned-and-where/" target="_blank">this year</a> including swathes of the Wilderness World Heritage Area; pretty scary stuff imo.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
