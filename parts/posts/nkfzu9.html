		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do pick up the audio. But the phone &quot;knows&quot; exactly what electrical signal it is outputting to the speakers create the audio; even with a simple electrical circuit, you can subtract that same signal from what is being output output by the microphone and transmitted over the phone line. That will cancel out most of the noise that was produced by the speakers and hopefully prevent the feedback you normally get with a microphone closer to a speaker.</p>
<p>It's why if people are talking over each other on the phone you tend to get dropped audio and it just becomes garbled instead of it being very noisy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do, and it is very difficult to mitigate.</p>
<p>The first step is to isolate the speaker and the microphone from the chassis, as sound is a vibration and the chassis will transmit it better than air. Ths is mechanical engineers job, and it is not easy, esp. on a cramped cell phone.</p>
<p>The next step is to use specific microphones that are directional, and will only pickup sound from a very near source.</p>
<p>Then there is active noise cancellation, where a secondary (or more) microphone records the ambient noise to &quot;substract&quot;it from the one coming from the primary microphone. This is done by software. </p>
<p>Finally, there are various filters, both software and hardware, to eliminate unwanted noise, like echo and larsen. some are integrated in chips, others need to be coded. People often use both.</p>
<p>TL;DR: the microphone picks this up, but phones are made to remove it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One very important point - conferencing software never feeds the sound from your microphone back to your speakers. They feed that sound to everyone else, but never to you. This means you can't get the short-loop feedback howl that is really easy to get in a PA. But you can get the long-loop warble from a loop that goes into your mic, out of someone else's speakers, into their mic, back to your speakers, and to your mic.</p>
<p>Another thing they do is detect when you are speaking, and adjust the speaker volume down and the mic volume up, then restore the speaker volume and cut the mic once you stop. It doesn't make for a good result, but it works. </p>
<p>You can also use a 'comb filter'. Carve regular notches our of the speaker sound, so that a graph of the frequency response looks like a comb. Then filter the frequencies that remain in the speaker output, from the microphone, with a 'complementary' filter. The sound you get from such a setup is - well, ugly - but at least you can get rid of the worst echo.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Sound's system in phones has something called &quot;negative feedback loop&quot;</p>
<p>which basically means that it subtracts the output sound from the inputs sound.</p>
<p>here is what it does in a function form</p>
<p>(person voice + phone voice) - <strong>(phone voice from feedback loop)</strong> = person voice</p>
<p>the bold <strong>phone voice</strong> is the signal fed through by the negative feedback loop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
