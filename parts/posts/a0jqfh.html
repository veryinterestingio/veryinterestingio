		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the language.</p>
<p>Generally, if a new noun is borrowed from a language that has gendered nouns, the gender will be preserved.</p>
<p>In Italian, new nouns are masculine by default.</p>
<p>In French, new nouns are assigned a gender by the Académie Française, which is the legal authority on the French language.  New nouns are masculine by default unless there is a logical reason they should be feminine.</p>
<p>German has a set of semantic rules to determine the gender of a word.</p>
<p>In any language, there many be a degree of popular confusion for a little while, with some using one gender and some using the other, until things eventually settle on one side or the other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Russian, it almost always depends on the sounds that the new word ends in. For example, “Инстаграм” (“Instagram”) is masculine as it ends in a consonant. Words ending in “-a” are feminine. Words ending in “-o” are neuter. I simplify, of course, but this rule covers the vast majority of cases.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Danish, the gender of the noun is in most cases decided by the gender of its Danish translation. Example: cover in Danish is omslag, which is common gender. Therefore, cover is common gender as well. Other examples of this are &quot;band - orkester&quot;, &quot;slogan, motto/valgsprog&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I know that English is a Germanic language and contains a many loan words (many, *many* of them being French), yet English is not a gendered language.
