<p>Does it amount to the proton being fully disassociated into its quarks, one electron and one up quark combine to form a down quark, and then the quarks reassociate into a neutron?  This fits with charge conservation, e + u --&gt; d, -1 + 2/3 = -1/3</p>
<p>What role do bosons play in this, are there any intermediate steps involving antiparticles, and are neutrinos and/or photons released?  Are these byproducts part of the output of a neutron star?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming you're wondering about electron capture decays of nuclei, or the formation of a neutron star?</p>
<p>The proton doesn't dissociate into quarks. The transition is governed by quantum mechanics, so it's really just an up quark and an electron being destroyed and a down quark and a neutrino being created. And we can use quantum mechanics to calculate the probability per unit time of the transition between those two states.</p>
<p>When you do that calculation, you just apply the time evolution operator from quantum mechanics to the initial state, and project that onto the final state. </p>
<p>Where bosons and intermediate steps fit in is that you can choose to expand this time evolution operator into an infinite series of terms with all the possible operators that can connect the initial state to the final state. Some of these terms may <em>look like</em> there are intermediate particles created and destroyed. These are called virtual particles, and you shouldn't take them literally, because that can lead you to misleading or even nonsensical conclusions. For example, the first term in this expansion for electron capture would involve a W boson being created and destroyed as an intermediate state. But the energies released by electron capture decays are typically at least around 10000 times lower than the mass of a W boson, so obviously no physical W boson can be produced by this process. And the series contains infinitely many other terms with various other operators representing the creation and destruction of intermediate particles, even ones which can't physically be produced without violating conservation of energy. In other words, for these particles to &quot;exist&quot; in these intermediate states, they need to disobey their equations of motion. So you can't really say that these particles are physically being produced and destroyed, it's just an artifact of the choice we made to expand the time evolution operator in this infinite series.</p>
<p>The real, physical particles involved are the up quark and electron in the initial state, and the down quark and neutrino in the final state.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
