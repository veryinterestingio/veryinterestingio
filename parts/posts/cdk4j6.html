		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different silent letters are there for different reasons.</p>
<p>Some are there because they didn't used to be silent. The K in knife and knight used to be pronounced, and the gh in knight used to be pronounced like the ch in loch or the h in Ahmed.</p>
<p>In other cases, a silent letter was deliberately added to be more like the Latin word it evolved from. The word debt comes from the French <em>dette</em>, and used to be spelled dette in English too, but we started spelling it debt because in Latin it was <em>debitum</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh I know this one! Because they used to not be. </p>
<p>I asked a Spanish teacher once why H's are silent and he explained that they weren't always silent. </p>
<p>Take the english word &quot;name&quot; he said. It used to be pronounced &quot;nah-may&quot;, but over time, we emphasized the first vowel more and more until the m sound merged with the long A and the E became silent. </p>
<p>Some silent letters were pronounced by themselves and some changed the way letters around them sounded. But eventually the pronunciation shifted, but the spelling did not.</p>
<p>Edit to add: and we have to keep the spelling because how a word looks signifies its root origins so we can know its meaning. (Weigh vs Way, Weight vs Wait)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to all the other answers, one thing I haven't seen mentioned is that while some letters might be silent, they're not always <em>purposeless</em>. For example, if you take nearly any three letter word in English that follows the pattern consonant-vowel-consonant (which there are MANY), the vowel will be &quot;short&quot;. But if you put an &quot;e&quot; on the end of that word, the &quot;e&quot; is silent but it makes the other vowel be pronounced &quot;long&quot;.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>sin --&gt; sine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>car --&gt; care</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ton --&gt; tone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>met --&gt; mete</p>
</li>
<li>cut --&gt; cute</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing that I haven't seen mentioned is that early modern scholars were big fans of latin (this is also the origin of 'you can't end a sentence with a preposition' which was true for latin but not for english). There were several words which had changed pronunciation, where some letters stopped being pronounced. And this <em>was</em> reflected in the spelling, but the latin-fans changed them back. Off the top of my head, 'debt' was often spelled 'dette', but the b was reinserted because it was present (and pronounced) in the latin root.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to previous answers about letters originally being articulate or to mark etymology, one other cause is that there are more sounds in English than the Latin alphabet, so inevitably the leftover letters either have to have new letters created for them, or just use combinations of existing ones. When the language became standardized due to the printing press and education, extra letters dropped out of use.</p>
<p>For example, you know that &quot;Ye Olde Shoppe&quot; thing you always see in things? In addition to the final silent e's which used to be pronounced, the phrase has another history hiding in there: the &quot;Ye&quot; is actually a simplification of &quot;Þe&quot; where &quot;Þ&quot; is capital thorn, the old letter used for what we now use the digraph &quot;th&quot; for. </p>
<p>The letter &quot;Y&quot; happened to look like a capital thorn to English speakers then, so that's why it replaced it when things were getting simplified and standardized. Add one more change down the timeline, and you realize that the phrase is really &quot;The Olde Shoppe.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
