<p><em>But</em> it is possible to measure an object's speed relative to the cosmic background radiation. The cosmic background radiation is the afterglow from the big bang, it is pretty much the same (with small variations) in all directions. If there is a universal rest frame in the universe, that's it.    </p>
<p>Our velocity relative to the cosmic background radiation is about 370 km/s, in the direction of the constellation Leo.  That's about 0.1% of the speed of light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I once got caught in a blizzard on a snowboard. I couldn’t see so I slowed down and stopped to regroup.
Then I sat down.
Turns out i hadn’t stopped, it was just so white and noisy and powdery that I had no cues left about my speed relative to earth. </p>
<p>I ate shit in the most unexpected way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
