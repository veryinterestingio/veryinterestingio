		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is because it is human nature to always want to rationalize and justify self actions. People believe that they should decide for themselves what is good and what is not.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If a person just gives in to another than it is only natural for a person to feel like a piece of their free will is being taken away.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I believe this is also why reverse psychology also works so well. It is by human nature to want to be in control of your own body and make your own decisions even if in making that decision it still leads a person to do something he/she did not want to do in the first place.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Furthermore, this also has to do with our natural-born selfishness. We want to put ourselves first before even thinking about what the other person's needs are. We grew up with this line of thinking. Humans know it coming out of the womb and don't need to be taught it. Others decisions can cause the mind to think &quot;Hey, if it's not my own decision, it may not be ultimately looking out for number one.&quot;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I hope I explained it well enough. You can always ask me follow-up questions too if you need.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a process involving [reactance](<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactance_(psychology" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactance_(psychology</a>) in which the person feels that their freedom of choice is being limited or threatened by whatever the prohibition is, so they rebel by doing whatever it is they were just told not to do.  Funny enough you can minimize someone's reactance simply by adding the phrase <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/blog/post/read-this-but-of-course-you-are-free-to-refuse" target="_blank">&quot;of course your free to refuse...&quot;</a> to whatever the rule or request is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of it is how you are wording it. </p>
<p>For instance, &quot;don't think about pink elephants.&quot; What are you thinking about right now.</p>
<p>Instead of saying &quot;dont put your feet on the coffee table,&quot; say &quot;it's important that everyone keeps their feet on the floor.&quot;</p>
<p>Instead of saying &quot;dont chew with your mouth open,&quot; say &quot;it's important that we all chew with our mouths closed.&quot;</p>
<p>This is actually addressed by Yale Prof Dr Kazdin
of the book The Kazdin Method for Parenting the Defiant Child.  He specializes in children psychology and actually has free courses online. Instead of focusing on the negatives, focus on the Positive Opposites.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Somehow doubling down makes them feel more that they're actually right and the mere hint that they're wrong is just false. Laws of Nature or Common Courtesy be damned they'll do it anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
