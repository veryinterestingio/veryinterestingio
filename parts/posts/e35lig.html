		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An embolism is when air gets into your blood stream. And because the blood is at higher pressure then the air this will not happen even if you get a cut. This is just an issue when using syringes or compressed air. It is true that air will get trapped between the tissue after a surgery but not in the blood stream. This trapped air will just sit there and not do any damage. Eventually it will diffuse through the cell walls and into the blood just like it would in a lung. The oxygen will get used by the cells of the body as usual and any other gasses will get released into your lungs. Pockets of trapped air can be visible on scans right after a surgery or serious injury but will soon disappear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer this properly we would have to go in to a whole physics lecture on gas solubility of the blood.</p>
<p>The short answer is any nitrogen left in your abdominal cavity will not be absorbed quickly and will likely cause bloating and phrenic nerve irritation resulting in shoulder pain.</p>
<p>It will eventually be absorbed into the blood stream by dissolving in the blood itself - it doesn’t get absorbed as a “gas bubble”.</p>
<p>Usually laparoscopic procedures use CO2 (an easily absorbed gas) to minimize the nitrogen that is introduced into the abdomen.</p>
<p>If it’s an open procedure then you just have pain for a couple days after. It’s not harmful - just irritating.</p>
<p>(SOURCE: I give anesthesia in operating rooms all day erryday)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't, unless it's a procedure like laproscopy where they actively inflate the abdomen to improve visibility. In those cases most of the excess air is pumped out because it would be too uncomfortable to leave in.</p>
<p>Any excess air left behind is just absorbed into the blood over time. To cause an embolism there needs to be a large volume that quickly enters a blood vessel, enough to form a bubble somewhere. But since it's in the abdominal cavity (for example) it is absorbed so slowly there isn't really a chance of that happening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>3 months post op.  I had a shit ton of air left inside me.  It hurt a lot.  The air would travel around and caused a lot of discomfort and straight up horrible pain.  The shoulders hurt the most.  The air would somehow get up into the muscles in the shoulder region and cause a very bad pinching twisting pain.  Walking helped.  Lots of burping and some extra farting, but mostly burping.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
