		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's how I would explain to an actual 5 year old:</p>
<p>The beads in the softener have millions of little hands. They hold onto regular old salt until something they like better goes by (like hardness or certain other things). When they're full of things they like and you want them to let go (regenerate), you put a lot of salt in there and they let go of the things they had grabbed onto because they want to touch all the salt going by. When the the salt is starting to run out at the end of the rinse, there's nothing left but salt to grab onto. So they hold onto it until something better comes by. Rinse and repeat (literally).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's other systems for dealing with hard water, too. The &quot;H2FLow&quot; anti-scale system employs &quot;Template Assisted Crystallization,&quot; which uses resin beads to accumulate dissolved calcium compounds into larger particles that don't stick to pipes &amp; shower glass, but it needs a carbon filter in front of it to remove chlorine from the water, and the carbon filter needs a sediment filter in front of it, to keep from clogging the carbon filter - so you end up with three filters in series. I've got two sets of these to condition the water coming into my house.</p>
<p>The classical &quot;ion exchange&quot; system to treat hard water at 10gpg (grains per gallon), you end up with 80mg/liter of sodium, about 4x the recommended limit for someone on a low-sodium diet. Some of these systems produce water with up to 300mg sodium/liter (reference below).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Salt is actually two types of atoms bound together, and they have a loose bond - once salt gets into water, it dissolves. This means the atoms float around by themselves. However, some other molecules can form from the leftovers, molecules which do not have a loose bond. These include the other minerals, which bind with parts of the dissolved salt, and drop to the bottom as solid materials, which are easily filtered out. </p>
<p>Now, a water softener uses some other smart tricks to remove the salt, but this is the basic version - salt dissolves, other materials form from the leftovers. We can use the same principle to clean water of lots of other unwanted things, and I recall a science project we had in high school where we went to a sewage plant and collected some, well, sewage water, and had to clean it using, basically, filtering and this method. My group's water ended up crystal clear - but quite toxic, as we hadn't figured out how to get the pH value down to normal levels.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
