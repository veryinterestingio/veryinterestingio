		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The smothering helps, but mostly it's just cooling down the burning material. Heating up the water cools the fuel down a lot, but when water evaporates it pulls a lot more heat out of the fuel.</p>
<p>Edit: Reworded some things. Glad to know my chemical engineering degree's still useful to people even after moving out of the field.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water both cools and smothers a fire depending on how you apply it. If saturated or sprayed in a heavy fog pattern it will cool the fire by removing heat both latent (liquid to steam) and sensible (cold water to hot water) by doing this it removes energy from the fire . Going from liquid to steam takes a lot of energy. It can smother a fire as well when going from liquid to steam water can expand by about 1600 times in volume this will displace the air in the space and break the fire triangle (air,heat fuel).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Certified but retired firefighter here.</p>
<p>Fires have to have four things to exist, we call this the fire tetrahedron.</p>
<ol>
<li>Fuel</li>
<li>Oxidizer</li>
<li>Heat</li>
<li>Chemical Reaction</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s the 4th one that most people don’t know or remember and is missing in the fire triangle.</p>
<p>Water works in different ways for different fires. A simple wood fire the water cools the wood (heat) and penetrates into it creating a barrier between the wood (fuel) and the air (oxidizer). Water is very effective here.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that when water is used lots of steam is created. This is because water expands over 1700 times when converted to steam.</p>
<p>Fire fighters plan for different scenarios where things like the fuel sources or oxidizer change for example. Additives to the water (detergents) help create foam and increase the penetration of the water so it soaks in. Ever have water sit on the surface of your clothes or couch, we want it to soak in immediately.</p>
<p>For more learning look at chemical fire suppression  agents like fm220 and fm200. They work by preventing the chemical reaction. A common misconception is that they remove oxygen from the area. Additionally,Take a look at steam converting a room.</p>
<p>Fire science was so interesting to me and many of you may find it interesting as well. Contact your local fire department and see if they have a citizens fire academy type class. You might get to experience several aspects of fire fighter life including:</p>
<p>Protective equipment - bunker gear, SCBA
Fire apparatuses - tankers, engines, ladder.
Fire fighting tools - nozzles, hoses, hand tools, foams, saws, ladders.
Fire science - How and why it exists. How to “kill” it.
Rescue - Cut up automobiles! Rappel!
Communications - radios and 911 dispatch
Fire command - scene control, public relations, incident command
Safety - man down alarms, strobes
Emergency Medical - cpr, triage, etc
Firefighting history - fire insurance, fire fighting around the world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fire requires 3 friends to survive:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fuel</li>
<li>Oxygen</li>
<li>Heat</li>
</ol>
<p>Water uses the heat from fire to itself heat up(forming water vapour) thus cooling the substance taking out 1 friend(heat)</p>
<p>Thus extinguishing fire.</p>
<p>Some might argue that it also cuts off oxygen which again takes out another friend. Making fire impossible to keep burning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The common fire needs four things to burn.</p>
<p>Fuel</p>
<p>Oxygen</p>
<p>Heat</p>
<p>And an uninterrupted chemical reaction. </p>
<p>You put enough of each of those into the equation, and you get fire. </p>
<p>Take out enough of one of them, no fire. </p>
<p>Water reduces heat, and displaces the oxygen. It separates the fuel and disturbs the uninterrupted chemical reaction.</p>
