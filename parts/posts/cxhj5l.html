		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have 2 kinds of photoreceptors in our eyes; rods and cones.</p>
<p>Cones are sensitive to color need a lot of light.<br />
Rods only detect levels of color but they can work with very little light.</p>
<p>Near the center of our vision we tend to have a lot of cones. That lets us see color in great detail during the day.</p>
<p>Around the periphery we have more rods. These let us see in lower light conditions.</p>
<p>So when you look to the side of a star more of the light will fall on parts of your eye with a lot of rods. That light may not be enough to activate cones but they'll activate rods.</p>
<p>An other issue is that rod density is lower than cone density in general which is why things look blurrier at night.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with the concentration of rods. Rods are not concentrated at the center of the retina. Instead, they are found off center. Therefore, if you look slightly to one side of the star, its faint light will fall on a more light-sensitive region of the retina.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sides of our vision specializes in brightness and movement. The center of our vision specializes in fine detail and color.</p>
<p>We can see distant stars better when we are not looking directly at them because that part of the eye is much better at detecting low light/low contrast.</p>
<p>An even more interesting question is <em>why</em> evolution has chosen this path. Ping me to learn more!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with a blind spot we have. The nerves in our eyes that eventually connect to our brain aren't really 'wired' perfectly, so there's a spot on our retina where the optic nerve fibers exit our eye and there aren't any light sensitive cones. So when something is being projected on that exact point of our retina, we can't see it. Like if you draw 2 dots on a paper, look at 1 and come closer, you can't see the second dot.</p>
