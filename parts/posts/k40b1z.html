Ghrelin goes up when it's usual time to eat and will go down after a couple of hours. Because I fast, I've noticed my ghrelin dips around 30 minutes after the initial spike.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is how a doc described it to me (I get super hungry a couple hours after eating, probably a mild hypoglycemia):</p>
<p>When you eat food, it gets broken down into glucose. Your body then produces insulin, which prompts your cells to take up the glucose and bring your blood sugar back down to the proper level. If your body (like mine) keeps making insulin a bit longer than needed, your blood sugar goes lower than the ideal, making you feel super hungry.</p>
<p>If you eat at this point, you start again and the cycle continues.</p>
<p>Alternately, if you power through the hunger your body will stop making insulin, your blood sugar levels will stabilize, and you won't feel starving again until you are &quot;really&quot; hungry -- that is, the readily available sugars in your cells are genuinely depleted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hormones is the answer.</p>
<p>Carbs are easy to use and access. If you eat them on a regular schedule your blood sugar follows a pattern.
And you can already prepare for incoming food by setting up the table and ringing the bell (i.e. hunger is that bell).</p>
<p>If no food delivery comes you switch to whatever you have in the pantry (body fat for example) and you get to preparing the pantry food by making and activating the tools hooded (enzymes by means of hormones).
Similarly you get the headache if a regular coffee user skips a day.
Our bodies have 24 hour clock.</p>
<p>You could look into the satiety hormone leptin and the interaction with insulin (carbs to fat storing and signalling hormone). High insulin levels block leptin for example.</p>
