		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are no Earth-based telescopes that come close to having the necessary resolution to identify the Apollo equipment.</p>
<p>However, there are a number of other ways in which we can observe the things our kind left on the Moon. One such way is through the Lunar Laser Ranging experiment. Multiple Apollo missions, including Apollo 11, left a &quot;retroreflector&quot; on the Moon. A retroreflector is somewhat similar to a mirror, except that it always reflects the incoming light back in the exact direction it came from, which a mirror doesn't do.</p>
<p>From Earth, we can point a laser at the spots where these retroreflectors were placed and then measure the reflection. The time it takes between sending the laser pulse and receiving the reflection back is a measure for the distance between the Earth and the Moon at that time. </p>
<p>Another piece of evidence is direct observation of the Apollo equipment, but not from an Earth-based telescope. Various projects have sent out lunar orbiters to study the Moon from its orbit, including high resolution photography.</p>
<p>NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has snapped some pictures of the Apollo 11 landing site: <a href="https://moon.nasa.gov/resources/128/lro-explores-the-apollo-11-landing-site/" target="_blank">https://moon.nasa.gov/resources/128/lro-explores-the-apollo-11-landing-site/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>Technically speaking</em>, yes, but the aperture of the telescope would have to be <strong>very, very big</strong>.</p>
<p>Let's start by ignoring atmospheric distortion of light, light pollution, bad weather, and what not. Everyone know physics is really about spherical cows in a vacuum.</p>
<p>In order to determine the resolution of a telescope you use the Rayleigh criterion, which says that two point sources of light can be resolved from each other if the angular distance θ between exceeds a certain number. If not, the blur together. The criterion can be expressed as</p>
<p>sin θ = k*λ / D</p>
<p>where λ is the wavelength of the light, D is the diameter of the aperture, and k = 1.2197. You can rearrange this as</p>
<p>D = k*λ / sin θ</p>
<p>Now, the Apollo 11 Lunar Module is 9.4 meters at its widest point (landing gear). The average distance from the Earth to the Moon is somewhere around 385 000 km or 3.85 * 10^(8) meters. Visible light has a wavelength of 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red), but let's use 400 nm as that will give us the smallest possible aperture for our giant telescope.</p>
<p>Substituting the numbers gives</p>
<p>D = 1.2197 * 4 * 10^(-7) m / (9.4 m / 3.85 * 10^(8) m) <strong>= 19.98 m</strong></p>
<p>This might not seem like a huge number but the largest optical telescope at the moment, at least according to Wikipedia, has an aperture of 11.8 m. Also, keep in mind that we made some pretty out there simplifications and assumptions and that this number is the <em>smallest possible</em> aperture for <em>barely</em> being able to distinguish to <em>violet</em> lights at <em>opposite ends of the landing gear</em>.</p>
<p>If we do the same calculations, but instead look at red light (700 nm) at opposite ends of the actual module (4.2 m), the aperture would have to be <strong>78.26 m</strong>. Keep in mind that this number is the bare minimum if you want to be able to just barely distinguish two red lights from one another, and it won't give you a clear image of anything. Wanna be able to distinguish one red line from another on a one by two meters American flag? Your telescope needs to have a diameter of almost <strong>two kilometers</strong>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A while back I was pretty involved in an astronomy forum and the question was often posed, how big of a telescope would be needed to see the US flag on the moon? The answer was, at that time, with the given pixel size of cameras being what they were circa 2008 let's say, that you would need a Reflecting telescope about 1320 feet wide to get the US flag (5'x3') to show up as a single pixel in a photo. </p>
<p>That would mean that same telescope/camera would probably be able to get the landing gear which is 31'(diagonally?) in a 5x5 pixel square.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
