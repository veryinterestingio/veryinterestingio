		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes we can. People have their hearts restarted or put on a bypass machine until they can heal or have surgery. Usually you have to be lucky enough to be in a hospital when that happens however. If your heart stops your brain is going to have about 3 mins before brain damage sets in. After 9 minutes the brain is essentially dead and revival isn't possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As other posters said, once the heart stops pumping, oxygen is no longer circulating to body tissues and they begin to starve and die. An imaginary clock starts once this occurs and you have between 3-5mins before the damage is irreversible even if the heart were to restart (no one truly knows exactly how long and it varies by age, how healthy the person is, temperature, and other factors... But it's minutes at best.)</p>
<p>Another reason that has not been mentioned already is when you die, blood is no longer moving (i.e. being pumped by the heart). Blood that slows down or stops moving begins to form clots inside the vessels, especially smaller ones. This initial process starts relatively quickly with the blood becoming thicker as microclots form. This also factors into the problems resuscitating someone who has been dead for minutes. Thick or clotting blood cannot be pumped effectively even if you restore pump function.</p>
<p>When CPR is performed on someone whose heart stopped, it is essentially doing what you are asking. It's an artificial means of maintaining the pumping function the heart is no longer doing while using other medications and interventions to try and restart the heart or reverse the underlying reason it stopped in the first place. With few exceptions, CPR or artificial cardiopulmonary resuscitation often fails and even for a witnessed cardiac arrest IN THE HOSPITAL (where you assume CPR starts almost immediately, and access to resuscitative medications are readily available) the chance of successfully reviving someone who later goes back to a normal life is somewhere around 25%. It is even worse if it is unwitnessed or occurs outside the hospital.</p>
<p>I am a doctor who works in an ICU and do CPR frequently as part of my job. It's unfortunate we do not have more tools or better ways of reviving people but one thing healthcare workers hate is how Hollywood portrays CPR (and defibrillation/shocking the heart) as magical tools that always bring someone back from death. Its portrayal on TV or in movies is often completely opposite to how it is in reality.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

EMS was there within 8 minutes but it was too late. They were able to get her heart beating but test results showed that her brain had gone without oxygen for too long and she would never resume consciousness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
