		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Launching rockets from a coastal area allows you to use a trajectory that's largely over open water so that in the event that there's a problem, there little to no chance that debris will come down in populated areas.</p>
<p>Note that there are some launches being done over land. For example, the White Sands area in New Mexico is used for some operations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a few concerns that led to the placement of these pads.</p>
<p>Generally speaking you want to launch rockets from as close to the equator as possible. The reason for this is that you are getting an extra speed boost from the Earth's spin. Imagine a spinning globe, the part around the equator is moving a LOT faster than a spot next to the poles. This quality isn't necessarily desired for all possible launches (for example, certain polar orbit launches), but for any that are ending up in orientations like Geostationary Orbit, it helps. You also don't have to waste as much of your thrust adjusting your orbital phase (angle) to align with those orbits.</p>
<p>Secondly, you want to launch rockets in directions that spend as little time pointed at people as possible. China's rocket launch facilities were built FARRRR inland and away from its borders during the Cold War because they were afraid someone might try to fire a cruise missile at it. This has led to incidents where parts of the rocket that were detached have landed in/on villages, and in one case a rocket tipped over and slammed into the ground virtually destroying an entire village. That latter incident is why modern launch industries require a self destruct system. Better to risk your unmanned launch pad or empty areas than having a massive bomb shove itself into a city. China is currently constructing a launch facility closer to the shore to avoid these issues. The various Cosmodrome's for Russia's launches ARE built in a desert and images of discovered rocket waste are always fun to see.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People here have covered why the launches are in Florida, but nobody's talked about why the human spaceflight center -- mission control, astronaut training, etc -- is in Houston.  The answer is politics.</p>
<p>A large number of sites were considered in 1962 for the home of NASA's manned spaceflight center, and originally, the current site wasn't even on the list.  #1 on the list was Macdill air force base in Florida, which was to be closed, but following the Cuban Missile Crisis the Air Force decided to keep it operating, and another site needed to be chosen.</p>
<p>The Houston center is now named after Lyndon Johnson, a Texas politician who was vice president and the head of the Space Council at the time.  But the biggest movers and shakers were Texas congressman Olin Teague, who convinced Rice University to donate the land the center now sits on, and powerful House appropriations committee chair Albert Thomas, who told the White House in no uncertain terms that if the president wanted his little moon expedition to get funding, his district in Houston was gonna have to see some of the benefits.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Florida instead of Nevada because it's further south, and along the coast because you can launch over the water and not risk populations below</p>
<p>There generally aren't any launch facilities in Texas, the NASA center in Texas does not perform launches</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Russia launches their rockets in the no man's land in Kazakhstan where you also sometimes see booster parts landing close to some homes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
