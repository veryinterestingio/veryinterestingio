		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a general rule of thumb: animals gradually evolve to larger and larger sizes as the environment permits, until the a change in the environment occurs (drought, food source goes extinct, etc) and then that large animal goes extinct because it has evolved to a size that required all of the existing food and is adapted to a very specific climate and any change in either of those things will lead to extinction. </p>
<p>Prehistoric animals had tens of millions of years of gradually reach enormous sizes (the Cretaceous Period lasted about 79 million years) whereas the last ice age ended only about 11,000 years ago. Anytime there is a dramatic environmental change, the massive animals tend to go extinct and the smaller and more environmentally adaptive species tend to survive and be the dominant lifeforms for the next age.</p>
<p>When you have a climate that is rich with biomass and it doesnâ€™t change dramatically for tens of millions of years, there is sufficient time and material for massive animals to evolve.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was thought to be because of higher oxygen levels and greater land masses. More recently we believe it's because of their physiological features hollow bones supporting more weight and bigger lungs supporting more oxygen growth. These along with the time allowed to evolve are our current theories on why so many prehistoric creatures were large.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Archaeologist hi. A lot of this is bias, no one talks about microfauna from the past which there were undoubtedly more of than megafauna. There's two main factors as to why we don't have giant sloths and large Pleistocene animals anymore though. </p>
<p>One is climactic, a lot of species change with climactic changes and are really contingent on that, so when the climate dips like it did at last glacial maximum (around 20000 years ago) a lot of species that were used to the warm Pleistocene have a hard time coping. </p>
<p>Another is those pesky humans. Humans like meat, humans are smart, and humans like to kill big things. There's a correlation between anatomically modern humans arriving to Europe and megafauna from the mammoth steppe arising. Now at this point, theres way too much human activity to support the gigantic grazing spaces that herds of megafauna would require. </p>
<p>An interesting side note is the island gigantiam effect. When species are left alone on island for a while, often they'll either shrink down (island dwarfism) or grow exponentially in size, it's just a really cool phenomenon of genetic drift/founders effect. But again, humans don't like to leave islands alone and humans don't like big animals. </p>
<p>TLDR; climate and humans.</p>
<p>EDIT: if anyone is interested in this stuff, I'd recommend reading about the Mammoth Steppe <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammoth_steppe" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammoth_steppe</a> which at one point was Earth largest continuous biome (with hardly any trees!) And was the home of TONS of huge megafauna. It's the stereotypical caveman/far cry primal/a quest for fire environment. Really cool stuff!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For ancient insects, it was due to higher oxygen content leading to easier oxygen absorption.</p>
<p>For recent animals (giant sloths, mammoths, elephant birds) it was likely due to the fact that they were easier prey, compared to their smaller variants, for packs of early humans.</p>
<p>For dinosaurs, I think we don't really have a good answer yet.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that we tend to find smaller prehistoric animals less noteworthy, so we're somewhat ignoring the full range of sizes that existed in the past.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
