		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Elevation changes are so tiny that it wouldn't make a big difference, provided you were reasonable about your definition of area.  (As /u/Gigazwiebel 's discussion of fractals suggests, you could in principle count the area of every grain of sand on the surface of Egypt's desert and get a ridiculously large area.)</p>
<p>But so long as you ignore the fractal stuff and look at kilometer-scale elevation changes, then the Earth's surface is <em>really</em> close to being flat.  Nepal, for instance, is about 800 km long, 200 km across, and has 8 km of altitude variation.  Relatively speaking, it's flatter than a tortilla.</p>
<p>Humans tend to mentally exaggerate the steepness of slopes: a 30-degree slope looks like a sheer cliff when you're standing at the top of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who recently had surveying done, I ended up learning a bit about that.  Almost certainly, the answer is &quot;no&quot; because the area is likely to be based on a survey.  Surveying is done &quot;on the level&quot;.  My lot slopes, but the surveyor's instruments account for that.  The actual surface area of a lot is not what they want for various practical purposes.  In particular, the foundation of a building is going to be level and if actual surface area was quoted as a lot size, you could change it by landscaping.  You don't want to have to worry about changing your lot size because you put in some raised beds or piled up a mound of dirt.</p>
<p>The borders of an entire country are, AFAIK, surveyed in a similar manner.  If they weren't, we'd run into the same kinds of problems subdividing tracts.  What if Chile subdivided some land, then there was a landslide on it?  Misery.  It's much better to keep surveying &quot;on the level&quot;.</p>
<p>What's more interesting is whether or not the curvature of the Earth is taken into account.  Out here in the western USA, you've got entire <em>sections</em> of land for sale quite often.  That's 1 square mile.  You might think the curvature of the Earth would factor in, but if you sit down and do the math you realize that chord length and arc length are surprisingly close until you get into some really large angles.</p>
<p>Surveys that take the curvature into account are called <em>geodetic surveys</em>, and when you're talking about an entire country or an unusually large tract like a national park they might do that.</p>
<p>In that case, the tract will be slightly larger due to the curve.  The word &quot;geodesy&quot; will get you some interesting links to learn more.</p>
<p>edit -- <a href="https://www.civilengineeringterms.com/surveying-levelling/plane-surveying/" target="_blank">according to these guys, plane surveys can be good for 250 square km</a>!  That's better than I thought.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For your question: no, we count useful area, which is flat. Otherwise cliffs would count as area.</p>
<p>However, it does change things more than most answers suggest. A very steep mountain (60 degrees) will have double the area of a flat surface. However, such mountains are only possible with very rocky materials and are rare. The highest fully stable angle is around 30 degrees, where the increase in surface compared to flat land is &quot;only&quot; around 15%. Still, for country like Nepal, which is very mountainous and contains many steep slopes (assuming 35 degree avg), this may mean changes in actual surface area of around 5 or even 10%.</p>
<p>It's up you to decide whether that is a lot or not.  </p>
<p>Edit: counting every rock and bump this could also mean double or even triple surface area. Then counting every single grain of sand as a sphere would increase that even further. So my answer assumes counting mountains as approximated cones. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Land is measured in 2 dimensions. Elevation changes are not considered for official measurements.</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever the shape of a parcel – or the topography of the land it contains – surveyors calculate its acreage based on a common surface, using basic geometry (whose Greek root words mean earth measure). And while it is possible to account for the curvature of the earth in land surveying, most boundary surveys for parcels less than a few hundred square miles use plane surveying. That is, the portion of the earth being measured is considered a horizontal plane.&quot;</p>
