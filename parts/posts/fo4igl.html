But when people talk of quantum fields, they talk of &quot;exciting the field to produce particles&quot; and other things that refer to quantum fields more as physical media that can be disturbed and picked apart. Am I missing something big here? Or is QFT just so complicated that it's not worth comparing quantum fields to classical ones?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the canonical picture, quantum fields are operator-valued fields (distributions, to be more precise). The Hilbert space on which they act is spanned by number states. Each number state consists of a given number of particles with given momenta and other quantum numbers (spin, color etc.). In fact the *free* fields behave like a set of harmonic oscillators for each momentum/spin/color/etc. Of course not every state is a number state, but they provide a basis by which you can express any state by linear combination.</p>
<p>In this picture, the fields are just operators that create and destroy particles, but the particle content is in the abstract quantum state.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The path integral picture is closer to the classical interpretation, but the relationship to particles is a bit more difficult to see. Basically, there is the path integral/partition functional, which consists of a sum over all possible classical field configurations weighted by the value of the action on the given field configuration. Thus all possible field configurations contribute to the amplitudes and expectation values. In the classical limit, only those configurations contribute for which the action is stationary, eg. those that satisfy the classical equations of motion.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>TL;DR: In the canonical approach, fields are just tools. In the path integral approach, physical processes happen by summing over classical fields, even those that do not solve the (classical) equations of motion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;exciting the field to produce particles&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In classical field theories, exciting a field produces waves, e.g. electromagnetic waves in electrodynamics or sound waves in fluid dynamics. What do we know about waves from basic quantum physics?</p>
<p>The Planck relation, which is probably the most basic equation of quantum physics, states that a wave with frequency <em>f</em> cannot have any arbitrary energy like in classical physics. Instead, it can only carry an integer number of quanta of energy <em>h f</em>, where <em>h</em> is Planck's constant.</p>
<p>So all waves now come in integer numbers of some quanta which carry energy (and momentum thanks to the deBroglie relation), or alternatively, you can describe the dynamics of the quantum field in term of these quanta. They have some energy and momentum, they can interact with each other – they are particles!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they are similar because the quantum field has to average out to become the classical field in the classical limit. Physicists call this the correspondence principal (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_principle" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence\_principle" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence\_principle</a></a>). When you are looking at a problem where you need to account for the particles being created and destroyed in the field, that is the quantum limit. But for some problems, you can ignore those details and just talk about the average behaviour of those many, many particles (field quanta) that are being created and destroyed. That is the classical limit of the quantum field (i.e. the classical field).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quantum fields are to classical fields what quantum particles are to classical particles.</p>
<p>A classical point particle in 3D space can be identified through six numbers: three components of position, and three components of velocity. Know those six numbers and you know the 'configuration' of the particle. </p>
<p>A quantum point particle in 3D space can be identified through a wave function, which when you take the modulo squared gives you a <em>probability distribution</em> on the position (the first three numbers). Interestingly, the <em>other</em> three numbers aren't as independent any more - they are conjugate to the former three. So they still have a distribution as well, but it's connected to the one of positions by the indeterminacy principle - if one's narrow, the other's broad, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Now, a classical <em>field</em> in 3D space is defined by a function on the whole space. For example, a scalar quantity that's a function of x,y,z. In addition it has a velocity of change of that quantity - another function on the whole space.</p>
<p>A quantum field, in practice, has a probability distribution over these things. Not just one function (with infinite points), but <em>infinite possible functions</em>, all defined on the entire space, each with its own probability. &quot;Particles&quot; for a quantum field are like the discrete levels of a quantum particle in a potential. For example in an harmonic oscillator, a single quantum particle will have levels of energy 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, etc. Well, for a quantum field, you can't create just <em>any</em> wave to travel through it the way you could in a classical one - instead you can have states of energy 1/2, 3/2, 5/2 etc. 1/2 is the vacuum - the famous 'zero point energy'. 3/2 would be one particle, 5/2 two particles, and so on.</p>
<p>The similarity with the harmonic oscillator isn't random: the maths are largely similar. A quantum field is, in practice, the result of infinite harmonic oscillators, packed together infinitely close, covering all of space and time, and coupled with each other. At least when undisturbed. The real fun stuff happens when we start to perturb it with non-harmonic terms, of course...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
