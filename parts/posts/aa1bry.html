			<a href="/posts/aa1bry" onclick="return false">Why file US taxes every year, when the US Government already knows your major income/revenue (wages,capital gains) and deductions (dependants,taxes etc)? Why can't the government just send you a refund or bill automatically and give you the option to accept or dispute it?</a>

<p>which got me thinking , if the government can do this (aka verify my taxes) wouldn't it make sense that they just calculate my taxes automatically tell me if I'm do a refund or owe them money and then I have the option to accept it or amend/dispute it.</p>
<p>It seems a bit backward in 2018 to have citizens file returns when the government has a pretty good handle on what you should be paying.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, the stated reason is that there are some people who have income or deductions that the government doesn't know about. So, they take the position that you are responsible to tell them, not the other way around.</p>
<p>But, your idea is actually a very popular one. This idea of the IRS just sending you what they think you owe/what they owe you and amending that statement has been brought up multiple times in the past. But, there are powerful lobbies that don't want that to happen. The largest of them are the tax preparation industry who makes a lot of money that they would stand to lose if the process was easier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's <em>literally</em> because tax prep companies want to charge you money every single year for their services or software.  Most developed countries use a pre-filled tax form that works exactly like you say.  The government has all your info, so they compute the best return for you, they send you the form, you sign it (or make corrections, or redo the entire thing yourself if you really want to for some reason), and send it back.  The US is very unique in that we don't do something similar to this.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because there's plenty of companies that get you to give them money to &quot;figure out&quot; your taxes for you. And they don't want to lose that income stream, so they pay off politicians.</p>
<p>In most of the rest of the civilised world, what you're describing is how it works for the vast majority of the citizens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
