But NASA says that Perseverance did about 7 months to travel to Mars and travelled about 480 million kilometres. But they say it travelled at a speed of about 39600 Km/h. And unless I made a dumb mistake that doesn't add up. Am I missing something?</a>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a bit of awkward phrasing. It might help to look at the <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/bosf/images/04-01v2_Earth-Mars-Trans-Orb_800x420.jpg" target="_blank">usual path from Earth to Mars</a>. You might kind of imagine that to go to Mars, you point the rocket towards Mars and fire, or at least, you compensate for the fact that it's moving, and aim ahead or something.</p>
<p>But it's not that: instead, you're still orbiting the sun, so you also travel a considerable chunk of your solar orbit, and end up in a very different spot. <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/bosf/docs/04_01v2_Earth-Mars-Trans-Orb_800x420.gif" target="_blank">Here's the animated version.</a></p>
<p>So relative to Earth, you're never moving fast enough to travel 480 million km, but relative to the Sun, you are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a question about this too.</p>
<p>It looks like Perserverance went directly from launch to landing without any orbitting of either planet. How critical was the launch date &amp; time to ensure it could land where NASA wanted it? How much play is there during transit to ensure landing at Jezero Crater?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Earth orbital velocity is about 30 kmeters per second.  Mars being further away from the Sun travels at about 24 kmeters per second.  A rocket headed to Mars will have to accelerate in the same direction earth is travelling so as to escape earth's gravity and be flung out to the distance that Mars orbits the sun. This must be timed such that Mars is at the same place at the same time. NASAs refenced speed is probably the average it traveled in addition to earth's orbital velocity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
