		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A camera-- to simplify-- takes in light to create an image (much like our eyes).</p>
<p>A long exposure just keeps that eye (the shutter) open longer, so that more light gets processed into the final picture.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you have a grid of buckets, covered by a retractable roof. If you retract the roof while it's raining, the buckets will fill up with water.</p>
<p>Suppose it's only raining over a very small region. Only the buckets under the rain will fill up, while the other buckets won't.</p>
<p>Now, consider, what if that small region of rain is moving. If you open and close the roof very quickly, the rain won't have much time to move and only a few buckets will be filled.</p>
<p>But if you open it, and leave it open, you'll see all the buckets it passes over will get filled. You'll end up with a trail of full buckets, even though the source was smaller than that area.</p>
<p>This is more or less how cameras work, but with light instead of water, and sensors (or film) instead of buckets.</p>
<p>In normal photography the shutter is only open for a fraction of a second, in order to get a clear picture with no motion blur. In long exposure photography, the shutter is open for a longer period of time, which will show moving objects as streaks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you take a photo, the camera opens a shutter and exposes the photo sensor (or film in older cameras) to the environment for a brief amount of time (typically fractions of a second.) The light being reflected off the subject is captured during this exposure. A long exposure photo is one that opens the shutter for a long period of time (typically for longer than a second.) The longer exposure allows the sensor (or film) to capture more light information than previously possible. This leads to the streaky and blurry nature of moving items and seemingly too perfect stillness of non-moving items. It can also cause certain parts of the photo to turn white as the are exposed to too much light and lose their color reference/context.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cameras record a slice of time. The size of the slice is the shutter speed. Most slices are smaller than 1/60th of a second, all the way up to 1/8000th of a second. Because the slice of time is so small, very little to no movement occurs. It looks like everything is frozen.  </p>
<p>Long exposures are a much larger slice of time — usually a second or more. All the movement that happens during this time is recorded. You're seeing the past and future all together at once. That's why star photos look like circles — you're that star at every possible point it occupies during that slice of time all at once!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
