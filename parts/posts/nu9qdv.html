		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You’ve been training those muscles since you were an infant. Babies are born with their neck muscles too week to hold up their head. There are training techniques parents must do to help. But your body has been doing it for so long that it just becomes a custom to holding your head up all the time. But also you have your spine which helps take a lot of the load off. It’s still hard to hold your head up for long times if your on your stomach or back because you don’t have that support of your spine and your muscles are not use to that angle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an issue of balance. There's a lot of weight above the legs, and the legs aren't very wide or else then we'd look like a pyramid (which would be much more stable)</p>
<p>Your body gets around this by making microscopic adjustments every time you might fall. This is why babies fall a lot when they're first learning to walk, they haven't quite gotten it figured out yet. Those adjustments that we call 'balance' are little twitches of muscles you do without realising which keeps the weight of your torso above your feet, and that exertion of energy to twitch those muscles is what makes you tired when standing for a while. It's also why leaning on something for support helps</p>
<p>The head and neck  are slightly more triangular, and it weighs less. Easier on the muscles to keep it upright. It does get tired and people still lean it on things though, like resting your face on your hands  or a headrest</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
