		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Researchers have been coming around to that idea, especially after a mechanistic basis for nucleocapsid (N) -targeting antibodies tied to a cytotoxic T cell response was established, e.g. here, from December 2020:</p>
<p>Caddy, SL., Vaysburd, M., Papa, G., Wing, M., O’Connell, K., Stoycheva, D., Foss, S., Andersen, JT., Oxenius, A., James, LC. Viral nucleoprotein antibodies activate TRIM21 and induce T cell immunity The EMBO Journal e106228</p>
<p>But unless we see major, major problems with current vaccines' efficacy against new variants and/or poor longevity of efficacy, it's unlikely (in my opinion) to get much ground at this stage simply because Spike-based vaccines are so well established. The Spike (S) was an attractive (and logical) target because it's present on the surface of the virus particle (easy access for antibodies) and because it's the part involved in viral entry into human cells. The N is located within the particle, so was less attractive, or less obvious, even though we've known for a while that we do generate antibodies against it and against equivalent proteins in other viruses, and that these are very sensitive in diagnosis/detection. Here's a paper on SARS-CoV-1 (an earlier Coronavirus) from 2004:</p>
<p>Leung DT, Tam FC, Ma CH et al. Antibody response of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) targets the viral nucleocapsid. J Infect Dis 2004; 190:379–86</p>
<p>Now that we have a clearer mechanistic basis for N-targeted antibodies in generating a directly antiviral T cell response, it is likely that this will be a major viral target going forward, as noted e.g. in this letter from June 2020:</p>
<p>Dutta, NK, Mazumdar, K, Gordy, JT The Nucleocapsid Protein of SARS–CoV-2: a Target for Vaccine DevelopmentJournal of Virology Jun 2020, 94 (13) e00647-20; DOI: 10.1128/JVI.00647-20</p>
<p>But like I said the S-targeting vaccines are well-established and, so far, working..</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other answers have already mentioned some of the ongoing research in doing exactly what you say, but I want to take a moment and call out this section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>target the virus’ spike proteins, which mutate a lot</strong> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an increasingly common way that scientific misconceptions are spread/amplified (usually unintentionally). You state this in your question as if its absolute truth, but that's not really what the science says.</p>
<p>Perhaps my research on this is a little out of date, but from what I remember, the spike proteins on Coronavirus, Influenza, and Rhinovirus don't mutate any faster than other portions of the viral genome. </p>
<p>The reason we focus on those mutations is because mutations in that area are more apparent and impactful to ways we deal with it. They are the proteins that our body uses when making antibodies so naturally we track them as places of interest. This also means that there is some evolutionary pressure to &quot;reward&quot; mutations in this area. So, it can seem like the mutations might be more common. This is mostly a perception issue. Other parts of the viral genome are mutating at the same time, but our bodies don't see it, because those parts of the virus are essentially hidden from our immune systems.</p>
<p>This is one of the first issues: We can only (mostly) use the outward facing structural proteins as targets for a vaccine. The spikes are easy. The nucleocapsid is a target, but often a more complicated one. With Influenza at least, I remember being told that even if you tried to bind to the nucleocapsid (I think it was actually the ion channel in Influenza), mutations in the &quot;spike&quot; (HA) could still interfere with the binding. So, it works, but mutations in other areas can still foul up your vaccine.</p>
<p>More to the point, targeting other areas for vaccines simply shifts where that evolutionary pressure is applied, without actually changing the possibility of mutations. If all our vaccines shifted to target the nucleocapsid, then a mutation in that coding region could allow the new variant to bypass immunity just as easily as if we targeted the spike protein. </p>
<p>So, somewhat oversimplifying the chemistry here, all areas of the virus have the potential to mutate and there's nothing all that special about the spike protein (or HA/NA proteins in influenza) that amplifies mutation (not completely true, but not false either). However, mutations in some areas of the virus would cause catastrophic impacts to the viability of the virus. The Phizer/Moderna vaccines are actually based on this: SARS-CoV-2 needs to be able to bind to ACE2. There's only so much it can mutate in that area without disabling itself. Some portions of the nucleocapsid are similarly critical. If we have a vaccine built on those targets and a mutation happens there, we might not care, because the virus might not even pose a threat with that mutation.</p>
<p>But none of this includes or supports the assumption that the spike protein naturally mutates faster than the rest of the viral genome, and especially not that our targeting of that protein is some sort of lazy short cut. We are working on other methods, but the current methods is probably the fastest and has the highest efficacy per research month we could have achieved. It may take years to find the correct way to target the nucleocapsid. They've been looking for a way to do this with Influenza for at least five years. We could easily produce multiple vaccines targeting any mutations we observe in the spike protein in far less time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are in fact several vaccines that were developed to multiple COVID antigens and their combinations, including N. They just weren't quick enough in their development to be among the first to finish clinical trials. Hence, they did not get to the approval/distribution stage yet. If they ever will, since the quickest ones (against S only) seem to work just fine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
