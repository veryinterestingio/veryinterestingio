		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The length of Earth's orbital period has changed over time, but probably not by much. The biggest change in Earth's orbit was almost certainly the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant-impact_hypothesis" target="_blank">impact</a> which created the moon very early in Earth's history. Since then, there are two main effects which would affect the orbital period: angular momentum transfer through tidal coupling with the sun and the decrease in the sun's mass over time due to fusion.</p>
<p>The Earth is tidally coupled to the sun in a similar way that the moon is tidally coupled to the Earth. In both cases, the gravitational pull of the smaller body creates a quadrupole mass distribution (a bulge) in the larger body. Since the larger body rotates faster than the smaller body orbits, the mass asymmetry drags the smaller body around, sort of like a ball being swung on a string. The increased angular momentum of the smaller body transfers it to a higher (larger radius) orbit, which corresponds to a longer orbital period. This effect, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation#Resonant_stabilization" target="_blank">among others</a>, has caused the lunar orbital period and Earth's day length to change drastically over time.</p>
<p>However, while tidal coupling of the Earth to the moon increases the lunar orbital radius by about 4cm per year, the tidal coupling of Earth to the sun only increases Earth's orbital radius by about 1 micrometer per year. (This corresponds to an increase in year length of about <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2pi+*+sqrt((149.6*10%5E6+km+%2B+1+micrometer+*+10%5E9)%5E3+%2F+(G+*+solar+mass)" target="_blank">0.3 nanoseconds per year</a>+-+2pi+<em>+sqrt((149.6</em>10%5E6+km+)%5E3+%2F+(G+*+solar+mass))).) There are a number of reasons Earth-Sun tidal coupling is so much weaker than Moon-Earth coupling, but the main one is simply that the mass ratios and orbital radii are much smaller in the former case than in the latter.</p>
<p>The larger effect is the decrease in solar mass over time. The sun will lose about 0.1% of its mass over its lifetime. If you assume its current fusion rate as constant, this means that the Earth is receding at a <a href="http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/about-us/41-our-solar-system/the-earth/orbit/83-is-the-distance-from-the-earth-to-the-sun-changing-advanced" target="_blank">rate of about 1.5cm per year</a>, corresponding to an increase in year length of about <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2pi+*+sqrt((149.6*10%5E6+km+%2B+1.5cm+)%5E3+%2F+(G+*+solar+mass)" target="_blank">4.7 microseconds per year</a>+-+2pi+<em>+sqrt((149.6</em>10%5E6+km+)%5E3+%2F+(G+*+solar+mass))).</p>
<p>Finally, while Earth's orbit has likely been fairly stable over the last few billion years, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability_of_the_Solar_System" target="_blank">orbital stability of the solar system</a> over arbitrarily long timescales is an open problem in astronomy! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's generally agreed that the Earth's rotational period is increasing, but that the rate of that increase has decayed exponentially since the moon was formed, (since the moon's tidal forces are the primary means for the slowing of rotation). <a href="http://www.iea.usp.br/en/news/when-a-day-lasted-only-four-hours" target="_blank">Here's</a> one physicist's numbers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At first, the Moon was at a distance of three times the Earth's radius, immediately after the Roche limit. With this distance and the estimated angular momentum, it can be said that the day lasted only 4 hours. Over time, the Moon moved away and the length of the day increased: when the planet and its satellite were 30,000 years old, the day lasted six hours; when they were 60 million years old, the day lasted 10 hours ... the first evidence of life, 3.5 billion years ago, happened when the day lasted 12 hours. The emergence of photosynthesis, 2.5 billion years ago, happened when the day lasted 18 hours. 1.7 billion years ago the day was 21 hours long and the eukaryotic cells emerged. The multicellular life began when the day lasted 23 hours, 1.2 billion years ago. The first human ancestors arose 4 million years ago, when the day was already very close to 24 hours long.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the exact number are controversial, but the broad outlines are correct: the length of the day has increased dramatically over its lifetime but the vast majority of the increase was early in its history, with less than an hour of increase since the Cambrian and the beginning of modern life on Earth. Every animal (at least as we think of them) that as ever walked the Earth, swam in its oceans, flown through its skies or burrowed through its soils has done so across days that were roughly as long as our own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
