		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quote from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7558663/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7558663/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In general, road traffic noise in urban environments is generated by vehicles and is mainly due to the friction of the tires and the noise of the engine. At speeds of over 30 km/h, the noise of tire friction overcomes the noise of the engine [8]. However, at low speeds, the predominant noise is that of the engine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Its quite surprising how low speeds it is until road friction starts to dominate. But there are areas of the city where 30km/h could be the speed limit and there would be less noise, especially cars accelerating from red lights etc. Most EVs do generate some kind of humming sound.</p>
<p>Noise near a highway would probably not change at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my experience living in cities. &quot;Normal&quot; traffic noise becomes white noise easily. It's the unexpected noise cars generate (mostly people honking) that generates 99% of the annoying sound. And that's not going anywhere with EVs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honestly the biggest problem I have with noise from roads isn't your typical driver doing the speed limit in a typical car. It's not even trucks. It's the people who speed around in (usually modded) cars or bikes, since that just straight up wakes me up at night, or makes it impossible to hear during the day until the car goes away. I'd hope that electric cars just make that a thing problem of the past.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
