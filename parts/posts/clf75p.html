		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body has a natural cycle referred to as circadian rhythm. If you do anything to throw it off, you can feel out of it. This includes sleeping longer than normal, and stuff like traveling time zones. When your body isn't a synched up to the activities you want to be doing, you won't feel at peak performance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sleep is cyclical. The average person goes through 90 minute sleep cycles that hit 4 distinct stages. Based on what part of that cycle you wake up in you may feel more groggy. Especially waking up in the deeper stages like N3 &amp; REM will make you groggy. The structure of this cycle changes as we get older or have more outside factors/ailments. Sleep is very complex and also very subjective. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to sleep cycles, something that can contributes a lot to that feeling is dehydration. Many people don't drink enough water as it is, and the downsides of that will feel even more apparent after you spend an extra hour or three with no water intake. </p>
<p>No data to support this claim but I'm pretty sure that situations where your sleep schedule makes you oversleep such as being sick, overworking or traveling will also lead to not taking care of other parts of your health.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
