		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on <strong>Economics, Political Science, Linguistics, Anthropology</strong></p>
<p>Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &quot;What would happen if...&quot;, &quot;How will the future...&quot;, &quot;If all the rules for 'X' were different...&quot;, &quot;Why does my...&quot;. </p>
<p><strong>Asking Questions:</strong></p>
<p>Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.</p>
<p>The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.</p>
<p><strong>Answering Questions:</strong></p>
<p>Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience" target="_blank">The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here</a>. In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Recently I've seen a <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/first-foreign-takeover-ancient-egypt-was-uprising-not-invasion-180975354/" target="_blank">Smithsonian article</a> that suggests the Hyksos were not foreign conquerors of the Egyptian Pharaohs as we had thought, and suggests the affair was an immigrant uprising from a population already living in the area.</p>
<p>Previous common wisdom I've seen suggests that the Egyptians learned of the spoked wheel and chariot from the Hyksos, who we had assumed used the devices to cross the desert and conquer the area for about 100 years.  </p>
<p>But this new information would suggest that if they Hyksos had the wheel, chariots, and horses that the Egyptians must have known of them.  Why would the Egyptians not have adopted this from them until after the Hyksos rule?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

With the recent potatoes surplus it makes me question if this happens so often shouldn't there be some government backed work force to move these crops so they don't just get wasted? It just sounds like a way to create jobs and lower food waste.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
