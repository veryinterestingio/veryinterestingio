		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Photography changed how we paint. Hyper realism uses photographs as reference and is an excellent way to zoom in or keep a light source or models still.</p>
<p>Before photography a similar technique was used, &quot;camera obscura&quot; but it didnt freeze the images.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Besides the technical issues listed here, before the advent of impressionism, realism was highly desirable in art. Take a look at, for instance Caravaggio. Although the lighting is stylised the depiction of human forms are incredibly accurate. When the Impressionist gained traction people realised that an artwork could be more than a moment captured in time and that feeling could be more important than realism. This led directly to the many forms of modern art.</p>
<p>So what you may be thinking is that people were unable to paint realistically but they could, they just chose not to as they explored the more abstract nature of art, and hence images such as those made by Dali, Picasso, Rothko et al. </p>
<p>To be clear, I'm not an artist or art historian, so I may be wildly off base here, this is just my understanding of art history from having read a handful of books.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As with everything, the internet has accelerated the spread and evolution of drawing techniques. Techniques used to evolve like a glacier, today it's an avalanche.</p>
<p>When I was young, I had to rent drawing books from the library, and my skills were limited to what I learned from those books and what I figured out on my own.</p>
<p>A few years ago, a simple tip passed on my facebook timeline that greatly improved my drawing skills. Just passed me by and I picked it up. That didn't happen 100+ years ago.</p>
<p>But it does injustice to many great artists who made incredibly realistic art, like Da Vinci, Rubens or Van Eyck.</p>
<p>EDIT: because everyone wants the tip; it's to focus on the angles. Everything is triangles. If you keep copying triangles to the best of your ability, you'll have a very realistic copy of the entire picture. It helps a lot for things like eyes and hands.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m pretty sure there were quite realistic paintings from back then.  Or perhaps realistic enough from painting someone in real life from reasonable distance.</p>
<p>We have photos now that can show incredible detail, be saved and looked at for months on end, and zoom into a skin pore.  Like all things it’s a combination of modern stylistic choices and technological advances.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most artists weren't (and aren't) interested in photo realistic art. Art isnt necessarily about capturing reality in a perfect way. I think it partly came with pop culture and - without wanting to insult the modern day artists - feels more like a skill trick or an attraction than the work of the visual artists of the past, who were more interested in capturing reality in (for example) a more impressionist way in the 1800s.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
