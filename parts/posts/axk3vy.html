		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Emulsifiers. Look at the ingredients: other than milk products, sweeteners and cocoa butter the other ingredients in a store brought chocolate are pretty much emulsifiers. </p>
<p>What are emulsifiers? They can make oil and water combine and stay that way. In fact most kitchens have an amazing natural emulsifier in their fridge (American) or on their counter or both! The egg. Or more precisely the egg yolk. See any recipe for home made mayonnaise. </p>
<p>If you don’t see any emulsifiers listed then either a) they didn’t use any and rely only on tempering (see below) and good quality cocoa butter or b) you live in a country where it’s not compulsory to list E numbers for chocolate (yep there is a chocolate lobby and cocoa butter is expensive, so...)</p>
<p>Note another important way chocolate stays firm is the dark, secret art of tempering. Tempering chocolate instills fear in all but the greatest pastry chefs. All store brought chocolate is tempered in the right way. We temper by raising the temperature of the “raw” chocolate and dropping it rapidly to a specific temperature. You might see pastry chefs scrapping and manipulating melted chocolate on a bench top: this is to cool the mixture down fast enough. And why are we doing this? To make certain crystals form and dominant in the chocolate. These crystal structure is rigid enough to handle room temperature but delicate enough that at body temperature, like in your mouth, the chocolate melts. </p>

<p>Edit: yep E numbers are European but the numbers are used around the world eg E300 additive will be labeled 300 (in say Australia). </p>
<p>Edit^2 : probably not just emulsifiers - other comments explain it better</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is <strong>Additives</strong>: emulsifiers, stabilizers and thickeners like Carrageenan that keep the product from separating and thus keeps it homogenous.
They are not necessarily unhealthy and can be found in nature like egg yolk in mayonese which has a natural emulsifier called Lecithin (which is Greek and means &quot;egg yolk&quot;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is homogenization.</p>
<p>Yes emulsifiers help, but the real trick comes in at the homogenizer. This is a machine that uses pistons to force the particles into each other at a huge pressure (120 bar plus) and forces them to “stick” together.</p>
<p>This is also used for normal milk, otherwise the fat/cream would separate from the milk itself</p>
<p>Another thing that helps the chocolate milk is how the powders and whatnot are mixed, this is usually done with inline circular mixers which blends this all in very well and very fine.  This is to aid mixing, but also if something like cocoa powder is too course when entering the homogenizer it will eat the the rings even if they are made out of tungsten or ceramic.</p>
