		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tadpoles (as well as some salamander larvae) develop lungs while still in the aquatic stage. At that point, they need to breathe air. Large tadpoles can easily pop their mouths above water to get a gulp of air. However, tadpoles at small body sizes can’t actually breach the surface on their own. Instead, they have to utilize a mechanism called “bubble sucking” where they blow tiny bubbles at the surface. The bubble fills with oxygen and they then “suck” it into their lungs - all without ever breaching the surface.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer to your question is that generally speaking, there will be a period where frogs will be using both lungs and gills at some point in development, to at least some extent. </p>
<p>Long answer:</p>
<p>Frogs use a variety of gas exchange mechanisms, not just lungs and gills. They breath through their skin too, which they do throughout all their life stages. At any given point during early development, most frogs theoretically have the ability to do all of these things, and whether they do or don't is highly variable, but generally speaking frogs tadpoles are probably doing all, even if some are occurring at a <em>very</em> low level. The extent to which a frog/tadpole is dependent on each gas exchange method is highly dependent on age and species, as well as other factors like temperature, or how much oxygen is dissolved in the water. There's even evidence that the presence of predators in different parts of the environment may influence how breathing occurs, based on where it's safest to be. A lot of tadpoles have lungs that they don't use, while some actually DO use their lungs, while some will only take random gulps of air every now and then. It has been found experimentally that removing tadpole lungs in some species doesn't affect their overall oxygen intake under normal circumstances, but in situations where there isn't much oxygen in the water, lung breathing can account for up to 25% of a tadpole's oxygen intake. While there there seems to be more of a slow transition in some species, in other species it appears like the entire transition from water to air breathing occurs over the course of just an hour or two, such as in the bullfrog <em>Rana catesbeiana</em>. Anyways, even in the fastest transitioning species, there is bound to be at least a little bit of time where the animal is doing both.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You’ve gotten some good answers, but it’s also worth noting that the transition to a mature adult frog isn’t discrete. The tadpole gradually progresses to a froglet which then progresses to a mature frog. Something like a bullfrog or leopard frog that spends its entire adult life near water or traveling between bodies of water will do a significant amount of cutaneous respiration (skin breathing) while more dry adapted species like American toads will rely more heavily on lung respiration. </p>
<p>When the frogs are breathing through their skin it isn’t really an active process, they have areas on their body (throat, groin, armpits, mouth) where the skin is thin and the blood vessels are dense. Gas diffusion will be constantly occurring here so long as the tissue remains moist. Fun fact, there are groups of terrestrial salamanders that don’t have lungs and get their entire oxygen supply this way. </p>
<p>Since this process is largely passive with gasses diffusing from high to low concentrations, the frog can also use its lungs simultaneously. However, frogs don’t have a diaphragm like you or I because they don’t have ribs, so they trap air in their mouth through their nose and force it into their lungs. So breathing for them is a very active process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
