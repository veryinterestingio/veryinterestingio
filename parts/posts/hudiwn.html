		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Consistency, mostly. It’s much easier for your brain to tune out something consistent because it’s easy for it to “predict” the next sound and ignore it in a way that doesn’t bother you. </p>
<p>For something like construction - that consistency isn’t there. Your brain can’t “tune out” something that it doesn’t know is coming as easily such as a jackhammer that starts and stops or banging that happens sporadically. </p>
<p>There’s probably some more evolutionary cause as well - our ancestors slept outside and had to deal with rain and over time evolved such that it didn’t prevent them from getting sleep. </p>
<p>If you’d like to learn more, you can look up “habituation” which is basically a fancy term for when our brains react less and less to a repeated stimulus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think because it’s natural, it’s constant, consistent, we’ve been hearing it at times through our whole lives. It’s also not as loud and rough sounding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its because rain sounds similar to white noise. We attribute white noise with comfort and soothing because when we were in the womb all we heard was white noise. It brings us back to a fetal state of mind. Play some rain sounds under a weighted blanket and try to stay awake.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans have evolved to appreciate the benefits of rain over thousands of years of evolution. It quenches thirst and gives life to the plants so we associate it with good (until it floods...) The rain drops are random, but they are consistent. The randomness finds a certain average and becomes a white noise, not unlike the white noise that our blood flow makes in our own heads (we hear it all the time so it's not usually noticeable unless it's dead silent). And not unlike the sound our infantile ears were exposed to in our mothers wombs.</p>
<p>Construction, meanwhile, is all modern mechanical sounds. The sounds of power saws, drills, heavy machinery, etc. - They are novel sounds to our ancient ears. In many ways, construction sounds imitate the sounds of our natural predators: loud growling machines sound like lions; screeching saws, like birds of prey. Maybe in a thousand years we will have evolved to appreciate the sound of construction. Already, there is evidence that suggests the paradigm shift is happening. Just try searching for &quot;construction site ambience&quot; on YouTube and you'll find recordings attempting to soothe its listeners. This video, for example <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nob1bpSXyrg" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nob1bpSXyrg</a> has commenters saying it provided the best sleep they ever had. To each their own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rain is more rhythmic and our brains like patterns. Construction noises generally don't follow a pattern and include a lot of sudden loud noises, some of which exist specifically to alarm or alert. Ex the beeping of a forklift in reverse.</p>
<p>Exposure plays a part too. Some people might find construction noises... I hesitate to say relaxing, but at least not annoying. Like, if as a baby you lived next to constant construction you might get used to the sounds of it. Then as an adult the same sounds send you back to that time of safety and comfort.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
