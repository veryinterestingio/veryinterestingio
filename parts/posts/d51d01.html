We possess this skill by default. Also, this is possible because all human languages, no matter how different, have some logical characteristics, actually because they were invented by humans and that makes them reasonable to our minds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can take any baby and place that baby in literally any society with any language. The baby will learn the local language effortlessly as a natural part of its early development. It doesn't matter where the baby was born and it doesn't matter what the language is. The same thing is not true for kittens and puppies, or any other animals except homo sapiens. Therefore, there is some innate and biological human faculty that allows people to use language, no matter what the specifics of that language might be. So, human language is universal, with superficial differences, and our capacity to make use of language is a product of evolution, like a bird's ability to fly. We come with genetic wiring for a particular kind of program and it's only the minor details of that program that get fleshed out when someone learns to speak Mandarin or Norwegian or French.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll expand a little bit. Every human is hard-wired to understand language and make language according to some universal grammar which is kind of embedded in our brains. Natural languages that are in use today (e.g., English) are based off of that universal grammar. Because of that, every natural language has a lot of things in common. E.g., every natural language has &quot;recursive&quot; grammatical constructs, which is kind of a fancy way of saying that every natural language has sentences that can be expanded out forever. Example in English: &quot;There's a flea on the wing on the fly on the wart on the frog on the bump on the log in the hole in the bottom of the sea&quot; (you can expand this pattern forever and ever in English). Another example of the universal grammar is that nouns are distinct from verbs, which is a feature we find in (I think?) every natural language.</p>
<p>Chomsky thought as long as young children are exposed to language from a young age, they can learn any language and languages will all have a lot of features in common. That's because every child has this UG embedded in their brains and, as they start learning a natural language, it's easy for them to map things from the UG onto the language they're learning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Warning: I am not a linguist.</p>
<p>If you watch children learning a language, they make mistakes. A child learning English might see someone kick a ball and say &quot;ball kick!&quot; The parent might correct and say &quot;he kicked the ball.&quot; Because that's the order we put subjects, verbs, and objects in English, and the child doesn't know that yet.</p>
<p>Perfectly normal interaction, happens millions of times every day. But what Chomsky and others noticed is that there are some mistakes that seem logical, but which the child will <em>never</em> make. And every mistake the child makes learning English is correct...in some language.</p>
<p>This hinted at the idea that the human brain might have a built in &quot;set of rules&quot; for grammar, and children are just learning &quot;which rules are turned on, and which are turned off, in this language?&quot;</p>
<p>And there are very complex and subtle linguistic concepts that no one ever teaches children, but which they understand. You take a box, and two balls, one red and one blue. Put the blue ball in the box, but the red ball next to the box, and ask a group of children &quot;which ball is near the box?&quot;</p>
<p>They will all say &quot;the red ball.&quot;</p>
<p>Now, you can <em>argue</em> that the blue ball must, by definition, be &quot;nearer&quot; the box, since it is actually touching the box, but the children all have a built-in understanding of &quot;nearness&quot; as distinct from &quot;insideness&quot; which no adult ever bothered to teach them, and which has nothing to do with the arbitrary sound we make to express these concepts, which we call &quot;words.&quot;</p>
<p>You can stop anyone in Time Square and point to a billboard for Cadbury Easter Eggs which prominently features a bunny and ask &quot;What is that?&quot;</p>
<p>And regardless of where in the world the person is from, they will all give some variation of the same answer. &quot;A bunny.&quot; &quot;Un lapin.&quot; Whatever.</p>
<p>None of them will say &quot;A billboard.&quot; Or &quot;An advertisement.&quot; Both of which are equally true, in some ways, MORE true! Because that thing you're pointing at...is not a bunny! It's a picture of a bunny!</p>
<p>These rules are built-in. In order to understand how revolutionary Chomsky's theory was, it helps to understand how people thought <em>before</em> Chomsky.</p>
<p>Folks believed in what was called the <em>tabula rasa</em> theory. That the human brain, at birth, is perfectly malleable, and you could invent ANY arbitrary set of grammar rules and pour them in, and the child would adopt those rules as easily as we all adopted our native tongues.</p>
<p>We now know; that is not true. <strong>Words</strong> are arbitrary, but the rules of language are not.</p>
<p>This is what Chomsky's talking about when he says &quot;whatever language you are taught in school, is by definition not your native language.&quot; You go to school to learn a formal <em>mode</em> of your language. But your actual language, no one ever taught you. You figured it out well before you went to school, by listening to your parents, to TV, by experimenting, and learning &quot;which rules does this language use?&quot;</p>
<p>Your parents just teach you the arbitrary sounds we assign to things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very simple explanation based on what I remember studying for my linguistics exam almost two years ago (not sure I remember everything correctly, sorry)...</p>
<p>The human brain is genetically predisposed to learn its primary language, it's like a computer with a preinstalled program that can receive, understand and use the &quot;linguistic input&quot;, sort of.
For this reason, humans have linguistic competence which is</p>
<ul>
<li>unconscious (the native speaker judges sentences etc through &quot;intuitions&quot;)</li>
<li>individual (every person has internalized linguistic knowledge)</li>
<li>innate (as said before, it's considered as a genetic characteristic of human beings)</li>
</ul>
<p>Language is then defined as this cognitive system formed by the &quot;program/software&quot; (which follows some common and universal rules) that allows humans to understand and produce messages in their language.
The aim of Chomsky' theory was to define explicitly the total of innate linguistic competences that form the human language.</p>
<p>Edit: had a problem with the app...
It said that &quot;something went wrong&quot; then tried again and it had posted my comment, like, 5 times...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
