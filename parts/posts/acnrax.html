		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The tar is constantly being cleaned by cilia and mucous, so the cleaning part isn't really a major surprise.  The body finally wins when the crap is no longer constantly added.  The &quot;healing&quot; part though is not quite true.  Lots of damage cannot be repaired.  You won't regain elasticity to lungs that lost it, and the scar tissue won't ever get returned to normal.  Sometimes it is too late when the smoker quits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don’t. Once the damage has been done, there’s very little repair that happens. That’s why you see people who develop COPD have such a tough time for the rest of their lives once they begin to develop symptoms. Once it gets to that point, care becomes focused on two things; quitting smoking to prevent any further damage, and managing symptoms through a regimen of medications, diet and exercise. </p>
<p><a href="https://foundation.chestnet.org/patient-education-resources/copd/" target="_blank">There are many resources that can help someone who develops COPD cope.</a>  Also seeing a lung doctor will allow your specific symptoms to be identified and managed accordingly.</p>
<p>I am a practicing respiratory therapist, and in my experience the best thing you can do to prevent this damage is to not smoke in the first place. If you already smoke, the next best thing is to try to quit. There are multiple methods to quit, and success varies from person to person depending on which method they use. Trying different methods, as well as seeing a lung doctor will give you the greatest chance at success.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some parts of your body can undergo dramatic healing, while others can't.  For instance, your skin, digestive tract, and respiratory system are all very resilient and can heal from injury well.  This is due to the constant barrage of minor injury that comes from interacting with the outside world (cuts, scrapes, and abrasion for your skin, hot, cold, smoke and dust for your lungs, and the various things you eat and drink for your digestive tract).  If these systems couldn't heal quickly, then you wouldn't live very long!  Other organ systems which exist in more protective environments tend to heal more slowly and/or less completely.  </p>
<p>Disease is another factor which can affect which organ systems heal well.  Again, because your skin, respiratory system, and digestive tract are exposed to the &quot;outside world&quot; they are susceptible to infections.  These systems must be able to recover from damage due to disease.  Diseases such as colds, strep throat, bronchitis and others do real and significant damage to your respiratory system.  If your respiratory system was not capable of quickly healing, these minor diseases would cripple you for life.  The same is true of things like the food poisoning or the stomach flu for the digestive tract.  </p>
<p>This is all due to evolutionary pressure.  A species which can't survive a ruptured spleen will probably do fine, because it is fairly unlikely that you will get a ruptured spleen.  A species which can't survive a minor scratch won't thrive, because it is extremely likely that most individuals will get a scratch at some point. </p>
<p>Your lungs can recover remarkably well from damage, but you may not recover completely if you are a long term smoker.  Your body will be able to get rid of most of the inhaled smoke particles stuck in your lungs in a fairly short period of time.  If you have been smoking for a long time, this will not be the only damage.  Long term exposure to smoke will cause scarring in the lungs, which will never completely heal.  Exposure to chemicals in cigarette smoke will also increase your chances of developing certain cancers within your lifetime, even years after you stop smoking.  That said, you shouldn't use this as an excuse to keep on smoking.  Even if your lungs never get back to 100%, quitting smoking will make them improve significantly.  Quitting smoking will also improve other aspects of your health; blood pressure, heart attack risk, and general immune system function.  The longer you smoke, the more permanent damage you do, so quitting today will result in a better recovery than quitting next month or next year.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The lungs cannot remove all the tar for this reason:
When the tar gets in the lungs, it is in the form of tiny tiny particles we call carbon black. These particles aren’t infectious, but the immune cells in our lungs treat them like a foreign invader. The immune cells try to eat them and break them down, but instead the carbon black fills up the cells and they die.</p>
<p>The overall, simplified result of this is a lot of inflammation (immune cells destroying everything including normal cells) which then heals by scarring. Scars are not elastic like the lungs, and they cannot allow oxygen to pass into the blood as efficiently as the very thin cells that are normally there. </p>
<p>The answer to your question about healing depends on how long someone has been a smoker for, and how much they smoked. There will always be irreversible damage from smoking; the duration of smoking changes how much can heal. The inflammation will die down when you stop, and then the lungs can heal and regrow cells from minor damage (or damage that happened more recently). Scars, however, will remain the same forever. A 5-year casual smoker will never regain his ENTIRE normal lung function, but he’ll most likely get back enough of it to feel normal. A 30-year smoker (one pack a day, let’s say) will have damage that will always cause him or her lots of problems. </p>
<p>tl;dr - scarred lungs can’t heal after too much damage, damage depends on how much you smoked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
