		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say you see a piece of wood.  And a bunch of termites are chewing away at it.  Each day, you can measure how much material is being eaten by the termites.  You also have information on other, smaller pieces of wood that have been COMPLETELY eaten by termites so you know HOW the termites eat wood (do they eat the same amount each day?  Maybe they eat a little bit at first, eat a lot later, and then slow down, or maybe they eat a small amount initially, but gradually eat more, and more each day, etc.).</p>
<p>Using this information, you can mathematically predict when that piece of wood is going to get completely eaten.</p>
<p>It's the same thing with plastic, except instead of that piece of wood, it's plastic, instead of termites, it's the summation of all the natural processes that break down plastic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don't need to observe the full lifecycle of a material or molecule or atom to understand how it works. In this case, you can say that a plastic bag in the forest decomposes or breaks down X% over a one year period, so using that math and knowledge you know that it will take Y years to break down completely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>PhD in plastics engineering here. There's a technique known as time-temperature superposition, which allows us to predict how long it will take to degrade plastics by subjecting the plastics to high temperatures (keeping most details out of it) and seeing how long it takes to degrade at this high temperature. Then we use this information to compute how long it will take the plastic to decompose at ambient  (room) temperatures. This method gives a very precise number much more accurate that a qualitative 1000s of years. The most stable plastics would probably survive for 100s of years, not 1000s.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has been explained below - but it just made me think of an even more absurd example: we have experimental evidence, that the half-life of proton (which is, simply speaking, the typical time it takes for a proton to decay) is at least 1.67Ã—10^34 years, even though that's 24 orders of magnitude longer than the existence of the Universe, so it's ... pretty damn sure nobody has watched a proton that long! It's simply because there is a <em>lot</em> of protons to watch and particle decay happen randomly, so even if the average time is unfathomably long, if you watch enough protons, one would be almost guaranteed to decay in an accessible time frame if their half-life were &quot;short&quot; enough. (We still do not know whether they decay at all, this is just as close as we come experimental get to saying that they don't as we can.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
