<p>The risk of internal bleeding isn't because the blood in your body doesn't ever go away, it's because it may go unnoticed for too long or may not be stoppable without proper medical intervention.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of you blood vessels like roads. There are trucks on the road carrying stuff around, these are red blood cells.  In the case of internal bleeding some trucks have gone off the road and are no longer working. A tow truck, white blood cell, shows up to break down the truck and recycle the parts. The tow truck can go off road if it needs to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blood is instead of plasma and cells (Plasma is the liquid that holds all the cells and hormones etc.) Plasma itself is absorbed easily back into the cells. The main reason that you see bruises, is the presence of RBCs.</p>
<p>After a while, many of the RBCs are broken down simply by not having nutrients and oxygen. The immune system also &quot;devours&quot; them by a mechanism called Phagocytosis, digests them, and puts the remains (mostly Amino Acids) back to use. The body is great at salvaging, and tries not to let anything go to waste!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If it is a small amount, it is reabsorbed by the body, if it is a large enough amount that it is pooling then you need a surgeon to suction it out for you. You don't need a lot of blood to be a problem, which is why 'internal bleeding' is an alarm to doctors. You can tolerate a bit, in fact many times the treatment is to keep you still so that it clots off on its own without surgical intervention, but if you have a big bleeder then a surgeon needs to go in and repair the bleed and suction the blood out. To a certain extend, you are somewhat 'leaky', which is why our blood clots so easily. The risk of dangerous bleeds is a side effect of the same drugs (aspirin, coumadin, etc) which prevent people from having heart/brain attacks. If you are kinda leaky already, you take a blood thinner, then you undergo some amount of physical trauma, this can be a potentially dangerous situation. You really don't want fluids 'pooling' in the body, in some cases (like around the heart) it can be life threatening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
