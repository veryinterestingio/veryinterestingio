		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ideas of infinite regress and the world resting on a giant turtle go way back, but the specific phrase “turtles all the way down” is probably from linguist J. R. Ross:</p>
<p>“The following anecdote is told of William James. [...] After a lecture on cosmology and the structure of the solar system, James was accosted by a little old lady.</p>
<p>&quot;Your theory that the sun is the centre of the solar system, and the earth is a ball which rotates around it has a very convincing ring to it, Mr. James, but it's wrong. I've got a better theory,&quot; said the little old lady.</p>
<p>&quot;And what is that, madam?&quot; inquired James politely.</p>
<p>&quot;That we live on a crust of earth which is on the back of a giant turtle.&quot;</p>
<p>Not wishing to demolish this absurd little theory by bringing to bear the masses of scientific evidence he had at his command, James decided to gently dissuade his opponent by making her see some of the inadequacies of her position.</p>
<p>&quot;If your theory is correct, madam,&quot; he asked, &quot;what does this turtle stand on?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're a very clever man, Mr. James, and that's a very good question,&quot; replied the little old lady, &quot;but I have an answer to it. And it's this: The first turtle stands on the back of a second, far larger, turtle, who stands directly under him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But what does this second turtle stand on?&quot; persisted James patiently.</p>
<p>To this, the little old lady crowed triumphantly,</p>
<p>&quot;It's no use, Mr. James—it's turtles all the way down.&quot;</p>
<p>— J. R. Ross, Constraints on Variables in Syntax, 1967</p>
<p>Stephen Hawking also tells a version of this story in A Brief History of Time.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It describes the problem of infinite regress. Ancient mythologies made reference to the World Turtle (or some other creature) as being the force holding up the earth. That led philosophers to ask &quot;well, what's holding up that turtle?&quot; to which the response is &quot;more turtles.&quot;</p>
<p>Infinite regress basically means that every proposition needs justification (i.e. every effect has a cause). Modern application of &quot;turtles all the way down&quot; has been used to challenge everything from scientific principles (what caused the Big Bang?) to religious doctrine (who created God?) </p>
<p>It's basically a fun way of saying &quot;we don't know, the possibilities are endless.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I first read it in one of Terry Pratchett's <em>Discworld</em> novels. Someone explains that the world (a flat disc) is riding through space on four giant elephants riding on the back of a giant turtle, A'Tuin.  The question is asked <em>what's under A'Tuin?</em>  </p>
<p><em>Another turtle.</em>  And under that?  <em>It's turtles all the way down.</em></p>
<p>This is similar to an argument about the existence of God (or any other creator of the universe).  The universe is &quot;obviously&quot; too complex and amazing to have originated spontaneously, so it must have been deliberately created.  But that leads to the question what then created God, which must be even <em>more</em> complex than the universe to have created it.  But once you go that route with your logic, you get into the realm of having turtles all the way down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There used to be a story that was going around, probably apocryphal; where there would be some famous scientist giving a lecture and was challenged by a lady in the audience who said that the world was carried by a turtle. When the scientist shot back with &quot;But what is the turtle standing on?&quot;, she retorted with the now famous phrase in question. This is the way us old guys learned it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
