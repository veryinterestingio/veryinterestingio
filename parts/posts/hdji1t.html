		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You’re arching your vertebrae which distributes weight very well across the structure to the point you don’t have to use your muscles. The arch is commonly used in bridges and other structures for its ability to disperse weight throughout the structure and into the ground at both ends. This feels good because you are not using your back muscles and energy to hold yourself upright. The issue is that you are instead putting the stress that your muscles would hold into your spine. The spine is an essential part of your body with vertebrae and disks that can be shifted and damaged, unlike an arch made of concrete or hard material used in construction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you sit up with good posture you're using certain muscles in your body. This isn't noticable immediately after sitting but eventually those muscles get tired and you naturally slouch over, giving those muscles a rest.</p>
<p>This is okay for short term, but over time repeatedly slouching stresses your bones, tendons, joints, nerves, cartilage, etc. Your muscles are made for stress. Tendons, joints, etc? Not so much. This is why slouching is bad in the long run, even if it feels good short term</p>
<p>Edit: spelling</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
