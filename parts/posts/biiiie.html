		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The statistic isn't meant to be significant, it's meant to increase hype. Similar to the college football championship.</p>
<p>It's a promotional number masqueradeing as a meaningful statistic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think that the metric that you're really looking for is tickets sold per capita.  That data allows you to judge relative popularity of films over time while excluding the variables of total population and ticket price.  FWIW, I've never seen any stats done this way for film popularity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because then we wouldn't be able to make headlines about how good the new movie was. I doubt any film in the last 30 years has got close to the sales numbers to the old classics such as Gone With the Wind.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/adjusted.htm?adjust_yr=1" target="_blank">Here's one list I've found</a> - </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Gone With the Wind, 202,285,600</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Star Wars, 178,119,600</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Sound of Music, 141,854,200</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ET, 135,549,300.</p>
</li>
<li>Titanic, 131,000,000
........</li>
</ol>
<p>and down at 29, the first avengers - the 2012 introduction, which has out-sold all the others, at 76,881,200.</p>
<p>Oh, and the top film currently showing, by ticket sales is ... Ben Hur, which is currently running a 60th anniversary special.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We understand inflation and are able to make comparisons between eras. </p>
<p>Amount of tickets sold is also misleading because our population has increased dramatically and is continuing to rise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even with inflation itâ€™s hard to compare because of population size, number of theaters showing a moving and how many screens are showing it any  one location. I know some movies will have 3-4 screens per theater. Not really a meaningful stat</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
