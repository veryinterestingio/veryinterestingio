		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two reasons at two different times. The act of chewing actually cleans the teeth. When a person fasts for an extended period, the thin film of plaque covering the teeth and gums can build up and become thicker, giving a fertile ground for bacteria to do their thing and cause odor. </p>
<p>A secondary problem is that if the fast is extended for several days, the body switches to a ketogenic metabolism where fat and muscle protein are converted to ketone bodies which then become fuel for the body. Ketones are broken down in turn as they are used and one of the byproducts are chemicals that smell a little like acetone (nail polish remover). The result is &quot;carnivore breath&quot;. This doesn't go away until the person eats more, or gets a good amount of carbohydrates in them. </p>
<p>I lost 30lbs during the month of June from fasting, and during my fasts I carried single use tooth brushes to work with me and had to brush 3 times a day even when not eating. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One possible cause is that when your body uses up all the suger in your blood (glucose) it needs to get engery from proteins and fat. Your body burns fat which creates ketones as a result. These ketones smell bad. They exit your body via your month and pee. It is one reason why low carb dieters can have bad breath.</p>
