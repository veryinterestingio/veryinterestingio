		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't. At least not in the short-term. In the short-term they're absolutely will be inbreeding related problems associated with that bottleneck.</p>
<p>In the long-term if the species does survive, it does so because the problematic genes that have been over-represented in the population are slowly culled out by natural selection.</p>
<p>Since that means that the population is going to be less healthy in the short-term, that poses a big problem that can make it even harder to recover from a very low population than it would be otherwise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>They need a LOT of time for their genome to recover to amounts pre-extinction. During this period, their weak genome might lead to further population loss, which could end in disaster. </p>
<p>But given some luck and a LOT of time, they can overcome extinction events</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Tasmanian Devils experienced a severe bottleneck a few decades back, so the remaining Devils are so closely related that they often spread cancer to each other when fighting. Contagious cancer. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil_facial_tumour_disease" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil_facial_tumour_disease</a>  &lt;= that link is NSFL by the way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a very common misconception that inbreeding &quot;weakens genetics&quot; or is otherwise harmful.</p>
<p>When two animals mate, a bunch of genes from the father and a bunch of genes from the mother combine to form one set of genes. When that child mates, a bunch of that set of genes will be combined with a bunch of genes from that child's mate to create one set of genes for the child, and so on. This is why you are not a clone of your parents, but you probably have some similar features to both parents.</p>
<p>If a mating pair is related (e.g. if they have the same parents), then their genes are going to be similar. This is because both sets of genes were created by combining the same two sets of parent genes. They won't be identical because different parts may be represented by different parents in different sets, but they will be similar. This is why you are not a clone of your siblings, but you probably have some similar features to eachother.</p>
<p>When parents have similar genes, it increases the likelihood that recessive genes will be expressed. Recessive genes are not necessarily harmful, but most harmful genetic disorders are recessive. This is why &quot;blue blood&quot; diseases were more common among incestuous royalty; the recessive gene was more likely to not get paired up with a dominant gene because both parents had the recessive gene.</p>
<p>The genes of the children are not in any way &quot;weaker.&quot; A gene cannot be &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;weak.&quot; It's just an instruction for proteins. In this situation, the only consequence is that recessive traits found in Diego, whether they are good/bad/neutral, will be more likely to be expressed in the children of his children. Over many generations and through random mutation, this will not be very noticeable.</p>
<p>Another factor is genetic diversity. Genetic diversity is beneficial because it helps a population adapt to changing environments. Inbreeding reduces genetic diversity. This factor is more of a &quot;big picture&quot; factor, in that it has no effect in the short term. Its effects are shown over hundreds of generations in changing environments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people are talking about natural mating here, but in a lot of &quot;saved species from extinction&quot; situations, there are actually intensive managed breeding programs. Usually these attempt to maximize diversity in the breeding population by pairing captive animals from different regions or with different traits. Now, with genetic sequencing, some breeding programs are able to actually optimize the breeding program by minimizing the number of similar genes between the two partners.</p>
<p>But there's a lot of other genetic concepts here that people don't draw distinctions between. For example, the appearance of recessive traits (meaning there was a recessive gene in both patents) and the fixation of traits. Recessive genes always exist in a population, and they aren't necessarily bad. What is bad is when alleles (essentially mutant versions of a gene) with negative effects get <em>fixed</em> in a population, which means that they become a very common variant in the population, possibly the only version of the gene that exists. An example of this is certain dog breeds that are prone to certain diseases, like lymphoma or hip problems.</p>
<p>Immune system homogeneity is another issue. The immune system is supposed to be extremely diverse at every scale you can think of (from individual genes to individual cells to individuals to populations). This protects the overall population from disease because the disease will only be super lethal in a certain percentage of the population (the percentage that can't resist it). But if a population's immune genes become more homogeneous, then its resistance to disease is much lower. This is a huge issue in plants, especially crops, because many of them are literal clones, so a disease that is lethal to one of them is lethal to all of them. So not only does a loss of genetic diversity make them more resistant to disease, it also ensures that there will be further mass die-offs,  which make the population even more homogeneous.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
