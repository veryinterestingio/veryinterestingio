		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have two layers of skin, the dermis and the epidermis</p>
<p>The epidermis is a simple layer of flat cells that protect you from the external environment. At the bottom of this layer are stem cells that continually replenish the cells that are sloughed off at the top. </p>
<p>The dermis is the layer beneath that contains nerve, blood vessels and structural stuff like collagen. Injuries to this layers can form scars that dont fade quickly because this layer does not have that stem cell layer that continually replaces dead cells. Cells from this layer are also not sloughed off as they are covered by the epidermis layer and thus are not exposed to the outside environment</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It all depends on whether the stem cells are present</p>
<p>Even though the skin looks like a thin tissue, there are in fact dozens of layers of cells situated beneath the surface of the skin.</p>
<p>It is interesting to know how new skin in made. The place where new skin cells are formed is known as the stratum basale, here are present stem cells, which are cells that have the ability to do continuously divide and form new cells. As these cells move from the deep layers to the top layers of the skin, they start to lose their internal structures such as the nucleus and mitochondria until the cells that reach the very top are nothing more than shells of their past selves.
These cells present in the outermost layer are called cells of the stratum corneum, do called because these cells are hard and cornified. The function of the stratum corneum is to protect the cells underneath from harm.
Due to constant wear and tear, these cells may be shed off and new cells will eventually take their place</p>
<p>However, in the case of deep injuries, such as in stab wounds, you basically end up killing off the cells that make the skin in the first place. In this scenario, the only thing your body can do is seal the wound by forming a scar</p>
<p>Unlike new skin, scars are not primarily made of cells, instead they have an abundance of what is known as collagen, which is a fiber found in the body.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you have a wound it is healed with connective tissue. This is what we see as a scar. Over years the connective tissue can be somewhat replaced with skin by a process called remodeling. This doesn't fully replace the connective tissue. Muscles do a similar thing and are only bound back together with connective tissue and not muscle tissue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've seen some answers in here that are correct but not ELI5, so here's my attempt:</p>
<p>You have two layers of skin. The outer layer is produced by the inner layer. If a cut goes deep enough to damage the inner layer, that will affect how it produces the outer layer in the future.</p>
<p>That's basically what a scar is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
