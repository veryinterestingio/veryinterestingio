		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simply put, the brain does not know that it will heal faster if left alone. In most cases, when your body has something stuck to the skin, itchiness can get the conscious brain to do something about it by scratching it away and letting the body start healing; but when that something is, say, a scab, the system works against itself. The situation is similar for bites and rashes; the body sends an itchiness response to make sure there is nothing on the surface of the skin that will keep causing it while the immune system deals with what's already made it into the body, but the cause of the issue is no longer directly on the skin, so the brain just made the problem worse by asking the body to keep messing with the thing its trying to heal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Foreign substances trigger the body’s immune system. The body’s immune system releases histamine, a compound that helps white blood cells get to the affected area. Histamine is what causes the itchiness, inflammation, and swelling. Bites and rashes itch because histamine sends a signal to the nerves around the affected area.</p>
<p>You are feeling the body’s response to fighting the foreign substance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain has a tendency to notice imperfections really quickly and tried to deal with them this also could be tied in with the fact that animals and our common ancestor between apes and us us would normally pick at scabs and bites and rashes</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s a constant balance with a cut, the scab formed is necessary to keep bad stuff out, but for the skin to fully heal the scab needs to be removed, the histamine causes you to itch reminding you scratch the scab which pulls bits and pieces of it off so that newly exposed regrown skin can get some air and start to stand on its own against the elements</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
