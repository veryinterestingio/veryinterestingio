I want to introduce civilization to the wonders of electricity, so the first thing I need is a strong magnet. The only sources of ferromagnetic material I know of are Lodestones, which I understand are only quite weakly magnetic.</p>
<p>So it got me to thinking...once you have a strong magnet, and once you can create electricity, creating more magnets is significantly easier. But how were the first strong magnets created?</p>
<p>There's surprisingly little written about how to make a magnet <em>in lieu of other magnets</em></p>
<p>Or, put another way, if you got thrown back in time how would you go about generating electricity for your deLorean?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first strongish magnets were created before electricity.  In the mid- 1700s people knew how to multiply the strength of permanent magnets.</p>
<p>The best paper on the subject is “A Method of Making Artificial Magnets without the Use of Natural Ones” by John Canton 1751:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/105019?seq=7#metadata_info_tab_contents" target="_blank">https://www.jstor.org/stable/105019?seq=7#metadata_info_tab_contents</a></p>
<p>iron and steel become magnetized when placed in a magnetic field; iron temporarily, steel permanently.  Stroking a piece of steel with a weak magnet makes it also a weak magnet.  Canton describes a process to (I think) align a piece of iron with the Earth’s magnetic field, use it to stroke a steel bar, then <em>stack the bars</em> in a way that creates a strong localized field.  He then stroked another steel bar with the stack, making it even more magnetic, and so on.</p>
<p>Using this technique you can magnetize steel up to its magnetic saturation point, which is respectable, enough to pick up small objects but nowhere near the strength of modern ceramic and rare earth magnets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a way of making electricity without any magnets: a chemical battery.And we know there is a way to make a battery in the ancient wold because some madman with a box did it (admittedly not as far back as 1000 BCE): <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad_Battery" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad\_Battery" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad\_Battery</a></a> [I should stress there is controversy as to whether these artefacts were actually ever actually used as batteries, and there doesn't seem to be any evidence of a thing you would do with a battery once you had it (because the time machine they were jumpstarting disappeared; come on historians! lol), but the more modern experiments show that something like this <em>could</em> function as a battery; albeit not a very good one].</p>
<p>It's basically a sealed clay jar container with an anode and cathode of differing metals in the lid, with an acidic solution inside (e.g. vinegar, fruit juice, or if you're near a volcano you'd be able to make sulphuric acid - at that point you're part way to an early car battery). Wire a few of those together and you'd have a current sufficient to magnetise iron parts. You'd then be able to use these to build a more reliable generator to hook up to a water wheel, and from there you can begin to get your time machine back up and running.</p>
<p>Good luck in your temporal travels, try to save the dodo this time around please.<br />
Or maybe correct my grammar without an edit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You could invent the first battery early using basic metals and an electrolyte (voltaic stack), and if you make a bunch of them, you could probably produce enough current to act as an electromagnet. Using that, you could produce more permanent magnets if you wish. Basically do what scientists did with decades of experimentation and refinement in just a few days.</p>
<p>Edit: the process to make more permanent magnets is to melt iron and expose it to the electromagnetic field created by the electromagnet as it cools.</p>
<p>After you make one decent magnet, you can build a generator to produce more electricity more easily, for more electromagnetic field, for better magnets and so on</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
