Those rates they charge are calculated using very high level math and models.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I know they keep a basic amount to pay claims and invest the rest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For every person who lost their drone and filed a claim, 20 others did not file one. They have teams of people called actuaries who crunch numbers to determine the percentage of customers who will ha e claims, for how much, etc. and help set profitable rates accordingly whether it’s $60 plans on drones or $2000 plans on a whole house.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They lost money on <em>you</em>, but they insured thousands of people. Some only flew the drone once (or never), others only used it very cautiously under conditions where it would almost certainly never be lost/damaged. The very riskiest drone users (who will lose drones the most) might not even bother with drone insurance because they <em>assume</em> that in their situations, insurance won't pay out.</p>
<p>If you insure 100,000 similar drones at $60 year, you take in $6,000,000 per year. At that rate, as long as you replace less than 6,000 drones (6%), you've turned a profit (we're ignoring overhead for this example). If, on a given year, you find that your profit margin is not enough (or you lost money), you raise your rates the following year. If someone loses too many drones, you probably stop offering them insurance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
