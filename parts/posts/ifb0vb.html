		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fossil fuels in many cases are still cheaper than renewable energy. Importantly they are also very reliable and can adapt quickly to demand. We don't have very effective ways to store large amounts of energy so electricity needs to be generated when we need it, and that isn't always when the wind is blowing, the sun is shining, etc.</p>
<p>If everyone comes home in the evening and turns on their appliances it isn't like we can expect the wind to blow harder to keep up. The sun isn't going to shine any more, in fact it is probably setting and solar energy output is decreasing dramatically. Also if we need energy in a specific place it is easy enough to ship coal or petroleum products to be burned there, but it isn't always the case that there is a convenient form of renewable energy to tap.</p>
<p>Many of those challenges might be possible to overcome, but the alternative is inexpensive fossil fuels which feed into an infrastructure that already exists. If you have a billion dollar power plant that burns coal to power a massive city nearby, how do you get the funding to try replacing that with another billion dollar project which has challenges with only theoretical, unproven solutions? What is available now definitely works and the massive city isn't going to enjoy being your test subject if things go wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s a huge amount of infrastructure already in place to use fossil fuels - think of all the power stations, refineries, tankers, gas stations etc. All that stuff would take a lot of time replacing. And generally countries don’t dismantle them unless they are old.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand, a big reason why fossil fuel is still more efficient and cheaper than renewable resources is the conductors commonly used to transport energy across long distances are still too inefficient to make it worth while. You only reliably collect solar/wind/hydro energy from very specific places on the planet. Highly effective &quot;superconductors&quot; are EXPENSIVE AF and in short supply. Whereas you can simply move the coal or oil where you need it and burn it much closer to where the energy will actually be used.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other answers, which I mostly agree with, a lot of the green technologies are location-dependent.</p>
<ul>
<li>Solar works less well the further you are from the equator, and it works less well when there's a lot of cloud.  (It does still work!  Just not as well.)</li>
<li>Wind only works in places where (amazingly enough) there's fairly strong, fairly consistent wind.</li>
<li>Hydro only works where there are rivers, and preferably rivers you can afford to dam.</li>
<li>Tidal only works by the ocean.</li>
<li>Geothermal only works where there's a good geoheat source close enough to the surface that you can dig to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's a lot of options, but some places are just SOL and don't check any of the above boxes.  For them, green energy would take a long time to pay for itself and it'll be understandable if they're slow and not-excited about changing over.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
