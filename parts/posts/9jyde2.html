		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The exact number will depend of course on the location, size, species, and maturity of the trees, etc. However, I found one study^(1) where researchers estimated the number of trees needed to offset the average oxygen consumption of a single person in various North American cities. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/5rKHPCO.png" target="_blank">Here is the full table</a>, where you can see that in an average city (e.g. Philadelphia) you need about 20 trees to provide enough oxygen for one person.</p>
<p>That may sound like a lot of trees, but fortunately the oxygen we breathe doesn't need to be produced locally. Forests all over the world continuously pump oxygen that is mixed into the atmosphere and spreads across the globe. Moreover, trees are not even the biggest source of oxygen on Earth. That honor goes to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoplankton#Oxygen_production" target="_blank">phytoplankton in our oceans, which collectively are responsible for the majority of the world's oxygen supply</a>.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I find it's better not to think of oxygen and CO2 as being consumed and produced.  Instead, think of carbon as existing either in biomass or in atmosphere.</p>
<p>If a plant isn't growing (because, say, it has reached its mature size), it turns CO2 to O2 during the day as it photosynthesizes, then turns it back at night as it lives off of stored energy.  It isn't making any oxygen.</p>
<p>But if you cut it down, it would get eaten by a fungus or burned by a fire and all (or most) of its carbon would be converted back into CO2.</p>
<p>We convert O2 into CO2 at the exact amount that we consume biomass.  If I grow a potato (or an edible tree), it converts CO2 into O2 and stores that carbon in a potato.  If I eat that potato, I break up that carbon and bind it to O2, and use the energy from that to drill for more fossil fuels.</p>
<p>So if you had a potato farm, fertilized it with your poop, and only ate those potatoes, you would be carbon-neutral.  No trees needed.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now think back to the Carboniferous period.  Trees develop lignin, and no microbes have figured out how to eat it yet.  So they grow, eventually fall over (because early trees had <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/phenomena/2016/01/07/the-fantastically-strange-origin-of-most-coal-on-earth/" target="_blank">weak root systems</a>), and then just pile on top of each other.  Biomass increases, atmospheric carbon levels fall, and we get giant insects because there's (relatively) more O2.</p>
<p>Many of those trees turn to coal.  If microbes hadn't evolved the ability to eat trees, then this would have kept happening until the CO2 levels were so low that plants were competing for it.  Instead, fungi started eating trees, CO2 levels rose again, but not as high as they were before -- because many of those trees had turned to coal.  So there's this phenomenon where old biomass now has a mineral form.</p>
<p>Fungi evolve how to eat tree, CO2 levels rose, and the atmosphere changed significantly and many species went extinct.  Including, I imagine, many fungi who had previously thrived on the massive volume of tree-based food available to them.</p>
<hr />
<p>So flash forward.  Now a new organism has evolved a way to take the energy out of that old biomass: coal and oil.  It's us.  We're tapping into biomass from the Carboniferous and burning it.  We can't replace old biomass, so unless we make new biomass at an equal rate, we'll change the temperature.  Instead, though, we're also destroying new biomass.</p>
<p>A gallon of gasoline <a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle" target="_blank">creates</a> 8.8kg (20 lbs) of CO2, with most of that mass coming from atmospheric O2.  A kg of tree soaks up 1.6kg of CO2.  So you would need to make 5.5kg (12 lbs) of tree per gallon of gasoline you use.</p>
<p>General Sherman, an enormous sequoia in Sequoia National Park, weighs 1.2 million kg, and is the largest tree in the world.  In the US, people use a total of 391 million gallons of gasoline per day.  So to counterbalance that, we would need to grow 1780 General Shermans <em>every day</em>.  There are about 8000 giant sequoias in Sequoia National Park, and all of them are smaller than General Sherman.  So every week, we would need to grow another one and a half Sequoia National Parks.</p>
<p>Incidentally, General Sherman is 2,300-2,700 years old.</p>
<p>Sequoia National Park is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_National_Park" target="_blank">about</a> 400,000 acres.  We're growing one Sequoia National Park per week.  Let's step out of California for a moment, because California has a lot of biomass, especially northern California.  Let's step next door to Nevada.  To keep up with USA gasoline consumption, you would need to grow one Nevada of Sequoia National Park every 2 years and 2 months.</p>
<p>In other words, since Obama was first elected (remember that?), you would need to have covered all of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Arizona with Sequoia National Park (without removing the existing biomass) in order to offset human carbon consumption in the US from gasoline alone.</p>
<p>Not counting diesel.  Not counting coal.  Not counting natural gas.  Not counting industrial use.  Not counting airline use.  Not counting the fuel used to ship goods to the US.</p>
<hr />
<p>I guess what I'm saying here, is that it's not like there's a number of trees at which we'll be all set.</p>

<p>EDITS: more sources, and more contiguous states.  Here's the maths.  Links provided separately because Reddit doesn't like links with parenthesis in it.  I also fixed some of the numbers above.  They're worse now.</p>
<p>Thanks for the gold!</p>
<p>[[[(142.98 billion gallons gasoline/year)x(8887 grams CO2/gallon gasoline)x(1 kg of tree /1.63 kg of CO2)]/(1.2 million kg of tree x 8000 trees/400000 acres)]x(time since noon, Jan 20, 2009)]/(area of Texas + Oklahoma + Arkansas + Arizona) = 0.97</p>
<p>Gallons consumed in 2017: <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=23&t=10" target="_blank">https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=23&t=10</a> -- I didn't check how gallons/year changed since 2009, so consider this only a commentary on current usage.</p>
<p>CO2 emitted per gallon of gasoline: <a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle" target="_blank">https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle</a> -- it's more than 1:1 because the CO2 mass includes the mass of the O2 consumed in burning it.</p>
<p>CO2-to-tree ratio: <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-many-trees-does-it-take-to-transform-one-ton-of-CO2-into-oxygen-over-the-time-of-one-year-Are-there-any-statistics-for-different-trees-leaf-trees-conifers-or-even-other-plants" target="_blank">https://www.quora.com/How-many-trees-does-it-take-to-transform-one-ton-of-CO2-into-oxygen-over-the-time-of-one-year-Are-there-any-statistics-for-different-trees-leaf-trees-conifers-or-even-other-plants</a> -- this one's a weak point in my maths, because it was somebody else's napkin-maths.

<p>Okay, one more edit: there are a lot of non-Sequoia trees in Sequoia National Park.  It's about one sequoia per thirty football fields.  Typical temperate forest sequesters 5.6kg of carbon per square meter, in both its tree mass and in its soil (<a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/004/y1997e/y1997e07.htm" target="_blank">source</a> -- that's 59 gigatons/10.4 million square kilometers.)  So using that instead, we get:</p>
<p>[(142.98 billion gallons/year)x(8887 grams/gallon)x(12 g C/44 g CO2)]/[5.6 kg/(square meter)]</p>
<p>That means we need about 1,960 m^2 per <em>second</em> of temperate forest growth (about the size of the apartment I shared with two housemates when I was in medical school... every second), to keep up with gasoline use.</p>
<p>How long would that take to cover Texas?  Almost exactly as long as it has been since the iPhone was released, in June 2007.</p>
<p>(The fact that these numbers aren't <em>that</em> different is a testament to how much carbon General Sherman has sequestered.)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is something I read very recently that gives an estimate on the numbers of trees required per person to sequestrant the CO2 produced. But i think with the estimate of 1 mole of O2 being produced for 1 mole of CO2 consumed, a correlation can be made.</p>
<p>&quot;World Health Organization has recommended
a minimum green space of 9.5 m2
/person) considering the services (oxygen, moderation of
micro climate) and goods of an urban environment. Estimates indicate that about 6 tons of
carbon is sequestered by 1 hectare of forests annually and this averages out as the carbon
sequestration of 6 kg/tree/year. Per capita respiratory carbon ranges from 192 to 328 kg/year
depending on the physiology of humans. Generally, the carbon dissipated through respiration
varies from 525 to 900 gm/day/person. This means 32 to 55 trees per person in a region is
required to exclusively mitigate respiratory CO2.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I imagine quite a few, but no where near as many phytoplankton it would take. Luckily there's a great many of those floating about. It's a common misconception that trees are very important for making oxygen, while they do contribute, they produce a smaller portion of the vital exhaust gas.</p>
<p>As much as 54% of photosynthesis occours on land, but terrestrial plants produce more rigid bodies, which makes them great sinks for carbon, but seaborne flora can happily float along running thier engine at top efficiency.</p>
<p>It is estimated (from what I have read) that 75% of the annual source of atmospheric oxygen (O2) can be traced back to phytoplankton, the near-surface families of plankton, one of the more vibile of these are algae. They make a lot of algae in both fresh and sea water.</p>
