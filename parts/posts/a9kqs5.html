		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is due to the fact that even though electrons have negative charge they are bound to the nucleus by the attraction force from the nucleus and thus they have to somehow be around the nucleus and at the same time be in the lowest possible energy situation. This is done by pairing of the electrons which have opposite spins. The spin can either be +1/2 or -1/2 and so when 2 electrons form pairs they are as such they are of opposite spins to maintain the overall energy of the system (nucleus+ electrons/ electron cloud) to the minimum and be stable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It helps to imagine people getting into a car. You (electrons) all want to be in the car (attraction to the nucleus). However, you also want as much space as you can get between yourself and the other people. Additionally, some spots in the car are more comfortable (lower orbital energy). So the first person will always sit in the driver's seat, the second will usually sit shotgun, the third will sit in one of the back window seats, etc. </p>
<p>You'll only really cram in if there's enough seats to fit everyone. But there's also a limit to how many people can fit in a given car, just like how there's a limit to how many electrons can orbit a nucleus, and it depends on the charge of the nucleus. You might try to cram an extra person in there (acidic environment, ion) but at a certain point you'll need another car. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
