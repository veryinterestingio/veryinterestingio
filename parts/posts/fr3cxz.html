		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The lenses make everything appear like it is about 2 meters from your eyes, this is actually the cause of the visual distortions most of us get when we first play vr - two parts of our brain are interpreting the distance differently.</p>
<p>It's also why if you hold things close to your face in vr they become blurry, even if nearsighted.</p>
<p>I am far-sighted, and it's amazing to see things a meter away in full detail again without glasses (I don't do contacts) .</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>EDIT: I actually flipped my terms!</strong> Apparently, I've been confusing focus (accommodation) and convergence (vergence) for years! It is <em>focus</em> that remains constant while your <em>convergence</em> changes with depth in VR. I will be changing the answer to reflect this! Shoutout to u/ShelfordPrefect for pressuring me to do more research and helped me finally realize my mistake! (FYI, the technical term for this concept is the 'vergance-accommodation conflict' if anyone wants to learn more!)</p>
<p>Okay, actual VR creator here. I did my thesis on stereoscopic media, so I can give an in-depth answer to this. The key ideas we need to know here are <em>focus</em> and <em>convergence</em>. Focus is the adjustment of the iris and other muscles in/near the eye to allow your brain to perceive detail at a certain depth; convergence is where your eyes are pointed toward in physical space. In real life, where your eyes focus and where they converge are the same - we use our eye muscles to see detail at the actual physical distance of the object from us. But in VR, this is different: the screens in the headset are always at a fixed (let's say 1&quot;) distance from our eyes, regardless of where in the screen we focus. So if an object in VR is a virtual distance of 15 feet away, our eyes will &quot;focus&quot; at the physical distance of the screen (1 inch) but converge on the virtual distance of the object (15 feet).</p>
<p>So we know that in VR, focus and convergence are separate values for our brain. But why does this mean we don't have perfect vision in VR? Near/farsightedness is caused by problems aiming light at the retina. Light enters through the pupil and aims for the retina, which is basically a small dot at the back of the eyeball. In a 'normal' eye, the lens/iris and the angles of the eyes (convergence) work together to focus the light onto the retina, giving you perfect focus and detail. But if the eyeball is too long or short, the light does not hit the retina at the right distance, and the resulting vision is out of focus. This means that if an object is focused at a distance that is beyond your normal vision, you will lose detail and visual clarity.</p>
<p>So how does this relate to VR? As we discussed, focus and convergence are separated in VR. This means that even though the screen may be one inch away (and in focus/detail for the nearsighted) the convergence of the eyes might be set for a different distance. If your eyes are converged on an object/distance beyond your visual acuity, it will appear out of focus, <em>regardless of your eyes' focus on the headset screens</em>. So no matter how close or far the VR screens are from you, if you can't see detail at a distance in reality, you can't see it in virtual reality either!</p>
<p>So how do we fix this? As others mentioned, there are prescription lenses you can buy for headsets. These function like normal glasses or contacts to redirect/focus the light entering your eye so it hits your retina accurately. These can be expensive, though, so many headsets are designed to be worn with glasses. If you can wear contacts, that's my preferred way to play! :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other folks have provided good answers here. That said, you can guy prescription lenses for your headset that snap over the built-in lenses. They are less than $100USD and very worth it. They come from Europe, so delivery takes 2-3 weeks. They just snap in place for installation. Easy to remove if needed if you have more than one user for your headset.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
