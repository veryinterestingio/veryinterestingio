		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctor here. There are two &quot;types&quot; (or criteria) of death, cardiac and brain, that need to be present and confirmed for a person to be l classed as clinically dead. If somebodies heart stops beating effectively, you attempt CPR because the brain is still alive, at least for a few minutes. Alternatively, if somebody is &quot;brain dead&quot;, you can still keep their heart beating and lungs breathing artificially and their organs will continue to function in the absence of brain activity. They go hand in hand though, so an absence of one will generally lead to the death of the other without intervention. Absent of cardiac activity and blood supply will lead to irreversible brain damage and death, and absence of brain activity will cause you to stop breathing, which will lead to cardiac death through lack of oxygen.</p>
<p>For this reason, when you verify death you have to check for cardiorespiratory death and brain stem death. You approach the body and check for a response to voice and pain, and other signs of life. You then check for pupil response, which is a brain stem reflex. If their pupils are fixed and dilated, with no response to light, then you can confirm brainstem death. You then feel for a pulse and listen to their chest for a heartbeat and breathing sounds to confirm they have cardiac/respiratory death. This should be done for a few minutes. If you can confirm both brain and cardiac activity are absent, then you can clinically verify them as dead.</p>
<p>They could have died minutes or even hours before, but the time of death is recorded as when a doctor (or somebody else who is qualified to do so) verifies they are dead, at least this is what happens in a hospital.</p>
<p>Edit: as stated by others, there are other criteria for deciding brain death in certain situations, such as organ donation. A full diagnosis of brain death or brainstem death is also more complex, pupil response is just one reflex and one way to indicate it and is usually enough in most circumstances if you have also confirmed absence of breathing or cardiac activity. And the difference between clinical death and legal death can be different. But as an ELI5 answer addressing a complex concept, I think this post covers the basics alright. There are some further posts in the replies if people want more details. I should also note that my medical experience and training was in the UK, mostly on general medical wards. Different circumstances and different countries may require a different approach. And yes I realise that somebodies should be somebody's.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Brain death is generally used now as the standard, legal definition of death. It has been since we got reasonably good at restarting speed hearts and doing heart transplants. Doesn't make much sense to say, legally, that someone died if we just shocked them and brought them back.</p>
<p>That said, in most cases heat and brain death go hand in hand so they won't necessarily do tests on the brain to confirm death of, say, a ninety year old on hospice care. It's not relevant in cases where the hat can be sustained with support but the brain is dead, meaning they'll never be able to live independently again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Brain death can be somewhat complicated to verify. Heart stoppage is very easy to verify and it is common knowledge that without a heartbeat the brain can only survive 4-6 minutes. (CPR can prolong brain life for about 20 minutes- If the heart has not been restarted at that point the chance of survival is next to zero)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>But that's not the only thing that's checked before tossing the body in the ol' incinerator; that's just what plays best on TV.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All the other answers you've gotten are quite good and my last paragraph here gives a short version really. But I wanted to add something my mum said that kinda stuck with me regarding death.</p>
<p>My mother is a GP Nurse in Scotland and during her courses to get qualified she had to do a several month long stint in a couple of local Hospitals. In her time there, and despite learning about death as par for the course, she learned one thing about death that no course ever taught her.</p>
<p>&quot;You're not dead until you're warm and dead&quot;</p>
<p>Your heart can stop, your brain can stop registering activity, but there are still, somehow, many cases of people randomly regaining consciousness even as late as the autopsy table. The prevailing theory is that body usually slows in cold weather, and the warming up can sometimes reactivate an apparently stopped heart for example. So, if you die and your body cools, fine, but if you warm up and still don't regain consciousness, THEN you're dead.</p>
<p>So to answer your question, like others said, the heart is just an easy thing to measure. Brain activity is probably more accurate, but we're still not entirely sure how it works and therefore have a bit more difficulty giving values to the activity within. However neither are 100% guarantees on whether someone is actually dead for good.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
