		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically all the Covid-19 tests operate on a spectrum that is based on two factors: speed VS sensitivity.</p>
<p>The rapid tests emphasize speed over sensitivity. They give you a result fast, but if you have the beginnings of an infection and you’re at a point in time where viral load is low, the rapid test may not detect this and can potentially give you a false negative result. </p>
<p>A negative result from a rapid test means one of two things: you are either not infected, or you are infected but your viral load is very low.</p>
<p>The other types of tests which require 24-48 hours of processing time are very sensitive. They can detect the virus even if your viral load is very low. A negative result from this type of test means you were almost assuredly not at all infected with Covid-19 at the time you took the test.</p>
<p>If a person is asymptomatic then it stands to reason that they may be infected but also have a low viral load. If I needed to be sure about their status, I would want this person to take the slow test because it is possible the rapid test would miss the correct result in a person with low viral load.</p>
<p>What is the benefit of a rapid test? Might be useful for testing immediately prior to an event. It would reduce greatly (but not totally eliminate) the possibility that someone attending the event might be infected and have a high enough current viral load to infect others. Can also be useful for granting a small peace of mind while awaiting the results of the slower test.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Couple of different tests out there.  </p>
<p>Antibody, PCR, and Antigen.  </p>
<p>Antibody is mostly for telling whether you might have had the virus at some point, or whether you have some level of immunity because of vaccination.  It seemed like this was going to be huge early in but isn’t really talked about as much now.  </p>
<p>Then you have PCR.  It is mostly done in a lab on machines that run a thousand samples at a time. Sending to a lab, making its way through the queue, etc… all takes time.  If it is processed in a hospital lb where it was collected then turn around is fairly quick but generally takes 2-5 days.  </p>
<p>There are devices that can do rapid PCR tests where collection occurs.  Think those take about thirty minutes to run. There isn’t as much capacity with those as the labs have.  </p>
<p>The PCR lab test is the gold standard though.  </p>
<p>Then you have antigen.  Antigen also shows active infection.  And can come in kits similar to pregnancy tests.  </p>
<p>My understanding is that they are pretty accurate for telling when you don’t have the virus.  And are probably accurate when telling you that you have the virus, but a confirming PCR test is normally recommended for positive results.  </p>
<p>These antigen tests have several advantages, cheap, quick, and easy to do at home.  I picked up a box of two at CVS for about $24 just in case I needed to test myself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two types of tests that you’ll commonly see: molecular/PCR and antigen. </p>
<p>Molecular or PCR tests use a process called DNA amplification to directly detect viral DNA. They’re very sensitive and accurate, typically capable of detecting the presence of the virus within a couple of days after infection. They’re also fairly expensive and often time-consuming; there are rapid versions available that will provide results in less than an hour, but most require a day or two of processing at a lab. If you must have a COVID test for travel, this is the only type that most governments will accept. If you’re in a hurry and need results right away you might pay as much as US$250 or more for a rapid PCR test, but if you can wait a day or two your doctor or health insurance provider may be able to offer it for far less money. There are home versions of molecular tests; some require you to take a sample and send it to a lab, but there are a couple that will give you results on the spot in less than an hour. They tend to be somewhat less accurate and the results may not be acceptable for travel purposes.</p>
<p>The other type, antigen tests, use a chemical reaction to detect the proteins that make up the external shell of the virus. They’re much less sensitive and are not considered as accurate; they don’t work well until an infection is well established. If you’re feeling sick and you need to know if it’s COVID, this type of test may be useful, but they’re not acceptable for most travel. They’re quick, easy to use, and cheap, and can often be done at home. Most look a lot like home pregnancy tests.</p>
<p>There’s a third type of test that looks for antibodies, proteins that your body produces to help fight the infection, but they’re not used for diagnosis because they won’t tell you whether you’re currently infected… they’ll only tell you that you were infected at some point, even after you’re fully recovered.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
