		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. This is in fact the mechanism presumed for a number of autoimmune diseases that appear to be precipitated by a viral illness.</p>
<p>Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis would be a great example (except it is caused by a bacterial pathogen rather than viral.)</p>
<p>Thin membrane nephropathy, IgA nephropathy, MPGN, and FSGS are themselves also often heralded by a recent upper respiratory tract infection.</p>
<p>Hepatitis C associated cryoglobulinemia or Hep B induced membranous nephropathy are all great examples.</p>
<p>Also see reactive arthritis and post-viral urticaria and pityriasis rosea (similar concept but I’m not 100% sure these are known to be antibody mediated)</p>
<p>And yes, these occur at least in part because of some dysregulation of the immune system causing an inability to dampen itself. There are of course many mechanisms and they are complex and how they become dysregulated isn’t something that is fully understood.</p>
<p>One example would be antibodies we produce against antibodies themselves to help remove excess antibodies. In some cases, they instead end up cross linking the antibodies and increasing the inflammation further. Such anti-idiotypic antibodies, called rheumatoid factor, have been implicated in a number of autoimmune diseases (of which rheumatoid arthritis is only one.)</p>
<p>EDIT: Guillaine Barre Syndrome was another great example I missed out so I’m throwing it in here - classically triggered after bacterial diarrhoeal illness, but also a known rare complication after influenza vaccination.</p>
<p>Or what about cold AIHA (autoimmune hemolytic anemia) after a nice mycoplasma infection?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. This is very much a thing.</p>
<p>It is one of the reasons why post vaccination patients (of novel vaccine)  are monitored.</p>
<p>You can very well trigger an autoimmune response in your body when you make immunoglobulins against a viral antigen that also interacts with your own body.</p>
<p>In fact, it happens often enough with bacteria as well. Many forms of kidney failure in the young are triggered by the immune reaction to streptococcus.</p>
<p>Also, many forms of type I (juvenile) diabetes are thought to be caused by the body's immune response to a viral infection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The loss of tolerance for self antigens has been defined as autoimmune disease. Interestingly, most autoimmune diseases have at least one infection implicated in their origin.</p>
<p>&quot;Autoantibodies may also be seen in infectious diseases in patients without ADs (autoimmune diseases) indicating that the presence of a pathogen may lead to the occurrence of autoimmune phenomena.&quot; (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459437/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459437/</a>)</p>
<p>So it can certainly happen. In fact, many non-infectious chronic diseases (think cancer or cardiovascular disease) are becoming increasingly linked to infections and antibiotics, through their effects on the immune system.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer to this is “yes, but.” There are several viruses, of which HIV is probably the best known, that enclose their typical protein capsid inside a phospholipid-glycoprotein envelope. The envelope is derived in part from the cell membrane of the host cells, which means many of the glycoproteins are also host-derived. Some of the “correct” antibodies for the virus would be destructive to the host, so the host doesn’t typically make those antibodies at all, which is one of the reasons why those viruses are so pernicious.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that viral infection can be linked to acquired autoimmune diseases, though the mechanism isn’t quite as simple as the body producing self-destructive antibodies by mistake.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>B cells recognize a pathogen with something called the B cell receptor (which is essentially just an antibody that’s embedded in the cell and transmits signals- the antibodies that a B cell makes will be identical to its BCR). Every single B cell has a unique receptor that is generated at random. To prevent you from having B cells that recognize things that they shouldn’t, there’s a screening process during the development of the cell. Any B cell that gets triggered by its BCR too strongly at a certain stage of development will die instead of becoming a mature B cell. So anything that strongly recognizes your own tissues should be weeded out by this process (T cells go through something similar too).</p>
<p>So to get back to your question, it’s theoretically possible that the best possible antibody against a virus would be one that can damage your own tissue. But if your immune system is doing what it’s supposed to any cells that would make that antibody should have been eliminated before they ever got the chance to react to a virus. It’s not a perfect system and there are a lot of other checks in place that can restrain immune responses after they’ve started, but that’s beyond the scope of a single Reddit comment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
