		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know that distances can be measured by laser but only if it gets reflected on the object, so that wouldnt work quite well I guess? How do we find out the exact distance between planets and the sun or other astronomical objects without sending a probe that is kept track of? I cant think of any other method to measure such long distances and when I asked my father about it he didnt really know either, he just said that it could maybe be derived by the planets weight and how fast it moves, but how do we know the weight?</p>
<p>(I am sorry for my lack of english skills and hope that this isnt a dumb and silly question)</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Look for &quot;Kepler's Third Law.&quot;</p>
<p>Kepler discovered that the square of the period of a planet (the planet's year) is proportional to the cube of its distance from the sun. </p>
<p>So if we say that Earth is 1 AU from the sun and it has a 1-year year, then we can look at Mars with a year of 1.88 years. That tells us a = (1.88)\^(2/3)= 1.52. So we'd calculate Mars was 1.52 AU from the sun, which is correct.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is quite easy to get <em>relative</em> distances - e.g. the orbital radius of Venus relative to the orbital radius of Earth - from Kepler's laws. The challenge was to get an absolute distance (or a measurement relative to the known diameter of Earth).</p>
<p>Historic approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Looking at Jupiter's moons. They orbit with always the same period, but one half of the year we move towards Jupiter, the other half we move away. This changes the perceived duration of the orbits. The difference is just 0.01%, but enough to determine our orbital speed around the Sun (if you know the speed of light).</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_of_Venus#1761_and_1769" target="_blank">Venus transits</a> and parallax. From different places on Earth the transit looks slightly different, how much depends on the length scale.</li>
<li>Aberration. Due to the motion of Earth the apparent position of light sources far away shift slightly over a year. Measure it and you get the orbital speed.</li>
<li>Red/blueshift. As we move towards/away from stars their frequency shifts. Another measurement of the orbital speed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Modern approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Radar. Send a strong pulse and wait for the reflection, the time between tells you the distance and the frequency also gives you the relative (radial) speed. We have radar measurements of most planets and various asteroids today.</li>
<li>Watch the trajectory of spacecraft. As we can communicate with them and have accurate clocks on them, this gives extremely precise measurements. We know the average Earth/Sun distance with an uncertainty of a few meters today.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Parallax.  As early as the 1600s they could calculate the distance to the sun of about 93M miles.  You take measurements from places on earth thousands of miles apart.  Even in the time of Cassini they knew Saturn was roughly 900M miles from the sun</p>
<p>Once you know the earths position at different times of year, and the distance to the sun you can calculate the distance of other stars since the measurement points are 180M miles apart every 6 months.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of people are saying use Kepler's third law or parallax, but I didn't see anyone explain how Kepler figured out the relative distances between the Sun and the planets.  This is really important because Kepler didn't have the law to figure things out.  He had to deduce the law from observational data.  It's easiest to explain for the inner planets because a single type of observation works.</p>
<p>The planets look to be in different places in the sky at different times.  Imagine a line from your eye to the Sun and another line from your eye to one of the planets.  There is an angle between these two lines.  Let's take Mercury as an example.  On some early morning imagine we just begin to see Mercury rise before the Sun.  The next morning the planet rises a little earlier and the angle between Mercury and the Sun gets bigger.  Each morning we see that angle grow until it reaches a maximum.  After that the angle starts to shrink.  We have a triangle here.  The three corners are Earth, the Sun, and Mercury.  We also know the angle between the Earth/Sun and Earth/Mercury lines.  Importantly, when that angle is maximum we know that the angle between the Earth/Mercury and Mercury/Sun lines is 90 degrees.  Since we know the two angles, we also know the third.  Further, we know that the Earth/Sun line is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.  Take this length to be 1 AU, and trigonometry lets us figure out the Mercury/Sun distance and the Earth/Mercury distance.</p>
<p>For the outer planets you need to figure out the orbital period first, then you can figure out the distances independently of Kepler's third law.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically someone on the earth takes a very accurate measurement of say the planet Mars. Point A</p>
<p>Someone else AT THE SAME TIME also takes a measurement of the position of Mars. Point B</p>
<p>The distance between Point A and Point B are measured. </p>
<p>Then we use the good old Greek triangles to measure the distance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
