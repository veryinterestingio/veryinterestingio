		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually right up my alley as I study atmospheric science and have even done some storm chasing myself. If your son hasn’t had the chance, I’d definitely recommend watching old TV shows like Storm Chasers from  the Discovery Channel or storm chaser videos that come out on YouTube after every big tornado event! Also the weather service has great resources such as <a href="https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/tornadoes/faq/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/tornadoes/faq/" target="_blank">https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/tornadoes/faq/</a></a> with plenty of information. I've left out peer-reviewed sources since I don't imagine they're of much interest to a 7 year old.</p>
<ol>
<li>When you see thunderstorms, you’re seeing rising air fueled with energy from water condensing into the cloud we see. The rising air is called and updraft, and the thunderstorm has to continually suck in air from the surrounding environment to fuel it. If the winds in the atmosphere change direction with height, this can cause the core of the storm to rotate – a rotating updraft is called a mesocyclone. Now the tricky part is we actually don’t have a complete theory for how these rotating updrafts form tornadoes – some do but most do not – and this is a topic of ongoing research! If we could figure this out, it would save many lives.<br />
Tornadoes rotate because the storm rotates – it’s an extension of this updraft that reaches the surface. Most of the tornadoes we typically think of are produced by supercells, which are the strongest type of thunderstorm. These storms have towering cumulonimbus clouds, have a rotating updraft (mesocyclone), and are fueled by energy from the sun and water vapor and by strong winds in the atmosphere.Fun fact - a supercell's updraft can carry tornado debris to as high as 30 thousand feet, after which it can fall out hundreds of miles away. Seeing this debris on radar is one of the main ways scientists such as those at the National Weather Service can 'see' a tornado without actually being near the storm and warn the public. The height debris reaches is correlated very well with tornado strength and the strength of the thunderstorm updraft.</li>
<li>The winds in tornadoes are so strong because the winds in thunderstorms are so strong! The speed of the updraft in a supercell can exceed 40 m (130 feet) per second, and air is drawn in rapidly to replace air that has risen. As air is drawn  into a tornado and rotates around it, it speeds up much like an ice skater drawing their arms to spin faster. This is because of conservation of angular momentum. A tornado is basically a tiny low-pressure system (like a hurricane or your sink draining) and the winds increase toward the center similarly.Fun fact - we see clouds in tornadoes (called the condensation funnel) because the pressure decreases and water vapor condenses inside the vortex, but the tornado is bigger than the cloud, and a condensation funnel is not necessary for a tornado to exist and do damage.</li>
<li>Tornadoes are not thought to have ‘eyes’ in the same way hurricanes do, but the wind speed at the center is 0. If you looked at a cross section of a tornado (see the link in 4), the wind profile in a tornado increases as you move towards the center  –  but it can’t go up forever! Near the center, it turns back towards 0 before increasing again on the other side. Any vortex has a calm center like this!</li>
<li>In some ways yes. The area near the center has the fastest winds, though the center itself has the weakest wins. Observed wind profiles from real tornadoes such as <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167610517301174#fig6" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167610517301174#fig6" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167610517301174#fig6</a></a> show this pattern.Typically however, being in the center of a tornadoes path <em>is</em> the worst place to be. As a tornado moves, the areas in the center of its path will spend the longest time inside, will experience the strongest winds twice, and will endure a complete 180 degree turnaround in violent winds. This does a lot of damage!</li>
<li>Things damaged by a tornado typically are damaged by other things inside a tornado more than they are by the winds themselves. Most of the damage you see when a tornado hits trees or buildings is from debris picked up by the tornado and hurled around! This is actually a reasonably large issue in determining tornado strength. We rate tornadoes using the EF scale, from the weakest EF-0, to the strongest EF-5, but ratings are given based on damage caused. The widest tornado ever recorded, the El Reno, OK tornado in 2013, was a staggering 2.6 miles wide and is often thought to be an EF-5. Researchers nearby recorded nearly 300 mph winds (EF-5 strength) inside the tornado using radar, but since we officially assess tornado strength by damage caused and the El Reno tornado was primarily in open fields, it ended up with only an EF-3 rating.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope this helps, I'd be happy to elaborate or answer more questions!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Meteorologist here (MSc), and I can answer question 1 rigourously! For a tornado to form there has to be wind shear: that is, the wind speed and direction has to be changing with height. This creates the initial momentum that causes tornadoes. Then you need buoyancy, to add to the energy that causes tornados.</p>
<p>Careful though -- too much shear, and the system will be &quot;sheared away&quot; as We call it, too stretched out to do anything. Too much buoyancy, Though, and it'll collapse onto itself. So Theres this balance between shear and buoyancy (something we call the richardson number, or the BRN).</p>
<p>What happens when you get the right mix of shear and buoyancy? A bunch of math happens in the form of the vorticity equation. Essentially, the buoyancy tilts the shear so that instead of vertical shear you have horizontal shear (a difference in wind speed horizontally). Here's a picture of it, google vortex tube tilting: <a href="https://www.boston.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Supercell20final-thumb-453x837-103416.png" target="_blank">https://www.boston.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Supercell20final-thumb-453x837-103416.png</a> . As it stretches out due to buoyancy, it increases in angular velocity (think of a ballet dancer pulling himself in to increase his rate of rotation), and voila, you have a tornado!</p>
<p>Fun fact for your kid, the vortex tube tilting always generates two tornadoes, but generally the left one dies.</p>
<p>Happy to clarify anything here.</p>
<p>Edit: in summary: wind shear creates horizontal angular momentum. Buoyancy tilts that into vertical angular momentum and stretches it out to increase the wind speed and rotation.</p>
<p>Also edited: angular velocity, not angular momentum, thanks u/geeflexx for catching that</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
