<p>It takes in consideration both influence of ecological additives to fuel for standard cars and non-green energy used for charging electrical vehicles, and still EVs win.</p>
<p>In Europe where is a lot of renewable powerplants the total emissions per lifecycle are up to two-thirds lower, in India with much more emissions created in power plants it is still up to 20-30 % better to use EVs. There is a nice visualisation in the study article.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There have been studies about this. The idea is that it takes about four years worth of carbon dioxide emissions from a traditional gas-powered car to mine the stuff to make one electric vehicle. So the upfront cost is maybe higher, but it pays itself off as long as you keep driving it beyond that four year mark.</p>
<p>Also technology will improve to make batteries more efficient, require fewer resources, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ICE needs materials that have to be mined too. Steel isn't really better than copper, silicon and lithium.</p>
<p>But the power generation alone is a huge game changer. Even if you'd fuel it 100% from coal powerplants you'd save COÂ² because a modern powerplant has roughly 40% efficiency (transport, battery, E-motor reduce that by 10% giving a total of 36%) and a ICE has less than 20% efficiency. And you can obviously get it from renewable sources too.</p>
<p>The main issue is that combustion loses efficiency when running in the wrong operation point. A powerplant will always run at it's optimum RPM</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Turning fossil fuels into energy at a power plant is a <em>lot</em> more efficient than distributing gasoline to individual cars and having every car convert it into energy through a combustion engine. Power plants can be a lot more sophisticated, take advantage of economies of scale, and implement features that just aren't practical to include in cars. </p>
<p>For a simple example, even if you made a power plant that was simply a giant car engine burning gasoline, you could use its heat exhaust as the energy input to a separate steam engine, capturing much of the energy a car would just lose to the surrounding air. But you would never put a second engine into a car just to capture the extra energy, and if you did, manufacturing and maintaining that engine would offset a lot of the savings. For a power plant, though, it's a no-brainer, and for reasons like this even a 'dirty' power plant generating electricity can be 3x as energy-efficient as a gasoline-powered car.</p>
<p>That's obviously before you get into the ability of electrical systems to gradually make more and more use of geothermal energy, wind energy, solar energy, and so on. Then you get into the other benefits, like more centralized pollution (so the power plant can have efficient pollution-capturing or filtering systems it wouldn't be practical to attach to every single car separately), less waste material and waste production associated with maintenance, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to other comments about the carbon footprint of an individual ICE vs a power plant - the amount of electronics in an electric car is not that much higher than an ICE car. Modern combustion engines are all driven by electronics (starting with the ECU, and injection electronics), the ABS system, stability control systems, etc. + the in car dashboard of course that also works with a lot of electronics. ICE needs also to drive an alternator which is basically an electric engine (used the opposite way obviously).</p>
<p>So comparing the amount of electronics, the difference is not that much at all, since you remove the injection electronics but add the power regulation for electric motors...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
