Extra breathes minutes before the action can help. Also there is no proof some of them havent got brain damage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The true world record is 11:21, as I remember. &quot;True&quot; as in unassisted.</p>
<p>Guinness world records are done with oxygen, and currently at around 22 minutes. The athlete breathes oxygen half an hour before the attempt, which essentially saturates the blood plasma with oxygen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because when you hold your breath you still have some oxygen running through your veins and your body can function with it for a short period of time. Whereas when you hit your head or something like that that affects circulation, that’s when oxygen doesn’t reach the brain</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you are confusing it with oxygen going to your brain, to oxygen in your system. :)
When choked, it limits the oxygen carrying blood to your brain, as opposed to forcing your entire system to operate on less oxygen like when you are holding your breath. :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don’t use all the oxygen you breathe in; you actually exhale a good bit of oxygen, too. This why CPR works: you’re breathing out enough oxygen to keep someone else alive. One deep breath in can last you longer than you think, especially if you are fit and trained — physically and mentally — to maximize it.</p>
<p>Divers often hyperventilate to force as much oxygen into their system as possible before holding that last extended lungful of air. They also typically are fit, so that their bodies use oxygen more efficiently. They also learn how to recognize and delay responding to carbon dioxide buildup signals (if you breathe out that carbon dioxide waste gas, you lose valuable oxygen). And swimming in cool to cold water also kicks in oxygen optimization effects in the body as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
