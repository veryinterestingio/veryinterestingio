		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The numbers are binary. When you program with words, that interface converts the words to binary numbers for the actual computing.  </p>
<p>Those numbers direct EVERYTHING. for the image, they print one pixel on the screen at a time. The numbers tell it which positions to be in (pixel location on screen) along with what colour to be. </p>
<p>For the size of objects it’s easy to use math. Think 2x2 pixels for a small square image and 10x10 pixels for a large square. That’s all math, is which is what computers were made for.  </p>
<p>The computer has a processing speed, say 2 gigahertz. That means the processor processes 2,000,000,000 calculations per second.  </p>
<p>Imagine playing battleship with your friend. He tells you A1 is red. A2 is red. A3 is blue. A4 is red. A5 is blue. And so on. That is what is happening when the pixels are told what to do and how it knows which pixel should be what colour.  </p>
<p>Computers and game consoles need to “load” a level before you can start playing because even at 2,000,000,000 calculations per second it can still take a while to process all the variables.  </p>
<p>For a shoot ‘em up game, the computer uses more math for hitpoints. It knows you are at 88% health and just keeps subtracting as you get hit more. It knows that when the enemy’s health gets to zero that it needs to process another action (enemy dies).  It’s like when your doorbell rings you know to go answer it. </p>
<p>Computers do one thing at a time (mostly). So it’ll update every single pixel on the screen, and then adjust the hitpoints of all the players, then update all the pixels on the screen, then update all the hitpoints of the players.  And so on. It does that for every process, like looking for button presses or stick movement.   </p>
<p>Sometimes it may not even change anything. For example, it checks to see if you’ve been hit by another player.  If not, it does NOT subtract anything from your health. X button is STILL not being pressed? Then it continues to do nothing.  When you eventually press the X button then it will initiate the sequence of events that are to happen.  </p>
<p>Computers keep all the variables and screen colours separated by “addresses”, just like how your mail man only delivers your mail to you. You can think of your neighborhood like a screen made up of pixels. Each house is a pixel.  It’s one mail man but everyone gets their mail every single day.  It just takes time.  </p>
<p>Computers freeze when there is an error and it doesn’t know what to do. Imagine if you went to check your mail and there was an elephant in the mail box. You would have no clue how to deal with that.  </p>
<p>Remember, this is 2,000,000,000 calculations PER SECOND.  That is a lot of stuff to check and a lot of numbers to crunch.  </p>
<p>It’s really amazing but keep in mind the first calculator was the size of a house and all it did was add numbers.  What you are seeing is the culmination of decades of advancement in technology to make all this magic happen.</p>

<p>Organization.  Smaller things are organized into groups that have properties not present in any of the individual pieces.  Something that understands that organization can interpret it and extract information from them.  These groups themselves are organized into larger and larger groups, squiggles into letters, letters into words, words into sentences, until complex messages are being conveyed, messages completely divorced for their constituent parts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The 1's and 0's are grouped into short sequences with specific meaning. Example:</p>
<p>10010000 equates to the x86 instruction &quot;NOP&quot; - short for &quot;No Operation&quot;. Literally, do nothing for 1 CPU clock tick.</p>
<p>Other sequences equate to other things.</p>
<p>Large complex things are built out of these simple things, much like a lego set.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, one thing you can’t guess: a string of binary code just represents a plain old number.</p>
<p>For instance, 1011010 means 90. 101101010110101011010 means 1,486,170. I won’t explain here how one becomes the other because that’s a bit mathematically tedious, but just note that every number translates as a binary string, and every binary string translates as a number.</p>
<p>(Why 1s and 0s for computers? Because electronics works with electricity, electricity is either on or off, two states, 1 or 0.)</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Alright now that you know that, when you think about it, it’s outrageous the kinds of data you can represent with numbers.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Take a letter for instance.</p>
<p>“E” is the 5th letter of the alphabet; so if you decided to use that alphabet, the binary code representing 5 could mean “E”. Or you could use a different alphabet, one with all the lowercase and uppercase letters, and maybe it could have a ton of special characters and punctuations too. Oh, and optionally, it could contain Cyrillic characters so you can also write in Russian, French accents, etc.</p>
<p>If you can represent one letter with one number, then BAM! you can represent all the books in the world as a sequence of numbers.</p>
<p>Fun fact: bugs from using the wrong “alphabet” (encoding format) for a piece of data are among the WORST to figure out, as you can imagine. It would happen a ton decades ago, but thankfully are more rare now that most of the industry has ended rallying around one called “UTF-8”.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Take a color.</p>
<p>A rainbow goes from red to purple and meets all colors, so you can set a number for the distance from red for instance. A rainbow doesn’t get colors darker, so you can set another number for how dark. With those 2 numbers, I believe you can represent all colors you could ever need.
The way a computer typically does it though is not like that: it takes a value of how much red, of how much green, and of how much blue, and it mixes them up like paint. It’s less visually imaginable, but you can trust me that with those 3 numbers, you can also represent all colors you could ever need. This is called RGB (Red-Green-Blue, how original).</p>
<p>Say you have an image of 1000 pixels by 1000 pixels. So, that’s 1,000,000 pixels to represent. You can just spell each color of each pixel (that’s what the “bitmap” format does), and with 3,000,000 numbers, BAM! you’ve got your image.</p>
<p>Fun fact: there are ways that are much less resource-intensive to describe an image with numbers than by painstakingly spelling out the color of each pixel. I won’t get into how each works, but their names will be familiar: JPEG, GIF, PNG, ...</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Take a music note.</p>
<p>The height of the note really is its frequency, which is a number; and you can have another number for how strongly the note was played for instance, if it’s relevant to the instrument. Each instrument gives a certain frequency and strength (or several, if it’s an instrument that allows to play several notes at once), so combine together the right frequencies/strengths, from the right instruments at the same time, each note at the right time (which is also a number), and BAM! you’ve got a symphony.</p>
<p>That’s how digital music (like the MIDI format) works. Full disclosure: I have no idea how recorded sounds (Wave, MP3, ...) work, but you can take my word for it that it’s all also series of numbers.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Take a point on a sheet of paper on a table.</p>
<p>You can define the distance of that point from the top of the sheet (let’s call that value Y), and from the left side of the sheet (let’s call that value X), and you can represent any point on the sheet with those 2 numbers. Throw in a 3rd number for the altitude of the point (let’s call it Z) so it can be higher or lower than the table, and if you are willing to set every number even very high or very low for those 3 numbers X, Y, and Z, you can basically represent any point in the whole space around you.</p>
<p>Now, think of the shape of a soldier in a video game. That soldier is just a collection of dots at the exact right spot in space (each 3 numbers), those dots each have a certain color (also numbers), that soldier makes noise and speaks to you (sounds, which are also numbers), and you may see their name and health metrics above their head in plain text (also numbers).</p>
<p>You take a step towards the soldier: this just makes the first-person camera of the game change its values for X and Y in space, that’s still number stuff.</p>
<p>The soldier raises an arm, several parts of his body move separately their values of X, Y, and Z so they change position in space, in a way that together, it almost feels like a natural, human movement. Still numbers, all that.</p>
<p>And BAM! you got a video game. All with numbers. All represented with binary code.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a word: Interpretation.</p>
<p>The numbers that make up a computer program such as a video game, are either data or instructions.</p>
<p>Instructions are commands that the programmer is telling the CPU or some other component to process. The numbers map to a predefined set of instructions that the processor understands because of the way it was manufacturered, called the instruction set. Ever heard of x86 or x86-64 (aka x64)? Those are instruction sets for CPUs. They already define which number means Add, Subtract, Store, Retrieve, Compare etc. And with this basic machine code you can build software*. <em>Instructions are numbers that are interpreted by the processor to perform low level computations that make up the program.</em></p>
<p>Data is the content that will be used by the software. These numbers could represent colors, shapes, text, sounds, anything. How exactly a set of numbers can represent this content, depends on the type of content. Colours can essentially be represented by levels of Red, Green and Blue light, plus maybe Alpha (transparency); shapes can be coordinate points in a virtual space; text can be ASCII code points; sounds can be voltage levels representing sound pressure. It's the software's job (the instructions that the programmer writes) to specify what data represents what type of content, and what to ultimately do with it (decompress it, transform it, send it to the monitor, speakers, etc). <em>Data is numbers that represents a range of types of information and multimedia.</em></p>
<p>*Nowadays of course, programmers rarely write software in this low-level machine code, they use programming languages that abstract away these details</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
