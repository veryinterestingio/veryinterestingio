		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A volcanic eruption is measured in two constants--gas and viscosity.   For clearance, low viscosity is like squirting water off a nozzle,  whereas high viscosity is like squirting caramel off a nozzle, which takes more effort to do, which ultimately makes it more dangerous.</p>
<p>In geology, there are four different kinds of volcanic eruptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Low Gas + Low Viscosity = A quiet lava flow. </li>
<li>High Gas + Low Viscosity = A fire fountain eruption. </li>
<li>Low Gas + High Viscosity = A dome-building eruption.  (This sort of eruption doesn't reach critical right away.) </li>
<li>High Gas + High Viscosity = A Ring of Fire explosion. </li>
</ol>
<p>These sorts of eruption are impressive enough on land, but in the  event of someone doing some serious worldbuilding, this question puts  three of the four types underwater.  Type #1 has long been confirmed to  happen underwater, but the oceanic differences in temperature and pressure have produced a different result called &quot;pillow lava&quot;.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Is it possible for eruption types numbers 2, 3 and 4 to occur underwater?  If yes, then would the oceanic differences in temperature  and pressure make them look and act differently from how they have acted  above sea level?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All four of those cases you listed depend only on the magma, not whether there's surface water, so yes, all four can occur underwater. <a href="http://www.geology.sdsu.edu/how_volcanoes_work/Hydrovolcanic.html" target="_blank">This page</a> gives a nice summary of hydrovolcanic eruptions.</p>
<p>As you can see it's a bit complicated and depends on the circumstances, how much water there is, the depth of activity, and so on. You will want to read the article to see which style matches what you intend.</p>
<p><del>You can probably safely assume any eruption in shallow water is going to be somewhat explosive and</del> Gas rich lava will explode and generate a large white steam plume that will travel for some distance. Take a look at the videos of Anak Krakatoa just after the recent landslide for an example. Note the dark ash mixed with the lighter steam. <del>Pillow lavas require enough depth and pressure to keep the steam from expanding, because if it's allowed to expand it does so explosively, so you're most likely to see those at some depth.</del></p>
<p>Edit: never mind what I said about the depth. I'd thought lava entering water at shallow depths usually resulted in explosions that shredded it, but apparently that's not the case.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The four types you list are not exactly categories as much as they are end-members. Volcanoes can exhibit qualities on the full range between high and low viscosity, and high and low gas content.</p>
<p>There is nothing stopping any of those situations erupting under water, except that high viscosity is usually associated with highly evolved melts that have spent a substantial amount of time in the crust. This tends to be the case in continental crust, because (a) it is much thicker so magma reservoirs have more opportunity to stabilise, and (b) the crustal material is more silicic, so as it is assimilated into the melt it leads to more extreme evolution trends towards viscous (high silica) chemistries.</p>
<p>Because they tend to come up through continental crust the opportunities for them to erupt underwater are much less. That's not to say it doesn't happen. We do get to see <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Pumice_raft.jpg" target="_blank">pumice rafts</a> forming where explosive eruptions have occurred underwater.  Once erupted from the sea floor the eruption plume will rapidly be quenched by the surrounding water. Depending on depth the water pressures will likely collapse any bubbles, leading to the gases going into solution, so you end up with something that looks a lot like a big version of this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtFFmDGIsa4" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtFFmDGIsa4</a></p>
<p>The buoyant stuff like pumice may find itself to the surface (assuming it's not completely water saturated - this will depend on depth) to form a raft like I linked above.</p>
<p>Lava domes below the ocean are likely to act much like the ones subaerially erupted; they'l cool to form a solid crust then gradually inflate as more material is injected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To put it simply, all 4 can happen underwater. Gas or viscosity are irrelevant as to whenever or not water is above the magma source.</p>
<p>Generally you also only have 2 types of reaction between magma and water:</p>
<ol>
<li>The slow reaction. The water is boiled rapidly by the magma which is in return cooled rapidly and thus turned into pillow like rock structure. This mostly happens in an unconfined area, as when the water expands it has enough room to do so.</li>
<li>The explosive reaction. Here the water has not much room. It also boils immediatly, but has no place to go. The surrounding water flows into the area where now the gaseous water is while the gaseous water pushes into where the water was, while due to itself taking more room than the &quot;normal&quot; water. The pressure builds up more and more. Now three things can happen: A. The pressure builds up , while the water cools the magma, the pressure does not built up enough to rupture the surrounding rock. The magma cools and becomes rock and the pressure dwindles over some time. B. The pressure builds up  , while the water cools the magma, but the pressure does rupture the surrounding rock. It either finds some smaller release or simply makes itself some room in the rock. The gaseous water and it's pressure is either contained or released, but we reach no critical pressure to. magma becomes rock or the water escapes/ is contained in the surrounding rock. C. Here is the fun part: The pressure builds up, but has no release and stays contained. More and more pressure. The surrounding rock withstands it over a long peroid of build up resulting in enourmous pressure or the amount of water during contact is quite big. Result; An enourmous explosion, as the rock can't contain the pressure anymore and is violently erupted into it's surrounding.</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, that is atleast as far as I remember that stuff? If anyone has any corrections please tell me.</p>
<p>Edit: tl;dr verison of the reaction</p>
<p>Pressure cooker with water in it (aka the water) secured on top a chunk of molten, hot stuff (magma).</p>
<p>No lit, normal chunk-&gt; boilded water, colled chunk (pillow lava)</p>
<p>lit on, small chunk -&gt; gaseous water in cooker, cooled chunk</p>
<p>lit on, cooker has a small weakness, big chunk -&gt; cooker swells, then the gaseous water burst from the weakpoint, cooled chunk or empty cooker</p>
<p>lit on, cooker has NO weakness, big chunk-&gt; cooker can either withstand the pressure or will EXPLODE as the pressure is too high to contain the water, chunk either cooled slowly, if the cooker can withstand it or be torn apart by the EXPLOSION.</p>

<li>Event no.3 can definitely happen. There are multple documented, the biggest right now being a slow eruption under the Kikai caldera south of Kyushu.</li>
<li>2&amp;4 generally only happen close to land. These types of volcanos are also physicly impossible in deep water (2km deep) since the increased pressure prevents gas from excruding.</li>
<li>Rhyolitic (a type of no.4) underwater volcanoes are super rare, but can be absolutely spectacular. 2012 the Havre Seamount absolutely goddamn exploded (and we almost didn't notice it), but almost levelled the Havre seamount and formed a pumice raft larger than israel. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Kermadec_Islands_eruption" target="_blank">Wiki</a> <a href="https://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/ourchangingworld/audio/2018648947/havre-the-world-s-largest-deep-ocean-volcanic-eruption" target="_blank">Link with more images</a></li>
<li>A type of no 2 is called a &quot;Surtseyan eruption&quot;. It's characterised by base surges (rapid pyroclastic flows expanding along the sea bottom while releasing steam and gas towards the surface. Base surges are typical for no.2&amp;4 eruptions under water) and explosive pillars of steam, ash and solid magma blasting through the surface of the water.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The viscosity is referred to as basic and acidic. Basic  magmas have a low viscosity whereas acidic are high. </p>
<p>You're right that high volatile (gas) content will cause it to degas when confining pressure is released. Exactly the same Principe as opening a carbonated drink, the volatiles can no longer stay dissolved in the low pressure environment and leave the magma returning to their gaseous state.</p>
<p>Both acidity and volatile content are on a sliding scale not binary.</p>
<p>When it comes to eruptions in different media, air Vs water, the biggest difference is how quickly the lava cools and solidifies. In air it cools relatively slowly but in water much quicker. </p>
<p>As you may know when something cools slowly it gives time for the crystals to form and grow. In rocks the size of the crystals is called the grain size. The largest grain sizes are found in igneous intrusions that never left the surface and cooled very slowly stuck underground. </p>
<p>The smallest grain sizes are when the lava cools almost instantly such as underwater, this leads to things such as volcanic glass where the lava has cooled so quickly it is more akin to glass then a rock.</p>
<p>Eruptions can also happen under ice Subglacially. An interesting example is Eyjafjallajokull which when it erupted under a glacier in Iceland blasted shards of volcanic glass and ash Into a giant cloud which shut all air traffic over alot of Europe for a week or so.</p>
<p>Krakatoa is the classic example of a high volatile acidic eruption. It was the loudest noise ever recorded, travelling around the world 3 times. The entire mountain was demolished and turned into ejecta and effected global weather for several years.</p>
<p>If you're interested in world building some interesting examples to look at could be:</p>
<p>Olympus mons, the largest volcano known to man. A shield volcano on mars that's taller than Everest, it's so large that it couldn't exist in earth because its own weight would cause it to sink into the mantle.</p>
<p>Pele's hair, happens in Hawaii where the wind catches the streams of lava and draws them into fine strings that look like hair.</p>
<p>Lava tunnels, where the outside edge of a lava flow solidifies but inside continues to flow. This leaves behind intricate networks of tubes left behind, often known to be fragile and prone to collapse.</p>
<p>Carbonate lava, the vast majority of magma is predominantly sillica based like most rocks but there is such thing as carbonate lava, carbonates are the basis of limestone and chalk. Carbonate lava has only been observed at Ol Doinyo Lengai in Tanzania where it erupted as a low viscosity flow which ran down the sides of the volcano, it is dark in colour when liquid and hot but becomes a light colour when it solidifies and cools. It is also interesting that it is the lowest temperature lava at 500-600°C</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
