		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mars still has a molten core (at least a molten outer core), (e.g. <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/308/5725/1120.full" target="_blank">Fei &amp; Bertka, 2005</a>). In detail, the interior temperature of Mars is estimated at ~2000 K (<a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/32/2/97/103752?casa_token=Mdbr2QZkVioAAAAA:jAQ8ELjmkg3pdk1BBZ9V-0_gKD3v4GVkRsxjE4JuMfPV_opHKj9sC-qv8D_9LR_tamysIdGr" target="_blank">Williams &amp; Nimmo, 2004</a>) which depending on the exact composition of the core is definitely hot enough (given the pressure conditions as well) for the core to be at least partially molten (<a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/msa/ammin/article/85/11-12/1830/133640/Structure-type-and-bulk-modulus-of-Fe3S-a-new-iron?casa_token=r5iVfyZadA8AAAAA:nlf2ALi_TbifFvOGYbXZiaArICOg0QF4TxVNIIweEP9hpGNeKMxv0YHbVLa4V1RCiEmu2UeE" target="_blank">Fei et al, 2000</a>). The existence of a partially molten core is also consistent with <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/mars-gravity-map" target="_blank">graviational observations</a>. </p>
<p>For both the Earth and Mars, it's not just temperature that is problematic to deep tunnels / wells / whatever, but also pressure. For example, this <a href="https://eesc.columbia.edu/courses/v1011/topic3/85.gif" target="_blank">graph</a> shows pressure as a function of depth within the interior of Earth. The pressure at the center of the Earth's core is ~360 GPa (3.55 million atmospheres). Pressure in the interior of Mars is significantly less at around ~40 GPa (e.g. <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/316/5829/1323.full" target="_blank">Stewart et al, 2007</a>), but that's still around 390,000 atmospheres. Neither the increasing temperature nor pressure as a function of depth is conducive to digging super deep tunnels on/in either Earth or Mars.</p>
<p>EDIT: For reference, since those pressures and temperatures might not be super tangible, we could consider this in the context of materials you might use to build a tunnel. For example, the upper end of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_%28engineering%29" target="_blank">yield strength</a> of various alloys of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_%28engineering%29" target="_blank">steel is ~1700 Mpa (or 1.7 Gpa)</a>. Similarly, the melting temperature of steel (or really most metals we use) at atmospheric pressure (which is what one would be trying to maintain in your tunnel) are <a href="https://www.onlinemetals.com/en/melting-points" target="_blank">well below the temperatures in the interior of planets</a>.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: For all the folks asking, &quot;If you dug a shaft, wouldn't the pressure be that of the atmospheric weight above the point in the column?&quot; I copied and pasted my response to one of these from below: <em>If you dig a shaft vertically downward, the pressure at the center of the shaft would be that of the weight of the air column above you. However, consider the walls of the shaft, i.e. move 1 mm into the walls of the shaft and that rock has the pressure of the entire weight of the column of rock above it. This basically means that the rocks making up the walls of the shaft would be pushing into the interior of the shaft at the pressure they are experiencing, i.e. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overburden_pressure" target="_blank">lithostatic pressure</a> at that depth. So, the shaft would need to be reinforced to withstand the lithostatic pressure at that depth.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Also there is no way to construct a rope that would be strong enough to support its own weight at those depths.  You could need mutiple stages.  </p>
