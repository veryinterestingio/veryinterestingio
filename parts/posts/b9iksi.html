		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ever use a pen that hasn't seen action in awhile? You have to scratch it around on some paper to get the boogers of dried ink off and get the ink flowing again.  </p>
<p>Writing in cursive keeps the ink flowing at a steady state, flowing from letter to letter.  The constant flow makes it easier to write in a straight line on un-lined paper.  </p>
<p>With practice, it's also faster to write when you're taking notes or trying to get work done quickly.  </p>
<p>Plus it looks all fancy.  Can't be writing like a pleb when you're billing at $200/hr.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So just to piggyback along and make something clear for younger redditors: back in the day people put a TON of effort into having really good handwriting. Why? Because that's how you did like 99% of professional communication. Having shitty handwriting would absolutely solicit negative judgement. Write your bank officer a sloppy letter? Kiss that 2nd mortgage you need to fix the roof goodbye.</p>
<p>As an old fart that lives and works on a laptop, I'm steadily losing my penmanship. I'm totally ok with that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cursive used to be the mark of an educated person. And you were less likely to break the nib of a feather or reed quill, unlike in block printing, you didn't have to lift the pen off the paper as frequently.</p>
<p>Modern pens removed those issues, and mass public education means everyone can read and write. So being able to write in cursive isn't as big an issue</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
