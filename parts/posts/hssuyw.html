		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don't have to breathe in hot bath or shower water. The air is still decent. </p>
<p>But take a hot shower with the fan off and the room sealed up, the weather will get pretty bad in there. </p>
<p>Conversely, if you stand outside in 95F degree heat, but wear a rebreather with a hose going inside to 65F degree AC, or just stick your face inside, you feel pretty good! </p>
<p>TL:DR - a lot of the misery from heat comes from breathing it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A part of it is psychological, because you can exit the warm shower any time you want. Whereas if you are outside digging a trench in 95F summer heat to pay the bills you don't have a choice. On the other hand, remember the times you were warm outside and enjoyed it? Going to the beach, the park, etc. Psychology has a huge factor in this. </p>
<p>Stranded in a hot desert? Torture!
Lying on a hot beach? Heaven.</p>
<p>But to be clear: psychology doesn't account for all of it, but it is definitely part of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body produces heat which it has to remove to stay within a small range of acceptable body temperature.</p>
<p>Removing heat to air is pretty slow, while water absorbs your body heat much faster. Hence 20 degree (C) air is ok, while 20 degree water feels really cold, and running around drunk in 0 degree weather for a few minute is fine, while 0 degree water will kill you in that time.</p>
<p>Water is thermally neutral at something like 35 degrees C. A few degrees below and you'll lose heat and it will feel cold, a bit above, and it will quickly become unbearable and even dangerous.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
