		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5: You use muscles to keep your eyes open. They get tired.</p>
<p>ELI'm Older: You unconsciously contract muscles to keep your eyelids open. If you ask people that have been blind from birth why they don't open their eyes it's because they never learned to, and they get tired easily. </p>
<p>For example:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Muscle fatigue! At the end of a long day of looking around, blinking, reading things etc. The muscles in your eyes become tired. It's just like if you worked out all day, then asked yourself why your biceps are so worn out </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have muscles in your eyelids that keep them open. Some of these muscles are skeletal muscle and can be controlled consciously. Some of these muscles are smooth muscle and are controlled unconsciously - it's the same kind of muscle as is in your stomach and intestines. When you have more &quot;awake&quot; hormones like adrenaline, the smooth muscle in your eyelids contracts and your eyes stay open without much effort. When you have more &quot;sleepy&quot; hormones, the smooth muscle relaxes and the only thing left holding your eyelids open is the skeletal muscle. It's not used to doing all the work by itself, so it gets tired fast and your eyelids droop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a hard time believing it's muscle fatigue as the others are saying. You can get tired for 5 minutes and then snap out of it, making your eyes feel like normal. That wouldn't be possible if it's muscle fatigue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
