		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Catholic missionaries came, and converted people and rulers. Rulers might convert because of genuine religious feelings, or because it pays to be on the good side of all the catholic kings south of you. Christianity pushes other cultures to convert in a way that pagan religions really didn't do, so over time one side kind of pushed harder than the other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the Greek gods, the Roman emperors forced all the temples to close, the popes ordered the books to be burned, and eventually the traditions just weren't passed on.</p>
<p>Charlemagne cut down the sacred trees and forced the Saxons to convert, and basically the same thing occurred.</p>
<p>The Northern Crusades crushed the old Baltic religions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The stories are different everywhere but often they were compelled to convert. The Knights of the Sword were Germans who conquered much of what are now the Baltic states in the name of the church, from memory around 1200.  Many people faced a choice between renouncing their traditional religion and being tortured or killed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most were coerced, some converted because it was politically convenient. Many Viking invaders were permitted to keep their holdings in the condition that they would stop raids by other Vikings and get baptized. After a few generations, they integrated into the local culture.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They didnâ€™t exactly stop believing in everything. When they were christianized, a lot of their beliefs became christianized. For example, the elves of Norse mythology became reimagined as angels and fallen angels, and the spirits of Celtic mythology became the Saints.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
