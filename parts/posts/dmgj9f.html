		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of memory as working like a big net of associations. When you learn one particular bit of information, you immediately start associating it with a lot of other types of information that are similar. These associations help you track down information again, because even if you cannot recall a particular word or fact at the time, you can recall some of the path you took to get to it by associations. Your brain is essentially tries to retrace its steps in order to find where it put that particular bit of information and retrieve it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Linguistics, this is called the “Tip of the tongue” (TOT) phenomenon. When you want to speak, you’ll figure out the meaning of what you want to say first. Later, the brain will go looking for the different words to create a sentence with that meaning, each building block of that sentence is called a “lemma”. Each lemma can be expressed in different ways (depending on the language, for instance, the concept of “table” can be expressed as “tavolo” in Italian, “mesa” in Portuguese and so on). TOT happens when the link between the concept and the actual form, ie what sounds you have to make to produce it, is somehow (temporarily) missing. This happens more frequently with words that are “low frequency”, so words that you don’t use that often, and it has been found to happen more often with proper nouns (eg people’s name we haven’t thought about in a while, such as your old teacher, actor of a particular film, band names, ...). The information is there but, for some reason, it’s not retrieved immediately. Some details can be retrieved (first letter, syllable count, word length) but some takes more time. TOT can solve itself in matters of seconds, hours or days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
