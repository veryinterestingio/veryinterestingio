		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some animals that at least seem to understand what death is when it occurs: elephants and most corvids (crows, ravens, magpies, etc.) have exhibited behaviors that seem to be basically funerals. But that's something of an assumption on our part, because we can't <em>really</em> know what those behaviors mean.</p>
<p>And that's really the problem with answering your question. We have very little understanding of cognition outside our own species and very few avenues to learn more about it. There are tantalizing hints that the mental life of animals is more robust than we currently know, but nothing that even approaches the lower limit of scientific certainty.</p>
<p>So really the best answer I can provide to your question is: maybe, but we can't currently state with certainty that any of them do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our next door neighbour had a Black Labrador dog. It never wandered off and was always close to the family members. The dog was approximately 14 years old and definitely showing signs of advanced aging. One day the dog simply wandered off and disappeared. I've read anecdotal reports of older dogs presumably wandering off to die. It's almost like they know when their time has come to an end. I would like to believe this is done to lesson the pain and burden on the family members.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had a Catahoula (M) and a Dalmatian (F).  He worshiped her and followed her every lead.  When she got old and was unable to care for herself, he was always by her side trying to comfort her.  Her kidneys failed and we had to put her down.  He looked everywhere for his girl and grieved for the rest of his life.  </p>
<p>Months later we got a new Dal pup hoping that might cheer him up.  But the Catahoula wouldn't even look at that pup, turning away like it pained him to see the pup.   </p>
<p>For about two years that Catahoula never played or expressed happiness again. He got sick and we put him down.  I don't know that he understood death, but he certainly understood the pain of the loss of a loved one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
