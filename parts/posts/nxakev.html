So that got me wondering what other vaccines that are widely used (like stuff against the flu or polio etc) also have a 1 in a million chance of creating blood clots?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.20.21255806v1" target="_blank">A recent preprint found no statistically significant differences in the risk of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (the blood clotting that people have been concerned about) between the 30 days before administration and 30 days after administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines (particularly relevant since Johnson &amp; Johnson was &quot;paused&quot;) in the USA, <em>or</em> one of 10 other FDA-approved non-COVID-19 vaccines.</a> </p>
<p>Sample sizes were large for this kind of study (~95,000 Pfizer-BioNTech doses, ~36,000 Moderna doses, ~1,700 J&amp;J doses, and ~780,000 non-COVID-19 vaccine doses). Of course, for the COVID-19 vaccines we have much larger &quot;samples&quot; from the tens or hundreds of millions of doses administered, but the non-COVID-19 vaccine information speaks to your question. </p>
<p>The 10 non-COVID-19 vaccines were:</p>
<ul>
<li>quadrivalent influenza (~334,000 doses)</li>
<li>recombinant zoster virus (~112,000 doses)</li>
<li>tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (~95,000 doses)</li>
<li>two pneumococcal vaccines (~79,000 and 52,000 doses)</li>
<li>pediatric/adolescent hepatitis B (~32,000 doses)</li>
<li>pediatric/adolescent hepatitis A (~27,000 doses)</li>
<li>measles, mumps, and rubella (~19,500 doses)</li>
<li>varicella (chickenpox) (~16,000 doses)</li>
<li>polio (~4,600 doses)</li>
</ul>
<p>Pharmacovigilance is vital, particularly when dealing with a new drug, but sometimes the focus on vaccine administration leads to assumptions that vaccines are causing things they may not be causing. People do develop symptoms or other diseases by chance close in time to vaccination without a causal link. On the other hand, for extremely rare side effects where there <em>is</em> a causal link, even sample sizes in the tens of thousands might not detect it. This is why clinical trials can't really detect side effects with very low level of incidence.</p>
<p>E: A significant number of people seem to have gotten derailed by the fact that the study involved COVID-19 vaccines because the possible appearance of a very low risk of blood clots associated with some vaccines has triggered investigation. I mentioned them because they were involved in the study, not because the evidence from the study should be taken as more conclusive than it is. Every COVID-19 vaccine involved in the study has now been administered in the tens or hundreds of millions of doses across a wide cross-section of the population, so we don't really need a study like this to get a reasonable estimate of the risk. </p>
<p>Linking the study was primarily intended to answer the question of whether such a risk is seen in non-COVID-19 vaccines by providing evidence from a recent data set of thousands to hundreds of thousands of doses of many common non-COVID-19 vaccines that showed no evidence that said vaccines cause an increase in clotting risk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
