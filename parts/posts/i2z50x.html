		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Carbon dioxide, CO2, is more soluble in water than most common gasses.  The solubility of a gas is proportional to pressure, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry%27s_law" target="_blank">Henry's Law</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry%27s_law#Values_of_Henry's_law_constants" target="_blank">Henry's Law constant for CO2</a> (3.4x10^(-2) mol /L-atm) is one to two orders of magnitude greater than for the other atmospheric gasses: 6.1x10^(-4) for nitrogen and 1.3x10^(-3) for oxygen.  So you can dissolve more CO2 in a given amount of beverage than you can N2 or O2.  But you could use other gasses, and I believe Guinness does just that, using N2.</p>
<p>Another reason may have to do with taste.  When CO2 dissolves in water it forms carbonic acid, H2CO3. This is a weak acid, so it could give some zap to the flavor, although the phosphate buffers in soft drinks may override this.  Perhaps a food scientist could address the effect on flavor.</p>
<p>Less common gasses would be more expensive of course, but could in principle be used.  N2O (nitrous oxide) for instance, is nearly as soluble as CO2 (<a href="https://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?Formula=n2o&amp;NoIon=on&amp;Units=SI&amp;cSO=on#Solubility" target="_blank">Henry's Law constant of 2.5x10^(-2) mol/L-atm</a>.)  This could make an interesting drink since N2O is commonly known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide
">laughing gas</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Amateur beer and winemaker here weighing in to say that part of the answer is that carbonation occurs somewhat naturally.</p>
<p>Traditional fermented beverages like beer, champagne (and even nominally non alcoholic ferments like root beer and ginger ale) can be naturally carbonated as part of the brewing process. Yeast turns sugars into alcohol and produces CO2 as a byproduct. By traditional methods the drinks were sealed with residual sugars and live yeast present resulting in a carbonated drink at the time of serving. Carbonation was not necessarily a desired feature, but a consequence of the process.</p>
<p>Today, many commercially produced drinks will kill off the yeast and carbonate artificially. With artificial carbonation being the norm now, some beer breweries <a href="https://www.craftbeer.com/craft-beer-muses/good-beer-gas-nitro-beers-explained" target="_blank">have actually turned to other gasses, notably nitrogen</a>. This is usually done with porters and stouts, and I believe that Guinness was, if not the first brewery to do this, a major contributor to making this popular.</p>
<p>Traditional non-sparkling wines only lack carbonation as a result of the aging process. Yeast will eventually stop producing CO2 (and alcohol) when it consumes all available sugars or when the alcohol content gets higher than the yeast can tolerate. If left to age, the CO2 will eventually rise out of the wine. <a href="https://wineladybird.com/how-to-degas-wine/" target="_blank">Home wine makers often employ either agitation or vacuum pressure to degas the wine faster</a>.</p>
<p>Pre-industrial vessels were less airtight than modern kegs and bottles, so beers were likely less carbonated than they are now. With industrialization, standardization and commercial production we now have the expectation of very gassy beers and completely flat wines, but this wasnâ€™t always necessarily the case.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a neuroscience perspective, CO2  triggers taste receptors ( <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3654389/#R17" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3654389/#R17" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3654389/#R17</a></a> ) as well as pain receptors ( <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2993877/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2993877/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2993877/</a></a> ) which may give rise to the tingly sensation.  I'm not sure how sensitive these receptors are to other gasses, but it is likely that they would not produce the same sensations we expect from carbonation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>CO2 is cheap and forms carbonic acid in water, which adds a bit of a bite to the drink.</p>
<p>You can get rid of that bite, and get smaller bubbles by using N2, which is common with many beers.</p>
<p>Also, it's pretty common to use &quot;Beer gas&quot; for beers on tap, which is a combination of CO2 and N2.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because it reacts reversibly with water to make carbonic acid. You can drive that reaction forward under high pressure and store a lot more CO2 in a volume of water than you could of most other gases. And because the reverse reaction takes time, your drink keeps fizzing for minutes to hours rather than losing all the dissolved gas very quickly once you release the pressure. And the carbonic acid adds a nice tangy taste to the drink.</p>
<p>If they weren't toxic, you could probably use sulfur dioxide or chlorine or acidic nitrogen oxides for the same thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
