		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The government doesn't make you pay more than you should. You decide how much to withhold from your paychecks to cover taxes. If you withhold too much then, when you actually file and the government sees how much you've paid vs. how much you owe they'll pay you back the difference.</p>
<p>If you don't withhold at all then you sure as hell won't be getting a rebate, lol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the United States we adjust our taxes after the fact, because the government has no idea what kind of deductions you might take, kids you might have, income you will end up with. A refund is a correction after all the facts have been made clear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Strictly speaking, they don't make you. You can set any amount of withholding you want. The W-4 and other worksheets they use to determine the proper amount of withholding do tend to err on the side of caution -interpreting &quot;caution&quot; to mean that they try to avoid withholding too little- so people often do wind up withholding too much. But you don't have to follow the W-4.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The govt doesn't make you pay more...how to complete your W-4 does...add to that the idea that situations change and incomes change and tax brackets have wide ranges and so much happens on a year to year basis....just fill out your W-4 to reflect your situation properly and you should be goo</p>
<p>my answer provides no  substance to the ELI5 question, therefore, it will be removed but in some countries, they do everyone's taxes for them and if you don't like the numbers you go back and do it yourself...one of the reasons we don't have that in the US is that HR Block/TurboTax/CharlesHewitt/etc don't want to change tax law to do that since then they wouldn't make those profits every year</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
