		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone is thinking air density and air pressure, which is wrong.  The speed of sound in air is mostly based on the air temperature, and to some extent humidity.</p>
<p>To put it simply, hot air is already moving faster, so it bumps into each other faster.  Cold air is the opposite.  So the speed of sound is faster in hot air.  The lower pressure and density of air at altitude cancel each other out.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound#Altitude_variation_and_implications_for_atmospheric_acoustics" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound#Altitude_variation_and_implications_for_atmospheric_acoustics</a></p>
<p>So, to answer OPs question, it doesn't directly affect it, but it does indirectly.  As the air tends to be colder at altitude.  (Relativistic effects are very, very minor in this, so ignored.)</p>
<p>(Edit - Don't confuse the speed of the sound for how the loudness would be affected.  These are different calculations.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes sound waves curve up and down through the atmosphere but it is not directly due to gravity. It is due to temperature gradients and/or wind gradients. During the day, the temperature gets colder with altitude, so the speed of sound is slower as you get further above the ground. So the sound waves curve upwards.
Sometimes on cold nights you can get a temperature inversion where for a few hundred metres of elevation  the temperature can get warmer with altitude, so the speed of sound is faster as you get higher above the ground, then the sound waves will curve down.
Even though the air gets less dense with altitude, it is only the temperature that affects the speed of sound.
A similar thing happens with wind speed gradients.
Close to the ground, the wind speed is slower, (because it get slowed down by the surface roughness of the ground, foliage and buildings) so the sound waves curve down - but only because the higher wind speed at higher elevation gives the speed of sound a boost. The wind doesn't actually &quot;carry&quot; the sound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
