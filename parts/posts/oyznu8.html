		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The pool is very cold. If you go from room temperature to really cold water, your muscles tend to tighten up. This is bad for divers, because they tend to need flexible and loose muscles to do what they do. A warm shower can help to relax those muscles again in anticipation of the next dive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In past Olympics, I recall seeing the divers getting into hot tubs to wait until their next dive. I didn’t see any hot tubs this year and I wonder if that’s because of social distancing. If they didn’t have a hot tub available, I suppose the warm shower is a must-have.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The diving pool is typically warmer than swimming, so it’s not as cold as racing temperature.  The reason for showering / hot tub is to keep the muscles from cramping.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been to many college diving pools while playing college water polo. Most high end diving pools are warm, like warm bathwater. The cold comes from getting in and out of the water and the air temperature making you cold. Being cold can cause muscle tightness and leads to injury. I highly doubt Olympic pools are cold. Also the jet of water is used to help see the water line and break up the surface tension of the impacting diver.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The commentators (the female of which was a former medal winning diver) said it was to wash the chemicals from the pool off.</p>
<p>Sounded legit, since one of the divers developed a skin rash soon after practicing in the pool.  (New to her pool, different chemical mix.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
