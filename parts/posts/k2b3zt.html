		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you can create a strong enough negative current, can you push the electrons away from wood/dirt/soil’s nucleus? (Since the electrons move away from the negative charges rendering it positive and causing it to magnetize to the charge). Also i know that nonmagnetic materials like wood want to keep their electrons close to their nucleus which is why you cant move them with magnets like metal (which has flowing electrons). So basically is the only thing you need to magnetize something nonmagnetic like dirt for example a super powerful negatively charged current from a power source. Or is it impossible to pull/push the electrons of a nonmagnetic material. If so, are their any other ways to magnetize/push away nonmagnetic materials. I heard that someone used a magnet to levitate strawberries. Thanks!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To magnetize an arbitrary material you esentially need a net electric current flowing through it.  Indeed most common materials like dirt and wood aren't particularly conductive and most such materials would melt before they let their electrons hop between nuclei freely enough for a sustained induced magnetic field.</p>
<p>HOWEVER: this is not the only form of induced magnetism in materials.  Notably materials generally fall into one of three primary types of magnetic property: ferromagnetic (iron for instance), paramagnetic (a number of metals such as lithium or tungsten) or diamagnetic (the most common, including most biomater, water and likely dirt).</p>
<p>Ferromagnetic materials can hold permanent magnetic fields due to the alignment of unpaired electrons which share &quot;spin&quot; direction (a sort of intrinsic circular current that all electrons have) and/ orbital direction (which has a similar effect).  These are tricky materials to discover and we only really know of a handful of them (a lot of which are iron based).  They strongly mimick the magnetic fields applied to them and stick to induced and permanent magnets.  Note: there are also anti-ferromagnetic materials which perfectly anti-align these spins making somewhat perfectly magnetically innert materials</p>
<p>Paramagnetic materials can similarly be attracted to magnetic fields but don't form permanent magnetic fields of their own.  Their electrons do align similarly to ferromagnets but the moment the magnet is removed the alignment quickly decays.  These fields are orders of magnitude weaker than ferromagnets and may be enough to draw a needle floating on water but little else.</p>
<p>Diamagnetic materials (most anything with water in it) weakly align its electron spins to oppose magnetic fields opposite to paramagnetism.  In particularly massive magnetic fields this will sometimes be enough to levitate organic matter, but practically has very little effect on most materials.  It's something of a triviality of physics but is a neat trick if you have access to super magnets.  Again usually this is only strong enough to push objects floating on water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our oldest and most intuitive understanding of magnetism is ferromagnetism/ferrimagnetism. This is when materials are magnetic in the absence of a magnetic field. When you think of a bar magnet, this is the phenomenon at work.</p>
<p>Some materials can be made magnetic only in the presence of a magnetic field. If they are attracted to the field this is known as paramagnetism, and if they are repelled this is known as diamagnetism (and is the phenomenon responsible for floating strawberries/mice).</p>
<p>(There is also a fourth type of magnetism called anti-ferromagnetism, which is also semi-permanent but doesn’t result in any macroscopic behavior as far as I know).</p>
<p>The key is, what I think you mean by magnetism is ferro/ferrimagnetism, and only a few substances possess this property. So no, even with strong magnet you can’t make any random thing ferromagnetic. But all substances do exhibit some other form of magnetism that I’ve listed here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is no, you can't.</p>
<p>The longer answer is more complicated.  Electrons have a magnetic moment, that either points 'up' or 'down's (physicists call this spin).  Atoms have electronic orbitals, which are basically shells that electrons can go into.  Each orbital can have 2 electrons in it. They initially fill up one electron in each shell, and once each one has one the second one is placed in.  Due to some complicated physics, the two electrons in each orbital must have opposite spins and so their magnetism cancels.  The reason iron is so magnetic is because each electron is in it's own shell, and so none of the magnetism gets cancelled.  Each atom is it's own tiny magnet.  Elements which dont have this electronic configuration, such as carbon, cant be magnetized regardless of any external field.</p>
<p>The reason that applying an external magnetic field can magnetize some materials is because, although each atom is it's own magnet, these magnets are normally pointing in different directions and so cancel.  An external magnetic field aligns all these tiny magnetic fields with the external one and creates a big magnet.</p>
<p>Carbon doesn't have the right electronic configuration, and so dirt, wood etc. can't be magnetized by applying an external field.</p>
