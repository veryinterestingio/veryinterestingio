		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s the switch from anaerobic to aerobic energy production. For the first few minutes you use anaerobic (like lifting weights) until you’re body realizes it’s going to keep needing energy so it switches to aerobic. Anaerobic revs up faster but is much less efficient. The byproduct is acidic and you breath faster to blow off carbon dioxide. </p>
<p>When people go up stairs they are out of breath quickly and wonder “Why am I breathing fast?  I can run miles.” But that’s because stairs are anaerobic. You usually don’t do enough sustained stairs to switch over to aerobic. </p>
<p>The trick to starting running?  The first mile is the hardest. Get past 2 miles and it’s easier. Endorphins really don’t kick in until around five miles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anyone have any clue as to why I've <strong>never</strong> experienced this, and it always feels harder to keep running the longer I go?</p>
<p>Is it just because I've never ran more than 2 miles at a time?</p>
<p>If I've ever gone 3-5 miles or more, it's been on an elliptical, which takes care of what I hate about running - knee, ankle and back soreness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is something called an oxygen deficit you are repaying after initiating the aerobic activity.  Increasing muscular contractions creates blood lactate which causes you to increase respiration and heartrate from their typical baselines (at rest).  Even after you reach a new baseline of muscular activity, your heart and lungs still have to work beyond that point to repay this oxygen deficit.  Then, once it is repayed and your blood chemistry/pH is at the normal level, your heart and respiration rates actually decrease to a new baseline, making it seem easier than when your were repaying your oxygen deficit.  <a href="https://www.nsca.com/contentassets/9166e0d6d9494e28a47b33695627fcae/oxygen-uptake-and-the-aerobic-and-anaerobic-contributions-to-exercise-1.jpg" target="_blank">See this graph for a little clearer explanation.</a>  I have a Bachelor's in Exercise Physiology and have been a Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist for 10+ years, fwiw.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This has to do with activation of the sympathetic nervous system. This is your “fight or flight” response. It takes a few minutes for your body to “warm up”. What happens when your body is “warming up” is that epinephrine (aka adrenaline) is released in larger amounts. This dilates both the bronchi (tubes in your lungs) as well as dilates the blood vessels in your muscles. So now not only is it easier to breath, and your blood is getting more oxygen from your lungs, your muscles are also getting more blood and therefore more oxygen. </p>
<p>This process also acts on the heart. Over that 5-10 minutes your heart starts to beat harder and faster, thereby providing more oxygen-Rich blood to the areas that need it. </p>
<p>This doesn’t really have much to do with anaerobic vs aerobic metabolism, as doing sprints in the middle of a long run would cause both types to be used. It’s more about taking the time to get your heart, lungs, and muscles In a better physical state to increase blood flow and oxygen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
