		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, it is definitely true that core muscle engagement causes exhalation, and exhaling initiates the grunt, and that exhaling is useful because it cues the parasympathetic nervous system to calm down (inhaling revs it up, exhaling calms it down), allowing the body to divert energy to the physical activity itself. </p>
<p>BUT! The grunt sound is the result of the larynx and (possibly) false vocal folds above it. Without a larynx, we wouldn’t have a way to equalize pressure in our thorax (control how quickly air leaves our lungs), and lifting heavy things, having a BM, or giving birth would be impossible, because our heart and lungs would be crushed. The larynx’s evolutionary function is as a valve to stop air from leaving the lungs (and to some extent, with the help of the epiglottis, to prevent liquid and food from entering the lungs) in order to provide a cushion of air and equalize pressure. When we push out a baby or lift something heavy, the larynx closes and lets out only a little air at a time, creating phonation (vocal folds set to vibration), which is the sound of the grunt. If the exertion is great enough, the false vocal folds (thicker slabs of tissue right above the larynx &amp; “true folds”) will also close to reinforce the seal, which also can make the grunt sound extra primal (extra tissue moving with the controlled release of air = louder, more guttural sounds).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
