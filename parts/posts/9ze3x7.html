			<a href="/posts/9ze3x7" onclick="return false">I've heard that the surface of a fast spinning neutron star(pulsar) rotates at about 5th the speed of light with respect to the centre. If so, then would the periphery experience Lorentz contraction? How would it affect the structure of the star?</a>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The initial premise of the Ehrenfest Paradox involves a rigid object and pulsars aren't rigid. And of course, as with many other paradoxes in relativity, they aren't actually paradoxes and all have resolutions. But, I suppose the short answer to your question is that length contraction doesn't really make sense in full general relativity versus special relativity, and since these are incredibly massive and compact objects, you need to take into account full GR anyway.</p>
<p>As one might expect, spinning neutron stars are oblate, and I think that's all that changes with respect to the structure of the neutron star versus considering a non-rotating one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Einstein actually wrote an essay about a spinning disc that, due to the Lorentz contraction, demonstrated varying values for pie as the radius changed. I know that's not your precise question but it might be a place to start if you're looking for source material. It's in the blue Dover edition of collected essays on the Special and General theories--sorry, that's probably not helpful, but I can get the full title for you a bit later if you're interested.</p>
<p>Edit: The essay I'm thinking of is titled &quot;The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity&quot; by Einstein. The section I referred to is three paragraphs into the third section (&quot;The Space-Time Continuum. Requirement of General Co-Variance for the Equations Expressing General Laws of Nature&quot;) of this essay. The book &quot;The Principle of Relativity&quot; is a collection of essays by Einstein, Lorentz, Weyl, and Minkowski and that's the Dover book I referred to earlier--I'm guessing you can probably just get the single Einstein essay online, but the book is the form I have the essay in and it includes several other interesting essays and texts. Enjoy!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
