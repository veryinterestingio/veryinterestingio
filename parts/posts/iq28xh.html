		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it, it's  due to tradition mostly. In times past a gentleman would dress himself, and a lady would have a servant assist her in dressing, so buttons were reversed in order to make it easier for the servant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The majority of people are right handed. It is easier to push a button through a button hole with your dominant hand. Therefore the button on mens shirts is on the right hand side of the shirt.</p>
<p>So why are women's buttons on the left? Well, it's a classist throw back.</p>
<p>For the majority of European history women of lower classes made their own clothes. Because of this, the only women who bought cloths from a tailor were rich women. Because rich women had servants who assisted them in getting dressed the buttons on their cloths went on the left, thus making them fall on the right frome the perspective of the servant who is helping her get dressed. </p>
<p>Then no one ever changed it when women stopped having servants.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's possibly apocryphal but some people think it's because men's shirts are easy to button yourself right handed and women's shirts are easy to button for a right handed servant. (This custom being set in an era where rich women were dressed by servants)</p>
<p>It serves no practical purpose today</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
