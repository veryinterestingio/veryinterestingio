<p>The greatest problem with sewage is when it enters your drinking water supply (i.e. you shit in the same river you drink from). Since nobody is drinking from the canals (it’s seawater) nor washing themselves, cooking implements or clothes in them there is little chance of contamination. </p>
<p>So as long as they have clean drinking water it’s of little concern.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Google/Quora tells me it's because the tide sweeps it clean twice a day.</p>
<p>The thing is, most biohazards need standing water to be able to procreate suffiently to make us sick. Moving bodies of water keep sweeping it clean. This was already practiced by roman cities: upstream river water was led to cities to drink from and bathe in and sewage was lead downstream to the same river. And yes, the further downstream a river a city was, the dirtier the water, that's true. That matters for drinking water, but not too much for cleaning out sewage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
