		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The biggest reason is that if the manufacturer includes them, then they are liable for them. Dashcams and SD cards fail all the time and Ford or GM do not want to be on the hook if it's some defect in the camera. </p>
<p>Given that there is a huge market for dash cams, giving the end user a plethora of options, and given that you can pick a really good camera up for under $200, there is absolutely no reason for manufacturers to engineer embedded cameras at the normal consumer level. </p>
<p>Some luxury cars do have them. Tesla has cameras. I believe some Mercedes do as well. Cadillac has started including them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

You know for like safe driving or to easily prove who's at fault for an accident. She almost laughed, said no, and moved right on to whatever else we were talking about.
