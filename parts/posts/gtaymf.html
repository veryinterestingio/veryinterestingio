		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>imagine light as little laser beams.</p>
<p>those beams travel at &quot;the speed of light&quot; so at a 100 million light years distance, you would be able to &quot;see&quot; the light reflected from earth a 100 milion years ago.</p>
<p>so in theory, if you had a telescope which was big and strong enough to focus that light, you could see the dinosaurs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To avoid the complications/distractions of optical telescopes, consider if we found a TV camera attached to a powerful transmitter, placed here on Earth 100 million years ago by some alien intelligence. The aliens on their home planet 100 million light years away could, right now, be watching a “live” TV broadcast of the dinosaurs. (The concept of “right now” might be a bit slippery in this example.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically?</p>
<p>You would probably require a telescope, a dish of maybe 87 million light years across of material. Provided you just managed that without your telescope collapsing on itself by gravitational forces, then you would probably have to wait about 60-70 million years to receive the information back at the center. Such a project focused on us would be visible in the sky. </p>
<p>So maybe you could watch, but we would know right now you were watching us 100 million years ago before you see the dinosaur 70 million years later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. But you couldn't go there now and see it unless you outsped light and got there before the light did.</p>
<p>When you account for the travel time of light to reach your eyes, you don't see anything when it actually happens. Reading this you're seeing it after it's been displayed - obviously the time is soooooooooooo miniscule you don't notice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, yes. In actuality, certain specifications would need to be met in order for the light to hit the telescipe just right. But, theoretically, yes, that would be the case.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
