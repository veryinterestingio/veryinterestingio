		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work for a digital security company working to shut down phishing, malware and other scams.</p>
<p>Occassionally our customers would ask us to shut down phone scams. </p>
<p>Ultimately laws against these types of crimes are extremely outdated. Just to get the phone company to deactivate the phone number you have to call the number and record your conversation. They have to openly state on the recording that they're the company they are impersonating. Then you submit the recording to the phone company, upon which they might investigate, and if they determine it to be fraudulent they deactivate the number. But they are by no means legally obligated to do this, so many dont.</p>
<p>As far as finding them for arrest/prosecution, sure it's possible to find them but 99 times out of 100 the person is in another country. And in these countries the authorities tend to care about it even less than we do.</p>
<p>Most of the time when people report these fraudulent calls they're reporting the number on their caller ID which is usually a spoofed number, spoofed meaning it's not the number they're calling from. In this instance even if they wanted to do something they couldn't because they dont have the right info.</p>
<p>This is possible because when your phone receives the connection request your phone says, &quot;hey, what's your number?&quot; And the other phone says, &quot;here you go, this is it, I promise&quot;, but there is no verification process in the technology so the person calling can configure their phone to say whatever they want. So your caller ID could say the call is coming from California when it's actually coming from India.</p>
<p>It doesn't help that fraud is a booming industry, growing at an exponential rate. Very little that we do will actually help. All you can really do is ignore their attempts and try to not fall for their tricks. At least until the old farts in DC keel over and people who actually understand technology can pass some better laws.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The telecom companies can but don't. The telco allows people to select their own callerID on VOIP-based phone systems. They don't have to allow this but they do. The spam system exploit this and set it to a random number, no number, or a number they choose that isn't random.</p>
<p>It is solvable but it would require the telecos to do something that is in the better good.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The telephone system is open to enable  interoperability across carriers and tracing can be both legally and technically challenging. Caller ID wasn't desiged to authenticate the origin caller, thus you can easily replace the 'from' number with anything. This is useful for situations where many lines sit behind a main PBX, e.g. like a hospital or large office, where you can display the main number regardless of extension. However, this feature also opens caller ID to widespread abuse by scammers. The FCC and other regulatory bodies are forcing telcos to act, by implementing some form of caller authentication, mostly via a digital signature and a protocol known as STIR/SHAKEN. The problem will get bntter as more telcos roll it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the telephone companies aren't financially liable for calls with spoofed caller ID. The technical side of the authentication problem has been solved for decades, but there's no financial incentive for the phone companies to implement it.  </p>
<p>You might still be able to trace the call with the cooperation of the phone companies and ISPs involved, but you'll probably have to get warrants in multiple jurisdictions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What the other posters are missing is that Telcoms have an open system that allows any and all access.  They can't vent ALL companies, and denying access could ruin a small company.  Because of this anyone can call into a system from and you can fake credentials, since the owner could come from any source.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
