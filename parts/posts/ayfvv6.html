		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is lower quality because of costs. The equipment used for filming and lighting, plus and especially post production costs. </p>
<p>Soap operas use a higher frame rate so it actually looks clearer but produces a weird effect of looking TOO real that viewers tend to not like. Most movies and high production TV also go through a slight color filter (usually blue.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the lighting. Better tv shows and movies set the light for each shot based on where the camera is. Soap operas set the lighting for a whole set and then leave it. This allows them to film faster but has a lot of limitations around how they light. There is rarely back lighting, for instance. Most of the lights are set from above or from the open &quot;fourth wall&quot; behind the camera. They also chose to light very evenly as a style. There aren't a lot of shadows or deep contrast between lightest and darkest parts of the lighting. I assume they did that so older people with worse vision or people using crappy TVs could see the actors better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s a combination of what most of these responses claim: The studio lighting, studio camera setup/lenses used, and the 30fps video framerate. If you look at a multicam sitcom, they suffer the same way. It feels more jarring on a soap opera, I imagine, because soaps want it to NOT look or feel like a stage. With a sitcom, we know the audience is there, the 4th wall is not, and accept the stagey-ness as an inherent part of the form</p>
<p>“Why does the frame rate matter?”
To understand this you need to understand a little about photography and shutter speeds. I’m not going to define those here. The framerate shot matters in TV because you are used to seeing the way things move and appear on films where the action captured on each frame is typically captured with a blur that’s equivalent to a still camera shooting a picture of a moving object at 1/48th second (I said “typically”—don’t clap back at me about shutter angles). When something shoots at 30fps, the look of the motion captured on each frame is more akin to a still photo captured at 1/60th.</p>
<p>(nb: new stuff, even shot for tv, frequently shoots at 24fps now. The stage setup and lighting still create that artificial look, but it’s less dramatic because the framerate is now consistent with what we’re used to in movies)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
