		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Making hard cheeses (like cheddar etc) involves introducing the right bacteria to milk, letting those bacteria eat up the food that other bacteria like (lactose, ie which is a type of sugar that exists in milk), heating the product (to reduce the number of bacteria in the cheese) then making the cheese less appetizing for bacteria to eat by making it drier and saltier.</p>
<p>Creamy cheeses are either eaten fresh or (in the case of cheeses like Camembert, roquefort etc) an edible mold is introduced to the cheese. These molds are picked specificly because they're edible and because they release bacteria-killers (which will keep the cheesy stuff inside fresh and bacteria free). It's not a coincidence that the mold used for many cheeses are closely related to the penicillin we use for medication. Camembert for example contains the mold <em>Penicillium Camemberti</em> and Roquefort contains <em>Penicillium roqueforti.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I'm going to REALLY try and ELI5, because this is one of the most important questions ever asked! It turns out that <a href="https://dairyprocessinghandbook.com/chapter/chemistry-milk" target="_blank">milk is the perfect playground</a> to understand why food goes bad &amp; what we can do to prevent it:</p>
<p><strong>ELI5 - Milk goes bad because it has:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Food Energy</strong> - Like you see on the back of a cereal box, food can give you energy to wake up in the morning through fat, protein, &amp; sugars. Sugars are the fastest way to turn food into energy.</li>
<li><strong>Water</strong> - Water allows everything important in your food &amp; your body to move around &amp; connect in order to do it's job. All of the good stuff (digesting food/making energy from it/getting rid of the bad stuff) &amp; the bad stuff (bugs that make you sick &amp; molecules that your body doesn't like) happens in the presence of water.</li>
<li><strong>Little Bugs (micro-organisms)</strong> - Just like you, tiny living cells want to gobble up bits of the food &amp; use the energy in it. They really like sugars.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What things affect how much those microbes eat?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Available Water</strong> (Water Activity) - If there isn't enough water available, the little organisms can't move around and feast on the food. Strawberry jam has less available water than a fresh strawberry, which is why you can keep it in your fridge for a long time.</li>
<li><strong>Heat &amp; Cold</strong> (Temperature) - Humans don't want to go out and hunt in winter, and neither do microbes. If it gets too hot or too cold, they won't be able to compete with you for that energy. Cooking in the oven &amp; using your refrigerator are examples of how we control that.</li>
<li><strong>Saltiness</strong> (Water Activity/Osmotic Pressure)- You know how the ocean can make your eyes and lips dry? That's because salt prevents water from moving around &amp; doing it's job. It does the same thing to the microbes and they can't eat &amp; grow big when the food is salty.</li>
<li><strong>Chemical Friendliness</strong> (best I could think of for acidity/pH) - Water can either have a lot of extra little + friends, or a lot of little - friends. When there are equal amounts of them, the - &amp; + balance out and you don't notice them. Microbes don't usually like extra +'s (acidic) or extra -'s (basic).</li>
<li><strong>Other Microbes</strong> (Fermentation) - At Thanksgiving with your family, everybody wants Grandma's special cookies. The more people there are, the more competition there is. If we add competition for the bad microbes in our food by adding friendly microbes, we are making it harder for them to survive.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>So why does cheese last so long?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It has <em>less water</em>, more <em>salt</em>, is <em>acidic</em> (more +'s), more <em>friendly microbes</em>, &amp; less <em>sugars</em> - all of which make it very hard for microbes to live.</li>
</ul>
<p>The magic here is that by combining all of these little factors that prevent micro-organisms from thriving, we can make a <strong>bigger difference than if we just picked one</strong> (e.g. just lower water, or just added salt). We call this the <strong>&quot;multiple hurdle&quot; approach to food safety</strong>. </p>
<p>If you start looking at the foods you eat on a daily basis, you'll see that most of them have couple of these hurdles stacked on top of each other. <em>We can't always make food 100% safe, but we can make sure that we've made it really hard for the microbes.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cheese is a much more unforgiving and challenging environment to try and live in.</p>
<p>While it is made from milk fats (and certain molds,) it’s an immobile, dense solid, instead of a liquid like milk, which makes it monumentally more difficult for bacteria to actually travel through it.</p>
<p>Not only that, but cheese contains a lot of salt, and most bacteria do not play well with salt.<br />
It also has much, much less water in it than milk, which is also bad for bacteria.</p>
<p>All of this combined makes it incredibly hard for bacteria to flourish and spread on cheese, and when they do, it’s a slow process, whereas milk presents very easy and ideal conditions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water and easily digestible food. Compared to milk, cheese is basically concentrated milk protein and fat,  with some remaining lactose, much of it digested by enzymes (and bacteria if used). There’s not much water left, so it’s not a hospitable environment for bacteria (and when it starts going bad, it’s usually fungi starting from the outside, where it absorbed some moisture from the air. Milk on the other hand is an emulsion of fat, sugar and protein in water, plenty of food for bacteria and quite a nice environment to live in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
