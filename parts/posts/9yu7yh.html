		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you get right down to it, all life relies on chemistry. And in order to facilitate that chemistry, we need a few very basic things that are hard to replace.</p>
<p>For starters, we need a building block. Something versatile that can be combined in many different ways like a lego block. I'm sure you've heard the phrase &quot;carbon-based life&quot; in sci-fi or science sometimes. All Earth life is carbon-based. Carbon has the ability to bond with four other atoms at the same time, that makes it key to creating incredibly diverse and complex molecules.</p>
<p>To use the lego analogy, carbon is that super versatile block that makes a staggering variety of builds possible. It's not unimaginable that extraterrestrial uses some other base, but out of all known atoms, none are as versatile as carbon. So any known alternative wouldn't support the complexity of molecules that gave rise to Earth life.</p>
<p>Secondly, if you want to facilitate chemical reactions, you need a neutral medium for the ingredients for that reaction to mix in. For Earth life, that's water. Water is a perfect solution for chemical reactions and it's plentiful to boot. Just like carbon, it's hard to find a substitute that is as plentiful or useful for the purpose as water.</p>
<p>Finally, life needs to be able to generate energy. And and the most effective simple means of generating energy is through the chemical reaction of combustion, which requires... oxygen! Sure, there are other ways of generating energy but they're usually more complicated and more limited in scope. Which in turn limits how complex life can get using those alternative methods.</p>
<p>So it's not like life is impossible without those components. We just have a pretty good idea why those components provide the best opportunity for life.</p>
<p>The reason those goldilocks planets are so interesting is that they have the key components for <em>complex</em> life. If you had to search the entire galaxy for signs of life, would you focus on the factors that are most likely to result in life... or would you search for that one bizarre outlier where some microbe managed to come into existence with suboptimal building blocks, a suboptimal medium for chemical reactions and a poor man's way of generating energy?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To elaborate on a concept being expressed here:</p>
<p>Yes the Goldilocks zone is looking for conditions that could potentially enable life of the kind we know about.  Yes, it is possible other kinds of life exist.</p>
<p>But, based on some well-reasoned supposition, life of other kinds existing is not as equally likely as our own kind of life existing.</p>
<p>Consider the statistical case. We have a sample size of just one - <em>us</em> - but that's still not nothing.  It is far more likely that our kind of life utilizes many of the most common mechanisms of life in the cosmos, rather than a rare kind. </p>
<p>But beyond that, the chemical case.  Life of the kind we know and care about is dynamic, sitting on the edge of changing it's form and maintaining it, which means it can both make itself into a complex order, and modify that order over time.  </p>
<p>The carbon atom itself seems to offer the most optimal version of this - carbon bonds are stable, but not too stable. And can chain together to form links of indefinite size to create a wide variety of complex molecules with distinct chemical and catalytic behaviors.  Silicon might behave similarly, but silicon bonds (if i'm not mistaken) are stronger and thus change how much energy is necessary to change and alter the materials.  Other chemicals could very well serve a similar purpose.  But they are less likely to.  So looking for carbon is a big part of looking for other life.</p>
<p>But the main thing looked for is the presence of conditions necessary for liquid water.  Water is a very impressive material.  Not only is it abundant, but it serves as a great solvent.  Life cannot exist on solids alone.  No significant chemical activities occurs between solids, and no complicated chemical pathways can be controlled at small scales.  You <em>need</em> some kind of fluid.  Being in a fluid means that materials get circulated around and distributed.  You can get access to a large, diverse amount of materials and control the concentration through compartmentalization.  You get access to the many resources in your environment in a more reliable and consistent way.  </p>
<p>Think about having a pile of salt sitting on your left hand and a pile of sulfur sitting on your right hand. Contrast that with floating in water that contains salt and sulfur.  If you skin cells could make use of these materials somehow, all your cells would have access to both, rather than two places being super-saturated and the rest left to starve.  Then also consider the likelihood of sulfur or salt being brought to you in the first place. Maybe if you're lucky and some wind blows some dust over you?  Far more likely to get the material you need in a puddle of water, where various chemicals can be leeched out of the surrounding rock in far greater quantities than what's available from surface-contact.</p>
<p>Having liquid water also means moderate temperatures.  A really hot place like Venus is liable to break down most bonds, so you can't get large stable molecules to stay together.  Meanwhile somewhere like Titan is so cold that chemical processes would occur exponentially more slowly, limiting the rate of development of life, and also leaving too high of an energy barrier to break apart molecules that haven't themselves frozen into inaccessible lattices.</p>
<p>There's no hard and fast rule here, but as a general supposition, you really do <em>need</em> a working fluid to get any life of significance going.  And water is abundant and ridiculously convenient in it's ability to serve that role. Maybe a gaseous atmosphere could support such a thing, but then the life would evolve to be buoyant and likely unable to work heavy materials necessary for any sort of exotic material process for electronics, or to utilize significant chemical or nuclear power for industry. Thus  they'd be unable to advance to a technological state where they harness lots of energy and can communicate or interact with the rest of the galaxy.  Sentient Dirigibles on another planet would be cool, but since light-years are currently a physically insurmountable distance, if they don't have radio, they're not nearly as useful to know about.</p>
<p>So it's not like we're looking for blue planets just because our life developed on a planet that's blue, as though a Mars or a Venus or a Jupiter would be equally capable of life and we're just biased.  Our prejudice towards liquid-water-bearing planets is based not only on us being aware that that environment <em>can</em> work, but by having good reason to believe it is far more <em>likely</em> to work than other forms.  Especially to work in a way that permits the development of non-trivial life that could potentially develop sapience and industry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Totally.  But we have no idea what &quot;other life&quot; would look like.  We could be staring it right in the face and we might have no idea that we could call it &quot;life.&quot;  So until we have compelling evidence that some other form of life can exist, it's best to limit our search to &quot;Earth-like&quot; life, because at least then we actually know what we're looking for.</p>
<p>Hell, for all we know, there are living rock monsters on Venus that breathe the horrible sulfur gases in that atmosphere that would kill us.  But if we were to see that in some future observation, we'd probably say &quot;Huh, there's some interesting effect that these rocks are having on the surrounding air, it makes them move around.  We should study that a bit.&quot;  It wouldn't occur to any of us to call that &quot;life&quot; at first glance because we've never seen anything like it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>The problem is we don't understand what we don't understand, and have no real way of searching for that kind of life.  It could be the most common form of intelligent life is superconducting crystal on worlds near absolute zero.  Or gas-filled balloons in the atmospheres of Jovial planets.  Or any of a thousand other possibilities we barely understand, we just don't know.  What we do know is how earthlike life looks like, and how it might appear to us from distant planets. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe this assertion assumes that water in a liquid form is the key element in having a chance for life. So the goldilocks zone is really just saying there will only be LIQUID water in the universe when a planet is X distance from an object that releases Y heat.</p>
