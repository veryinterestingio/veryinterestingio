<p>What exactly does this mean, and what is it specifically about the pigment that causes this</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way computer screens, our eyes and colour work are all very complicated. Essentially, computer screens emit light at 3 wavelengths (red, green, blue, rgb) and mix them to simulate other colours. This works fairly well for most things, but there are limitations.</p>
<p>Since a computer screen only emits light, other phenomena arent accurately captured. One of these is absorption, which is what prussian blue does. When a pigment does one of these effects, we can simulate its colour with a computer screen, but not the way it interacts with light around it (which actually dictates a lot of how we perceive our vision). </p>
<p>Another (simpler) example is something like vantablack. Since there is no way to simulate black on a computer screen other than turning off the pixels, you cant really tell the difference between something like vantablack or specifically lit black felt.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can think of it this way, the color of Prussian Blue is a more saturated ('high-chroma') blue than the blue that is displayed in your monitors blue pixels. Therefore, the blue pixels alone don't display the  color well. But you also can't get any help by adding in light from the red and green pixels, since (color-wise) they are pulling you in the opposite direction! The result is that you cannot display the color well on a monitor. </p>
<p>To think about this more completely, it is helpful to look at a chromaticity diagram: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/CIE-1931-xy-chromaticity-diagram_fig4_248392467" target="_blank">https://www.researchgate.net/figure/CIE-1931-xy-chromaticity-diagram_fig4_248392467</a></p>
<p>If you look at the above chart, you can see that the colors you can make by averaging red, green, and blue, lights are just the ones inside the triangle. Outside the triangle, the color is not represented well. And these outside colors are generally ones that are high in &quot;saturation&quot; or &quot;chroma&quot;, which is defined as a color's distance from the center of the diagram. Pure wavelengths of light are also &quot;maximum saturation&quot; which is why it is also hard to capture a rainbow's colors accurately on a monitor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you painted a card with regular blue ink and put it in the sun, it would absorb the red-orange-yellow light and reflect back the blue. Prussian Blue is so intense because it actually takes some of that red-orange-yellow light, then converts it to blue and reflects it back. It appears to be glowing blue.</p>
<p>If you took a photo of the two cards, the Prussian blue wouldn’t look special, because the photo isn’t made with Prussian blue. It’s a similar deal with your monitor, though in that case they’re both glowing. Even the ink card is giving off light, because it’s really a glowing image on a monitor, rather than absorbing light as it does in the real world.</p>
<p>It’s a bit like laundry detergent with optical brighteners. They contain a fluorescent agent which converts some invisible ultraviolet light to visible light. This is why so many laundry detergents glow like crazy under a black light. Much of the light given off by a UV black light is in the invisible spectrum; a fancy one will emit very little visible light. A white towel that has never been washed with optical brighteners will be hard to see. Wash it with optical brighteners and it will glow blue. In the sun, it will look brighter too. why fluorescent-died stuff seems brighter than it should.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Screens emit too much light to properly showcase the texture and depth of Prussian blue.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, your computer screen is not coated with the special pigment. This means that it cannot correctly display fluorescent colors, because it outputs in RGB (Red, Green, Blue) which cannot clearly represent the hue and brightness that the human eye perceives when examining a fluorescent material.And that's why fluorescent colors do not appear accurately on computer screens. </p>
