<p>The people saying we don’t know are correct. But we can make a reasonable guess that the efficacy should be pretty high. Hospitalization in particular is hard to study because relatively few people end up hospitalized. But also vaccines are generally more effective against severe outcomes (VE infection &lt; VE disease &lt; VE severe disease). </p>
<p>We will (very) soon know more about immune responses generated in response to the JnJ vaccine and how they correlate with risk of COVID-related outcomes. This can provide a means of inferring vaccine efficacy (this is a current research project of mine). In other words, if we know how well the JnJ vaccine induced antibodies that are capable of neutralizing the delta variant, and we know how what level of antibodies corresponds to what VE, we can infer VE against delta. Our team will have such results generated over the next few weeks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a biologist who used to even work in a virology lab, while nothing is ever certain, I find the likelihood of a &quot;variant&quot; emerging that is unique enough to bypass gained immunities to be an insanely low probability, mostly due to the low complexity of the viral genome (I'm simplifying guys, this is for the masses!).</p>
<p>Variants are normal. Every virus has variants. In 10 years there is going to be dozens or even hundreds of variants of this virus. They will all most-likely be less potent and still protected against by your immune system of those who have recovered or been vaccinated. </p>
<p>You can never say this 100% because there is always a chance, but I wouldn't lose sleep over it because the chance is so so low.</p>
<p>This is why every report is quickly showing that gained immunity from the original is sufficient against these variants. Viruses mutate by nature. You have a 100% guaranteed chance of a variant. You could have a bunch of codons of the genome mutated at the <a href="https://microbenotes.com/the-wobble-hypothesis/#:%7E:text=The%20Wobble%20Hypothesis%201%20The%20Wobble%20Hypothesis.%20The,of%20the%20Wobble%20Hypothesis.%20...%204%20References.%20" target="_blank">wobble position</a> and it literally produced zero different proteins, yet they'd still call it a variant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simplest answer is that we don’t really know yet what the reduced effectiveness is. </p>
<p>Almost all of the information about increased spread and immune evasion of covid variants is coming out of the UK because they have the best infrastructure for genomic surveillance and a centralized healthcare system. They’re not distributing the J&amp;J vaccine there, so they aren’t able to provide efficacy data on it, but they have efficacy data for Pfizer and AZN, see <a href="https://khub.net/documents/135939561/479607266/Effectiveness+of+COVID-19+vaccines+against+hospital+admission+with+the+Delta+%28B.1.617.2%29+variant.pdf/1c213463-3997-ed16-2a6f-14e5deb0b997?version=1.4&amp;t=1623689315431&amp;download=true" target="_blank">UK delta variant vaccine data</a>. </p>
<p>We can infer that it’s likely the same proportion of decreased effectiveness, so 5-10% less effective; however, that’s really, at best, an informed guess.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
