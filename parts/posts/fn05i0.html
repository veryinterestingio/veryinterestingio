		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Welcome to ELI5’s first “Ask Me Anything!” We’re inviting expert educators to respond to your questions here on ELI5. Today the topic will be mathematics, brought to you by University of Oxford maths professor Tom Crawford (u/tomrocksmaths). Dr. Crawford has asked us to share <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUVERo2xpH4" target="_blank">his video about exponential growth, and why it’s so important to take every step to slow the spread of COVID-19</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKMHhm2Zbkw" target="_blank">another video about the SIR model for epidemics</a>.</p>
<p>This thread is your opportunity to ask questions about mathematics and the teaching of mathematics. Please remember that we will still be enforcing the rules, especially Rule 1. In this case, Rule 3 is amended: top level comments are reserved for questions. We ask that you guys try to stay on topic for Dr. Crawford - keep in mind that although Dr. Crawford may be discussing how diseases spread, this is <strong>not</strong> a topic about the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>And a big thanks to Dr. Crawford for helping us. Check out his YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRfo-DAifrP3lzcxUHtGm_A" target="_blank">Tom Rocks Maths</a>!</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Well, I think this went very well. Thanks everyone for helping us make this a successful first AMA! Dr. Crawford is on UK time so he may or may not continue to answer questions.</p>
<p>Next Sunday we'll be doing another AMA. This time the subject will be biology, and it will be hosted by some verified high school biology teachers!</p></div></div>
