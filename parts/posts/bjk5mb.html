		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The planet is not filled with magma. The mantle, the layer beneath the crust, is a solid that behaves like an incredibly viscous fluid on long time scales (i.e. a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheid" target="_blank">rheid</a>). There are isolated spots in the crust and very upper mantle that have significant pockets of melt (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma_chamber" target="_blank">magma chambers</a>) and other areas that may have a few % melt coating grain boundaries (more on why in a moment), but the first (and only layer) that is entirely liquid is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_outer_core" target="_blank">outer core</a>, which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core%E2%80%93mantle_boundary" target="_blank">~2891 kilometers down</a>.</p>
<p>Now, as a general rule, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_gradient" target="_blank">temperature increases</a> as you go deeper into the earth, but the pressure also increases (as a function of the increasing overburden with depth). The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting_point" target="_blank">melting point</a> of most materials increases as a function of pressure, so if you track the solidus temperature (i.e. the temperature at which a material crystallizes if cooling below it or melts if heating above it) with depth (i.e. pressure) and the temperature with depth, in most places the temperature is below the solidus temperature (i.e. the material is solid). It's only in very specific places where the temperature is elevated, pressure is lower (usually through rapid motion towards the surface), or the solidus temperature is reduced (usually through the addition of water) is it possible for material to melt, e.g. <a href="http://www.ei.lehigh.edu/learners/tectonics/heatflow/heat_depth.png" target="_blank">this diagram</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I use the following model:</p>
<p>Imagine a pot of melted chocolate sitting on a stove over very low heat. Now let’s cross section that. </p>
<p>At the very bottom, nearest the burner, the chocolate is totally melted. That’s the nickel iron liquid outer core (the pan/burner is the solid core itself, which is radioactive and produces the heat). </p>
<p>As you move away from the heat source, the chocolate gets firmer and firmer because it’s further from the heat source. So in between it’s sort of like peanut butter consistency. Finally, at the very top, there’s a skin of solid chocolate. It’s solid because it is dissipating heat faster than it’s taking it on because of its distance from the heat source, the surface area, etc. </p>
<p>Now imagine that whole thing as a sphere instead of in a pot. </p>
<p>We live on the skin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Radiative heat loss to space:</p>
<p>There's significant geothermal heat energy generated within the Earth from nuclear reactions.  There is also some heat left over from the energy of planetary accretion - when the Earth &quot;fell together&quot; releasing a lot of potential energy.   If this energy was trapped by a fully insulating layer, the temperature of the Earth would be increasing increasing due to the ongoing heat generation.  A close to balance situation exists where the energy loss due to radiation into space is approximately equal to the internal energy generation.  Heat flow to the surface requires a temperature gradient with temperature lower at the surface.  The material the Earth is made from (squishy hot rocks) is not a particularly good heat conductor and the distances the heat needs to flow are large - thousands of kilometers - so heat flow is slow, but it is enough to balance.  The average heat flow up to the Earth's surface is around 0.087 watt/square meter.  That's not a lot.  For comparison, the incoming solar power flux at sea level with the Sun overhead on a clear day is about 1000 watts/square meter.  When the geothermal heat reaches the surface it departs as infrared radiation with the much greater energy from solar heating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To give you a better understanding on how the whole things seems to work, I need to expand on a few things that you said.</p>
<p>As explained in other comments, the Earth's mantle is far from being a pool of magma and should be rather seen as a very viscous fluid that can flow and deform easily at long time scale. It is more like two slightly different used chewing gums moving on each other.</p>
<p>The crust itself IS melted material that crystallised from melt coming from the mantle. During partial melting of a rock, only a very few percent of the rock volume melts and not all mineral are gonna melt at the same time. This means that you are gonna preferentially melt certains minerals and leave other behind (pyroxenes are usually the minerals melting first in the upper mantle and olivine is often found as the one remaining one). The resulting melt will then travel upward, could get stuck in the mantle on the way (at any discontinuity) or can make it to the surface/subsurface. Its following crystallisation (close to the surface) will form what you call crust.</p>
<p>The lower crust and the upper mantle are basically at the same temperature, you do not see a strong increase in temperature when you cross from one to the other, it is rather continuous. Differentiation between the crust and the upper mantle mantle is mostly made on petrological grounds (i.e. when a mineral called Feldspar disappears, which is correlated to a bump in seismic velocities, allowing us to map that limit). In a continent, as everything is at equilibrium (temperature, pressure and most of the time no addition of melt), there is no reason for it to move inside the mantle.</p>
<p>On Earth, some crust does melt today but not for the reason you think. In subduction zones, the oceanic crust dives in the mantle because, with time, it becomes too col, too dense and therefore less buoyant than the underlying mantle. The crust (now called a slab) will dive in, will make the surrounding mantle melt by releasing water and will sometimes melt itself. This is where all the dangerous volcanoes / earthquake comes from.</p>
<p>Back in the Archean (few billion years ago), it is believed that the rules of the game were different as the Earth was hot enough to probably make the crust melt. Some structures observed in very old region of the continents seems to indicate a change from vertical (some kind of bubbling) to horizontal tectonic (subduction) which could reflect a change in the way Earth get rid of its heat (which is its the sole purpose).</p>
<p>To conclude, I'll say that part of what you are referring to may have existed in the archean but we think that it is not happening anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rock isn't a strong conductor of heat. Old stone churches are colder than outside in spring and warmer than outside in autumn. Some photos from Iceland a few years ago had snow on still slowly moving lava</p>
<p>Not much of Earth is liquid in a direct sense. The outer core is. The mantle has (very very slow) convection because solids at that high pressure cannot resist deformation</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
