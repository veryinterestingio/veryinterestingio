		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>India was indeed the most recent landmass to be connected to Madagascar, but a lot happened in the 80 million years between then and now, including a global mass extinction.  This long period of isolation has contributed to the very high degree of endemism on the island, which makes it non-trivial to figure out the closest relatives of the many forms of life there.</p>
<p>Indeed, the question of the <a href="https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/news/091001_madagascar" target="_blank">origin of Madagascar's species</a> is one that has been studied for some time, and includes some excellent case studies on differentiating dispersal and vicariance (as that website shows).  In most cases, phylogenetic analyses indicate that Malagasy species arrived from the African mainland after Madagascar had already become isolated; this is certainly true for most mammals, including lemurs (though major groups of mammals do appear to have arrived at different times, as discussed by <a href="https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/54/5/719/1630184" target="_blank">Poux et al. 2005</a>).</p>
<p>Another major complicating factor is that, while life on Madagascar has remained relatively isolated, the fauna of India did not enjoy the same luxury.  Once India hit Eurasia, species rapidly migrated in both directions.  In similar fashion to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_American_Interchange" target="_blank">Great American Interchange</a> which occurred after the formation of the Isthmus of Panama, however, the net result of this was highly asymmetrical, and the modern fauna of India is largely dominated by species of Eurasian origin.  Though there are exceptions of species that successfully spread from India outwards too; see <a href="https://scinapse.io/papers/168893340" target="_blank">Karanth 2006</a>, for example.</p>
<p>Others can probably comment more knowledgeably than I on fossil discoveries, but I did find one example that pretty clearly seems to represent a link between extant Indian and Malagasy fauna.  <a href="https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article/118/4/982/2705736" target="_blank">Toussaint et al. 2016</a> constructed a phylogeny of cascade beetles, and report a sister relationship between two genera: <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BDAh1GtCcAAX6w7.jpg:large" target="_blank"><em>Scoliopsis</em></a> from India, and <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/183533/files/figure.png" target="_blank"><em>Tritonus</em></a> from Madagascar.  Both genera are highly specialized, living only on the edges of waterfalls, which might help explain why the Indian species were not replaced by ecologically similar animals from Eurasia.</p>
<p>On a final note, I didn't really know where to put this, but just wanted to show <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?size=large&amp;id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0062086.g003" target="_blank">this excellent figure</a> from <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062086" target="_blank">Samonds et al. 2013</a> summarizing the biogeographical history of Madagascar and showing approximate arrival times of many vertebrate groups.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
