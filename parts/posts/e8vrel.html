<p><a href="https://youtu.be/C7HP9Xkim9o" target="_blank">Example song</a></p>
<p>I have a few questions about this.
I was once told that it's because multiple vocals of this era were done live through a single mic (rather than overdubbed one at a time), and the layers of harmonies disturb the hair in such a way that it causes this quality. Is this the case? If it is, what exactly is the &quot;disturbance&quot;? Are there other factors, such as the equipment used, the mix of the recording, added reverb, etc?</p>
<p>EDIT: uhhhh well I didn't expect this to blow up like it did. Thanks for everyone who commented, and thanks for the gold!</p></div></div>

In it, the producer of many Simon and Garfunkel classics details his vocal recording and mixing style which basically amounts to having each vocal recorded and doubled individually and then both vocals on one mic giving the mixer several tracks to pan and balance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see a lot of good info, but I didnt see anyone talk about this. When people sing in the same room the vibrations of their voices actually affect each other. When perfect harmonies are sung there are natural overtones created by the stacking of the sound waves. When voices are autotuned or electronically harmonized you are actually missing a lot of frequencies that natural harmonization would have, making the newer stuff sound flat and robotic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of it is the mixing/mastering. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/twenty-thousand-hertz/id1171270672?i=1000450841062" target="_blank">this “Twenty Thousand Hertz” episode</a> and the following episode covers the differences in modern mixing/mastering, versus mixing/mastering in previous decades. </p>
<p>Some of it is that songs used to be recorded in a single session in a big group, yeah. There are differences in the way they were recorded, and the ways that it’s been mastered make a big difference. Same with the size and acoustics of the studio in which it was recorded.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They loved doubling up vocals back then, as in you have the same vocal track repeated a fraction of a second later. John Lennon is doubled up on nearly all of his songs. They'd do this with harmonies as well - each vocal onto a single track and then doubled up. That's a lot of vocal going on at once, with sounds overlapping and interfering with each other, giving it that swirling shimmery sound.</p>
<p>What I also notice about the example you posted is that every vocal harmony is at a similar level, as if you're listening to a group of singers in a room. Modern music tends to go with the lead vocalist pushed to front, and backing singers for the harmonies, pushed further back in the mix. </p>
<p>Any kind of commercial music is competing in a kind of arms race of sound, attempting to stand out. Producers come up with a trick that makes their song sound bigger, then pretty soon everyone's doing it. Vocal doubling was one of those tricks. As we move into the 80s, the backing track becomes more of a focus. There's only so much you can do with vocals, but instruments and production techniques are changing all the time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vocals were often recorded much further off the mic back then 1-2' rather than 6&quot;.
Also not everything was pitch corrected and an amount of tuning variation between harmonies can make them sound thicker and richer.</p>
<p>Edit: auto correct hates me</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
