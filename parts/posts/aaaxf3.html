<p>Buffet restaurants serve cheap filling food for a price that 90% of the customer base won't manage to out eat. Then they save money on less employees and earn money on drinks (which have an insane mark up)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>We had a pub near us that did a Tuesday night Thai buffet for £1 (plus a table reservation fee of £2). Food was decent and the place was always busy with families(so you did need to reserve) </p>
<p>A pint of coke at that place normally cost about £2, On Tuesday it was £4.50 Cost to them of post-mix pint of coke? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>around 2-5p depending on their volume. </p>

<p>Actually answering OP's question, the wholesale cost of food is actually really really cheap. In most restaurants, food cost runs 20-30% of total costs. Buffets cut back on most of the other variable costs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
