		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cytokines and histamine make you itch. They're released by the body in areas of injury and promote healing. The itching is a by-product. Also, as the wound begins to heal, the new skin cells and collagen sort of entrap the small pre-existing nerves as they grow, which is perceived as itching.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wound healing releases a lot of histamine. Histamine causes the itch. There is evidence to suggest that antihistamines impair wound healing but for minor wounds it would not be significantly noticeable. Wound healing is a mixture of proliferation of epithelial cells, angiogenesis, fibroblast and myofibroblasts contracting to hold the wound together and inflammatory cells protecting the area from microbial insults as well as aiding with wound recovery. This complex interplay may cause itching.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The outer layer of our skin, epidermis (latin), is home to a lot of nerves. These nerves are really sensitive, so whenever we feel heat, a breeze, soft touch (a fly or whatever) the nerves are sending a signal to our brain that something is itching, especially when there is a wound. When the wound is in a healing proces the cells are dividing themselves and wander into the wound, where they reconnects and tries to heal up the wound.  </p>
