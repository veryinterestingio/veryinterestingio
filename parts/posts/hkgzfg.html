		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>MLM stands for Multi-Level Marketing, which is a fancy way of saying 'Pyramid Scheme'.</p>
<p>Essentially, as someone working for an MLM brand you have two means of income: Sell products yourself, or recruit people and get a cut of what they sell.</p>
<p>The problem with MLMs is that in the first option, generally you are a &quot;re-seller&quot;, that is you buy a bunch of products at wholesale cost, then sell them for a higher price. That can be difficult, especially if you are not at the top of the pyramid and you have to pay a percentage of your commission in the form of higher wholesale costs. Another downfall is that every person you recruit is now also selling the product, and now you are going to have a tougher time selling because they are direct competition. On top of that, <em>you</em> are making the financial investment, so if you can't sell your product, well you just bought a lifetime of charcoal face cream.</p>
<p>Lastly, MLMs depend on exponential growth. Let's say you recruit 5 of your friends, and each of them recruits 5 of their friends, and so on. Because of the nature of exponential growth, after the 14th iteration you would have more than 6 billion people trying to sell this product - and that's only if you can get effectively everyone in the world on board. At only 9 iterations, you'd have ~200,000 people selling this product which is more employees than multi-billion dollar companies (Apple, Google, Microsoft etc.) employ. It is very unlikely that a special kind of herb is going to be more sustainable than some of the world's largest companies (marijuana excluded for obvious reasons). This means the selling market gets saturated very quickly, so if you're not at the top you're likely not going to find people to recruit yourself that haven't already been propositioned. Another pitfall of being too far down on the pyramid is that those above you can sell for cheaper because they don't have the mark-up you do, so as someone that has been recruited you are already at a disadvantage. Not <em>everyone</em> will want the product, so it will quickly reach all of the potential buyers and quickly fizzle out. To boot, everyone trying to sell the product does not want to buy the product, and generally people who love the product want to show the world how great it is, and so the high-volume buyers will likely not be buying from you, but from themselves.</p>
<p>The MLM business model is beneficial for those at the top, and incredibly poor for those on the bottom, and even bad for those in the middle. They sell you on the idea that &quot;if you can hustle, you can make lots of money&quot;, but the caveat there is that it only applies if only a <em>few</em> people are hustling. Instead, it preys on people not understanding this concept and investing their life into a model that is doomed from the get-go. </p>
<p>They should be illegal, I'm not exactly sure why they are not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have done a great job answering the mechanics of how an MLM functions and compares to a pyramid scheme, so I'll try to answer your second question: how they ruin lives.</p>
<p>MLMs and their close cousin, Network Marketing companies, rely on a member's social connections to sell product. The problem with this is that these companies KNOW they are running scams that will be unprofitable for the vast majority of participants, so they work hard to brainwash the participants into believing in the company at all costs. </p>
<p>Since the whole point of an MLM is recruiting new sellers beneath you, these companies force earnest sellers to spam their friends, family and acquaintances with unwanted sales pitches and &quot;great business opportunities.&quot; This can ruin friendships fast, especially when the recipient knows the truth and tries to explain it to the victim (I really think it's appropriate to call most sellers victims).</p>
<p>Take it from someone whose wife's best friend from high school has pitched 3 different MLMs in the last year - that friendship is toast. The financial devastation that comes from investing your life in a scam doesn't help either</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are pyramid schemes. They make money in two ways and this is how it ruins lives. Upon joining the team at a MLM you will usually be asked to go out of pocket to buy a set of products that you sell. You make whatever you sell, but people bankrupt themselves on the initial purchase before realizing their products dont sell.</p>
<p>The better way to make money is to get a new member to join, bc then they will buy a whole starting kit from you (just like you did at first).</p>
<p>What happens most of the time is that people start trying to work over their friends to make sales. And it gets personal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No explanation here, just an anecdote:</p>
<p>I had a &quot;friend&quot; try and sell me on the idea of an &quot;unfranchise&quot; model. They thought I'd like the opportunity to be part of their business model, since I was already independently operating a business.</p>
<p>The trap is they sell you on &quot;it's easy money, but you have to work hard&quot;, but also that they rely in marks not to do their independent research. The offer was essentially to be another link down the chain.</p>
<p>&quot;Just like a shopping mall&quot; you had your website, you sold stuff off your website, and you could &quot;give&quot; your friends and family discounts for buying directly through you, except you don't pay franchise fees. And you could increase your earning power by bringing on more people.</p>
<p>I presented the following, all of which were refuted with &quot;but my mentor said it's ok&quot;:</p>
<p>Franchises at least give you notoriety via existing brand power: None of what I saw that they sold existed in any media I had consumed. Where were their advertising stats? Consumer target markets etc? Oh, you're supposed to advertise word of mouth, because that &quot;still works&quot;. </p>
<p>Franchises give you actual purchasing power: I looked around, and if I look up the price of that product online, it's exactly the same price everywhere else, and cheaper if I buy elsewhere in bulk. What's your 5% discount compared to that? </p>
<p>Franchises have regulated training - your mentor taught you everything to be successful? Sure. What's the difference between your product and the cheaper competitor? It works? So does the competitor's. It's scientifically tested? So is the competitor's. Try again.</p>
<p>Having your own business means that you could actually have power over your inventory, but in this model you're forced to purchase, and keep purchasing to a minimum spend to earn your commission. </p>
<p>You have access to their exclusive warehouse? Why not just use their website to sell your own stuff? I brought up that they could have made a killing sourcing and selling toilet paper for 3 months instead of &quot;vitamin C supplements&quot; and that they still had sold a few and insisted it was worth it, they just hadn't sold much because they &quot;decided to take a break and focus on other things&quot;.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Just UGH. It's definitely cult like.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
