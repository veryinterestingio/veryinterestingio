		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello, I'm a scientist, and I did my dissertation work on this topic. The short answer is that no, urine is not sterile. Everyone has a bacterial community in their bladder, it is just low biomass and can not be detected by standard urine culture. Here is a link to the original article proving that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22278835" target="_blank">bacteria can be found directly in the bladder and is not a consequence of vaginal or skin contamination</a>. And here is another paper that shows that standard urine culture does not pick up all the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3957746/" target="_blank">organisms that live in urine</a>. If you want a thorough, but easy to read description of this research, check out <a href="https://liveutifree.com/uti-test/" target="_blank">LiveUTIFree</a> (full disclosure, I'm the scientific adviser for LiveUTIfree).</p>
<p>Let me know if anyone would like more information. I would be happy to talk more about it here.</p>
<p>****update 1/3/2020****</p>
<p>I'm overwhelmed by the enthusiasm for this topic. Thank you to everyone for the great response and positive feedback. </p>
<p>I am trying to respond to all the questions that I have answers for. But I also thought I would provide a few more resources. I have given talks on this subject many times. If you would like to watch one, here is a link to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcOhSCAyp3A&amp;list=PLKd7dV6_-AImAB3TjIhIJy3L9adrb8emx&amp;index=2&amp;t=99s" target="_blank">5 min talk</a>. </p>
<p>Also, I was a part of the <a href="https://ssom.luc.edu/luerec/" target="_blank">Loyola Urinary Education and Research Collaborative</a> when I did this research, and they are still doing some awesome work. So check out their website as well. </p>
<p>Finally, for anyone looking for help with their condition, I unfortunately an not an MD, so I can't provide diagnosis. I would recommend finding a UTI specialist. Also, check out <a href="https://liveutifree.com/" target="_blank">LiveUTIFree</a> for resources, and reach out to the people on that website. They are building a community and might be able to point you in the direction of a specialist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Urine is traditionally considered sterile in your average healthy individual. There are various reasons why some people are chronically colonized with bacteria (usually people who have anatomic issues with their urinary tract) that may not necessarily mean infection. </p>
<p>As others have mentioned, more recent research indicates that there is a urinary tract microbiome with small amounts of bacteria that live in everyone’s urinary tract. We are only just starting to understand what role this urinary tract microbiome may play in disease.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you’re following the medical definition of sterile, not the dictionary definition, it just has to be under a specific quantity of bacteria per ml of urine. In a healthy person, urine bacteria count doesn’t exceed that number.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>That's because it's important to carefully frame your question.  </p>
<p>Are there a clinically relevant number of microorganisms in a urine sample from a healthy person?<br />
No.  Get a clean catch and plate it on some sort of enriched medium (blood agar, chocolate agar, et al) and note the lack of growth.  </p>
<p>Are there any microorganisms at all present in the above sample?<br />
Probably.  Other posters have gone into good detail on this, read their posts, I couldn't possibly improve upon them!</p>
<p>It's worth noting that not many things are&quot;sterile&quot; by the second definition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
