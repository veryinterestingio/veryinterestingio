		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most road noise has to do with the air your car is pushing out of the way underneath it's tires. As your tires roll forward not all the air can get out of the way and it stacks up on itself  creating an area of high pressure. When that area of high pressure is pushed into a crack or crevice in the road as well as your tires it has nowhere to go but out the sides or released from under the tires when it rolls off creating that &quot;woosh&quot; sound.</p>
<p>Newly paved roads are smooth with very little in the way of defects and cracks leaving very few places for the air to be trapped. This means the air is just pushed out of the way and produces less road noise. Though it will still produce some because of the air trapped in the tire tread.Older roads or roads with more porous material (for drainage usually) will trap more air and make more road noise.</p>
<p>Rougher roads also cause tiny vibrations in your tire and car creating just a little bit more noise, but not as much in comparison to the air interacting with your car and the road at high speeds. Also a bridge can make road noise louder since the ground isn't there to absorb the vibrations in the road, that translates to more noise surrounding the bridge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tons of reasons! </p>
<p>Tires are actually super complex and way more important than most people realize. Most of it has to do with tread pattern. Big knobby tires make more noise because the tread blocks are taller and there is more space between them. That means the blocks can flex more. When a particular tread block drags across the roadway it flexes and rubs across the road creating friction, which in turn creates heat and sound. The more flex the more sound.</p>
<p>It's also amplified by a cool process that actually makes your tire into a horn of sorts. Picture a tire on a flat surface. (O<em>) Theres a triangle or pocket of air from the very bottom point of the tire touching the ground out to the farthest part of the tire tread, (zoomed in it would look very roughly like this /</em>  ) The air that comes through the tread under your tire comes out the back, &quot;mixes&quot; with the noise from the tread block rubbing the road, and is projected out the back side of the tire via this triangle. The triangular shape acts like a megaphone and makes all of that noise even louder!</p>
<p>A rougher surface, larger tires, larger treads can all make the road noise louder. It's not that simple though! There is a point where TOO smooth of a road also makes more noise. This is because most passenger car tires have a lot of tread blocks and many small voids. The smoother the surface the more tread is in contact and there are less places for that air to escape. More of it is concentrated under the tire in between the tread blocks instead of escaping out the side like it could on a rough road. All that extra air hits the megaphone zone and suddenly your normally quiet car is humming!</p>
<p>But u/freshfromthefight, why are slicks so loud if no air is going through the tread blocks. FRICTION. Slicks are made of very soft rubber so they grab the road surface more firmly. As they roll along it's almost like thousands of tiny auctions cups being placed and pulled off of the road all at once.</p>
<p>Car manufacturers put a ton of engineering into NVH or noise, vibration, and harshness testing. If you have a newer car theres a good chance you may see just a hunk of rubber bolted to the side of your suspension. That's there to soak up vibrations at a certain frequency so that your car doesn't make an annoying noise or drone at a commonly driven speed.</p>
<p>Thank you for coming to my TED talk. PM me your tire questions. I particularly like to talk about winter vs summer vs all season tires.</p>
<p>PSA: check your spare tire pressure. It's always flat when you need it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't really a technical explanation, but I read about it a while ago. Auburn University just installed a &quot;musical road&quot; where the road plays the fight song as you drive across it at the speed limit. I think they used different aggregates to achieve tonal differences. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So your cars suspension is a giant spring and damper system. What that means is when the tires are hit by a force, like a crack in the road or a rock, rather then getting absorbed by the frame and damaging the car the energy is put into the spring (coil) and damper(shocks). The spring without the damper would keep bouncing on and on slowly losing power untill the energy was gone. The damper without the spring would compress, removing the energy but then no uncompressing - just one use. The combination of spring and damper is what allows your car to hit a bump and bounce but then even out.</p>
<p>Picture the effect of hitting a bump as  as a wave that slowly goes down to a line. The size and amount of time you are effected is a factor of the size of the bump and speed, or force an frequency. Sound it itself a fourm of mechanical losses so when the energy from the road goes into the system the more energy the louder the sound. If you hit a large pothole the damper is compressed, the spring is under stress so it then pushes the tire back out and if you hit it with enough force for the damper compress again a few times untill you even out. If you keep hitting bumps like an unfinished road, this effect doesn't have time to even out and you get the 'rrrrr' sound with vibration. </p>
<p>Each car will have a different response depending on the suspension but overall they work the same. Each car and in fact each part has what's known as a natural frequency which is the vibration (Hz) at witch the object will destroy itself. If your cars bumping on the road happens to match the Hz of the car or a part it will be VERY loud and you will notice. I would say this is uncommon but I've been seeing videos of pickup trucks that this happens to at highway speeds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best ELI5 (pun intended as you will see) I can put it is for the same reason you will get different sound if you play with a toy car in different surfaces. If you play in a perfect sheet of aluminium you will barely hear the wheels, if you play on a rugged sheet of aluminium it will make much more noise.</p>
<p>Tires and roads are (purposely) not perfectly round nor perfectly flat so there is a lot of attrition and the less perfect the road (or the tire) the louder the noise. Roads and tires are made with different materials and degrade over time making the amount of attrition vary and with it the amount of noise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
