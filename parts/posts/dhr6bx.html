		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tanning is a process that alters the protein structure of the skin using specific acids. It makes the material tougher and less susceptible to decomposing. That’s why we can have leather products without it rotting like regular skin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I once worked in a leather workshop making high end leather goods. </p>
<p>The sales rep from the tannery William Clarke’s in Kent came in once with some 300 year old reindeer leather. They had recovered a cargo of ‘green hides’ (untanned/untreated hides) as part of a salvage operation, which had been submerged in mud which had preserved them. </p>
<p>They tanned them and sold them at around 5 times the cost per ft.</p>
<p>We did a factory visit there once was fascinating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tanning involves several steps that include removing all non-skin elements from the hide, and then treating it with an acid to make the skin more durable and less prone to rot. There are a lot of ways of doing this. </p>
<p>The reason we do this is that if you don't, the skin will probably rot away to nothing. By tanning, you are basically pickling/preserving the leather so it will last a very long time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
