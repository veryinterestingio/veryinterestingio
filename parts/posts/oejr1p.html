If they’re not typically associated with igneous volcanoes, how do they pressurize? Under what circumstances do you end up with a mud volcano – or one that ignites?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mud volcanoes typically represent eruptions of &quot;overpressurized&quot; fluids and muds. A standard model for their formation would be in a location with very high sedimentation rates. In such areas, compared to regions with slower sedimentation rates, sediments do not have a chance to significantly &quot;dewater&quot;, i.e. the fluids in the depositing sediments get trapped by layers depositing on top of them. As the overburden increases (i.e., more sediment is layered on top), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pore_water_pressure" target="_blank">pore fluid pressure</a> increases. Through a variety of mechanisms (faulting or folding being common ones), if the overpressurized fluid in these layers can find a pathway to the surface, the internal pressures are sufficient to erupt. And voila, a mud volcano is born. Some good reviews of general details of mud volcanoes are <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825202000697" target="_blank">Dimitrov, 2002</a> or <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025322700000220" target="_blank">Milkov, 2000</a>. Mud volcanoes share some common features with &quot;sand injectites&quot;, also called &quot;clastic dikes/sills/etc&quot; (where the nomenclature is the same as if they were an igneous intrustion) in that they are thought to form mostly from overpressurized fluids and sediments (e.g., <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825211000250" target="_blank">Hurst et al., 2011</a>). The main difference being the material being &quot;injected&quot;, i.e., sandsize particles vs mud, though there are more nuanced differences and sand eruptions are not as common, and &quot;sand blows&quot;, which would be something like the sand equivalent of a mud volcano, are usually related to liquefaction associated with earthquakes (e.g., <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013795206002997?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">Cox, 2007</a>).</p>
<p>Now, most mud volcano eruptions are not violent, more like fluid rich mud flowing out of a vent. However, some do erupt more violently, sometimes explosively. An excellent example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%B6kbatan_Mud_Volcano" target="_blank">Lokbatan</a> volcano in Azerbaijan (not the one in the news lately, but one that does erupt a lot, sometimes violently). Most eruptions of even Lokbatan are non-violent (I've hiked to the top of this one and put my hand in the mud slowly leaking out, which is basically ambient temperature most of the time), but sometimes it erupts violently, spewing mud breccia and emitting flames (e.g., <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X20306439" target="_blank">Mazzani et al., 2021</a>). As mud volcano systems are often associated with petroleum and natural gas rich areas, there are certainly flammable products being emitted by many of these. Exactly how they ignite is not 100% understood, but the assumption is either heat from friction or rocks hitting each other during the eruption and creating sparks, either of which would be enough to ignite the various petrochemicals (e.g., methane) that are also often emitted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
