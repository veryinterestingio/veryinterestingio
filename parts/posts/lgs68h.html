		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A former <em>New York Times</em> weekly tech columnist from 2000 to 2013, I'm a five-time Emmy winner for my stories on <em>CBS News Sunday Morning</em>, a <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author, a five-time TED speaker, and host of 20 <em>NOVA</em> science specials on PBS.</p>
<p>My most recent <em>NOVA</em> special is a mini-series called &quot;<a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/series/beyond-elements/" target="_blank">Beyond the Elements</a>,&quot; a sequel to my 2012 documentary &quot;<a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/video/hunting-the-elements/" target="_blank">Hunting the Elements</a>,&quot; which has become a staple in science classrooms worldwide. The new show's three one-hour episodes take me on a worldwide quest for the key molecules and chemical reactions that make up human civilization, including concrete and fertilizer, plastic and rubber, fire and venom, explosives and hot peppers.</p>
<p>I've written or cowritten more than 120 books, including dozens in the Missing Manual tech series, which I created in 1999; six books in the <em>For Dummies</em> line (including <em>Macs</em>, <em>Magic</em>, <em>Opera</em>, and <em>Classical Music</em>); two novels (one for middle-schoolers); my three bestselling <em>Pogue's Basics</em> books of tips and shortcuts (on <em>Tech</em>, <em>Money</em>, and <em>Life</em>); my how-to guides <em>iPhone Unlocked</em> and <em>Mac Unlocked</em>; and my 620-page magnum opus, <em>How to Prepare for Climate Change</em>.</p>
<p>After graduating summa cum laude from Yale in 1985 with a distinction in music, I spent 10 years conducting and arranging Broadway musicals in New York. I won a Loeb Award for journalism, two Webby awards, and an honorary doctorate in music. I live in Connecticut and San Francisco with my wife Nicki and our blended brood of five spectacular children.</p>

<p>I'm a fan of your work with PBS. Shows like Nova and Nature were my first exposure to real scientists, and now I'm getting my PhD. How did you come to work with PBS? Were you involved with scientific communication with the general public before your books? </p>
<p>Thank you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
