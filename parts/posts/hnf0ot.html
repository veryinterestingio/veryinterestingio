		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The WHO coordinates the <a href="https://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/en/" target="_blank">Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System</a>, which includes a bunch of National Collaborating Centers. Representatives of these centers, plus a number of other groups, meet (organized by the WHO) twice a year to share their national surveillance information.  </p>
<p>This international information is compiled and used to predict what influenza strains are likely to be prevalent in the upcoming flu season.  Because of the way flu works, it’s critical to know what strains circulate internationally, because that shortens the lag between flu seasons. WHO makes recommendations based on this for specific viruses that meet the requirements. </p>
<p>In the US, the CDC is the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/who-collaboration.htm" target="_blank">WHO Collaborating Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology and Control of Influenza</a>.  There are several others <a href="https://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/collaborating_centres/list/en/" target="_blank">Collaborating Centers</a>, including Australia, China, Japan, etc, as well as a bunch of <a href="https://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/national_influenza_centres/list/en/" target="_blank">National Centers</a>. All in all, WHO coordinates information from over 100 countries. </p>
<p>I have no idea how withdrawing from the WHO would impact the information compilation and coordination. I am certain that without this international information it will be impossible to predict flu vaccines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The WHO gives recommendations for flu vaccine composition ( <a href="https://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/recommendations/en/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/recommendations/en/" target="_blank">https://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/recommendations/en/</a></a>). Here's a news report about the flu vaccine with a summary of how it works:  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/19/the-16-billion-business-of-flu.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/19/the-16-billion-business-of-flu.html" target="_blank">https://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/19/the-16-billion-business-of-flu.html</a></a></p>
<p>&quot;The process of putting the flu vaccine together begins in February, when the World Health Organization determines which strains of the virus should be included, based on what’s circulating around the globe. 'What’s nice is we have a Southern Hemisphere flu season and a Northern Hemisphere flu season,' said Phil Hosbach, vice president of new products and immunization policy at Sanofi Pasteur. 'They’re able to look at strains circulating in the opposite hemisphere and can kind of predict what will be circulating' in this one. Public health agencies then provide seed viruses to manufacturers, which can decide whether to make a trivalent vaccine — including three strains —or, more recently, a quadrivalent — including four.&quot;</p>
<p>It's possible that the information is available elsewhere and, if needed, might be generated by some other agency or the companies making flu vaccines; after all, the companies make the vaccines because they can make money doing it. This means there is financial incentive to produce the vaccines and accurate ones.</p>
<p>The WHO does a lot of direct work too but its major role is in coordinating efforts and issuing guidance. So while cutting funding might have an effect on the seasonal flu vaccine, we do not know what the effects are. In any case, withdrawing funds should not have any effects on flu vaccine development until 2022 (for the 2022-2023 season) at the earliest (unless the WHO decides they need to cut spending early and stop giving flu guidance as part of that, which is unlikely).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, the WHO just stated that coronavirus droplets stay in the air for extended periods, which is something that Germany said in March with demonstrations. I don’t think the WHO is a cutting edge health organization but rather, a political organization that doesn’t know what’s happening right now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no immediate concern. The next 12-24 months of vaccines have been chosen and are in development if not production now. It takes a long time to stockpile enough.  The current stockpile is more than less set in place.  Than there is  a lack of travel which will throw the model used to create it into a bit of chaos but the strains selected are not perfect every time. The 2017 vaccine was a good case of this. For now nothing more can be done about the immediate consequences.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>After that it is a little more difficult.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The viruses are  selected based on a model generated to predict the most likely candidates. Than 3-4 are chosen. As others have said this is driven by global monitoring. The global bit is important as southern hemisphere flu strains are good indicator of northern hemisphere and vice versa each year. A lack of central coordination by the WHO will hinder the flow of information in the short term. This will reduce the power of the model and reduce the talent pool giving input to what is chosen.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It is possible for the US to simply run its own R&amp;D for a local vaccine. This would not be based on global data. It would not be as good at predicting the trend but a viable option as the industrial capacity is still present if not the data.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It is possible that the monitoring may simply be worked around by collaborating with other institutions. There is  a window of up to 2 years for this to happen but probably less.  It is  also possible that the US program can still contribute to the global data which means the departure effects coordination rather than vaccine flu strain selection.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>For now the best practice is to assume a worst case scenario, plan for it and hope that things work out. That worst case scenario is one in which a lack of communication leads to a huge gap in the data and that adversely effects the models used. Conversely the US loses access to the rest of the information immediately.  Beyond that it is a lot of guess work as the exact details of the departure are unknown.</p>
<p>*One big caveat is private pharmaceutical companies working internationally.  If they have a branch in say Europe or Australia where the virus data is analyzed ad the domestic vaccine is produced they may be able to use that data for US production. It would favor global companies.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
