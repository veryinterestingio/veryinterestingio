		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rabies isn't the only virus with a broad host range. Viral host range mainly depends on compatibility with cell surface receptors. As /u/PHealthy mentioned, the rabies virus targets receptors that are basically the same in all mammals.</p>
<p>Influenza virus has an even broader host range, because its targets (sialic acids) are present in not only mammals, but also birds.</p>
<p>There are even some viruses that can infect both insects (such as mosquitoes) and vertebrates. Yellow fever virus <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2609379/" target="_blank">is an example</a> although it doesn't cause disease in the mosquitoes as far as I know.</p>
<p>And in an even crazier example, apparently there is a virus that can replicate in plant, insect, and human cells: <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0217494" target="_blank">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0217494</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Rabies is also quite new on the scene, thought to have evolved about 1,500 years ago. And there is the beginning of some potential speciation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the continental US, four terrestrial mammalian species are reservoirs for seven antigenic rabies virus variants. Cross species transmission (CST) occurs when a rabies virus variant causes disease in non-reservoir species.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>u/iayork also had a good answer a few years ago:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The receptor rabies binds to is highly conserved among vertebrates and higher temperature means more collisions so more infection and more replication... the receptor is also likely different enough even if still highly conserved... in reptiles and birds to prevent viral propagation at least to a degree that makes it not threatening.  </p>
<p>Basically... rabies binds to a receptor that even a mutation that changes its shape just a little bit would almost always be incompatible with life... so it’s stayed almost exactly the same shape among mammals.  Kind of like how alpha cobratoxin can paralyze everything from fish to other snakes to humans... but banded mongoose are immune because they have a mutation that changes the shape of alpha nAChR preventing the toxin from binding.  Research isn’t conclusive but it also likely causes some degree of loss of function as an acetylcholine receptor too.  The mongoose could make up for this by having a larger concentration of receptors on its skeletal muscles or by having other mutations that allow a different part of the acetylcholine receptor to function to make up the difference... basically it would be way too much to be a positive influence on survival for anything that doesn’t prey on cobras.  There are other methods of gaining resistance to alpha cobratoxin, but none grant the essential immunity the mongeese have... just a better tolerance.  We see these more minor mutations on a lot of prey species.  </p>
<p>Rabies is kinda like that... most viruses don’t target something AS essential and conserved as what rabies does... and things that can shift and still function will just because of chance, so usually by the time you have gone from raccoon to human the receptor is different enough the virus doesn’t fit anymore.  But (as covid-19 reminds us) sometimes those differences are very small and all it takes is a little mutation to be able to jump species with a spillover event.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't.</p>
<p>The same rabies virus won't infect every animal species out there.</p>
<p>There are multiple viruses in the rabies family and each can infect it's own host types.</p>
<p>Viruses mutate and from time to time the mutation allows the new virus type to infect a different species.</p>
<p>This is valid for other viruses as well, the current coronavirus for example has infected humans, bats, cats, dogs, tigers, minx and who knows what else.</p>
<p>But before the mutation that allowed it to cross to humans, the previous version of this coronavirus couldn't infect us and probably other animals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
