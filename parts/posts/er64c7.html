		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In medicine having a fever or being “febrile” is generally considered to be a temperature greater than 100.4F. Sepsis criteria includes fever of more than 100.4°F (38°C) or less than 96.8°F (36°C) as hypothermia can be a sign of infection as well.
A fever “breaking” is a layman’s term and is also outdated as it really has no meaning in modern medicine. It’s based on the notion that some illnesses often accompany a fever and after it (a self limiting virus) runs its course the fever resolves as the body recovers.
But you should know that the fever is NOT the illness. Fever is just a response by the body. Just because a fever ends does not mean the illness is ended. Different illnesses have different patterns. Some may have a constant fever, some intermittent, some have recurring patterns of days or months. And treating a fever is not usually necessary aside for comfort reasons unless it gets severely high around 105-106 where febrile seizures are a concern, especially in babies/children.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Infections cause the immune system to release prostaglandins which signal the hypothalamus to &quot;turn up the temp&quot;.  During this phase you will feel freezing cold as your body shunts blood centrally, your skin will get dry as a bone and goosebumps appear.  Finally, rigors or the muscles (chills) begin to set in which generate heat assisting the temp raising to the higher hypothalamic set-point.  As the infection wanes or lulls, prostaglandin release fades and the hypothalamus signals &quot;lower the temp back to the original set-point&quot;.  Blood shunting stops and you feel hot, to cool your body you begin to sweat heavily.  This phase of the cycle is what people refer to as a fever &quot;breaking&quot;. It identifies the phase of infection/immune response of a resolving infection as the body temp resets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
