		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A mushroom is the fruiting body of some types of fungus. The reason the fungus living in the soil underground or in a rotting log grows them is to distribute spores which are like mushroom versions of seeds.</p>
<p>Fungus are an entirely separate branch of life from plants and animals.</p>
<p>Some of them develop a poison which can kill people who eat them. Some don't.  Producing a poison takes extra energy, so ones that don't probably developed in areas where there were less animals likely to eat them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They are really fascinating because they don't work like animals or plants do.</p>
<p>For instance, they don't have male and female but still have genders: their reproduction cycle (for the multicellular shrooms) is as it:</p>
<ol>
<li>the mushroom liberate spores, which are &quot;sexualised&quot; (usually noted + or -) </li>
<li>the spore hopefully land on a fertile soil and begin to duplicate and grow</li>
<li>the spore create a mycellium which is a colony of cells linked together.</li>
<li>When mycelli (plural of mycellium) encounters and they have an opposite sex, they mix toghether and create a cite where some species make an aerial part called &quot;mushroom&quot; by normal people</li>
<li>mushroom release spores and the cycle goes on</li>
</ol>
<p>This is part of what makes the fungus reign interesting. And there's many more</p>
<p>source: what I remember from my high school biology courses so take it with a grain of salt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A mushroom is a fungus. Fungi are actually far more closely related to animals than plants according to genetic analysis, but they evolved into large multi-cellular organisms independently. So a lot of their traits and features, while solving the same problems, are slightly different answers than the plant or animal versions.</p>
<p>Two key differences that are on the easier end to explain:</p>
<p>-Most organisms can construct a structure known as &quot;cell walls&quot; to make their tissue more sturdy. Animals do not have cell walls, we lost them during evolution. Plants construct cell walls of cellulose (fiber). Fungi have cell walls similar to plants, but instead they make them out of chitin (the same substance that makes bugs crunchy).</p>
<p>-Plants produce sugars from sunlight and air using a process known as photosynthesis. Fungi and animals lack all of the adaptations needed to do this. Instead, fungi mostly gain their nutrients by breaking down and digesting the dead leftovers around them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
