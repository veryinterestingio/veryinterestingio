		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The primary cause is thermal stress. Unequal thermal expansion of the glass pane over its area causes stress and cracking.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nobody has said this bit, which is a little strange.</p>
<p>Windows subject to thermal stress in house fires should have crazed, sometimes rounded cracks. Windows that are broken by firefighters have roughly concentric and radial cracks, and windows blown out tend to be made of smaller, sharper fragments with no obvious point of impact but this varies depending on the force of the explosion, which can be quite weak. Some windows are intact, even after a vapour explosion. Stress fractures caused by forcing a window in its frame have a different crack structure.</p>
<p>Caveat: this relates to float glass (the commonest stuff), not toughened or laminate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The OP was already answered. To add to this, there are often large thermal events that happen without shattering windows. They also happen more quickly than they did years ago. The contents of rooms today contain combustibles that burn faster than older contents. </p>
<p>So get out quickly and have a family plan.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The snarky version? Well. It’s firemen who like to break things. But, we do it for a reason. Trapped gasses and heat, a way out ... we don’t like to live in there with that.</p>
<p>Let the house breathe is how I was taught. The heat drains your strength and energy, the smoke completely blocks your vision.. ventilation is one of the core components of firefighting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My favorite college professor was an expert witness in several arson cases, where it was alleged that windows cracking is always caused by fire accellerants and thus the owner was somehow guilty.  It was a pervasive myth of at the time and caused a number of innocent people to be imprisoned for arson.  He was able to prove and video, in a number of test fires, that windows cracking or shattering can be caused by the fire itself or by firehoses hitting them. There was a large concrete test facility behind his rural home, and he would build little structures back there, calling the fire department to tell them another one was going up in flames.   In many of his arson cases the only evidence was that windows had shattered, and the owner was due some fire insurance payments and had no alibi.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
