<p>While I did know the UK mutation was a thing, I was quite surprised by the addition of South Africa.</p>
<p>If it's the same virus, shouldn't we assume it's already spread from the UK to mainland Europe (I mean, what's the chance it spread from the UK all the way down to South Africa, but not to any countries in-between?) and shut down travel between countries until we know where it will show up?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are independent mutations. That’s one of the reasons scientists wonder if there’s natural selection acting on this, since the independent variants both seem to be spreading faster. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>But further reason for concern comes from South Africa, where scientists have sequenced genomes in three provinces where cases are soaring: Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and KwaZulu Natal. They identified <strong>a lineage separate from the U.K. variant</strong> that also has the N501Y mutation in the spike gene.</p>
