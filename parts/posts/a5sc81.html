		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Smallpox: we used a huge amount of resources to track every case and vaccinate everyone around them.</p>
<p>Polio: there are actually two different kinds of vaccines inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and oral polio vaccine (OPV). The concept behind OPV is to infect people and spread a weakened virus in the environment to vaccinate many people who might not have contact with the health system. This sounds amazing but like you mention, a live virus has potential to mutate so in addition to wild type polio outbreaks in Afghanistan and Nigeria, you also have vaccine-derived polio outbreaks like what's happening now in Papua New Guinea and Niger. IPV is a more traditional vaccine and gives promise for eradication.</p>
<p>Rinderpest: this is an animal disease that was eradicated and was done through a combination of culling diseased animals and a huge vaccination campaign. There is some fear that laboratory samples might be accidently released.</p>
<p>Guinea worm: this is a disease that's about to be eradicated without the use of any drugs. A huge effort by the Carter Center over the last few decades through the use of education, water filters, and insecticides has brought millions of cases a year down to a couple of dozen. There's been a bit of a set back as the human Guinea worm in Chad is now being found in dogs and South Sudan just had an outbreak in a long eliminated area. So it'll probably be another decade or so before it's fully eradicated.</p>
<p>Lymphatic filariasis: this is a mosquito-borne parasitic disease that's being controlled through mass drug administrations to kill parasites in people and clean up campaigns that involve habitat elimination and spraying for adult mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Trachoma: a combination of education campaigns and mass drug administrations are being used to drastically reduce the burden of blinding trachoma with the eventual hope of eradication but given it's the same bacteria in the Chlamydia STD infection, there's a long ways to go.</p>
<p>It's doubtful that eradicated diseases will mutate from closely related diseases but opening niches could have new diseases emerge. There's also always the threat of bioterrorism which may feel distant but is a constant looming gray cloud in public health.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Smallpox is a very unique disease in many ways that allowed us to make it the first eradicated disease.  First is that Variola virus, the virus that caused Smallpox disease could only infect one species – humans.  This is important because once a person had been infected (or vaccinated) they are immune or partially protected from repeated infection.  Since it only infected humans, once you have a sufficient number of humans that were are immune (via vaccination or exposure), the virus cannot continue to infect new host and dies off.  There are other zoonotic Orthopoxviruses that infect multiple species and continually pop up due to their ability to transmit among various animals and then jump back to humans.  Thankfully, those infections were not as bad as Smallpox.  Viruses like monkeypox virus in central Africa, cowpox virus in Europe and western Asia, and vaccinia virus in South America continually cause new disease when a non-vaccinated human is exposed to an infected animal.  </p>
<p>The second unique aspect was that there was a readily available virus that could be used for vaccination – a variant of the vaccinia virus mentioned above.  Vaccinia (and all Orthopoxviruses) are so similar that once you are infected with one of the viruses, you gain immunity to infection with all other Orthopoxviruses, including variola.  This worked well since you could get “infected” (aka, vaccinated) with vaccinia and then be protected from smallpox.  Vaccinia also infects multiple species so they would just grow the virus however they could (most notably calf lymph or more simply on the side of cows).  There was no need to have all the modern biotechnology tools to culture virus.  Vaccinia infection caused much less severe disease, so you could give it to a lot of people and not worry (too) much about side effects.  </p>
<p>It was also important that the disease was easily identifiable.  It was hard to hide the huge number of lesions that developed all over the body.  Once lesions popped up, the disease could be identified and the person could seek treatment.  The infected person was also not infectious (e.g., did not spread the virus) up until a few days before the lesions appeared so there was only a few days where you could have spread the virus unknowingly.  This leads to the next unique aspect, the long virus incubation and use of vaccination in that time.  </p>
<p>Immunity from vaccination was sufficient that you were protected for quite some time afterwards and importantly that vaccination could still protect even if it was given to you after exposure!  Once you were infected with variola, there is a long period of 1-2 weeks where you had no symptoms.  As mentioned during most of that time the person didn’t spread the virus.  If you were vaccinated early enough, your body would mount an immune response to the large dose of vaccine (vaccinia) which would prompt your immune system to generate antibodies which would then bind/inactivate any variola virus in the body and stop the further spread.  Point is, you could be exposed and then get vaccinated and still be ok.  </p>
<p>This leads to the last and very ingenious aspects of the eradication – the use of ring vaccination.  Since there was only a few days time when a person could spread the virus unknowing, and vaccination (even after exposure) was effective at stopping spread, we simply vaccinated everyone that had been in contact with a person who had smallpox.  You create a “ring” of now vaccinated people and the virus cannot spread.  If you also then monitor all the people that were exposed to that person, and if any one of them shows symptoms, you then vaccinate all their contacts.  It was time intensive, but because of this, you didn’t need to vaccinate everyone, you could just vaccinate the contacts and still be successful.  </p>
<p>In short, it was a combination of many factors that allowed the eradication of smallpox.  Smallpox won’t be back, and if it does somehow reappear (from the permafrost or from bioterrorism) we have newer and safer vaccines that will help solve that problem.  Interestingly, it is many of these same factors that helped us eradicate Rinderpest (from cattle), but that are now working against us in eradicating polio or even attempting to eradicate something much more dangerous like Rabies.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Smallpox basically only exists in humans, and doesn't change that quickly.</p>
<p>So one of the largest vaccination campaigns ever was started in an effort to eradicate the disease. As no real anti vaccine movement had started at the time, and smallpox was a horrible disease that everyone knew, and no one wanted to risk. The campaign succeeded in basically vaccinating enough people that the disease could no longer spread. </p>
<p>After 10 years of no known cases emerging, WHO declared the disease extinct. (though i think some strains remain in certain laboratories )</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The last phase in India was interesting. There were not enough vaccines for the whole country, so it was decided to inoculate all people in the radius of 20-30km when outbreak occurs. The strategy proved successful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is an excellent book by Richard Preston called Demon in the Freezer that outlines the smallpox eradication effort as well as analyzing the issues with small pox stocks held in government labs. </p>
<p>Briefly, smallpox does not live outside of humans for long. It doesn’t live in soil, water, or anything else. </p>
<p>The world health organization (WHO) spearheaded a campaign to eradicate smallpox. Essentially they would vaccinate in a large circle around known smallpox outbreaks and work their way in. Through this method of vaccination, they were able to eradicate the disease.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
