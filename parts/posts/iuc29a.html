		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure I agree with u/crashdemon's answer. It does not explain why you would have bags under your eyes the next morning. That has to do with your blood vessels dilating. </p>
<p>If you do not get enough sleep, your body kind of relaxes your blood vessels, so there is more blood flowing closer to the skin. Because the skin under your eyes is so thin, you see the blood colour through it, creating dark circles. The poor circulation also means that some fluid might be left under the skin, so your eyes might look slightly puffy. </p>
<p>Alcohol does similar things, so when you have been on a bender, you can have even worse bags than normal. (side note: this is also why alcohol makes you feel warm even though it actually makes you lose more heat.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I was recently looking at a wedding photo of my grandma.  Her sisters were her brides maids, they all looked like they had black eyes their eyes were so dark.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you've been upright for awhile blood starts to pool under your eyes, the skin under your eyes is really thin making it look dark, creating the &quot;bags&quot;. Sometimes people with bad circulation will have bags under their eyes but the majority of people haven't laid down for awhile, that's why we associate it with being sleepy.</p>
<p>Edit: I should have added there are multiple reasons people get bags, this is just the most common one associated with sleepiness. Sometimes it's large blood vessels, sun exposure, drinking, blood medications, sleeping with crazy women, etc....</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the accumulation of tears and other lipids that seep from your eyes all the time. It usually get absorbed during sleep, and not all experts agree, but many say it happens most rapidly during rem sleep. Not entering a deep sleep stage or not staying in it long enough results in fluids remaining under your eyes.</p>
<p>You can temporarily dry them by covering each eye with moist tea bags and leaving them on for twenty minutes. This does two things. Laying down provides a greater area for the liquid to go and the tannins in the tea are astringent, drying it up. </p>
<p>Rinsing your eyes with distilled or filtered (R.O. filtered) will help. Keep you eyes open while you splash the water into them. The excess will accumulate into your eye bags and look horrible at first, but the pure water desaturates the liquid that has seeped in, allowing it to drain more efficiently. your bags will be much less conspicuous in an hour or so.</p>
<p>The real treatment for eye bags is to have good rest for 8 hours for several consecutive nights. That treatment will improve your overall health too. So you'll not only look better, you'll feel better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
