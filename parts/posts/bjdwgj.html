		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chicxulub crater is 150 km in diameter, or about 17671sq/km.  If we assume every bit of atmosphere in this diameter was totally lost to space (I doubt that's a good assumption but we'll roll with it), that's 17671/510,100,000 (the surface area of the earth) or 0.000035 of the atmosphere.  Or 0.0035% drop in atmospheric volume.  So I think it's safe to say there would be an insignificant drop in air pressure, even if 100x that much air was lost you'd see less than a 1% change in the atmosphere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The shockwave needed more than a few hours to travel around the Earth the first time (and it didn't stop after that). The pressure was varying wildly from the direct impact and secondary impacts and so on, I'm not sure if you would have seen any additional effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
