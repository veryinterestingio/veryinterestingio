		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During the 1972 election, a group of people from then-President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign broke into the headquarters of their Democratic opponents to wiretap their phones. The headquarters was at the Watergate office complex, from which the scandal gets its name. The breakin was probably not directly ordered by Nixon, but he learned of it shortly afterward and began a cover-up to try to prevent it from becoming public (which would have been very politically damaging for him). He won the election by a landslide, so he remained in office during this attempted cover-up.</p>
<p>The cover-up failed, there was a large public backlash, and Congress was set to impeach and probably remove Nixon from office. Nixon resigned before that could happen, and his Vice President, Gerald Ford, became the President. Ford then used the pardon power given to Presidents to pardon Nixon of his crimes, stopping any further actions against Nixon.</p>
<p>EDIT: To be clear, the probable fact that Nixon didn't directly order the break-in doesn't mean he wasn't culpable to some extent. Nixon was, to put it mildly, very willing to engage in underhanded or even illegal tactics to win. In retrospect, for example, we know that he deliberately sabotaged peace talks in Vietnam to win in 1968. Even at the time, it was an open secret that he was happy to use the FBI against his political opponents. In fact, some names you might know from more recent political crimes, like Roger Stone, got their start as low-level Nixon operatives.</p>
<p>EDIT2: To those of you pointing out comparisons to recent events, it's against ELI5 rules:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was during Nixon’s term.  People broke into the democratic national convention offices to plant bugs and steal information that could help campaign against them.  The office was in the Watergate building in DC.   </p>
<p>The people were arrested and evidence eventually pointed back at Nixon’s election campaign funding the whole thing.  Nixon tried to cover it up but was unsuccessful.  Congress eventually started the impeachment process, but Nixon resigned before the proceedings could continue and Ford pardoned Nixon for his crimes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
