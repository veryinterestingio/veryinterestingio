<p>Edit: Also, most of your DNA is random strings of letters that don’t seem to spell anything</p>
<p>Edit: Everyone seems to be in the giving spirit. Thanks for the gold and silver</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Just like it takes many bricks to build a house, a gene is composed of many base pairs. Additionally, just as there can be many different types of bricks such as color, size, or ways to arrange them, the same gene can be made up of different base pairs as long as there is a basic shared structure (there are many ways a house can look but it’s more than just bricks randomly piled on each other).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because lots, LOTS of DNA is non-coding (they dont make a protein product). Those parts have many purposes. Most of them control expression of genes (turning them on/off, modulating response). Some of them are thought to protect from viral insertions/mutations (in short, the odds of mutatong something important in billions of pairs is much lower than in fewer base pairs with the same number/size of genes). And some parts are leftover (old genes, inserted transpozones/viruses, repeats...).</p>
<p>It takes a lot of regulators for one gene to function.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Genes are only the parts of the DNA that encode proteins and RNA. Other than genes, the human genome also contains a lot of control elements, like promoters, enhancers etc. that help regulate gene expression, but are not considered genes themselves. </p>
<p>Then there's a lot of stuff called mobile genetic elements - transposons, indigenous retroviruses and so on, that don't code for anything useful for the human cell, but as a side effect of their mobility they sometimes create extra copies of genes, which can lead to evolution of new genes. </p>
<p>Then there's structural elements, like telomeres and centromeres, that aren't genes and aren't involved in gene expression, but have important roles in keeping chromosomes intact and making sure they are split evenly between daughter cells during cell division, respectively.</p>
<p>And there's still parts of the human DNA that has unknown or maybe no function.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answers about genes being made up of many base pairs here are unintentionally misleading. If the question is why is there so much sequence compared to genes, the answer is NOT that genes are made up of many bases. </p>
<p>Counting by bases, only ~2% of the bases in our genomes are part of a gene. The rest of them have many functions that help support the genes that make (express RNA that makes) proteins, and some of it does nothing and a lot of it we haven’t discovered whether it does anything useful yet but we are on the edge of ongoing new discoveries of function in the ‘junk’ (non-coding) part of the genome. The concept of ‘junk’ DNA is outdated for those of us who study that part of the DNA specifically, and the term junk is misleading.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
