		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is YES!</p>
<p>But not without special treatment. The trick is to HEAT THE STEAM ITSELF!</p>
<p>Imagine a pot of water on the cook top.  Instead of the lid making a seal, make the lid have a single copper hose (maybe .5cm internal diameter) coming out into a tightly looped coil.  As the water in the pot boils, the vapors above the water (the steam) will expand and flow through the copper coil.  If you place a torch under the copper coil itself, you are now adding thermal energy to the steam!  It is not unreasonable to reach temperatures over 800C this way, PLENTY hot enough to ignite paper, cellulose, or any other common combustible.    </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Steam is a gas, like other gases there's no theoretical upper limit to how hot you can get it although at some point it will have so much thermal energy that the atomic structure of individual H2O molecules will break down and you'll have an energetic plasma instead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes,  They would give you a straw broom to look for steam leaks at power boilers.  When you find a leak it sets the broom on fire.  Saw this in action and can tell you it gives you great respect for steam.  You shouldn't however confuse vapor coming off boiling water as the same kind of steam.  Steam in a power boiler is under pressure.  You can't get that level of energy from boiling water in a pot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Water can only have so much energy before changing form from liquid to gas (steam). That energy is called the saturation point. Steam, however, can absorb much more energy and assume a state called super saturation.
Super saturated steam, or superheated steam, can reach temperatures of over 600 C (1100 F) and can set many substances ablaze or even melt some metals without losing enough energy to condense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
