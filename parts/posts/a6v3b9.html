</blockquote>
<p>Rather than tackling the specific question, I'll tackle this general idea you have, which seems to hint at a misconception.  </p>
<hr />
<p>I think it is a mistake to even think of it as differing by &quot;<em>only</em>&quot; one oxygen atom.  </p>
<p>Yes, one oxygen atom is small, but it is <em>big</em> compared to the rest of the molecule.  </p>
<p>Think of it this way - that oxygen atom is like a third of the carbon dioxide molecule!<br />
Imagine if I took a third of your DNA away, or added half-again the heat of a fire, or removed quarter of a car's wheels.<br />
Those would result in huge changes in how those things behave!  </p>
<p>With that in mind, taking away a third of a molecule seems like it very well could be a big deal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whoa, almost everyone here seems to think CO2 is somehow harmless. It is at low concentrations, but it is in fact extremely toxic at higher concentrations. It will very easily kill you if you take a few breaths of pure carbon dioxide. Not because of lack of oxygen, but because it turns your blood into soda pop, and at below around pH 6.9, large parts of your body's biochemistry begins to fail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>because CO will displace the oxygen in your blood stream and that is bad for you.   It has a greater affinity for hemoglobin than oxygen does.  CO2 does not do this.  </p>
<p>There are two equilibrium reactions of binding oxygen and becoming oxygenated hemoglobin:</p>
<p>Hb(aq)+4O2(g)⟶Hb(O2)4(aq)</p>
<p>Hb(aq)+4O2(g)⟵Hb(O2)4(aq)</p>
<p>And carbon monoxide binding equation at equilibrium:</p>
<p>Hb(aq)+4CO(g)↽−−⇀Hb(CO)4(aq)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
