		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reason: Because of WIND</p>
<p>The air likes to circulate a lot, due to numerous factors such as the Coriolis effect (earth rotation), heated air from albedo effect (dark stuff re-emits heat, rather than reflect light), mountainous terrain interacting with moisture, etc.</p>
<p>All of this air movement causes air molecules (which are so tiny on the microscopic scale that gravity isn't super duper strong) to move around and mix, hence no even layers of the atmosphere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe to a certain extent it does. My understanding is at the extreme edges of the atmosphere it is primarily hydrogen and helium. There have also been numerous cases with small basins / ponds / pits collecting heavier gasses (usually with a source emitting them) and suffocating people. However with oxygen and nitrogen being so close together on the periodic table the forces others have described dominate and keep them mixed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The molecules in gases travel at high speeds (\~1500 km/h or \~1000 mph).  Because the density is low, each molecule can travel a long way before it bumps into another gas molecule.  As a consequence, mixing of gas molecules occurs much more quickly than those in liquids.  There is some segregation of gases in the atmosphere, but it is a gradient, not a layer.  Hydrogen and helium escape from the atmosphere much more so than oxygen, nitrogen, or argon.</p>
<p>For the same reasons, gases are miscible in all proportions.  In other words, they don't segregate the way that some liquids do (like oil and water).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's not how thermodynamics works. If you mix water and alcohol, all the alcohol doesn't rise to the top...</p>
<p>The entropy (disorder) of the system is higher when the gases/liquids are mixed, so due to second law of thermodynamics, different liquids/gases will mix unless there is an enthalpic reason (some kind of force) keeping them separate</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>It just happens on such insane altitudes that we don't see the effects around sea level. MSISE-90 model of the upper atmosphere shows that at International Space Station's orbit (400 km), what little is left of the atmosphere consists mostly of atomized oxygen and helium (rather than &quot;normal&quot; oxygen and nitrogen). Pressure at such altitude is 12 orders of magnitude (i.e. trillion times) lower than at sea level. The molar weight (and thus, composition) of &quot;air&quot; starts shifting significantly from &quot;the norm&quot; only around 100-120 km from sea level.</p>
<p>You actually can separate gas mixture into components in a porous medium (such as narrow tube), where diffusional mixing is reduced to almost not being a factor. Certain people even did it with different isotopes of the same element: </p>
