		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Older movies were shot on film. Film doesn't have a &quot;resolution&quot; in the same sense as digitally shot movies, because it isn't stored as pixels. Film is just layers of chemicals on a sheet of celluloid (or nowadays some other plastic), and those chemicals change colour when exposed to light. That means a physical image of each frame is stored when the movie is shot.</p>
<p>When they digitise an old movie in HD they just take a higher resolution digital scan of the image from each frame of film. The quality of the physical image stored on film is so high that you still see an improvement in image when scanning up to 4K/8K resolutions, possibly even higher.</p>
<p>Edit: removed &quot;filmed on film&quot;. It's hard to talk about film without using the word film to mean &quot;cinema&quot; or &quot;shoot&quot; or &quot;movie&quot; because that word can mean basically anything.</p>
<p>Edit 2: To address the most common misconception I'm getting in replies to this comment: no, modern HD/4K etc scans and remasters aren't &quot;higher resolution than the originals&quot;, they are just higher resolution than the old, low res digitised versions. So your 4K Star Wars remaster isn't going to be higher resolution than the original film version shown in cinemas, but it <em>will</em> be higher resolution (and closer to the original in terms of resolution) than the old DVD version you have from back in 2004. Often the HD remastering also involves other elements like removing defects in the film, sharpening images, correcting colour, and updating VFX to suit the new resolution, which may qualify as &quot;improvements&quot; depending on how they're done and what you think of them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It’s when they are converted to digital they start to lose quality. As we get more advanced technology we will get closer to having the full resolution of the movie available to us at home.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This isn't for Back to the Future but its probably a similar process. Fascinating piece.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everybody is talking about celluloid film and resolution compared to digital but I haven't seen anyone mention yet two other factors that influence picture quality of old films  -  Film ISO and quality of lens. When shooting dark scenes with film, you have to use a film that is more sensitive and can react with less light but to accomplish this the film needs a bigger grain. This results in an image that is much grainier and there is some loss in sharpness/detail because of that. Also, lenses influence the quality of the light hitting the film and can introduce other flaws to the final image quality like softness, chromatic aberration, blurriness in the corners etc. For some of those flaws, scanning at higher resolution doesn't always result in a better image unless they scans go through some heavy post-processing which may not always improve the image. Directors &amp; cinematographers had to work with the tools (and budgets) they had and it's quite amazing what was accomplished with film over the past several decades.</p>
<p>Also, one additional thing, for xHD digital releases it depends on the print that's being digitized. If the studios can scan from the original work print which is one generation from the negative then they will get the best possible results. If they have to resort to 2nd or 3rd generation copy, the quality starts dropping. Like a photocopy of a photocopy, each resulting in a loss of detail, dynamic range, and overall quality. Analog is a pain in the ass in that sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
