		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Join us at today at 1 p.m. ET (17 UT) to ask anything about NASA's New Horizons mission! In July 2015, New Horizons became the first spacecraft to explore Pluto and its moons. Recently, the spacecraft - which is more than four billion miles from home and speeding toward interstellar space - took images of the stars Proxima Centauri and Wolf 359 from its unique vantage point in deep space. Scientists combined these images with pictures of the same stars taken near the same time from Earth, creating stereo images that instantly demonstrate the parallax effect astronomers have long used to measure distances to stars. New Horizons is humankind's farthest photographer, imaging an alien sky. Why does New Horizons &quot;see&quot; these stars in a different place in the sky than on Earth? How are these images sent back from New Horizons? How long does it take the team on the ground to send commands to the spacecraft? Where is New Horizons headed next?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I spent years waiting for New Horizons to make it to Pluto, I was so excited. I imagine it was only a miniscule fraction of how the team felt. Pluto was so much more interesting than I think 95% of people expected. </p>
<p>What is the team's feeling on possible subsurface oceans on Pluto or Charon? I don't know how to do the calculations myself but I would assume that Pluto has a bunch of tidal heating due to Charon. I never, never would have guessed we'd be considering Pluto as a candidate for life, but if it has subsurface oceans... Why not?</p>
<p>I'm grateful to the team for making this flyby happen! I can't believe what you guys achieved with Pluto alone, let alone managing to pull off the Ãšltima Thule/Arrakoth flyby. I desperately hope a third target can be found!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
