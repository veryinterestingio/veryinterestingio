		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Glaciers move through three processes - creep, basal sliding and deformation of the underlying surface.</p>
<p>Creep is where the ice flows like cookie dough. It is driven by gravity and pressure, so the deeper you go into a glacier, the faster the ice creeps. If the rate becomes too high, the glacier can suddenly crack and you end up with the glacier collapsing - this is common at the toe of a glacier in a fjord which is where icebergs are calved.</p>
<p>Basal sliding relies on water being present under the ice. Pressure can melt ice and create a thin film of water which lubricates the sheet. Also, meltwater can find its way to the bottom of the sheet during summer months, increasing the ability of the ice to slide over the bedrock - so many glaciers accelerate during the summer months. Rough terrain under the ice sheet can also increase the rate of basal sliding as it allows areas of water to form between the ice and the rock which allow ice to zip along.</p>
<p>Finally, if a glacier rolls over soft sediments, it can accelerate by deforming the sediments - they are so weak that they can be stretched and pulled by the moving ice. This is especially important if those sediments are waterlogged where they act just like the water that controls basal sliding.</p>
<p>So you can imagine a glacier rolling down a mountain over different types of rock and different roughnesses of surface - parts of the glacier will be moving faster than others, some will actually be frozen to the rocks, others will be disintegrating because they are creeping so fast. </p>
<p>Complex things.</p>
<p>I'm sure a grown-up glaciologist will be along shortly to give a proper answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the type of glacier.
Normally warm-based glaciers, ones found closer to the equator, have a thin layer of meltwater at their base caused by pressure. This allows them to slide rather easily.
Cold based glaciers usually slip and stick, as I like to think about it, or they flow through internal deformation of their aligned ice crystal layers.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are always moving downhill.    </p>
<p>When sea ice breaks off, it moves faster due to not having as much weight on the downhill side of the process.  This is why the loss of the ice sheets is so detrimental to the entire process.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By definition, a glacier is a mass of ice that moves, if not, is not a glacier but a patch of ice or snow. To obtain this movement, a glacier needs to accumulate a minimum thickness that allows it to flow downslope.
Even though there are stationery or equilibrated glaciers in the world, for example Perito Moreno Glacier which has a zero mass balance but an average speed rate of 2 m per day, they are always moving. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
