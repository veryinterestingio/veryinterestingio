<p>There are a lot of other components of a sound beyond just its pitch and volume - how fast and sharply the wave begins (attack), how long it lasts (sustain), and how quickly it ends (decay), how much noise is in the signal,  how many overlapping sound waves (harmonics) there are and where they fall in and out of phase with one another are just some of the things that go into giving a sound it's particular tonal uniqueness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When a tone is played, there are several harmonic frequencies that also play. Kinda like how a mother duck walks and her ducklings follow, the dominant frequency leads the tone (and is the one we hear and identify most) with harmonics being more subtle underneath. Different materials create different harmonic frequencies. These harmonics are what create the individual textures of the sound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So when you play a note, you're actually playing a bunch of different frequencies (&quot;harmonics&quot;) with different intensities, not just the main frequency (&quot;fundamental&quot;). The different intensities of those many frequencies give the different &quot;textures&quot; of various instruments (&quot;timbre&quot;, pronounced &quot;tamber&quot;).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A waveform (musical or otherwise) can be analyzed as a sum of sine waves.  The sound of a tuning fork is approximately a simple sine wave.  Most sounds are far more complex than that.  </p>
<p>In an idealized musical instrument, all of the sonic energy is in waves whose frequencies are multiples (‘harmonics’) of some fundamental.  The relative strengths of these component waves give a large part of the color of the sound: if the higher components are strong, the sound is ‘brilliant’, like a trumpet; if they're weak, the sound may be called ’fat’.  In a clarinet, the even multiples of the fundamental are missing.</p>
<p>Real physical instruments have harmonics that are <em>not</em> perfect multiples of the fundamental.  This is most conspicuous in a cymbal or gong, but hints of such imperfection also give a bit of spice to many other instruments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
