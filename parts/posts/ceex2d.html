<p>----</p>
<p>You don’t need math to understand this.  Here was Einstein's thought experiment.</p>
<p>Start with the Equivalence Principle (EP), which (essentially) states that acceleration and gravity are the same thing.  Einstein came up with this as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>You are in a windowless box</li>
<li>The box has a rocket attached, which is firing, so you are accelerating.</li>
<li>Because you are accelerating you feel a force on your feet.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, how can you tell the difference between the force you feel in an accelerating box and the force you feel due to gravity standing on a rock? Einstein concluded that you can't, hence the EP.  Scientists use their sciences to test the EP and so far it appears to check out.</p>
<p>Now consider this</p>
<ol>
<li>You are in a box in space that has a window</li>
<li>Someone shines a laser through the window straight across.</li>
<li>If you are not moving relative to the source, the laser beam goes straight across your box.</li>
<li>If you are moving at constant velocity relative to source, the light beam still moves in a strait line, but will contact the other wall opposite the window “lower down” towards the direction opposite of motion, since the box is moving and it takes time for light to cross your box.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s the important one</p>
<ol>
<li>If you are accelerating relative to source, the light appears to follow a curved line through your box.</li>
</ol>
<p>Go back to the EP.  Since gravity and acceleration are the same, light must curve under gravity.  Note this is NOT a proof, just a line of reasoning that points to the conclusion.  The math came next and then the experimental verification.</p>
<p>Edit</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The curvature of space and time was something that was implicated in a lot of mathematics before Einstein, so there were a lot of hints that straight things were actually curved. It took him 10 years from special to general relativity so it took a genius 10 years to sort out the implications of special relativity. Specifically, it had to do with accelerating reference frames but that is too far for a five year old explanation. It is to say, he knew something was 'up' with the situation because the problem between Newtonian calculations, Clerk's observations, and the fact that Mercury's orbit was wrong using Newtonian mechanics. It took him 10 years to solve it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The bending of light is a bit of a mis-representation of what is really the bending of space-time through which the light travels - that spacetime is bent by mass of objects.</p>
<p>But..to your question, tt was a mathematical consequence of the rest of his theory.  The model he created of how the universe worked was a set of mathematical &quot;axioms&quot; that if accepted and &quot;true&quot; (as a pedantic aside &quot;true&quot; is a tough one here as we're talking about a model, so...&quot;pretty darn good at predicting reality&quot; is better than &quot;true&quot;)  have downstream consequences - things that if they are not true indicate that axioms are false.  We have subsequently measured the bending of spacetime (and it's indeed how we find many objects far away) which has been one of many tests over the years since einstein that have further validated his theories.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it`s even more simple:</p>
<p>In 1845, Faraday discovered that many materials exhibit a weak repulsion from a magnetic field: a phenomenon he termed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamagnetism" target="_blank">diamagnetism</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday#cite_note-53" target="_blank">[53]</a></p>
<p>Faraday also discovered that the plane of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_(waves)" target="_blank">polarization</a> of linearly polarized light can be rotated by the application of an external magnetic field aligned with the direction in which the light is moving. This is now termed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_effect" target="_blank">Faraday effect</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday#cite_note-Pioneers-50" target="_blank">[50]</a> In Sept 1845 he wrote in his notebook, &quot;I have at last succeeded in <em>illuminating a magnetic curve</em> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_force" target="_blank"><em>line of force</em></a> and in <em>magnetising a</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(optics)" target="_blank"><em>ray of light</em></a>&quot;.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday#cite_note-54" target="_blank">[54]</a></p>
<p>Later on in his life, in 1862, Faraday used a spectroscope to search for a different alteration of light, the change of spectral lines by an applied magnetic field. The equipment available to him was, however, insufficient for a definite determination of spectral change. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Zeeman" target="_blank">Pieter Zeeman</a> later used an improved apparatus to study the same phenomenon, publishing his results in 1897 and receiving the 1902 Nobel Prize in Physics for his success. In both his 1897 paper<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday#cite_note-55" target="_blank">[55]</a> and his Nobel acceptance speech,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday#cite_note-56" target="_blank">[56]</a> Zeeman made reference to Faraday's work.</p>
