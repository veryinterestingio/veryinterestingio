		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Babies and toddlers have the same growing pains for both their body and their developing minds.</p>
<p>Their perception of the pain may be different from when they are older. In general, they will be more fussy and easily irritated, sleep and eat poorly, or just cry for no reason. For some babies and their unfortunate parents, these symptoms are not too different from the everyday experience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>who says they don't? Truth is they do experience growing pains, but seeing as they are infants, they usually express this through crying, being fussy, sleeping poorly, etc. and most adults overlook this because well.. infants do that a lot anyways.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Babies grow in spurts, sometimes growing multiple centimeters in a day! Then they have periods of stasis (no significant growth). In these growing periods they are VERY fussy.</p>
<p>EDIT: &quot;Dr. Lampl measured thirty babies daily and found that babies grew  between 0.5 and 1.65cm in one day, between two to twenty-eight days of  no growth. These growth spurts changed their sleeping patterns, inciting  tantrums as well as insatiable hunger. &quot; <a href="http://sites.nd.edu/emily-clarke/2019/12/06/chapter-8/" target="_blank"><a href="http://sites.nd.edu/emily-clarke/2019/12/06/chapter-8/" target="_blank">http://sites.nd.edu/emily-clarke/2019/12/06/chapter-8/</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s a documentary on Netflix called “Babies” where someone explains this. She did a case study where she would measure babies every day and ask the parents for any notable behaviors or what they did that day. </p>
<p>She came to understand that babies grow one to two* centimeters in one day, not over time. The parents would report that the babies were particularly fussy or throwing tantrums on those days, so they actually do react. We just don’t always understand why since they can’t talk yet.</p>
<p>Edit: *previously said several centimeters but it’s not quite that extreme. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajhb.1310050607" target="_blank">Here’s a link</a> to the study if anyone is interested.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This might be helpful. I have Ankylosing Spondylitis. Im my patient group, a lot of us had what doctors called “growing pains” but were actually misdiagnosed symptoms of juvenile arthritis, that after a while turned into full blown Ankylosing Spondylitis. So if your kid is complaining, take it seriously, the earlier the diagnosis the better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
