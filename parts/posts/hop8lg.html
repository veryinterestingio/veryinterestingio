		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so what I am trying to understand is,  the &quot;&quot;WHY&quot;&quot; behind this phenomenon. You see when I am playing chess online they are days when I perform really good and my average rating increases and the very next day I don't perform that well and my rating falls to where it was so i tend to play around certain average rating. Now I can understand this because in this case that &quot;mean&quot; that &quot;average&quot; corresponds to my skill level and by studying the game,  and investing more time in it I can Increase that average bar. But events of chance like coin toss, why do they tend to follow this trend? WHY is it that number of head approach number of tails over time, since every flip is independent why we get more tails after 500, 1000 or 10000 flips to even out the heads. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And also, is this regression towards mean also the reason behind the almost same number of males and females in a population?</p></div></div>

<p>Trained actuary here.  Eli5: It doesn't.  Not in the way you are thinking, at any rate.</p>
<p>Each flip is independent of all the flips that came before.</p>
<p>Let's say you had a lucky streak and tossed 20 out of 20 heads.  Neato!  The next flip is still just a 50/50 shot.</p>
<p>Think about that for a minute.  This means that the 20 heads &quot;advantage&quot; is going to persist.  If we started with that advantage and you asked me what I would expect after 20 more flips, I would say 30 heads and 10 tails, total.  So instead of 100% heads, you now only have 75% heads.</p>
<p>Now imagine we do this 1 million times.  At the end I would expect 20 more heads than tails.  Out of a million.  Which just doesn't really seem like all that much, and is practically 50% again, and *that* is why it seems like it regresses.  </p>
<p>The absolute numbers do not, but the percentage does.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's some math describing coin flips. </p>
<p>I've done 9 flips. All of them have been. Heads. </p>
<p>100% of them have been heads. (Note that its still a 50% chance for each flip that 100% is just what <em>has</em> happened. Don't fall into the gamblers fallacy)</p>
<p>I flip again and get heads.</p>
<p>Still 100% heads the percent didn't even change. No farther or closer to the mean. </p>
<p>I flip again that means that now. 91% of my flips have been heads. It's now 9% closer to the mean.</p>
<p>So what happens if my next flip is heads? That's 12 flips 11 of which are heads. That's now 91.6% to get heads. I only moved .6% farther from the mean. </p>
<p>But what if that 12th flip was tails? It's now only 83% tails. That's 8% closer to the mean. </p>
<p>The farther from the mean you get the more and more of an effect values that bring you closer to it will have. As for why? Uh...math. It's a relationship we have observed.</p>
<p>We don't get more or less values that bring us closer to the mean. It's just that the same number of values will have a larger apparent effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One way to look at it is that the more trials you do, the more 'watered down' past history becomes.</p>
<p>So let's say you've flipped 100 coins and came up with 60 heads (60% heads). Now you flip 900 more coins. If you get the expected result - 450 heads - then you'd end up with 510 heads out of 1000 coins (51% heads).</p>
<p>What you're thinking about is the Gambler's Fallacy - the notion that past history will 'balance' in the future.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Assuming a fair coin -- you don't.  Each flip always has a 50% chance of being heads or tails.  But the larger the sample size, the less likely it is that the ratio of heads/tails will be far apart from 50%.  That's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers</a> .</p>
<p>Intuitively -- if you flip a coin 5 times there's about a 3% chance of getting all heads or tails (<code>0.5 ^ 5 ~= 0.03</code>).  If you flip a coin 10 times there's only a .01% chance of getting all heads or tails (<code>0.5 ^ 10 ~- 0.0001</code>).  If you flip a coin 50 times it's basically impossible to get all heads or tails (<code>0.5 ^ 50 ~= 10^-16</code>).</p>
<p>If you know the coin is fair, past results have no influence on the future.  If you flip the coin 10 times and get all heads, it's no more or less likely to happen again in the next 10 flips.  It tends to &quot;regress to the mean&quot; in the long run because <em>the most likely result</em> for any set of N flips is to have the same number of heads and tails.</p>

<p>With something like Elo rating it's different.  Let's assume you &quot;really&quot; should have a rating of 2000.  Meaning that if you play someone else with a rating of 2000 you should have a 50% chance to win.  (We'll ignore things like going first having an advantage, etc.)</p>
<p>But let's say you play a bunch of games at that rating and get lucky and win 4 or 5 in a row.  Now you're rated at 2100, but your actual skill level hasn't changed.  You start getting matched up against players at 2100 -- but most of those players are better than you, so maybe you only have a 40% chance to win.  More likely than not you'll lose more than you win until you drop back down close to 2000 (or whatever rating causes you to have a 50% win rate).  The higher your rating goes compared to your actual skill level, the more pronounced that effect will be.  And the same thing will happen in reverse if you get unlucky and lose a bunch of games and your rating goes down.</p>
<p>In a situation like that, the &quot;coin landing on heads&quot; (winning a game) actually makes future &quot;heads&quot; results less likely.  At least if assuming a fixed skill level for the player.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a mathematical idea in statistics and probability theory called the central limit theorem (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem</a>). According to this rule, if you flip a coin many times, the results will approach the shape of a bell curve (a normal distribution). In the limit of an infinite number of coin flips, the shape of this curve will mean that the most likely outcome when you flip a coin infinitely many times will be getting an equal number of heads and tails. </p>
<p>I would recommend watching this video about a Galton board (<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6YDHBFVIvIs" target="_blank">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6YDHBFVIvIs</a>). You can imagine the heads or tails outcome of a coin flip as being like whether a bead moves to the left or right one space on a Galton board. If you drop a single bead down a very long board, this is like flipping a coin many times. You can see directly from the way that the Galton board works that most likely thing that will happen is that the bead will land in the middle space at the bottom. This means that the most likely outcome for many coin flips will be getting an equal number of heads and tails (like having an equal number of left and right movements for a falling bead).</p>
<p>For the second part of your question: I think that this is the result of something in population genetics called Fisher’s principle (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_principle" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_principle</a>). The idea is just that any bias that led certain chromosome combinations like XX to be more prevalent than others like XY would tend to lead to reproductive differences between sexes that eventually would lead the bias to cancel out. Any population that follows normal laws of genetics and begins at some combination other than an equal number of XX and XY individuals should eventually end up at an equal number of XX and XY individuals after many generations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
