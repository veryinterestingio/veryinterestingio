<p>On an anthropological level, if 6-fingered people were more highly preferred that 5-fingered ones, then the vast majority of the population would have it, but apparently humanity didn't find it a desirable trait.</p>
<p>Edit: Used 'than' instead of 'then'. It's been fixed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One reason is the 6th finger seldom grows in a useful manner and is often extraneous. Have more than 5 fingers (for people) is called polydactylism and there are many types. You're envisioning a fully-functional Ulner Polydactyly, but other forms are not nearly as useful/not useful at all. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I very often see people get confused about three different aspects of a trait (or allele if we're talking about a single gene) that are not inherently connected to each other.</p>
<ol>
<li>The first is what we call the inheritance system for a trait.  This can include things like a trait being dominant or recessive, though many traits show other patterns too.  In the case of the trait you mention, six fingers are dominant over five, meaning you only need to inherit one copy of this gene from one of your parents to have six fingers.</li>
<li>Another aspect is a trait's <em>current</em> frequency in the population (not to be confused with its predicted future frequency).  This can range anywhere from being unique to a single individual to being present in all individuals (what we call &quot;fixed&quot;).  A trait's frequency will naturally fluctuate over time just due to random chance, and if you wait long enough traits can and do become either lost forever or fixed just by chance too.  However, a trait's frequency in a population can also be influenced by natural selection, which leads us to</li>
<li>The final aspect to consider is the selective benefit a trait gives to the individuals that have it.  Basically, what effect (positive or negative) does this trait have on the reproductive success of individuals, <em>relative to other equivalent traits</em>.  Generally speaking, we expect that beneficial traits will spread (i.e., increase in frequency), since their owners have higher reproductive success, and that detrimental traits will decrease in frequency over time.  However, this isn't guaranteed; if the difference in success between two traits is pretty minimal, then random chance will still be the main factor that determines how their population frequencies change.</li>
</ol>
<p>So the point here is that all three of these categories are independent.  For example, you can have a recent mutation that is recessive, starts out at a low frequency, and is highly beneficial.  In this same scenario, if there are only two options then the other trait is dominant and present at high frequency, but is detrimental relative to the new mutation.  A trait can fit into any possible combination of these three aspects at any given time.  So in the case of the six-fingered trait you ask about, we can say that this trait has a dominant inheritance system (at least over the most common five-fingered trait), that it is currently at low frequency in the population, and while we don't know inherently if it has a benefit or penalty to reproductive success, I would guess that it probably is fairly neutral.  This likely means that the frequency of six-fingered people more or less fluctuates randomly, though I could be wrong about that since I'm not sure exactly what the reality is with respect to natural selection for this trait.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
