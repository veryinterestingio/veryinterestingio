		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People are designed to hear speech, people having conversations, especially well. Because you are so sensitive to the sound of people’s voices you are also really sensitive to any noise at the same frequency. Nails on a chalk board happen to be at the same frequency as people talking, but sound nothing like it. So it really hurts your brain to try and process it, but equally because you are so sensitive to it, you can’t ignore it.</p>
<p>Imagine it’s like the ‘<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley" target="_blank">uncanny valley</a>’ but for sound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Researchers have found the &quot;nails on a chalkboard&quot; to have the frequency range of between 2,000 and 4,000 Hz — which is the same range as human speech. This ear-splitting noise has the same frequency as that of a human scream, indicating that these sounds are tied to survival. Amazingly, when these frequencies were filtered out and the sound replayed, people have no trouble listening to the sound.</p>
<p>Edit: guys apparently I have my frequency hertzs wrong.</p>
<p>Edit2: ok found it. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/healthmain/screech-sounds-which-are-worse-nails-chalkboard-1C6541925" target="_blank">&quot;Screams also have energy in the same frequency band, but its concentration is less.&quot;</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
