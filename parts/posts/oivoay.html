		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those “octane ratings” denote the knock resistance of the fuel.  A higher number means greater knock resistance.</p>
<p>Engine “knock” is when the fuel/air mixture ignites prematurely.  The piston compresses and this heats the mixture up dramatically.  In high compression engines this can be so dramatic that the mixture ignites spontaneously - and early.  This is bad for many reasons, sapping power and damaging the engine.</p>
<p>So if you have a high compression engine, you need the good stuff.  There’s no benefit to 91 octane in a low compression engine.</p>
<p>The different refineries sometimes also put various additives and surfactants in their “premium” blends so the stuff is a little different between stations of different brands.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have stated, octane is the resistance for the gas to self ignite. For gas engines, the fuel is injected before the compression stroke (where the piston moves up and compress the mixture) so there is a possibility that some fuel ignites before the the spark plug fires. This is known as knock or pre-detonation and higher octane is more resistant to it. Over time, this knock will damage your engine. </p>
<p>Modern engines are smart and can pull timing (let the spark plug fire off sooner) or adjust valve timing when sensors detect that there is knock. That being said, if a car requires premium, you should use it as the engine was not designed for lower octane gas. If premium is recommended, you don't have to use premium and the engine is designed for regular gas but you get more performance and better fuel economy if you use premium. If the engine is designed for regular you're basically wasting money unless there are very specific issues you're having with knock.</p>
<p>As for gas quality, most gas in a city or region uses the same base gasoline since there aren't that many refineries in a given area. What makes the gas different is the additive package that is added to it. To get the best gasoline, get gas that is certified as Top Tier (<a href="https://www.toptiergas.com/licensed-brands/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.toptiergas.com/licensed-brands/" target="_blank">https://www.toptiergas.com/licensed-brands/</a></a>). This was created by several automakers and specify detergency standards for the fuels and apply to all grades (so you don't need to get premium to get extra detergents). Gasoline has a shelf life too so ideally you should get it from a busy station (the Costco near us has trucks coming daily and that's where I go)</p>
<p>TL;DR Octane is how well gas resists preignition and higher grades are only useful for cars that specifically ask for it, get good quality gas from a busy station.</p>
<p>Edit: I just want to clarify that I meant detonation not pre-detonation. I had pre-ignition in my mind but that is different from detonation or knocking. Thanks to u/followvirgil for pointing this out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The higher the octane number, the harder the fuel is to explode. Higher performance engines force more air into the piston along with the fuel. This makes the explosion more powerful, but also increases the amount of pressure inside the piston prior to the explosion. Gasoline can explode from pressure alone, so this extra pressure could cause the gasoline to explode prematurely which can potentially break the engine.</p>
<p>They add chemicals to the gas that make it harder to explode, so that way it will only explode intentionally when there is a spark and not unintentionally from pressure. The octane rating is how much of these chemicals they add. The higher the number the more pressure you can safely put the fuel under without a premature detonation. That is why you should never use fuel that is below the recommended octane for your engine, but there is no advantage to putting a higher octane fuel than your car requires.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a ton of well-meaning but somewhat misleading advice here; especially that advice that says modern cars accommodate for knock.  While that's technically true, it's missing the point completely.</p>
<p>Octane is added to fuel to retard the ignition of fuel, during compression, before the spark plug sparks.  High pressure could lead to the fuel igniting in the combustion chamber in high-compression engines before the spark plug fires.  This can lead to all sorts of undesirable effects.</p>
<p>Modern engines can detect this preignition and change the timing on the fly to handle it, but fuel economy, power, and engine life will all suffer because of it.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that you need to put fuel in that the manual recommends.  A car that is engineered for 87 won't perform any better with 91 or 92 and you're just wasting money.  A car that needs 91 or 92 will struggle with 87 even though the computer will unduly exert the mechanical devices to accommodate the preignition.</p>
<p>89 is seemingly useless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Shell and Mobil gas station owner up in Canada here. Generally the bronze/regular/87 gas from any station is gonna be pretty much the same for your everyday cars. The difference comes in the premium blends. Shells Vpower has no Ethanol and has a bunch of additives to 'clean' your engine as it runs. Same thing for Mobil 91, Ultra 94 etc. Check your car manual and stick to whatever fuel grade it tells you. Putting Ultra 94 in an old Dodge Caravan is not gonna magically clean your engine and make it go fast, but putting 87 in your Ferrari 488 is gonna be a problem. Shell is probably the best overall, but it depends on your cars needs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
