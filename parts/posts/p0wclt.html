Since it’s not like I feel tired for the rest of my life after missing a night’s sleep, after a few days of good sleep I’m back to normal.</a>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read a science article a while back about this. If I can find it again I'll post it here. The gist of it was that our brains sort of 'wash themselves' while we're sleeping. If you don't sleep long enough, your brain isn't squeaky clean the next day. This not only impacts your immediate health the day after a bad sleep, but can also result in long-term damage if poor sleep is a chronic habit. Just like there's no point in washing dishes that are already clean, you can't pregame sleep and expect your brain to cooperate. Similarly, if you ran dishes for a half-cycle every time you put them in the dishwasher, those plates are gonna be gross.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That was what they thought until recently at least. New research suggests you can catch up on lost sleep. You can heal your brain once you get into REM sleep again, it may take a long time depending on big your deficit is to catch up to but it's definitely possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's like being dehydrated. You can't drink more water to make up for being dehydrated in the past. At some point you are just hydrated again...anything more doesn't really help and it doesn't change that you were dehydrated.</p>
<p>You can extend this analogy to pre-drinking. Yes, you can absolutely make sure you have adequate intake before you do something strenuous, but there is a limit. At some point you are just hydrated. If you tried to drink 8 gallons then go without for 72 hours you'd run into issues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve answered this question before.  But here goes.</p>
<p>Don’t muddle together long term sleep deprivation with short term.  That’s where the confusion sets in.  </p>
<p>We don’t truly understand exactly why we need sleep.  But we know that sleep is important for clearing out metabolic waste in the brain and hormone regulation, one of the most important being cortisol, or for the purpose of this discussion, stress.  </p>
<p>In the short term, say a single poor nights sleep, you’ll be tired the next day as your body is attempting to tell you to “fix” the problem.  Sleeping extra the next night will correct the problem.  Maybe even just a normal full nights rest will fix it without extra sleep.  </p>
<p>Now say it’s been a year and you have slept 5 hours a night ever day.  This does permanent damage down to the cellular level.  Your body has been unable to properly regulate itself because you have disrupted a key process.  No amount of extra sleep will fix it.  We have found studies relate this type of behavior with early dementia and various chronic diseases.  </p>
<p>True ELI5:  in the short term you can make up for sleep loss, in the long term the damage is already done and is beyond just sleeping more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
