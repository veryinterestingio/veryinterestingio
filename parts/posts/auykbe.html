		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two trucks, 1 truck contains 1000kg of nails and the other 1000kg of cotton assuming that the trucks are identical with both their drivers being the same person(also run in then same speed),and they have the same starting point and end point .if the two trucks have a race on a football field. Which one will come first?</p>
<p>So my science teacher asked the whole class this question and all of our class answered that the two   trucks would have a tie(since all of their features are identical).</p>
<p>To our surprise our teacher answered that the 1000kg of cotton would be the first them the 1000kg of nails would catch up. Our teacher then asked us why would the cotton win, so my classmates made some hypothesis why the cotton would win. Like the truck with the 1000kg nails on which the nails were bouncing up and down the truck then one of the nails went through the engine which caused the truck to explode or one the other truck was made of cotton. His answer to our hypothesis was that it was wrong since we were making assumptions since there were  parts that was not in his given question</p>
<p>My question is that does the cotton, the nails or both win?</p>
<p>(I really have no idea on why the answer is cotton. For me I strongly believe that the answer is both. The teacher even called us “slow” because we could not explain why the cotton would win.)sorry for the bad grammar</p></div></div>

<p>If you want to screw with him, ask what the speed is.  Engine size also matters, as does the configuration of the truck bed.  Is it segmented?  Can the nails move around?  Is the cotton compressed?  I would bet that the answer would vary considerably with a traditional engine vs an electric truck.  He can say it doesn't matter all he wants, but if he is going to play games, he needs to give you more info.</p>
<p>With the information you have, and under the assumption that you aren't in university, I'd argue that &quot;same time&quot; is a fairly safe answer.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: Unless he's being completely ridiculous and going with something like &quot;the cotton would all blow out of the truck bed as the truck accelerates&quot; which is an assumption you can't make (shaped of truck bed) from the information given.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My comment is that he should have framed the question in an answerable way.  Or at least prompted you all to ask the questions you needed to.  The point of being a teacher is not too show superiority over your students but to help them to, hopefully, exceed your ability.</p>
<p>For what the question is worth, I've heard it in a different form which is: what weighs more, a ton of bricks or a ton of feathers.  And of course the answer is neither, they weigh the same.  And the answer to your teacher's question is that, all else being equal, the trucks would tie the race.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A thought I'm playing with is that the two trucks would be different in that the load is going to shift to the back of the truck as it starts driving, and that more dense load (nails) is going to shift more mass because it has more room to shift into.</p>
<p>Though I'm not 100% sure whether shifting load actually affects the momentum of the truck. I do know that load shifting to the front of the truck extends your breaking time, so the inverse would suggest that load shifting to the back of the truck would lower your acceleration.</p>
<p>If I'm right about this then that would imply that the truck full of nails is going to accelerate slower and thus take longer to reach the finish line. And after the finish line it'll hold on to its momentum longer (so take longer to break).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the trucks start at the same time, from the same place, and travel with the same velocity (speed and direction) then they both arrive at the end point at the same time.</p>
<p>The only difference in the trucks is their cargo. This data is irrelevant, assuming the trucks have the same velocity. It's not a question of inertia, drag, air resistance etc. Even if we assume those things are different, your teacher stated they are moving at the same speed. (Even if the cotton has more drag, lets say, it doesn't matter. If the speed is the same, then it is the same. Force, inertia, mass, density are irrelevant.)</p>
<p>Simple Newtonian physics.</p>

<p>Your teacher is either leaving something out, or you are. Or, your teacher is just plain wrong. It happens!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
