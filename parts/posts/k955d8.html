		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With the technology of today (ease of internet access, video medicine, and smart watches, etc), Why is there an explicit &quot;end of Phase 3 Trials&quot;? Shouldn't it just be &quot;begin Phase 3a&quot; at whatever rate the vaccine can be produced, and include placebos, continue to add new phase 3a patients at the dose production rate. When the number of cases in the placebo group have become sufficient to determine efficacy and the efficacy is good move to phase 3b, just continue administering doses of the real vaccine and no more placebo, could we have been at about 10 million people vaccinated by now? When your confidence reaches a certain level, discontinue asymptomatic monitoring that requires one-to-one medical staff, and discontinue smart watch requirements, but encourage patients to continue log data if they wish.  Also reduce the patient acceptance requirements.  For this particular incident, the explicit dividing line between Phase 3 and rollout is costing 1000-2000 lives a day.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The consent process for an approved vaccine is different from clinical trial consent. One is for an experimental product and volunteers consent to taking on this risk versus a product that has had regulatory review and had a full data analysis for safety and efficacy based on the phase 1-3 trials. Also there is the issue of once it’s approved, ideally doses should be distributed equitably and effectively ie in trials they often go to young healthy volunteers whereas once approved many countries are prioritizing elderly/nursing homes etc. There is some flexibility in trial designs in some cases eg combined phase 1/2 trials and open label extensions for some pharmaceuticals but the process of regulatory approval is a safety mechanism to ensure unsafe products aren’t distributed to 1000s of people</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One reason is that, statistically speaking, a trial needs a beginning and an end, and a pre-established set of rules to follow.</p>
<p><em>P</em>-value hacking is a big problem in science, and an easy way to <em>P</em>-value hack is by changing these things after a study begins (eg. &quot;with 1000 extra people we can probably achieve the safety threshold&quot;--huge error, you would need to redo the study from the beginning with a larger sample size).</p>
<p>Because of this, there is always going to be an official end to a trial. If your trial passes according to its original design and criteria, things can begin to move forwards quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Giving the vaccine to millions before you tested the safety with (relatively) smaller groups is reckless.</p>
<p>The companies already ramped up production as much as they could. Starting large-scale vaccination only after the end of phase III trials didn't slow production. At best you could have given the vaccine to millions of people maybe a month earlier - but you don't want to do that before knowing more about the safety. By mid January we would be at the same number of vaccinated people either way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Because a report has to be delivered to the regulators.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>could we have been at about 10 million people vaccinated by now?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those 10 million people could have long term side effects because you didnt wait for results long enough.</p>
<p>Yes confidence can be phased, and in places it is.  There are &quot;conditional approvals&quot; and stuff like that.  Ultimately the reason is simply that if you rush stuff then you increase risk of catastrophe.  You are talking about rushing stuff.  But, if you actually think you have a way to improve medical expediency without increased risk then you should become a professional and push your idea forward.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>But you're sort of right, the study is continuing. The company can ask (with your permission) to follow everyone for years after and do. The FDA does it too. As a &quot;post-market&quot; analysis</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
