		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just a quick reminder that males have a spongy urethra and this particular structure creates a spiral urine stream which expels urine at higher speeds and this functions as a way to remove obstruction, like sperm in this case. Females do not have this structure and why there's a higher incidences of UTI's for females vs. males.</p>
<p>After sex, you have a combination of foreign objects there such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>sperm</li>
<li>lubrication</li>
<li>vaginal fluids</li>
<li>spermicide</li>
</ul>
<p>Which clogs up the very tip and, in the case of sperm, parts of the shaft.</p>
<p>This is why it's always good for men (and women) to pee (and wash off) after sex because it cleans, well, everything.</p>
<p>The same streams can happen at any time throughout the day but for similar reasons: basic blockage in the tunnel, so to speak.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most likely culprit is  drop of semen.  It can dry and glue parts of the opening distorting the flow.</p>
<p>The guys starts peeing expecting it to flow straight like always, and instead shoots off in a weird direction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aside from the obstructions mentioned by others, also attempting to pee with erection or after a prolonged erection can cause this just because the head is engorged with blood, thus changing the overall shape of the opening. A bit like lightly squeezing the end of a straw while trying to spray water through it. The water isn't prevented from coming out, but it definitely comes out in a significantly different spread!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
