		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water is much denser than air, so light doesn’t bend as much going from water into your eye. This means your eyes can’t focus when in contact with water. Using goggles means you have air in contact with your eyes so they work as normal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water and air have something called an <em>index of refraction</em> that causes light to bend when it translations between those substances.</p>
<p>This is why images are distorted when you look from air into water, with a smooth surface this causes stuff to look like it’s in a different location, but with a choppy surface this causes an image to be totally scattered or broken up which is why you can see into still water, but moving water is difficult or impossible to see into from the air. </p>
<p>Your eyes ability to focus is based on the transition between the air and the material of your eye. This transition affects the direction of light, but does it in a way your eyes use to their advantage to focus and understand the image they’re seeing.</p>
<p>The transition between water and the material of your eye will also affect the direction of light but very differently, and the shape of the lens in your eye is not suited to focusing under those conditions.</p>
<p>The transition between air and water <em>when it’s through swimming goggles</em> does affect the direction of the light but because the swim goggles are a flat surface, any distortions to the light are uniform causing slight magnification or other distortions to your vision, but mostly allowing for a clear image.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
