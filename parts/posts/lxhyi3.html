And throughout your life individual cells undergo mutations that may of may not be passed down to other cells. Apoptosis prevents most from being passed down to other cells. By the end of your life it is possible to sequence a cell from your left hand and a cell from your right hand and get very very close but ever so slightly different sequences.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok.</p>
<p>This is really both a population biology, and a systems biology question, and it has to be broken apart as such. Here is a rough order estimate that will get you most of the way to whatever it is you need. Flame me if I am off by 50%, I dont care, but this is experience talking. Much of this data comes from sequencing, life science degrees, systems biology, bioinformatics, and most importantly Personal genomics and several discussion with the director of George Mason Systems Biology.</p>
<p>Back of envelope:</p>
<p>3BB. Human beings have around 3 billion base pairs</p>
<p>25k. This is encoding about 25000-30,000 &quot;Genes&quot;</p>
<p>This is segmented onto 23 pairs of chromosomes # 1-22 and X/Y</p>
<p>750MM. A quarter of that is coding and regulatory  (750 MM bp), the rest non-coding.</p>
<p>10k. Now up to half (10000) of those coded genes are completely necessary, untouchable, &quot;unmutated&quot;, conserved to a very high degree, and the fetus will stop development if they are changed in any way, so then those implantations fail out and mom will miscarry (up to 20% of the time). This is no ones fault. If you, as a budding little promising zygote, cant put a phosphate on a glucose molecule with hexokinase, you will not make it in this world. You absorbed nutrient of your placenta until you got to 128 cells, then it was too far a journey for diffucion. Same situation is for neurotransmitters, receptor proteins, cell cycle kinases, etc. There are many of those that you just can't change, and survive development. Some result in putting off the death drama, like lysosomal storage disorders, where a lack of the ability to take a sugar molecule of a brain protein leads to that now useless thing being shunted into a neuronal storage granule, until arund 2-3 years, when the child perishes. Be compassionate. All of us know these people.</p>
<ol>
<li>Now there are changes in the other half of the genome with varying effect. For the remainder, we are talking about involvement of 7500 &quot;rare&quot; heritable genomic disorders. Gp investigate NORD for more info. Blindness, deafness, ALS, charcot marie tooth syndrome, Alpha-1 Antitrypsin disorder. Many of them. Mess with those and you have a disorder, if not a disease. Glass bones, inability to taste cilantro, we are legion.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let's call mutations &quot;SNPs&quot;, or single nucleotide polymorphisms; changes. Half of the rare diseases are SNP related, half are multiple sites involved. We dont know a lot of those.</p>
<ol>
<li>Last, people are actually mosaic. A person has at any moment 5-25 genomes in them, from localized cellular mutation. The changes are slight, but hey, one of them goes awry like cyclin dependent kinase 1, and you have a tumor since you cant control cell division in that tissue anymore. We hope that your killer T cells keep on cleaning up and seeing them. Then again, some SNPs are escape mutants without the receptors that TNK cells need.</li>
</ol>
<p>So. What are the population numbers you ask?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Average people carry about 3-10000 SNPs in their 3 B bp genome. This is still only a vanishing part of who we are as a genome, 0.013 parts per thousand changed. We are way over 99% alike one another, changes and all. of those 5000 changes, over half are silent, non-deleterious changes. I have over 5k of those. We dont worry about them. They dont do anything. Look in your personal sequence file, find the (=). They are equivalent, silent, immaterial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then about 2-4000 changes are &quot;likely pathogenic&quot;, where the SNP change results in a change in the protein of the gene, a charge change in it, a folding problem, a premature read stop. However, modern medicine is only up to knowing what a fraction of the genes do, much less correlating the changes to a diseases causally or with Pearson's R or some such. Currently about 25% of genetic diseases are mapped to a polymorphism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now at the last, if you are talking about &quot;mutations&quot;, that is, SNPs, probably pathogenic, non-benign, and mapped to a disease or metabolic pathway, then the answer for a regular person is about a HUNDRED. I have about 45 of these. This is from sequenced human beings at INOVA, northern Virginia where they are getting the exome of every baby, rather than doing heel sticks for PKU, Down's trisomy,  etc. Everyone has them, no one is perfectly functional at the genomic level. There are 25k bell curves of enzyme function in pop bio to eventually look at. We are the sum of all of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now half of those changes are in only one copy, or yield to us a &quot;carrier&quot; status. You have one bad hit, the other is fine. You are &quot;heterozygous&quot;. Bless the sexual reproduction, we have multiple copies of almost everything! These disorders just do not show up. The &quot;incidence&quot; of the change can be up to 5-10 % of the population. Rare diseases have under 2% incidence? However, if 48% of the populace carries a SNP, is that a variant? Thoughts. I carry SNPs that produce pathogenesis for 45 genes. Better than average but who wants 45 damages? Luckily more than half of these are recessive. </p>
</li>
<li>I have only informatically battered down about 22 of SNPs that cause some concern. Inosine metabolism, glutamate turnover, etc. You can lose yourself in Pubmed on this stuff. Thankfully, most of these changes result in enzyme activity being dropped by only 5-30%. Functionally, they have no perceptible effect, physiologically,  that a practicing MD would call  &quot;disease&quot;. Will you be an olympic athlete? Sorry, VO2 max is limited to 78% because your lung neutrophil elastase is changed and unregulated by serpins, and now your alveoli have less surface area. Go take a spiromoter reading and get back on your bike. Will you be Einstein? No, of the 10k genes it takes to make a brain, you have 4 changes that impact catecholamine synthesis. Sorry. You have a good spleen though, that only took 5200 genes to make and the organ is unhit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you are down to the very last category, which I think is what you are actually asking. For those persons who carry a deleterious mutation, a dominant SNP, which then results in disease, who are they and how many? Now we are talking about 5-10% of humanity carrying some form disease. Of my 5k variations, 2 are in this category. One is metabolic for which a protein can be taken be needle, one is structural for which there is no cure. Both of them result in 40% activity for that pathway. There are others that result in 25% that I can augment with nutritional support, hacking myself. </p>
<p>I live for the day when personal genomics makes medicine personal, for when genetics is not eugenics, for when the natural variation is treatable if pathogenic, and left alone if not. We are all humanity, we are every color. Your ability to metabolize alcohol better than me does not make you better or worse. We can be grateful for the math that aspergers has brought us, the violin of Paganini who could not connect two lysine molecules correctly to make collagen, so his fingers were extra flexible. This is who we are, a group of adventurers. We can work on crispr genetic therapy to fix beta thalassemia, and clotting disorders, and many of the above where a SNP has caused loss of function. We can work on situations wehre a bad protein builds up and gives you cirrhosis, with antisense RNA technology.</p>
<p>Now let me extend the last point. You may ask yourself, of, if I have 75 SNPs to worry over, they make me different by a fraction of a percent, and those genes control stuff like depression, ambulation, height, whatever. Is there anyone like me? Add up the chance of having each SNP at each position, for all your copies. What is the chance someone else has this &quot;signature&quot;? My answer is, you would need 50X the current poulation of the planet, to find a single person who has that set of SNPs or mutations. Even your brother carries half the SNPs you do.</p>
<p>All of us are unique. That's the statistical fact.</p>
<p>Thanks. Best of luck.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>So everyone has them, probably a couple thousand per cell and old people have more than young people.</p>
<p>Which is why having an old father puts you at higher risk of borth defect.</p>
<p>EDIT: GUYS, I GOT IT WRONG! It's 10-100 mutations per GENERATION! Each cells ends up with 10-100 mutations in a lifetime, not each cell division!!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We tend to separate inheritable mutations - called 'germline' mutations - from non-inheritable mutations - called 'somatic' mutations. The mutation rate varies greatly between tissues. A large part of this is down to different rates of cell division, but that's far from the only factor. </p>
<p>The germline mutation rate is well documented, since we can look at genetic differences between parent and child to calculate this. It's around <a href="https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/257350" target="_blank">0.5x10^-9 per base pair per year</a>. We have about 3 billion base pairs, so that works out to about 1.5 inheritable mutations a year. </p>
<p>The overall somatic mutation rate in humans is a bit debatable, since to accurately measure it you'd need a constant stream of DNA samples from the whole body, due to different tissues being under very different pressures and environments. However, the best estimate I've found is about <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046202318303827#b0075" target="_blank">2 mutations per cell division for every 100 million basepairs</a>. That's roughly 15 mutations with every division. This number is likely to be rather rough, but it's probably a good ballpark.</p>
<p>It's difficult to say how fast, on average, we make new cells over our whole body. You often hear the factoid that we replace our bodies every 7 years, but that's a number that seems to have been pulled out of thin air. Most of our body replaces itself in under a year (<a href="http://book.bionumbers.org/how-quickly-do-different-cells-in-the-body-replace-themselves/" target="_blank">Source</a>) . Fat, bones, and heart muscle can take closer to 10 years, and nerves, lens cells, and oocytes (egg cells) are rarely replaced. Let's go for a ballpark figure of around a year on average, though, for all the cells. This is almost certainly incorrect, but it's also likely in the right order of magnitude. Perhaps someone else will feel industrious enough to calculate a more accurate average based on the relative number of cells in each category.</p>
<p>We have about <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/number-of-cells-in-body#:~:text=Humans%20are%20complex%20organisms%20made,Written%20out%2C%20that's%2030%2C000%2C000%2C000%2C000!" target="_blank">30 trillion</a> cells (3x10^13) in our bodies, replacing themselves roughly each year. This give us a ballpark of around 500 trillion mutations a year. </p>
<p>If you're wondering why we don't have cancer of the everything all the time, it's a combination of many of those mutations being 'null' mutations - ie they have no effect. Those that do have an effect overwelmingly tend to be harmful in that the cell just doesn't function and dies. Those very very few that have cancerous potential are, by and large, immediately destroyed - either by a cell's own security features causing it to self-destruct, or by our immune system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
