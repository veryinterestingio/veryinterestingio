		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The same way municipalities everywhere deal with their trash:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Bury most of it.  Landfills are used on islands, just like anywhere else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Burn some of it.  Some islands build trash-to-power incinerators.</p>
</li>
<li>Ship some of it to another place.  For HAZMAT and valuable reclaimable materials, it makes economic sense to send these materials to a remote processing location.</li>

Space is not a problem on remote islands unless you're talking about super-small islands like Nauru, and when it's that small the scale becomes small enough where you can recycle and ship off the rest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's no garbage collection where I live so we have this big hole we dug where we throw the trash then burn it it. It's a super common occurrence to have someone's thick trash smoke filling up your house from the wind blowing, or the smoke traveling to where kids are playing. </p>
<p>Other places here have garbage collection and I didn't know how much I took it for granted until it was gone</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have lived on one remote (Ascension Island) and not so remote (Cayman islands) both are moving to waste to energy incineration. It would seem since china stopped importing recycled waste exports, recycled waste got more difficult for poor remote islands to sell on.
The highest point on the whole of Grand Cayman is rumoured to be Mount Trashmore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
