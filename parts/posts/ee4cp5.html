		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Once the measles virus gets onto the mucous membrane, it will infect epithelial cells in the trachea or bronchi. It uses a surface protein named hemagglutinin (H protein), to bind to a target receptor on the host cell, which could be CD150, aka signaling lymphocyte activation molecule or SLAM, which is located on immune cells such as B or T cells. Once it's bound, the fusion/chimeric protein helps the virus fuse with the membrane and eventually get inside the cell. The virus is a single-stranded negative-sense RNA virus which means it first must be transcribed by RNA polymerase into a positive-sense mRNA strand.</p>
<p>Next, it's ready to be translated into viral proteins, wrapped in the cell's lipid envelope, and sent out as a newly constructed virus. In a period of days, the measles virus will spread through the local tissue and will be picked up by dendritic cells and alveolar macrophages, and carried from that local tissue in the lungs to the local lymph nodes. It will then continue to spread, eventually getting into your blood and spreading to even more long tissue, as well as other places such as the intestines or brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, a good question to ask is: how do cells in your body stay together, organize themselves and know other cells are ‘self’ (i.e. not foreign)? </p>
<p>The answer is that every cell in the human body expresses a set of cell surface proteins that hold cells together, identify them as part of the body (self) and identify what type of cell they are. In fact, their development is tied to these cell surface proteins as well. So as a cell develops it produces the right types of cell surface proteins that then identify it as being the correct type of cell. If there is any contradictory data during development the cell is usually killed off. In fact, in T cell development, 98% of T cells don’t develop the correct suite of cell surface proteins and are subsequently apoptosed. </p>
<p>Most viruses use one or more of these cell surface proteins to bind to the target cell to infect it. In the case of measles, it uses a protein that’s part of its capsid coat, hemagglutinin, to bind to a protein on the surface of T cells called Signaling Lymphocyte Activating Molecule ( SLAM or CD150). There are other target receptors such as CD46 which is found on every nucleated cell in the human body. But for the immune system, SLAM is probably the route that measles uses that allows it to infect both T &amp; B cells specifically. After the nucleic acid gets into the cell, it incorporates itself into the DNA in the cells nucleus and begins mass producing nucleic acids and proteins to make new viral particles. This part is fairly uniform across viruses, there two approaches, direct incorporation of DNA into the cells genome or it transmits a strand of RNA into the cell then uses a protein called reverse transcriptase to form a DNA strand that is then incorporated into the cells genome. </p>
<p>EDIT: as I did this without looking something up I made one mistake. Measles doesn’t bother with reverse transcription. It merely ‘reverse transcribes’ mRNAs off of a template RNA. So it never creates a DNA copy of its genome. The template RNA is known as a ‘reverse sense’ strand as it is the complement of the mRNAs it produces that actually make the proteins in measles. </p>
<p>Once the mRNAs are made, the cells machinery is coopted to form large quantities of RNA and proteins to form viral particles. Ironically, cells have a pathway that activates so a specific set of cell surface receptors are activated to inform the immune system that the cell should be killed. So the cell surface receptors are both the problem AND the solution. </p>
<p>The immune response is to kill our own infected lymphocytes. Except T cells hold our immune ’memories’ of cellular infections and B cells hold our ‘memories’ of viral infections. So as we kill off these infected cells, we end up losing some to all of our immune ‘memories’ of previous infections. This makes measles particularly nasty as if you survive it you may no longer be immune to things you were previously exposed to, like chicken pox. As an example, you could get chicken pox, develop immunity, get measles and survive, BUT then get chicken pox a second time because you lost your immunity from the first exposure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
