		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eggs typically function as a binding agent that brings all the dry ingredients together. When you heat the mixture, the water in the egg begins to evaporate, which causes the proteins in the egg to stick to each other as well as grab onto the tiny particles of flour, sugar, salt, and whatever else is in the recipe. This is also why egg is used to do coatings of food such as bread crumbs since it allows all the crumbs to stick to the food underneath when it gets fried. Essentially eggs are an edible glue when heated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two components in eggs:</p>
<p>The whites - which are mainly proteins and water</p>
<p><strong>The yolk</strong> - which is mainly fat</p>
<p><strong>The whites</strong> act as a binding agent because protein turns solid when exposed to heat .  Also, since the egg whites are basically tasteless you can add a lot of it and not change the main flavour of the dish.</p>
<p>You can beat the <strong>egg whites</strong> to add air in the protein structure, or combine with sugar and get what is called a merengue which benefits of something called the Maillard reaction. This functions as a raising agent as well. So you can add beaten egg whites to make things fluffy.</p>
<p><strong>The yolk</strong>'s main function is as an <strong>emulsifier</strong>. This means it facilitates mixing between substances, making the mix homogenous.</p>
<p>If you mix the yolk with the white you will collapse the structure of the proteins and mix it with fats. That's why you can't get a lot of raise  out of a cake when there's yolk in it, without extra help such as yeast.</p>
<p>If you mix the yolk with the egg (when you're making an omelette) you will get a somehow fluffy mix , but it won't raise too much.</p>
<p>So, bottom line: want fluff or solid, use whites . Want homogenous mixture, use yolk, want both at the same rate ? you can't without external help.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi!! Baker here. Eggs have a few functions when it comes to baking. One of which being binding, theyâ€™re  a natural leavener (help dough/batter rise), they add protein, and they also add structure, flavor, and color to baked goods.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're whipping egg whites and folding them in to the dry ingredients, that also serves as the raising agent (usually in place of baking powder) since the while point is to have tiny pockets of air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
