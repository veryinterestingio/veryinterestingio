		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>English did not originally have fixed spelling.  People would spell words however they thought it sounded.  This means that spelling varied from person to person and region to region.  Also, due to being made of bits of several languages all smushed together often retaining parts of the original language's rules, there's no consistency as to how words are pronounced or where you even get the spelling from.  A man named Samuel Johnson  eventually wrote a dictionary in which he spelled the words however he wanted to and because of how popular it became, that became the fixed spelling. Johson liked stuffy fancy spellings rather than simple phonetic ones and he set the idea of telling people the &quot;correct&quot; way to write instead of telling them how words were normally used. Webster eventually did something similar for American English, although he preferred simplified spellings, hence some of the differences between American and British spelling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A mix of historical change and language attitudes. English spelling was mostly standardised just before a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Vowel_Shift" target="_blank">major series of sound changes</a>happened, and the spelling mostly reflects the pronunciation from before those changes. Spanish hasn't had really much of anything quite so disruptive happen - it's been more a long series of much smaller changes. On the attitude side of things, English speakers have made a huge deal out of the concept of 'spelling things right', to the point that major change is largely unthinkable at this point - too many people have too strong of feelings about the current spelling system. (This might also be due in part to English's more major sound changes! It would take a massive reform to update English spelling, and it would have even if the reform had happened in 1600, thanks to the above-mentioned Great Vowel Shift - updating to account for even just that change would require a major change. Spanish on the other hand has largely been able to get by on a rolling series of small tweaks.)</p>
<p>Plus, now English has different standard dialects in different places, and it would be impossible to achieve a Spanish-like level of one(ish)-to-one(ish) letter-to-sound correspondences in all dialects simultaneously without having different spellings per dialect.</p>
<p>For some other examples, compare Tibetan - which has a worse spelling-to-pronunciation correspondence than English does - and Swedish and Norwegian, where Swedish has much less predictable spelling than Norwegian despite them being basically dialects of the same language (from a purely linguistic perspective). Norwegian has gone through a series of language reforms (not confined only to spelling) since Norway's independence from Denmark in 1814, in part as a way of asserting a separate linguistic identity from Danish; Swedish just hasn't ever had the same impetus to change. Tibetan went through a drastic change somewhat like English did, where several kinds of previous consonant distinctions got turned into tone distinctions all in one go; I suspect that's also part of why Tibetan hasn't been updated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ditto to everyone about the random spellings and eventual &quot;uniformity&quot; inspired by dictionaries and an increased number of literate speakers.</p>
<p>I'm a L2 (second language learner) of Spanish and a native English speaker. </p>
<p>Spanish only has 22-24 phonemes while English has 38-45. (World languages like these two have A LOT of speakers spanning a big portion of the globe).</p>
<p>*Phonemes are distinct sounds of speech. We think of these as letters, but English doesn't have the same amount of letters to match the phonemes.</p>
<p>English also has a lot more phonemes than Spanish so exponentially there are more combinations in English than in Spanish.</p>
<p>Examples- English sound /zh/ or /ʒ/; this sound has no singular letter to represent it. Example words are azure, measure, Jacques (loan words/names from French), casual. </p>
<p>So /ʒ/ can be represented as z, s, j, or s. This variation is confusing so many people believe that /zh/ could be an allophone of /s/ /sh/ /z/ or /j/. S sound, Sh sound, Z sound, or J sound (/dʒ/ for j sound) respectively.</p>
<p>An allophone is a variation of a phoneme because phonemes change based on mouth position and the way your produce the sound (though teeth, throat, nose, etc.,,) </p>
<p>Allophone example- Stop versus top. Say stop and put your hand in front of your mouth to feel if air hits your hand when you say the t (it shouldn't), but when you say top it should. These are two different sounds of /t/, but we only use one letter for these sounds. The two variations are the same phoneme or base sound. </p>
<p>This happens a lot in any language. Allophones are everywhere, but we don't notice them because our brains steam line when we're in diapers.</p>
<p>I could go on. Comment if you want more explanation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is important to note that spoken languages always evolve in the way that they're spoken. Spanish is no exception to this; 1600s Spanish is very different to the Spanish of today, and even among different regions and countries, Spanish is spoken differently.</p>
<p>There are a couple of key differences between Spanish and English that makes it more 'phonetic': </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Note that both languages use the <em>Latin alphabet</em>. The language for which it was most suited for is, by and large, Latin, which had five vowel sounds and some number of consonants. English has always had more than five; hence why we have to distinguish between the <em>long</em> vowel sounds and the <em>short</em> vowel sounds, and why two vowel letters like 'ew' make one sound. Spanish is also not quite a perfect match to Latin's sounds: letters like 'h' are pretty much obsolete as Spanish doesn't have this sound, and letters like 'b' and 'v' actually make the same sound in Spanish. So Spanish isn't as phonetic as it might seem at first glance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spanish has updated its spelling to reflect changing pronunciations. This is largely thanks to a central body governing - written - Spanish: the Réal Academia, which happens to be highly respected by education and the media, and so any decisions they make happens to eventually make it through to all parts of society. English lacks such a central body, and so it's much harder to convince people to spell differently. For all the rag that English gets, no one actually seems enthusiastic about a more phonetic variant. Quite a few Commonwealth speakers I know seem to scoff at the idea of adopting even American English spelling, even though it was born out of Noah Webster's (failed) attempt to make English a more phonetic language.</p>
</li>
<li>The pronunciation of Spanish has changed in a way that doesn't seem contradictory to the way it's written. For example, 'g' and 'd' have evolved to a much softer sound than we would say them in English. When a Spanish speaker says 'de nada', it's closer &quot;de natha&quot;, but since Spanish originally had no 'th' sound to begin with, d just becomes associated with that 'th' sound; same with 'g', whose pronunciation is closer to the soft Dutch 'g'. Contrast this with English; the 'ea' in 'meat' and 'ee' in 'meet' where once pronounced differently, but these two sounds merged a few centuries ago to give the modern pronunciation. </li>
</ul>
<p>This, on top of no one being able to convince speakers to spell them the same when they started to be pronounced the same, creates a very much 'fossilised' version of English; a spelling of English that largely reflects its old pronunciation, while Spanish has, for the most part, managed to keep up the way it writes with the speaking populace.</p>
<p>Side-note:
There exists this big misconception that language use is dictated by the way it is written; this is very much false. In all regards, the way a language is written is subservient to the way that the people speak it. Written English (or written Spanish) is not the 'ideal' nor 'correct' way to use or speak the language; this is just a by-product of the way writing evolves: the elite and educated use writing, therefore how they do it must be somehow 'correct'. This is, of course, not at all reliable. When the French Revolution occurred, the way the bourgeois used French immediately became stigmatised, and the language of the revolutionaries became the 'correct' way. The point being, what happens to be considered the 'correct' way of writing or using a language has no objective reason; it's just that that version happened to be in vogue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
