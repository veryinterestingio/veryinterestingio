<p>&quot;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/ekpn5q/eli5_when_people_lose_an_arm_or_leg_how_do_their/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/ekpn5q/eli5_when_people_lose_an_arm_or_leg_how_do_their/</a>&quot;</p>
<p>If someone loses an arm, even if the wound heals over, it seems like there would be a problem with their blood suddenly having no route to or from their heart.</p>
<p>Do doctors have to create a temporary channel for the blood to flow? People lost limbs before modern medicine, so I assume the body has a way to deal with it on it's own.</p>
<p>[MY QUESTION]</p>
<p>It sounds like you might use cauterization or some other such procedure. (I just learned what cauterization is. Thank you. Now, I need to remember how to spell it.) </p>
<p>it sounds like the arteries will just take the blood to the end of the artery. And the veins will take the blood back. So, where do the arteries meet the veins? Is there some particular set of points?</p></div></div>

<p>And that's just showing the larger blood vessels, there's also a massive network of criss-crossing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriole" target="_blank">arterioles</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venule" target="_blank">venules</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary" target="_blank">capillaries</a>.</p>
<p>Cauterisation is used to stop blood loss. Not to &quot;reroute&quot; the blood flow which, as the above diagram shows, is unnecessary as alternate routes already exist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Only a minute amount of blood actually reaches your extremities. Most of it goes from arteries to veins as soon as it has delivered it's oxygen.</p>
<p>When there's no arm, the blood simply doesn't go there (if it has healed).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your blood system is like the wiring in your house (if it was DC instead of AC). Arteries and veins are parallel to each other, and they're connected by capillary beds. When you break a light bulb, the others can still light up because they're wired in parallel to each other.</p>
<p>Such an intelligent design, huh? In comparison, a lobster's blood system is analogous to a car engine's oil system, where the pump pumps the oil up, from where it just falls back into the oil pan.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every artery splits into smaller and smaller pipes, until it is so small that the blood cells can barely squeeze through so they transfer oxygen to the surrounding tissue. These are the called capillaries and are where arteries and veins meet. They're everywhere in your body. Every cell in your body is no more than a few cells away from a capillary. There are 10 billion capillaries in your body.</p>
<p>And that's why it's not a big deal for blood flow to lose a limb. The blood just goes through the other capillaries that still exist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I also think it's worth mentioning that vasculature (the whole network of veins &amp; arteries) is arranged to deliver oxygen (through the blood) to all of the tissues as efficiently as possible. The oxygen is only really delivered through capillaries, and the big arteries and veins are really just highways to get the blood to the right place.</p>
<p>And so, if there is no big mass of flesh (i.e. a leg) that exists beyond a certain point (i.e. your hip), there is no reason for your vasculature to look as if it were just cut-off at that point.. your body needs to deliver less oxygen to the tissues at and beyond that point, and collecting and delivering oxygen is costly. </p>
<p>One might expect even vasculature that suffered no direct injury to change as a result of the healing process, as the body repairs itself to allocate oxygen to tissues more efficiently.</p>
<p>So, in summary; (a long time) after an amputation injury, you would expect the whole vasculature to look significantly different, due to the absence of any oxygen-demanding tissues past beyond the point of injury.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
