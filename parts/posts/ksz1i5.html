		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your frontal lobe basically turns off when you sleep. This is the part of your brain that helps you form a picture of reality.</p>
<p>This is why dreams can be fantastical. Your logic/reality center is turned off.</p>
<p>Your brain is sorta repairing itself when we sleep. It's actually very active while sleeping but it's, in computer terms, saving all the files for the day it thinks it needs saving. It's defragging, and it's stopping processes that aren't needed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I generally like to catch the odd article about sleep but I personally haven't come across anything absolute to why we sleep.
But i read something interesting that basically says that the fluid in your brain builds toxins throughout the day while you're awake. When you sleep the spinal fluid washes in and out your brain in waves to clear out all the build up of the toxins. If these toxins build up enough (sleep deprivation) in can be fatal. </p>
<p>ELI5
Your brain juice goes through a wash cycle while you dream.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I’ve read, and I’m no expert, is that we don’t know why we need sleep. As other comments have mentioned, we know basically what happens during sleep and that sleep is necessary. However, I don’t think there’s a definitive answer to your question about why we need to be sleeping for those processes to occur.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Here is some good information on the 4 stages of sleep.</p>

<p>There are also alternative sleep cycles that I've read about. Here is a good link on those.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s my understanding that sleep is the way our brains get rid of the trash that builds up throughout the day.  It’s pretty much a filing system that determines whether or not what we learned from today has been useful enough to use again later, or if it’s going to be forgotten and thrown out as useless information.  These memories are filed and sorted during sleep and end up being interpreted as dreams.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
