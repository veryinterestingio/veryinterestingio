		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What’s the most energy efficient thing you can do?</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>If you’re not hungry, it’s not mating season, and there are no challengers for your territory... why do anything?</p>
<p>Reptiles and arthropods have taken a much different evolutionary path to success that relies on massive energy efficiency.  They require very little energy and can thus live for a very long time without food and/or survive in poor environments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most organisms are in a constant struggle for energy. Obtaining energy is dangerous, you have to leave your save burrow or go risk injury in a hunt.</p>
<p>That's why many organisms develop strategies for minimising the risks they need to take. And one of the most popular strategies is simply having simple, low demand physiologies, slow metabolisms and generally low energy needs.</p>
<p>Warm blooded animals are fairly unique. We're like a car with the engine constantly running. That means we're ready to go from zero to a 100 right away but we're also guzzling gas constantly, even if we're standing still. That's why warm blooded animals need toc constantly eat. Some of the smaller more high energy creatures like humming birds can starve to death in a matter of hours.</p>
<p>By comparison, cold blooded animals waste zero energy on body heat. The downside is that they need to warm their bodies up with external heat like sunlight in order to get their digestive enzymes working or to get their muscles ready for fast action.</p>
<p>But on the upside, they need so little energy that they have to take far fewer risks than warm blooded animals. Some cold blooded animals can go up to a year or even longer without food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you watch the TV show Alone where they have to survive with minimal food (what they find/kill) one of the most important skills is to do literally nothing and not go insane. It conserves calories. If they had a book or TV I'm sure they'd go for those, but they don't so they just half nap do nothing. </p>
<p>Even 200 years ago (and many people today) humans spent vast amounts of time doing nothing. Things like farming were seasonal and required intense work at times and no work at others. When there was nothing to do, people often did nothing. </p>
<p>I was in rural Dominica and encountered a gent with no TV and I doubt he could read. He had a tiny little house and grew his own food. He'd usually be sitting outside doing absolutely nothing. </p>
<p>You often hear Europeans meeting indigenous people going on about how lazy/idle they were. It wasn't because they were slackers, there was just nothing that needed to be done and doing other stuff was a waste of energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doing things consumes energy.</p>
<p>Imagine if you drove your car around all day every day;  you'd need to put a <strong>ton</strong> of fuel in there to keep it going.</p>
<p>Same thing for living creatures.  Creatures that are highly active (birds, rodents, etc.) eat an absolutely massive amount of food compared to their size.  Some birds eat double their own body weight in food every day.  Imagine a 150 pound human eating 300 pounds of food every day.  That's the price for moving around a lot.</p>
<p>So some animals go the opposite route.  Move very little, eat very little.  This works especially well for ambush predators like spiders.  Make the web and then just wait.  No use in burning excess energy.  When something lands in the web, go eat it and wait some more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Besides energy, lots of spiders and lizards are both predator AND prey. They have to balance foraging for food with avoiding predators that might eat them. They also have to balance mate attraction. Each species will have a different strategy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
