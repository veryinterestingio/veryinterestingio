<p>I was wondering whether there are unpredictable systems in the body akin to weather or planetary orbit that over longer periods of time become unpredictable due to tiny differences in the initial conditions, down to quantum fluctuatins.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A big one is heart-rate variability. </p>
<p>Though it is seemingly disturbing to think of “chaos” and “heart” in the same sentence, the inter-beat interval is <em>not</em> perfectly regular; in fact if that occurs, the risk for an arrhythmia increases markedly. </p>
<p>This has been known since at least the late 1980s, and more recently it has been hypothesized that these slight irregularities are protective, giving control systems greater flexibility in responding robustly to a greater range of inputs. In the case of cardiac rhythm it seems to help guard against “re-entrant” conduction of electrical signals to the intrinsic pacemaker pathway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably the immune system. Early in life, the genes for immune cells are randomly scrambled. It's called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VDJ_recombination" target="_blank">VDJ recombination</a>. The purpose is to produce immunity against a wide range of possible threats. Obviously, small changes in this process can lead to severe disorders (anything from peanut allergy to type 1 diabetes). It's a stochastic process, which is why auto-immune disorders are so unpredictable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

No 2 individuals have the same exact pattern and I believe (without much knowledge in the subject) that some abnormal initial conditions can lead to drastically different results, some times with deadly consequences.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The brain. We don't know a lot about how it works, but it clearly is iterative and non-linear, meeting two of the most basic criteria for a chaotic system. We can approach this from other directions as well: it's clearly not a homeostat, and its behavior clearly cannot be explained with a simple linear model or first order differential equations. </p>
<p>Consider the process of writing a novel. At each stage, the author considers what they have written so far and generates a new paragraph or edits an existing one. There is clearly a feedback loop, and just as clearly it is impossible for any simple linear model to predict what this next paragraph will be. This process continues iteratively, until at the end there is simply no way of knowing where it will end up. Yet the simplest change of detail in the earliest phases of the project will result in a completely different book.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neural processes could be considered chaotic.</p>
<p>Neurons fire based on reaching a particular threshold. Stimuli, triggering complex biochemistry, lead to whether a particular neuron fires or not, and the sequence/network of neurons dictates whether a behaviour emerges to respond to a particular stimulus.</p>
<p>In fact, I'd suggest all of biochemistry is chaotic, in the context of &quot;deterministic chaos&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
