<p>Spider webs are unique to each spider, the web itself has a mix of sticky and not-sticky strands. They do this so they can walk around on their web because, unfortunately, spiders don’t have special feet that don’t stick to their own web (that’d be pretty cool if they did!).</p>
<p>The spider that makes its web remembers the pattern they created so they know how to walk on it... not so much for other spiders.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
