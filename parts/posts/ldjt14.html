<ol>
<li>
<p>Why do mRNA vaccines provide more or less protection based on SARS-CoV-2 variants? If they all infect with the spike protein, it should be the same, right?</p>
</li>
<li>Why do lipid based(Pfizer, Moderna) vaccines appear to be more effective against SARS-CoV-2 than adenovirus vaccines(J&amp;J, etc)?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the first question, the different variants have different genetic sequences which correspond to slightly different protein make-up of the viruses. There are dozens of different variants circulating around, most of which are functionally identical. The specific variants people have some concerns about are ones that have mutations in the genes for the spike protein, so the spike protein of those variants is a little different than the ones in the vaccines. When an immune response is created typically multiple antibodies are produced and kept that bind the target of interest.</p>
<p>Each antibody recognizes only a small part of the protein, a specific 3D shape that is unique to that protein. So for the spike protein, you may develop one, five, or more likely dozens of antibodies of various strength and specificity that will recognize that protein. Moreover, each person will develop antibodies that are different and may recognize different parts of the protein, it's all kind of like a mini evolution experiment where random mutations happen in the antibody and only the ones that recognize the intruder the best are kept around. Some people will develop responses against the part of the spike that are slightly different between the variants, and therefore will not recognize a different variant when they are challenged with it. Some people will develop &quot;broadly neutralizing&quot; antibodies that will recognize parts that are not changing between the variants. And most will develop a bit of both. So it's possible both per person and more so, on the population level that the vaccine would not be as effective because the shape of the spike protein in the vaccine is a little different than the one in a different variant. This happens with flu all the time (a lot more so than with coronaviruses) and that's why flu vaccines are updated every 1-3 years for a given strain to take into account what are the 3-4 most prevalent variants in circulation.</p>
<p>For the second questions, there are a few reasons. Firstly, the premise of the question is not exactly accurate. Different studies measure efficacy in slightly different ways depending on how they are set up and what the study is looking for. It's not wise to directly compare efficacy numbers between the different approaches. The only way efficacies can be directly compared is in a study that seeks to do so from the outset.</p>
<p>That being said, theoretically the mRNA vaccines rely on the protein being produced in the cell where it can replenish for a short time (before the mRNA is degraded). This can lead to longer half-life on the cell surface and a more persistent immune response than from a bolus dose of an adenovirus. In principle, that production mimics the production of the viral spike better (since a true infection also produces the protein using the native cell machinery) and will therefore be at least as good and potentially a better mimic of the true viral protein structure. This means the memory response is likely to be a bit more effective. There may be some other immune mechanisms at play that are specifically triggered because there is foreign RNA present in the cell but without more specific studies I would be hesitant to speculate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the first question, NPR did a great article about the spike proteins using Legos to illustrate what is happening with how it infects people, how antibodies work, and why we worry about mutations.  They do a great job explaining it, and the illustrations really do a great job breaking it down. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2021/02/02/961668700/whats-going-on-with-all-these-coronavirus-variants-an-illustrated-guide" target="_blank">https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2021/02/02/961668700/whats-going-on-with-all-these-coronavirus-variants-an-illustrated-guide</a></p>
<p>Picking up where the article left off, the mRNA vaccine teach our bodies to recognize the original spike. If the spike has changed enough, the antibodies won't work, so if we were to encounter the mutated virus, you would get sick. The good news is that so far, it sounds like the two RNA vaccine make antibodies that would still work, but it is mutating enough that they are worried that may not always be the case.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Does anyone have any insight on whether the two delivery methods show any selectivity for different cell types? It makes some sense to me that lipid delivery may lead to more efficient delivery to phagocytes, which are better able to stim an immune reaction over, say, epithelial cells. (I havenâ€™t seen any data saying this happens, just curious.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
