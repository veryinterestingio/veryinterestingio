		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answer I see is correct, but I can add some answers that haven't been given.</p>
<p>First off-how do tests not detect other types of coronavirus? Let's focus on pcr testing, which is the most accurate. Dna and rna (this virus has rna) is the genetic code. It's unique to the things it's from. Some parts of genetic code are the same, more likely over short segments. So if I had a bit of code that was &quot;ggccttc&quot; well lots of things might have that exact code in that pattern, because genetic codes are very very long.</p>
<p>When they first identify the disease they want to test for, they map out massive stretches of code. Then, they'd look for a stretch of code that is unique to that specific thing. That stretch could be dozens of digits long. They look for a bit that's so long, that the chances of something else having the exact matching order of that code are very slim. They of course check to make, verifying it as much as possible.</p>
<p>They might even have 2 or 3 segments that are unique (I think it is actually 3 segments with covid), in order to rule out the chance of getting something else by mistake. They have a series of chemicals that look for that specific genetic code, break it down to just that strand, then replicate it. As it replicates, something is added to the replicated stretch of code that glows under certain conditions. So when they check for that glow, only the replicated segments glow. And it's designed to only replicate the very specific targets segments.</p>
<p>So other coronaviruses shouldn't have the exact same genetic codes that you're looking for, and so shouldn't have stretches replicated and given the part that glows.</p>
<p>Now when a mutation occurs, it does so fairly randomly across the entire genetic code. If the mutation occurs within the segment you're targeting, it won't detect it. But the chances of that happening within the part you're targeting are fairly slim. And of course the labs test for 3 stretches, so even if one mutates, other segments are detected.  Then when it is read at the final stage, they'd see anomalous results that suggest it's there, but not the way they read it, they'd look closer. They then might test that sample further, and have specific sequencing done on it to check for mutations.</p>
<p>I hope that helps. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is yes, it is entirely possible for a virus to mutate its genome to the point where current PCR tests do not detect it. However, when we design the tests, we expect the virus will mutate over time and so we try to pick target sequences of the viral genome that <em>should</em> be highly conserved. Further, these tests look for multiple matched sequences, not just one. I believe the FDA-approved tests look for 3 different sequences. This actually caused quite the kerfuffel in the earliest days of the pandemic because one of the sequences was frequently coming up negative. This was allegedly why we were so slow to get tests out initially. I don't recall the full details, so maybe google that one if you're interested. </p>
<p>Anyway, back to the question, if there was a mutation within those segments of the genome, one would expect to see a lot of 2/3 matches -- which would be a flag that we would need to adjust the tests. As a last line of defense, it's often very obvious that someone has contracted the infection simply from the clinical manifestations. If we have a high number of clinically suspected cases but with negative tests, it would be another flag that we're dealing with a new variant that has evaded the test.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that Covid tests can and do cross-react and detect other types of coronavirus, and they could potentially return false negatives in the event of the right mutations.</p>
<p>PCR tests use a targeted primer to replicate a particular sequence in the virus genome if present in the sample. Early Covid tests used less optimized primers and we're more prone to error than the ones in use now. You can get false positives from other coronaviruses that use the same sequence, or false negatives if the sequence has changed in a mutant.</p>
<p>Antigen tests bind onto a part of the physical structure of the virus. You can get false positives if similar structures are present, or negatives if the structure changes.</p>
<p>Originally as the outbreak occured, the CDC sought an broad spectrum antigen test which could catch everything in the virus family as positive. That unfortunately turned into a regulatory clusterfuck at the FDA as obtaining emergency use authorization meant validating the Covid-testing method against the SARS virus, access to which was tightly restricted. It took direct intervention from the White House to cut that gordian knot and get the Covid-tests approved and in-use without testing all possible cross-reactivity.</p>
<p>In general it's better for the &quot;error&quot; to fall on the side of a false positive, as the patient can be re-tested with an orthogonal method to either confirm the positive result or ID the false positive.</p>
<p>Re the amount of changes to be considered new/different? It's largely arbitrary. You get the same issue defining speciation. The reason everything from a 1lb Chihuahua to a 343lb English Mastiff are considered the same species while Coyotes and Wolves are considered distinct is usually justified by genetic isolation, but even that gets wishy washy in a modern world where the typical genotype of a wild Eastern US coyote is about ~65% coyote ~25% wolf ~10% domestic dog.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Emerging variants of an infectious virus are to be expected, but new, more transmissible forms of Covid-19 cropping up around the world have been an understandable cause for concern.</p>
<p>From the UK and Brazil to South Africa, the US, India and now Germany, mutant strains of Covid-19 have been causing concern wherever they emerge. SARS-CoV-2 mutations are unfortunately to be expected – mutating is part and parcel of what viruses do, and the Covid-19 virus has been mutating ever since it emerged. Most of these mutations don’t substantially change the virus and some might actually be to its detriment, causing the variant to die out.</p>
<p>The new strains and mutations are identified by taking samples from positive patients for background observation of the genetic code. As such, the chance of an emergent Covid-19 variant evading tests is highly unlikely. Currently, the most widely used tests for Covid-19 are polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and lateral flow tests (LFTs).</p>
<p>Researchers are testing the first crop of vaccines against the new variants, and we should know in the coming weeks whether or not they’re still effective. There is good reason to be optimistic here – the vaccines are designed to generate an immune response to multiple different parts of the virus, which means a lone mutation is unlikely to render a vaccine ineffective. Even if the antibodies generated by immunisation become unable to recognise one element of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, they will still be able to recognise the others and dispatch it.</p>
<p>Eventually, the virus probably will mutate enough to evade the vaccines in their current form, but this isn’t as dire as it sounds – we see this happen every year with the flu, where developing a new jab is a standard part of vaccine manufacturers’ annual workload. But it doesn’t appear we’re at that stage just yet, and any necessary tweaks to the vaccines won’t take nearly as long as the experimental candidates took to develop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
