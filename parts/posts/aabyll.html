My right nostril always gets more clogged up than my left and my right ear almost always hurts more than my left.  I’d say it’s true about 80% of the time for me.  I am right handed if that matters at all.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Medical school professor here. Fun fact: your nose is filled with erectile tissue that engorges with blood, just like our naughty bits. The function of this erectile tissue is to use blood warm and moisten the air we breathe. But, when the erectile tissue engorges, it can block airflow, making it hard to breathe. So the erectile tissue on the right and left sides take turns engorging so we can always breathe through one nostril. This is called the nasal cycle.</p>
<p>Body posture can affect the duration of the cycle on each side. If you sleep more on your right side or lean your head to the right side preferentially, the engorgement will happen for longer on the right side (this is called right nasal dominance).</p>
<p>When you get sick and your nose fills with mucus, we become more aware of this dominance.</p>
<p>What about your ear? Well, the back of your nose (nasopharynx) is connected to your middle ear by the auditory tube, so congestion of the right side of your nasal cavity can spread to your middle ear on the right side.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an expert, but I saw an ENT and he basically said that there is tissue in the nose, called turbinates, that is responsible for controlling air flow into the nose in a way. On a normal basis, it swells a little on one side, then the other. When you're sick or if you have swollen turbinates (like mine, which required a surgery to reduce, a long with a septoplasty to correct a deviated septum) they can cut off air flow in one nostril while they're swollen.</p>
<p>I'm sure it's much more involved than that, this is a patient trying to sum up what he remembers from a surgery over a year ago!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One nostril is always a bit swollen than the other, even if you're not sick. This is to slow the air down in one of the nostrils. Some particles are detected better in slow moving air, and some in fast moving air, so doing it this way gives us both. When you've got a cold though, this swelling is magnified. </p>
