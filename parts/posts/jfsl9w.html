		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In other words, we perceive the universe to be 13+ billion years old but could there be other regions in spacetime that would perceive the age of the universe to be much younger/older?</p>
<p>Also could this influence how likely it is to find intelligent life if, for example, regions that experience time much faster than other regions might be more likely to have advanced intelligent life than regions that experience time much more slowly?   Not saying that areas that experience time much more slowly than us cannot be intelligent, but here on earth we see the most evolution occur between generations.  If we have had time to go through many generations then we could be more equipped than life that has not gone through as many evolution cycles.</p>

<p>Edit:  Even within our own galaxy, is it wrong to think that planetary systems closer to the center of the galaxy would say that the universe is younger than planetary system on the outer edge of the galaxy like ours?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit 2: Thanks for the gold and it's crazy to see how many people took interest in this question.  I guess it was in part inspired by the saying &quot;It's 5 O'Clock somewhere&quot;.  The idea being that somewhere out there the universe is probably always celebrating its &quot;first birthday&quot;.  Sure a lot of very specific, and hard to achieve, conditions need to be met, but it's still cool to think about.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your basic idea is right, but it turns out to be such a small effect that it doesn't matter very much.</p>
<p>The age of the universe does depend on your frame of reference. Time dilation from gravity and from moving close to the speed of light can change how old the universe looks to you. There is no universal age of the universe. We have to pick a frame of reference, and we choose the frame where the cosmic microwave background appears stationary as our frame of reference.</p>
<p>However, this only matters if you need your numbers to be very precise. Most objects in space (stars, planets, galaxies) move at 10s to 1000s of km/s relative to each other. The speed of light is ~300,000 km/s, and you really need to be above like 90% of the speed of light for time dilation to really get noticeable, so stars and planets don't have strong time dilation relative to each other. The only things that move really really fast are jets of magnetised ionised gas blasting out from rapidly rotating accretion discs around black holes, but you can't live in a thin magnetised plasma.</p>
<p>Gravitational time dilation is similarly weak in almost all situations. It only really gets strong when you are really right on top of the event horizon of a black hole. So, if you had a planet that was almost touching the event horizon - which is an implausible but not technically impossible orbit - then yes, any aliens on that planet will have a very different view of the age of the universe. But the Milky Way's gravity is too gentle to have a significant effect between the central bulge and the outer spiral.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
