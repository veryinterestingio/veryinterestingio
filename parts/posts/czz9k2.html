		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, Reddit! My name is Jane Pearson, and I am from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). I'm working on strategies for our research that will help prevent suicide.</p>
<p>Suicide claims over 47,000 lives a year in the U.S. and we urgently need better prevention and intervention strategies. Thanks to research efforts, it is now possible to identify those at-risk using evidence-based practices, and there are effective treatments currently being tested in real-world settings. I’m doing this AMA today to highlight how NIMH-supported research is developing knowledge that will help save lives and help reverse the rising suicide rates.</p>
<p>Today, I’ll be here from 12-2 p.m. ET – Looking forward to answering your questions!  Ask Me Anything!</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is in crisis and needs immediate support or intervention, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255, or text the Crisis Text Line (text HELLO to 741741). Both services are free and available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  The Lifeline is a national network that routes your confidential and toll-free call to the nearest crisis center. These centers provide crisis counseling and mental health referrals. You can call for yourself or on behalf of a friend.  If the situation is potentially life-threatening, call 911 or go - or assist a friend to go - to a hospital emergency room. Lives have been saved by people taking action.   </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How can people get help in a timely fashion? </p>
<p>I have great insurance, but when a family member is severely depressed (and possibly suicidal,) getting an appointment to start medication takes about 6 weeks, and getting into counseling takes months. The wait list for actual psychologists and psychiatrists is even longer. This has actually happened to 4 people in my family over the last couple of years. Obviously that is too long to wait when someone needs this kind of help. I know there are emergency rooms and temporary psych commitments, but there seems to be a gap in care for patients that are in crisis but don't need hospitalization.</p>
<p>Thank you for doing the research you do. I am just worried that our system is wasting that work by not putting it to use where it is needed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In 2017, former director of the National Institute of Mental Health, Thomas Insel, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/05/star-neuroscientist-tom-insel-leaves-google-spawned-verily-startup/" target="_blank">confessed to the public</a>, “I spent 13 years at NIMH really pushing on the neuroscience and genetics of mental disorders, and when I look back on that, I realize that while I think I succeeded at getting lots of really cool papers published by cool scientists at fairly large costs — I think $20 billion — I don’t think we moved the needle in reducing suicide, reducing hospitalizations, improving recovery for the tens of millions of people who have mental illness … I hold myself accountable for that.”  </p>
<p>What is NIMH doing differently that will actually help people now compared to the 13 years Thomas Insel was leading the organization?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
