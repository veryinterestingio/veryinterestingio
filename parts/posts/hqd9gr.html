		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a middle school science teacher. I find the growing movement of anti-science and the proliferation of disinformation on social media that perpetuates it to be one of the most disturbing trends in our society. For many years I have incorporated lessons on how to research facts and differentiate between reliable and unreliable information. What advice do you have for creating a good foundation for young people to be able to think rationally in order to be able to navigate a world in which they are increasingly bombarded with disinformation? Is there a good way to do this while staying politically neutral, especially when considering that many students grow up in households with parents that actively embrace conspiracy theories and anti-science propaganda?
How do you think our education system, on a larger scale, should be addressing this issue?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I watched the flat earth documentary on Netflix (behind the curve) and one point they made is when you ridicule and insult them, all it does is push them further into their echo chamber. I would imagine this is similar for anti-vaxxers, so how can you discuss things in a meaningful way when they don’t listen to any of the science that’s out there?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>That is, are there different approaches or different tactics that are more likely to work, based on the format where you “meet” the person?</p>
