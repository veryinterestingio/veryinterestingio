What is an engine seize? Can those engines be salvaged? Or would the Germans in this scenario know it's hopeless and scrap the engine completely?</p></div></div>

<p>The end result, though, is a 100% dead engine that can’t be fixed in any practical sense of the word. (Sure, it could stripped down piece by piece and completely rebuilt and have any damaged components sorted out... but that’s not practical in the middle of a war. And it’s usually costs more than it’s worth.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Engines have moving parts, which is why they need oil to lubricate them. </p>
<p>One job of the oil is to dissipate the engine heat. If an engine is drained of the oil, then the heat that gets created by it expands the metal parts until there is no space for them to move about.</p>
<p>When these parts rub against each other, they grind together and fuse, or seize up. Then the engine is useless until it can be taken apart and rebuilt properly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Inside of an engine, you have hollowed out tubes and cap-like pieces that fit within these tubes. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Internal_combustion_engine_pistons_of_partial_cross-sectional_view.jpg" target="_blank">Image.</a> Crucial to the operation of the engine, these cap-like pieces must be able to slide up and down constantly. They run pretty much the full length of the tube multiple times a second. If even one of them stops, the engine cannot run, as they are all coupled together.</p>
<p>From here on, the cap is called the piston, and the tube is the cylinder. The piston and cylinder must very tightly fit one another. The piston is just barely small enough to fit within the cylinder. Should one of the pistons be damaged in such a way as to begin to grip the walls just right, it can easily become wedged. It will immediately stop. Since it is physically connected to the other moving parts of the engine, and they are moving quite fast, the forces jamming it in are absolutely huge. Things bend, things break, and the piston can become effectively fused to the cylinder. It would be far cheaper to build a new engine from scratch than to repair this one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Yeah to make it really simple: no oil or coolant in a box filled with explosions (an engine) = extremely hot metal gouging itself apart and welding itself solid simultaneously.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Running an engine dry (of oil) causes moving parts to overheat, warp and bind (seize). Essentially the crankshaft no longer turns. It is sometimes possible to recover but it requires a LOT of work, replacement parts and a good workshop - it isn't something that can be done in the field so it renders a vehicle stuck on the road useless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
