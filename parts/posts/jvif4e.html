		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Higher mortality diseases get quarantined more aggressively.</p>
<p>If COVID had a 15% case fatality rate and most survivors were left permanently disabled, Wuhan would have been in hard lockdown four weeks earlier. Similar actions were taken when Africa had an ebola outbreak.</p>
<p>Because the disease is 80% 'less deadly' than that, it was able to slip out of the origin region and into nearly every country on Earth.</p>
<p>It's also an evolutionary advantage for diseases not to kill their host. It simply makes them better at spreading, and this creates a tendency for viruses to mutate to become less lethal. This is why the 2018 flu virus was much less deadly than the 1918 one, despite the 1918 one being an evolutionary ancestor of the 2018.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While a super high lethality rate would have caused the virus to quickly burn out, something in the 10-20% range easily could have spread out of control. What every commenter I have seen here is forgetting is that COVID-19 can be transmitted asymptomatically for up to 12 days. SARS, which had a lethality rate of around 10%, was contained because only symptomatic individuals were contagious. If SARS could have spread through asymptomatic carriers, it is unlikely it could have been stopped before spreading globally. </p>
<p>So yes, we are lucky COVID is not more lethal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, the higher the mortality rate, the more likely we are to take it seriously and stop it from spreading in the first place. There is probably a sweet spot in killing power where the virus doesn't attract too much attention and is able to spread unhindered, while being as deadly as possible. COVID-19 seems to be close to that point - lots of desire to stop it, but not quite enough to get the job done so it spreads widely and kills regularly. We might have been luckier if it did have a higher mortality rate, so people would have taken it more seriously and stopped it from spreading before it killed 1.3 million people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
