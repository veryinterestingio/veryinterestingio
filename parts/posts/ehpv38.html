		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People with Down syndrome have similar features because of genetic abnormalities. Because genes are essentially the “code” for how your body is built, a large change in the code (via an extra chromosome 21 in the case of those with Down syndrome) causes specific features to emerge. The features are similar from person to person because the code contained within the extra chromosome is similar and is expressed similarly from person to person. </p>
<p>If you look at people who suffer from some other genetic diseases (Patau, Edwards, DiGeorge, Williams, etc.), those individuals also share similar features that are distinct from individuals with Down syndrome (although there is some overlap from one syndrome to another). These syndromes all feature a specific gene disruption that results in shared characteristics of those who have the disease. </p>
<p>If you do some image searching, you can find lots of examples of the more common characteristics for all of these conditions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well as you already may know that Down syndrome is caused by an extra chromosome (trisomy) meaning that it’s effect begins before t he protein synthesis stages which ultimately result to how you look, how your body works and in this case their appearance. Due to the chromosomal mutation occurring in the same section of the DNA in all Down syndrome patients the effects are often very similar, which includes their facial features. And don’t feel bad about asking such questions because more informed people are the less likely they will say something offensive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the answers here are slightly missing the point and only describing what Downs Syndrome does to people...</p>
<p>The answer of why they look similar is because although they, as individuals, have the same distinct variations in face morphology that standard people do, the significant changes in their looks in a sense 'overrides' your ability to discern the usual subtle facial features. Thus this similarity in variance away from 'the norm' confuses your facial differentiation capabilities into thinking they look similar.</p>
<p>In roughly the same way people with little exposure to other races often report that they all look 'the same', but people who live in very multicultural areas don't have that issue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
