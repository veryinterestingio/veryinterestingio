		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a biologist who has spent over 40 years studying the diversity of life on planet Earth. I've written many books dealing with questions about this amazing biodiversity, but recently I've become fascinated by questions about life on other planets. The number of known planets is now well over 4000 - a very large number compared with the mere eight we knew of until recently, and yet only the tip of the suspected iceberg of about a trillion planets spread across our local galaxy. Some of these planets almost certainly host life. But how many, and what is it like? These are the central questions of my new book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Biological-Universe-Life-Milky-Beyond/dp/1108836941" target="_blank">The Biological Universe</a>, published by <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/thebiologicaluniverse" target="_blank">Cambridge University Press</a>.</p>
<p>I began my scientific career with a PhD from Nottingham University in England, went on to teach and carry out research at several other British universities, and am now Emeritus Professor at the National University of Ireland in Galway. I have held visiting positions at Harvard and Cambridge universities. I was one of the founding editors of the scientific journal Evolution &amp; Development. My previous books include Life through Time and Space (Harvard 2017). This was described as 'brilliant and thought-provoking in every way' by Sir Arnold Wolfendale, Britain's Astronomer Royal (only the 14th person to hold this position since its origin in the year 1675).</p>
<p>Ask me anything about:</p>
<ul>
<li>What alien life is likely to be like</li>
<li>How widespread it is likely to be</li>
<li>How soon we are likely to discover it</li>
<li>How close is the nearest alien life to Earth</li>
<li>What are the implications of discovering it</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll be on at 12 noon Eastern (16 UT), AMA!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The more intelligent vertebrates of Earth (primates, corvids, cetaceans) seem to be able to communicate with each other and express basic thoughts and emotions across species.  There are even accounts of such cross-species intelligent interaction between humans and octopus.  Does that give you hope that intelligence in non-terrestrial species would, at least on a basic level, be understandable to us, and vice-versa?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have your views about the likelihood of finding extraterrestrial life in our solar system changed in the recent months and years? Especially with the (still debated) claims of phosphine on Venus, some complex molecules on Titan, liquid water on the moon. </p>
<p>For an outsider, these findings sound significant for astrobiology. But on the other hand, these kind of findings must happen all the time. So has it influenced your assessment on how probable life in our planetary neighborhood is or is it just &quot;nice to know&quot; information?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
