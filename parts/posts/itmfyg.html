This predates modern humans that arrived in europe somewhere at 40k years ago, making this the first solid evidence of Neanderthal symbolism.</p>

<p>Needless to say, this seems quite controversial and far from settled. The tone in the critique and response letters is quite scathing in places, this whole thing seems to have ruffled quite a few feathers.</p>
<p>What are the takes on this ? Are the dating methods unreliable and these paintings were indeed made more recently ? Are there any strong reasons to doubt that Neanderthals indeed painted these things ?</p>
<p>Note that this all is in the recent evidence of Neanderthals being able to make fire, being able to create and use adhesives from birch tar, and make strings. There might be case to be made for Neanderthals being far smarter than they’ve been usually credited with.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't comment on the archaeology side, but the U-Th dating of cave carbonates is an incredibly well established science and Dirk Hoffmann really does know what he's doing with it. The dates are of carbonate precipitated on top of the art by subsequent flows - that's pretty unambigously younger than the art itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, neanderthals existed concurrently with humans and were just as smart as us. They eventually interbred with humans and faded/melded into homo sapiens. (As homo sapiens are breeding machines, Homo Neanderthalis couldn't keep up.) I would say its entirely possible that the paintings could have been drawn by them, depending on the region. (Neanderthals lived in mid to northern Asia/Russia)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neanderthals were human. Homo neanderthalensis branched from what would become Homo sapiens probably between 400,000 and 800,000 years ago. Humans were still essentially human a million years ago. There is taxonomic dispute over even considering them a separate species, some suggest they should be a subspecies -one which could and did interbreed with Homo sapiens until they were utterly absorbed into our genetic stock.</p>
<p>As such, I find the idea that the <em>couldn't</em> have made the cave art to be utterly without basis. Humans make art, and we have probably been doing so in some form since before the branch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
