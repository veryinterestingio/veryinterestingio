Would it be like, a stream of electrons dumping out of the charge cord and into some kind of receptacle? Would they fill in randomly or orderly? What keeps them from escaping, thus keeping the charge?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a retail clothing store that has a bunch of customers but no sales. Throughout the day the customers ruffle through the neatly folded clothes, try them on and put them down somewhere else. Completely disorganizing the entire store. </p>
<p>That is you using your battery.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the employees run through using their tiny hands to pick up crumpled clothes, fold them, and reorganize the entire store. </p>
<p>That is the charging. </p>
<p>The electrons come in through the wall, reorganize your lithium ions and leave.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You would see equal numbers of electrons flowing from and returning to the source, out from the negative and into the positive wires, respectively. They hop across valence orbitals through a lattice of metal atoms that make up the wires. They also move surprisingly slowly - the rate at which electric pressure is felt on the other end of a wire is very fast, but the electrons themselves only move around 10mm/sec.</p>
<p>Inside the battery you would see electrons hopping off one electrode and onto a molecule, destabilizing it and causing part of it to rearrange in a fashion that transports an electron through the electrolyte. Generally speaking, charging the battery would have the same effect but in the opposite direction, re-forming the original molecules in the electrolyte.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you could zoom on the cable you would see a flow of electrons from the positive pod of the battery to the negative, in it's way activating said device.</p>
<p>See it like a stream of water : your charged battery is like a 2 parts pressurised water tank, one full and one empty.
Discharge : When you plug something the stream of water give some energy to your device and the water end in the empty part of the tank.
Empty : When you do not have enough pressure left you can't activate your device anymore
Charge : with an external source of energy you move the water back in the first part of your tank an rise the pressure again, you can now use the battery/tank again</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
