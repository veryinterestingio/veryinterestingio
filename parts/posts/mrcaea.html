		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Solvents are used in a variety of applications - from paints and electronics to pharmaceuticals and agrochemical production. Yet, many pose a hazard to human health and the environment, which means it's more important than ever to create safer, more sustainable alternatives.</p>
<p>We're exploring new applications for bio-based solvents, such as Cyrene™ - a dipolar aprotic solvent that is derived from cellulose and produced in one step from levoglucosenone (LGO), a versatile chemical building block. This solvent can be used for the production and development of active pharmaceutical ingredients, the engineering of plastics and the manufacturing and recycling of electronic components.</p>
<p>In addition to determining new applications for Cyrene™ solvent, we're also working on further developments for other LGO derivatives. These next-gen solvents can play a crucial role in more sustainable chemistry. For example, when compared to N-methyl-2-pyrrolione (NMP) and dimethylformamide (DMF), two solvents under increasing regulatory restrictions due to their toxicity, Cyrene™ solvent offers superior performance in some applications. Additionally, its low toxicity falls well below the hazard thresholds defined by the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals.</p>
<p>Here to answer your questions about greener solvents are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dr. Jane Murray (/u/GreenJanem): I am the global head of green chemistry at Merck. I have a background in chemical research-having completed my Ph.D. at the University of York, where I researched green oxidations of organosulfur compounds using hydrogen peroxide. In my current role, I enjoy partnering with academics to introduce novel green chemistry technologies to the scientific community. I was named an Environment+Energy Leader 100 Honoree in 2020.</li>
<li>Dr. Jason Camp (/u/DrJasonCamp): I am the chief technology officer at Circa Group. Prior to joining Circa, I had over 10 years of experience as an independent academic at various UK universities, during which I conducted research and published extensively in the areas of green chemistry and sustainable solvents, including Cyrene™. In addition, I have served on the Society of Chemical industry's (SCI) Fine Chemicals Group since 2014 and am currently the secretary of the SCI's Science and Enterprise Group.</li>
<li>James Clark (/u/GreenJamesClark): I am a scientific advisor at Circa Group, professor at the University of York and director of the Green Chemistry Centre of Excellence. I have played a leading role in green and sustainable chemistry over the last 20 years, and have published over 400 related articles in that period. My activities in research, education and industrial collaboration have led to prizes and awards from the Royal Society of Chemistry, the SCI and EUChemS, as well as honorary doctorates from universities in Belgium, Germany and Sweden.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll be answering questions about our work on bio-based solvent developments from 11 a.m. EDT - 1 p.m. EDT (15-17 UT). Ask us anything!</p></div></div>

<p>Is this something that you look into ?  I know that a lot of histology lab would be interested</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I glanced at the SDS on Sigma. Disposal and seems similar to other organic solvents. Is there an advantage to this solvent over say isopropanol or toluene, when using ~500 mL at a time for analytical work? </p>
<p>I usually pick liquids for surface tension or polarity. My favorite is water, followed by surfactant solutions. But sometimes you can’t avoid an organic solvent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for doing this AMA! As a recent Ph.D. graduate in inorganic chemistry, any discussion of new technology towards sustainability is very  valuable. I have 3 questions.
1) Solvent removal is an important part of using solvent during synthesis &amp; purification. How do you normally isolate the product using Cyrene?
2) What is the applicability of Cyrene in reactions with acids/bases, or reducing/oxidizing agents?
3) Where do you see the biggest breakthrough in biorenewable solvents in the next decade or so?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
