I always worried about the radiation of a microwave oven, but this looks like a pretty good solution to check radiation leak (tell me if I'm wrong)... I always thought it's a shielded &quot;box&quot;! :-( </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Normally, microwave ovens are shielded. However with very old or defective microwave ovens, this shielding might not be that great and there might be some noticeable leakage. Since microwave ovens operate at the same frequency as some wifi networks (2.4 GHz), a poorly shielded microwave oven can interfere with wifi reception (note: many wifi networks use 5 GHz signals, which wouldn't be affected).</p>
<p>But it only takes a tiny amount of leakage for a microwave oven to interfere with a wifi signal, given that an active microwave oven is about 10,000 times more powerful than a wifi router and a wifi router is often tucked away somewhere making the actual strength of the wifi signal even lower. It doesn't take much to interrupt a wifi signal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some microwaves can leak and this can disrupt WiFi signals, because they use several thousand times more power internally than a WiFi router puts out. A small leak can be enough to overwhelm the WiFi signal. Microwaves are cheap consumer devices without high-spec RF sealing at the door, so they are not guaranteed to be completely leak-proof.</p>
<p>However, you shouldn't be worried about any health effects. A small amount of leakage isn't any different from the WiFi signal itself. RF radiation at the frequencies that microwaves use just does what it does inside a microwave: heat things up. It doesn't cause cancer, because it is non-ionizing radiation. As long as you don't make a habit of having your head right up against the door seal of a microwave while you cook every time, you're going to get more RF exposure out of talking on a phone than from a nearby microwave, and that amount RF exposure isn't going to do anything to your health.</p>
<p>The test that the video demonstrates is reasonable. If you put a phone inside a closed microwave (without turning the microwave on, of course) and it loses the WiFi signal (on 2.4GHz - this is not guaranteed to work if you have a 5GHz network), then it is doing at least a decent job of shielding when the door is closed. It's not a terribly accurate test, but it should at least detect if there are any big issues with the shielding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like you are confusing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-ionizing_radiation" target="_blank">ionizing and non-ionizing radiation</a>. Ionizing radiation is the scary stuff you think about when you hear of nuclear bombs and X-Rays etc. That's the stuff that damages your DNA, and kills you dead in scary ways. Non-ionizing radiation can of course burn you, but it's a thermal burn. Ultimately, you aren't much different than the pot roast you put into the microwave oven, so if you feel suddenly quite warm near the oven then by all means turn the damn thing off and have it checked, but no need to reach for the iodine pills.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I did not watch the video. However, I do know for a fact that microwaves can interfere with wireless technologies that operate on 2.4Ghz, such as WiFi, bluetooth, certain mouses/keyboards, and other devices.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>There are multiple types of radiation. Only ionizing radiation can cause cancer. Microwaves do not emit ionizing radiation. If your concern has anything to do with cancer, you can stop being concerned now. If your concern has to do with interference with other wireless devices in your household, then it's possible this could be worth looking into depending on the microwave and it's physical location relative to the 2.4Ghz devices you use.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Microwave radiation can only hurt you if it is intense enough to cook your flesh. That's why microwaves have to be shielded; cooking food requires very intense microwaves, and you want to retain as much as possible (they bounce around inside the box) to make it work better.</p>
<p>Much like you get feel sunlight on your skin before you get sunburnt, you will feel yourself being warmed before the microwave oven can start hurting you. If you feel like you are being cooked, move away from the microwave. And then get a new microwave oven.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
