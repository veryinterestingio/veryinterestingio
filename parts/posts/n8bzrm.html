		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On a microscopic level over really long time, yes. Materials will creep over very long time periods, sped up by applied load and temperature. Basically a material that is far under the average load/temperature required to break bonds will still randomly have small random spikes of energy concentrations. Over long enough time these small energy spikes will eventually be energetic enough and happen in a weak point, so bonds can break.
So, yes. The load applied by the magnet will influence and increase creep. But under normal temperatures and loads it will not make a noticeable difference on a macroscopic level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends how much force and corresponding stress (force per area) you can generate within the material and if some kind of creep mechanism is possible under the conditions you have. </p>
<p>Up to a certain stress, the metal will behave <em>elastically</em> meaning it will be stretched but return to original length/shape when you remove the force. Above that particular stress, it will behave plastically meaning things called dislocations will be transported through the lattice structure in the metal causing the metal to not return to original shape when load is removed. (If itâ€™s brittle material the material will usually break before much plastic deformation occurs).</p>
<p>If the material is heated up you can get something called creep where the thing under stress would continue to elongate or deform under a constant stress as long as the creep mechanism has enough energy to activate (from the temp). I think at low temps the dominant mechanism would be grains sliding against each other.
Also I think magnetism decreases with temperature so might be hard to create conditions where you can creep some metal with a magnet.</p>
<p>So if you had a sample that melts close to room temperature and can exhibit magnetism, then you could probably continuously plastically deform that sample.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, stress applied to an object will cause a deformation, depending on magnitude of stress, Area of cross section, Elastic Modulus and original dimension of the object. The deformation will be obviously visible, or you have to look it under a microscope, but it will deform. Magnetic forces will cause small normal internal stresses to be set up in the metal. This stress will try to oppose the deformation that is trying to be caused by the magnetic force. So deformation will be produced.  However, time could easily be few years and degree of deformation will be negligible. You can consider it analogous to effect of gravitational force on metals, which is a non contact force too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the responses here mention creep, but I'm surprised no one's mentioned magnetostriction yet. If you apply a magnetic field to a ferromagnetic material, for example the material of a transformer core, the magnetic domains will align in the direction of the field. When the field is applied, the material becomes strained. If you reverse the field direction, the domains will flip, and as the strength of the field reduces and increases again, so will the strain. That constant oscillation in the strain is what causes the characteristic hum of large power transformers.</p>
<p>There is also a phenomenon called piezomagnetism, which also results in deformation of certain materials when a magnetic field is applied, (or creation of a magnetic field when the material is mechanically stressed), but its origin is different, and I'm not knowledgeable enough of it to explain it. One notable difference between the two phenomena though is that magnetostriction results in an increase in length (for ferromagnetic materials at least) regardless of the direction of the applied field; but with piezomagnetism, a field applied in one direction will result in a length extension, and a field applied in the other direction will result in compression.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Most materials change shape slightly when a magnetic field is applied. This is known as <em>Magnetostriction</em>. This happens almost instantly, not slowly over time. </p>
<p>In most cases it's slight. This effect is largely responsibile for the humming noise produced by transformers and other large electrical equipment.  The iron core off the transformer changes shape slightly resulting in vibration.</p>
<p>This effect is exploited by many earphones. They contain an alloy of iron and the rare earth metals Terbium and Dysprosium. This has the largest known value of magnetostriction of any material. You need only wrap a coil of wire around a rod of this material. Running a curent through the coil that's proportionate to a sound signal generates a magnetic field, causing the material to vibrate. This is very simple to construct but highly effective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
