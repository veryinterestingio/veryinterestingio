		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scratching a nail on a chalkboard emits a high pitched sound. Human ears tend to be shaped in a way that amplify higher pitched sounds. High pitched sounds tend not to travel as far or be as loud (as a function of wave length), so if you create a loud high pitched noise, it will seem even louder to a person than it's actual decibels would suggest.</p>
<p>This over amplification makes evolutionary sense, since we wouldn't encounter frequent super loud high pitched noises, but it also means our ears can be damaged when we do encounter them, so the bodies response is pain - and you generally react in ways that minimize the damage (covering ears, moving away, avoiding it in the future).</p>
<p>Hope this helps you conquer the humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The part of the brain that handles hearing is right next to the part of the brain that handles some emotions. With some people when the hearing area starts working it bumps the emotion area and makes you feel like you're feeling an emotion that you are not. In many people, but not all, this can be disgust and revulsion at that squeaky scrapey sound. In a very few people the sound of chewing or lip smacking creates feelings of anger, or the sound of dishes and silverware clanking can cause anxiety.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
