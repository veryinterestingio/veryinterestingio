		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scientists have been doing this for decades. The concept goes back to the 1950s (1952 article: <a href="https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1952.tb39969.x" target="_blank">VIRUSES WITH ONCOLYTIC PROPERTIES AND THEIR ADAPTATION TO TUMORS</a>), and there are over <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Oncolytic+virus" target="_blank">5000 peer-reviewed articles</a> on the topic, and over a hundred <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=&amp;term=Oncolytic+virus&amp;cntry=&amp;state=&amp;city=&amp;dist=" target="_blank">clinical trials</a> on the approach have been registered. </p>
<p>Many different viruses have been engineered for this. One of the earlier approaches, starting in the 1990s, was to take advantage of p53, which both suppresses cancer and many viruses. Adenoviruses have evolved a protein that blocks p53, and without that protein can only replicate in p53-negative cells. Since many tumor cells have eliminated p53, that means that adenoviruses engineered to lack their p53-blocker more or less specifically infect cancer cells. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncolytic_adenovirus" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a>. </p>
<p><em>edit</em> thanks to u/backroundagain for pointing out that one of these viruses, a modified herpes simplex virus, has been FDA-approved for treatment of recurrent melanoma as <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/cellular-gene-therapy-products/imlygic-talimogene-laherparepvec" target="_blank">IMLYGIC: talimogene laherparepvec</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) is an oncolytic virus based on herpes simplex virus type 1 approved for intralesional treatment of advanced melanoma. … Phase I to III clinical trials and early real-world experience have shown the efficacy of T-VEC in advanced melanoma as single or combination therapy with tolerable adverse effects. We conclude that with a standardized clinical approach and training, dermatologists can pave the way in using T-VEC and future oncolytic virus therapies in appropriate clinical scenarios.</p>

<p>That said, none of the engineered viruses so far have been spectacularly effective, and most approaches now look to use them as one part of a multi-pronged attack on the tumor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The challenge with using viruses to deliver healthy DNA as you say is that many genes are simply too large to fit inside of the storage area of viruses. They are used all the time for this type of therapy, but can only deliver short and simple (by DNA standards) strands which limits their versatility. </p>
<p>The current manufacturing process is also deeply flawed with some processes yielding only 30% of what the theoretical yield should be and leading to worldwide capacity shortage which in turn can make these therapies prohibitively expensive. </p>
<p>These are called viral vectors, by the way, if you want to research more on your own. It’s a really fascinating topic</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another problem at play is that while cancers may <em>arise</em> from a specific cell type, it often doesn't <em>stay</em> that way.</p>
<p>One of the big steps on the path for a cell to become a cancer cell is disabling the checks that cause it to suicide if it mutates too much. Once you get a tumor going, you have a bunch of cells playing solitaire with their genes, so it's a mess of different little cancer-families.</p>
<p>You may be able to paint a target on something that 99% of those have, but the 1% will just keep breeding and splitting off into new mutant lineages.</p>
<p>Also, to kill them with a virus, you need to get the virus <em>to</em> them. Via the bloodstream. Which is also a total mess around many a tumor. So, the parts with nice plumbing get virus'd and die, the rest, again, lives on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In theory yes, but we don't have the ability to design viruses that can be that specific yet.</p>
<p>The other issue is that every type of cancer is different, and sometimes even the same type of cancer, or even the same cancer within the same person will have significant differences. That makes it impossible to target all of them with one cure. You could potentially take a sample from a person, design a virus specifically targeting just those cancer cells and create a personalized cure for the patient. But again, we don't have the ability to do that yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this already is going on with adeno associated virus, and lentivirus.</p>
<p>CAR-T therapies use modified viral vectors to target white blood T-Cells, to give them the ability to seek our and destroy the canercous cells. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimeric_antigen_receptor_T_cell" target="_blank">Wiki on it here</a></p>
<p>There is also plans to use Lentivirus to help treat Parkinsons (Axo-LentiPD, and Sunrise Trial) by infecting the putamen part of the brain to restore dopamine production.</p>
<p>Same technology can also, and is being developed for heamophillia, many diseases effecting the eye (Wet AMD is a good example), and some other cancers.</p>
