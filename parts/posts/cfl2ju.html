		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The actual science behind soap was one of the most fascinating things I remember from OChem back in the day.  It's really kinda amazing.
Soap is a very very long carbon chain with a negative charge at 1 end.  The charged ends bond to the &quot;dirt&quot; particle which is always positively charged.  This makes the size of the small dirt particle become huge as it's surrounded by soap particles...now it is separate and large and easily flushed away by water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
