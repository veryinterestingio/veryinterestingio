		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is an interesting question!  I came across a very thorough review by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5090016/" target="_blank">Beale et al. 2016</a> which broadly discusses physiological rhythms in environments without clear daily cycling (of which the deep sea is obviously a prime example).  As u/wrathchilde mentions, there are plenty of organisms from various taxonomic groups that move from deep waters to shallow and back again in daily cycles, which generally falls under the umbrella of <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(14)01067-7" target="_blank">diel vertical migration</a>.  However, for organisms that permanently live at depths of over a kilometre, there is no sunlight which might be used to measure daily cycles, nor are there any regular variations in temperature on the scale of days or even seasons.</p>
<p>However, that doesn't mean that life in the deep sea is totally arrhythmic; Beale et al. cite several studies which have looked into this question.  Examination of the stomach contents of crustaceans (<a href="https://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/171/m171p221.pdf" target="_blank">Maynou and Cartes 1998</a>) and fish (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25052896" target="_blank">Modica et al. 2014</a>) from below 1000 m demonstrated mixed results, with some species showing apparent 24-hour cycles, but others having no clear pattern (though as the authors point out, it could also be the case that this cycling is actually a feature of the prey species being consumed, rather than their deep-sea predators).</p>
<p>Another study, by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967063707002002" target="_blank">Wagner et al. 2007</a>, looked at melatonin levels in fish collected from as deep as 4800 m, and found some not quite statistically significant evidence of correlation to lunar (i.e., tidal) cycles.  And finally, yet another study by <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0096924" target="_blank">Cuvelier et al. 2014</a> went a step further and decided to actually just record video of some deep sea communities over a few weeks.  They again found mixed results, with <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?size=medium&amp;id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0096924.g006" target="_blank">12-hour cycles</a> apparent in the behavioural patterns of tube worms, but not so much in the case of scale worms, sea spiders, or sea snails.</p>
<p>So to summarize, I think it's fair to say that the answer is kind of variable for different organisms; some appear to demonstrate cycling of some kind (though I'm not sure we can definitely call it &quot;sleep&quot; per se), while others don't seem to have any clear schedule.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about &quot;sleep&quot;, but the largest migration of animals on earth happens every day from the sea surface to the deep ocean.  If you consider 1000m deep, that is.  This certainly establishes a schedule, but who knows what the lanternfish are doing in their down time.</p>

<p>Here is an interesting TED talk by Heidi Sosik on the Twilight Zone: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJmwZhy9Suk" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJmwZhy9Suk" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJmwZhy9Suk</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This may not answer the question directly, but near the poles, there is no 24 hour cycle. It is &quot;day&quot; for 1/2 year, and &quot;night&quot; for 1/2 year. Many animals hibernate through the winter. During the summer many, like polar bears, also sleep, but not to a 24 hour rhythm.</p>
<p>Clarification: Only the pole has a true 1/2 year day, 1/2 year night. As you move away, it is more and more a daily cycle. But even 71^o north, summer is day only, and winter is night only. Spring and fall is more of a daily day/night.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
