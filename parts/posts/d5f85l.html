		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you fall asleep, your muscles are NOT totally limp and relaxed - specifically your breathing muscles. If you're a side sleeper for example, your neck, arms, and legs can also sometimes tense up in order to help keep you in a certain position so you don't stop breathing. </p>
<p>Spine alignment is also important. If you sleep with a hunched back, or a crooked neck, you can cause muscle bunching/stretching, as said in another comment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Muscle tension is what protects our muscles from being over extended / tweaked.  </p>
<p>When we fall to sleep in an awkward position, our natural tension in our muscles drops off, which would allow an already awkward position to lurch just a little bit more and cause stress to those muscles, meaning we wake up with cramps / pulled muscles.  </p>
<p>ELI5: Muscles need sleep too, sleepy muscles do sleepy things, like bend themselves too far.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That’s because when you sleep in an awkward position, some of the muscles go under a certain amount of stress. </p>
<p>Example: you fell asleep at your desk, your neck is completely flexed(looking down) so the muscles in the back of your neck(upper trapezius  lev scap etc) are stretched for the period of time that you’re asleep and stay that way, while in the front of your neck(SCM) are in a way contracted because they’re shorten.  So to recap this position, front of neck = tighter, back of neck = really stretched out. </p>
<p>Look up wry neck, pretty nasty stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
