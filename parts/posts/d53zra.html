<p>Setting lower difficulty tells the computer to look less far ahead, or to consider fewer possibilities before stopping.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally, when you set a computer to play at a lower difficulty, three things are happening:</p>
<ul>
<li>You're limiting the amount of time that the computer is allowed to &quot;think&quot;</li>
<li>You're limiting the number of moves ahead that the computer looks</li>
<li>You're denying the computer access to its opening book and its pre-selected &quot;good moves&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>So if you take a lot of that stuff away, you really limit a computer's ability to select strong moves.  It might not get so bad that it just throws its queen away and leaves its king open to an easy checkmate, but it might miss things like &quot;Oh, in two turns your knight can do some damage unless I move this pawn&quot; or &quot;if I don't move this rook now, I can be checkmated in 5 turns&quot; the way that a supercomputer would be able to calculate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short a computer is capable (with enough processing power) of looking at every possible move that could happen based on the current state of the board, and calculating the response to each move, and repeating this calculation until it hits the end of each possible list of moves. This builds what is called a decision tree. Once that tree is built, the computer can score it's potential moves based on how likely they are to lead to a win in the computers favor.  </p>
<p>Once all the moves are scored, it simply picks the highest scoring move and goes with that one. A difficulty setting may affect how moves are scored or it may require the computer to pick lower scoring moves so the game swings more in favor of the player.  </p>
<p>tl;dr - Computers can calculate the best moves possible, lower difficulty can force the computer to make weaker moves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
