		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quick reply before heading into lab, sorry for any spelling errors. The answer is not as easy or clear as one would think and how it is measured differs between which virus you are talking about, usually there are rules/systems.</p>
<p>For it to be a new &quot;virus&quot; and not a strain or subtype I would say it is a question about mortality rate, cells infected, drug resistance, reinfection or disease progression and symptoms.</p>
<p>As someone mentioned above, theoretically one single nucleotide mutation is enough if it leads to a difference in any meaningful way. In the most extreme theoretical case for a virus with three overlapping coding reading frames, this could lead to changing which amino acid is expressed for each of the three reading frames.</p>
<p>For SARS-CoV-2 for example we are tracking over 10 000 mutations, many are however silent. Which is the exact opposite to the above example. Silent means the three nucleotides in the relevant reading frame code for the same proteins even though a different combination of three base pairs in the reading frame (google codon table/graph), theoretically you could have 33% difference between two strains and they would express the exact same virus. In such a case, again extreme and theoretical, you however would expect to see a difference in expression and replication rate. When we make recombinant proteins we usually codon optimize them for the host system to maximize expression rate. Simply put, you can code for the exact same amino acid with varying combinations of three nucleotides and with varying levels of expression. Not done or read any studies on what the extreme variation could be.</p>
<p>One recent example would be SARS and MERS and COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2). The mortality rate is drastically lower but with a high degree of genetic similarity.</p>
<p>Take for example HPV (warts, cervical cancer) for which there are over 120 varying strains. These can be quite different indeed in many ways. If memory serves only are responsible for nearly all viral infections leading to cervical cancer cases. From the papers I studied I seem to recall exceeding a given % change (can't recall exact number) that is fairly large is enough to class it as new. Don't quote me on that one.</p>
<p>For HIV-1 we talk about subtypes and beyond that specific strains where the most important thing is drug resistance, which truly is an awful problem no one talks about. 80% of all strains in the USA have resistance against at least one drug. 15% of all new cases in SSA gain resistance against first line drugs during their first year of infection. It is assumed 60-80% of all with chronic diseases don't take their drugs as they should although there is some dispute to what extent is from this and what from mutations that arise regardless. As even with new novel multi drug setups we see mutations, although less so.  I could talk for hours about it, sorry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the simplest answer to this is &quot;When we decide it's useful to call it a different virus.&quot;</p>
<p>Classification is a human artificer on the world. Of you drill deep into any area of science, you find absurdly large grey areas in classification. Pluto isn't a planet, our moon might arguably not be a moon (instead we are a dual-planet system), what a &quot;species&quot; is is clear as mud, and changes depending on what you're talking about. Heck, the definition of what an &quot;organism&quot; is pretty loose, Stephen Jay Could wrote a fantastic essay on it. What's &quot;alive&quot; is about as agreed-upon as whether Star Trek or Wars is better.</p>
<p>In the case of a virus, it's mostly useful to classify it as a separate strain if it's recognizably different in it's behavior, usually in regards to infectivity, transmission, or treatment, especially with vaccine/antibody sensitivities. It could swap a whole gene out, but if it acts the same, we would probably not change the name, and maybe call it a variant. Classification is all about being useful to humans, so it generally just follows that rule.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mutations happen in the genome of any species.</p>
<p>The genome is like a book with recipes. Some organisms have a book of collections, some organisms (like viruses) have just a few pages.</p>
<p>Your question is closer to asking: how many mistakes can happen in a recipe for it to be considered a new, different food?</p>
<p>Change the grams of salt and it can be from unnoticed to inedible.</p>
<p>Change the maine meat from beef to turkey and it is a whole different plate.</p>
<p>Both are just a small mistakes of a few letters in the whole recipe.</p>
<p>Sometimes they matter, sometimes not and sometimes we have a whole different thing on our hands.</p>
<p>A virus could have 100 mutations that don't matter. Could get 1 and it kills millions of people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Due to the very 'volatile' nature of viral (and bacterial) genomes, it's very hard if not impossible to pinpoint the specific genes that make up a species. Human genomes, whilst incredibly divers in outwards appearances, is super conserved compared to microbial genomes.</p>
<p>As such, relatively recently bacterial and viral genomics have had a bit a paradigm shift. Instead of trying to rigidly describe a strain or species, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230885510/figure/fig5/AS:202801981464593@1425363168487/The-core-shell-and-cloud-of-microbial-genes-A-generalized-schematic-showing-the.png" target="_blank">they define it as a cloud of genes</a>. Some of these genes are essential for the species/strain, those are called the core genes. Around the core genes, there is a cloud of optional genes. Each strain picks a bunch of optional genes from the cloud, which will then be called the shell genes of that specific strain.</p>
<p>Now it sounds like a strain is a very specific set of shell genes + the core genes. But in reality, a strain itself will be sort of a mini cloud within the cloud with slight variations in less important genes. The differences between strains is then defined by variations in more important genes. This isn't so much a real hard and nature based rule, but more of 'what is important to humans.' For example, to us humans, antibiotic resistance is very important and thus likely to define a strain. On the other hand, a variation in the 46th amino acid of an enzyme in sugar breakdown that doesn't affect efficiency is not really important and 'part of the cloud.'</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
