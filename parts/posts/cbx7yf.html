		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I finally can explain something here and I'm late to the party. My son has situs inversus totalis. So everything on the inside is flipped to the opposite side. When the Drs were describing it to us I asked him for an ELI5. He said that when the baby is first forming there is basically what looks like a small piece of string on it with a loop on it about three quarters of the way up. That loop is typically on the right side and is the heart or at least where the heart forms. The rest of the organs form based off that loop. In rare cases (1 in 10,000) the loop forms to the left and the organs typically follow suit. The complications come in when they don't follow and form in their normal position and things get crowded. Many people with situs live their entire lives without knowing. Now that technology and imaging has come so far it's being caught more often. They caught my son's while still in the womb with an ultrasound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of folks here have mentioned situs inversus, but I thought I'd chime in to cite dextrocardia - literally &quot;right heart&quot;. Dextrocardia situs inversus is particularly interesting because the heart is &quot;chiral,&quot; just like the human hand. You can flip a right hand over, but that doesn't make it a left hand.</p>
<p>If you get a transplant from a donor without dextrocardia (which is quite likely because the condition is rare), the surgeons have to rearrange your bits so the blood vessels will attach properly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several factors involved, but essentially beginning from conception there are cellular cascades and signals that drive your dividing cells to end up in certain orientations. Itâ€™s mostly predetermined by the genes in each cell. The genes responsible for making a set of cells into one region of the body are turned on while the other genes would be turned off, and vice versa for the cells (which later develop into organs) destined to be on the other side of the body. There can be mutations in these genes that cause irregular development (e.g. flipped organs, and other things like spina bifida etc). </p>
<p>There are also chemoattraction and chemorepulsion mechanisms that could be at play, where cells are signalled to grow towards or away from certain chemicals being released from other cells. This helps guide them to the right developmental location. For example, our nerves are signalled to crossover in the spine (decussation) and branch out to certain areas in part by these mechanisms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
