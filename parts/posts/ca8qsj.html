<p>If it is true that you can be genetically obese then are those humans better adapted for this?</p>
<p>Would the human body be more likely to adapt to automatically store less fat, or to strengthen its organs/structure to be able to cope more easily with increased body fat?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If being overweight has enough impact on a person's average reproductive success (i.e. total number of children who survive long enough to reproduce themselves), it's not impossible that we'll eventually see human evolution select for people who are less susceptible, perhaps because they retain less fat, have less interest in fatty/high-calorie foods, or are simply more healthy with high body fat. (There are plenty of animals that are perfectly healthy with lots of fat, and would be quite unhealthy without it--look at seals, for example.)</p>
<p>But it is way, way, way too soon to see any evidence of that right now. The &quot;obesity epidemic&quot; has been a thing for a couple of generations at most. Try back in a few thousand years.</p>
<p>(And even that seems like a stretch, honestly. Obesity kills, but it usually kills in middle age or later, after many people have already had kids.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many answers asking for a sufficient selective pressure but most are forgetting about epigenetics. There is this famous case about a dutch famine decades ago (ny times article: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/science/dutch-famine-genes.html" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/science/dutch-famine-genes.html</a>) where unborn babies got the information about the famine through the mother by means of modification of genes. These are not mutations but rather some changes which decrease or increase expression of certain genes.
The same can happen with babies of obese people. These babies will get the signal that there is plenty of food available and the genetic modifications can respond accordingly. I am not aware of such a study but it would be for sure very interesting for the field of epigenetics. Great question!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
