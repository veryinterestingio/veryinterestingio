		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of stimulation like soft tickling. How many hands could tickle you before you started to feel overwhelmed, distracted, lose focus, laugh, scream, fall to the floor, etc?  For some people, just one or two hands tickling them is overwhelming. That's like an individual with autism who is <em>incredibly</em> sensitive. But for others, they could ignore it until there were like 30 hands tickling them all at once. That's like an individual with autism who might just be overwhelmed in crowds or around exceptionally bright lights or loud noises. Now imagine what happens to the sensitive person when 30 hands are tickling them. </p>
<p>And just like tickling, small amounts of sensory inputs might be really pleasant. But too much or for too long is really upsetting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

When there is suddenly too much noise moving objects etc. they are then unable to process all than information at the same time and can feel overloaded and overwhelmed by too much information at once and try to &quot;defend&quot; themselves from the excessive input. <a href="https://youtu.be/iSJ9tEzgoPg" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/iSJ9tEzgoPg</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you're at the store and suddenly the lights start flashing on and off really fast and you start hearing one of those car alarms that changes every few seconds but there's 10 of them at a time, also there's a 3 year old following you around crying really loud and tugging on your shirt, and you're trying to read the label on the bread but it's hard bc the lights keep flashing and you can't focus bc the car alarms and the obnoxious kid. Everyone else is going about their day just fine, telling you to tune it out, but how are you supposed to tune out this madness? It's driving you up the fucking wall and you can't get a break so you suffer til you can't take it anymore and leave without getting bread</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So basically what this comes down to is sensory regulation. Our body senses all sorts of information from our environment and also from our own body. Our brain takes that information and modulates - either increasing or decreasing these signals based on what is important.
For example, when you put your shirt on in the morning you can feel it on your skin, but soon after you brain modulates that so that you are no longer &quot;feeling it&quot;. Although technically the sensory information from your skin is still being sent to your brain, your brain is essentially ignoring it so you can pay attention to other more important things.
And our brain is doing this constantly. </p>
<p>But some people have difficulties with this modulation. So their brain maybe doesn't decrease the signal when it's supposed to - So they feel their shirt all day long.
Or their brain increases that signal so instead of just feeling the light touch of their shirt it actually feels more intense and maybe painful. </p>
<p>And then think about how that would feel knowing that this could be happening with a whole bunch of other things throughout the entire day.
So you are sitting there, trying to talk with a friend, but at the same time your shirt is hurting you and the lights are too bright and there are 15 people who are talking nearby who sound like they are yelling and the smell of coffee and the person sitting at the table next to you is also distracting and did you notice that that one florescent light is flickering. And you may or may not be consciously aware of all of these competing sensory input but you know that you are overwhelmed or distracted and just cannot make it stop. </p>
<p>And then add in that other things can make this feel even more overwhelming, such as when you are stressed about something socially or emotionally, or you're physically stressed from not sleeping well. It can be a lot to handle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
