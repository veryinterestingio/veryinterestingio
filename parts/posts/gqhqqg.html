		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So - the evidence would show the healthiest way of managing our thoughts and emotions is leaning to <em>regulate</em> them, effectively and flexibly (this a a central aspect of many,many different types of therapies). </p>
<p>“Bottling up” or suppressing emotions/thoughts  may actually be a really a really good strategy at times (eg. Yep - you’re captain on a sinking ship and you’re a scared.  Not the time to freak out or start talking in depth about your feelings)  </p>
<p>“Bottling up” your inner world becomes unhealthy when it’s the <em>only</em> ways you ever cope with emotions Because </p>
<ol>
<li>You may not even realise yourself that you’re distressed and need to do something to cope. Awareness of our own emotions/thoughts is the first step to managing them. </li>
</ol>
<p>That’s a key thing. There’s a lot of research on the difference between the self-suppression of an emotion (eg I don’t want to feel this) vs. Suppression of the expression of the emotion (eg. I’m the ships captain and I know I’m scared, but I’m not gonna freak out right now). </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If we don’t acknowledge and regulate our emotions/thoughts, distress builds up and up. And then we can act in impulsive and harmful/unhelpful ways (eg punching other people). This may seem cathartic. But it can actually be really damaging to our lives. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This can also have physiological effects (through chronic stress response) which can actually impact our physical health. Our nervous system is literally never getting a break or any down-time. As our brains and bodies are working extra hard to suppress/bottle up what’s happening inside us. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It can lead to a “catharsis”. Or bouncing between “bottling up” and “catharsis”.  For example, punching something and letting it all go may seem like a good idea. And occasionally it’s a great emotional release. But it can be overwhelming and dangerous. And If you go around “letting it all go” eg. punching things every time you get angry/upset, it’s gonna cause you problems. </p>
</li>
<li>Finally, Bottling up emotions can affect our relationships with others. Most human beings are social creatures and communicate and build connections and relationships through sharing their inner world with others. When we talk to a <em>trusted</em> person about what’s going on for us, we feel closer to them, we feels safer, they can help us acknowledge and understand our emotions/thoughts. This can even be non-verbal; other people can co-regulate with us, even on a physiological nervous sytem level. </li>
</ol>
<p>Phew. Sorry for the essay! Hope that’s of some help</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Discussing/writing  your emotions helps build an emotional literacy. It helps you understand how you’re actually feeling, what’s causing certain emotions, and helps you keep things in a realistic perspective. Talking to other people about your emotions is healthy too because it’s part of valuing your self worth and building connections with other people. </p>
<p>If you keep emotions bottled up you risk cycling bad thoughts on repeat, warping the narrative of your life, feeling isolated from other people and loosing a realistic perspective on situations.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a CBT (Cognitive behavioral therapy) POV, its mainly better to get those things out because memory is often tainted by extreme feelings, especially for strong emotions like Anger or Depression. Not to forget memories overtime can become falsified (Loftus scandal). When those two things mix it can overexaggerate what happened leading to larger problems like OCD (cognitive), Anxiety, Depression, etc. </p>
<p>By releasing and firmly understanding it, we can go back to the source and try to reevaluate what actually happened. This can alleviate many mental stressors by doing so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a trauma perspective:</p>
<p>When you have a traumatic incident, there are a lot of negative emotions tangled up with it (obviously). Here's the kicker: our memory is beyond shit and easily manipulated. So, the solution to removing some of the negative emotions surrounding a traumatic memory is to rework the memory, now with more neutral emotions. How do you do that? <em>You talk about the memory in a safe place, with people you trust, when you're ready</em>. Now your shitty memory has created new associations with your trauma. You are a bit more distanced from the negative emotions you had before. Of course those negative emotions may never fully go away, but they become less intense. This connects with the idea that whenever you remember something, you're actually remembering the last time you remembered it, if that makes sense. </p>
<p>An important detail here is that this doesn't work if you talk about the memory with people you don't trust, in an unsafe environment, or before you are ready. In those cases, you would actually be worsening your negative emotions about the trauma.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The idea of catharsis is really common, but most psychologists today believe that screaming or punching to release aggression and calm down doesn't actually work - it actually makes you more angry. It may feel good in the moment, but it doesn't actually relieve any stress. </p>
