		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Join us today at 2 p.m. ET (19 UT) to ask anything about NASA's recent technology developments for Electrified Aircraft Propulsion - the use of propulsors (propellers or fans) driven by electric motors to propel or help propel aircraft ranging from air taxis to subsonic transports.  From developing technology to aircraft concepts to flight testing, we're working toward a new generation of aircraft with a lower carbon footprint.</p>
<ul>
<li>We built and tested a lithium-ion battery pack that uses Space Station technologies to improve safety and reliability - already being used in other experimental aircraft!</li>
<li>We've doubled the temperature capability of soft magnetics for flight electronics.</li>
<li>We will soon be flight testing the all-electric X-57 Maxwell Experimental Aircraft in a 2-motor, 150 kW mode followed by a 14-motor, 300 kW flight test on a high-performance wing.</li>
<li>We are using what we learn on experimental aircraft and in laboratories to help write the design and test standards for electric propulsion system in future passenger aircraft.</li>
<li>We can't wait to answer your questions on how we're turning this idea from science fiction to reality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cheryl Bowman, Deputy Branch Chief for High Temperature and Smart Alloys</li>
<li>Sean Clarke, Principal Investigator, X-57 Maxwell Experimental Aircraft and Advanced Systems Development Engineer</li>

<p>What are some the challenges remaining for solid State batteries, and where do you see the most promising innovations improving the energy density:weight challenges with current battery designs?</p>
<p>Do you think improved fuel storage or propulsion efficiency is the bigger breakthrough for achieving commercialization?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, thanks for doing this!</p>
<p>So just as an FYI, I know virtually nothing about this, so forgive me if this is an overly simple question.</p>
<p>The big thing that I've always thought that somewhat hindered electric fueled propulsion is the weight of batteries.  For example, a Tesla car, because of the batteries, weighs almost as much as a pickup truck that is twice the size of the Tesla.  </p>
<p>I would imagine that weight is an extremely significant factor in aircraft.  So my question is:  what new ways are you addressing the weight of energy storage in your experiments and designs?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
