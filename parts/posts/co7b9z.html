		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ever seen a map view of a downtown city? The roads that lead between the buildings are relatively small, but they go everywhere, and every building is touching at least one street. These small one-lane and two-lane roads connect to larger roads, which connect to big highways.</p>
<p>In this image, each building is a cell, and all the roads are veins and arteries. When you see your veins, those are the major highways, the really big roads. You can't see the one-lane roads, because they are too small, and surrounded by lots of cells.</p>
<p>So when you cut your skin, it might be a &quot;downtown area&quot; of the city that is far from the highways, but that cut goes through a lot of small streets, and that means you bleed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your circulatory system isn't made up of a few very large veins and arteries but rather billions of vessels ranging in size from the big veins and arteries you know down to extremely tiny ones that go close to the surface of your skin.  Everything in your body needs blood for nutrients and oxygen, so we have a circulatory system to feed them.</p>
<p>That's why you bleed when cut, you're cutting the little tiny ones not the big ones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your circulatory system is composed of many types of vessels. The ones you see are the medium large one, that we commonly call veins. However most of the length of our circulatory system is composed of small vessels called capillaries that you don't see, and that derive from the visible vessels.</p>
<p>So when you cut very lightly, the blood pouring is the one from the capillaries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Veins and arteries are the super size sixteen-lane highways of the circulatory system. </p>
<p>There are many smaller types, going right down to capillaries, which are the little single track barely-marked-on-a-map roads. </p>
<p>If you cut yourself the blood is probably coming from one of these tiny smaller ones. </p>
<p>You don't bleed to death because your body generally is very good at plugging these leaks, closing the roads where there's blood being lost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the good answers about capillaries, it's also possible for very small or fine cuts to miss all the capillaries, in which case you don't bleed! Papercuts, for example, can be pretty large, but so straight and thin that no blood vessels get broken.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
