		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My girlfriend is about 34 weeks pregnant with our first child and she recently asked me if I knew what position you're supposed to lay babies down in to sleep. I said that I thought you lay them on their side, so that if they were sick in the night they wouldn't choke, but she told me that babies were in fact only allowed to sleep on their backs.</p>
<p>I obviously believe her and since going to antenatal classes they also said the same thing, so without question I will lay our baby on his back to sleep. I still feel a little bit anxious about doing it though. Maybe I'm thinking of the situation in adult terms too much, but I just can't seem to shake the worry that, similar to an adult who'd passed out, if he's sick while lying on his back he might choke.</p>
<p>Please can you explain why it's safer to lay him on his back and why it's unlikely he'll choke if he's sick in the night/during a nap.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Babies can't really lay on their sides.  They're pretty round and have little control over their limbs, so if you lay them on their side, they pretty quickly roll either to their back or to their front.  So your only options are on their back or on their front.</p>
<p>The evidence is overwhelming that babies are way less likely to die from SIDS if they sleep on their back.  It's not clear why that is (mostly because we won't experiment on babies and watch them die to figure out why, for obvious reasons); the leading theory is that babies on their front can end up with their mouths and noses in a position where they can't breathe and they're not strong enough to clear them.</p>
<p>Overall, being sick while on their back is actually not a big concern.  They have a functioning gag reflex which makes them spit out anything that gets in their throat.  The problem with adults is usually being drunk, which impairs the gag reflex and makes it possible to choke if liquid ends up in their throat.  Unimpaired adults don't normally choke on their own vomit either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off, congrats! Just to add to this, in addition to sleep position, the sleep environment is important in SIDS prevention. An easy way to remember how to make a safe sleep environment is ABC: Alone, on the Back, in a Crib. </p>
<p>Alone meaning nothing else in the crib. No stuffed animals, no blankets, no crib bumpers. Loose or fluffy bedding has been associated with an increased risk of SIDS, believed to present a suffocation risk. As for warmth, they make wearable blankets and a good general rule of thumb is to keep your house at a temperature that you are comfortable in wearing light clothing. If the house is that temp, the baby should be comfortable, but you can always check the tip of his or her nose and the ear lobes. If those are cold to the touch, turn up the furnace (and vice versa if things are too hot). </p>
<p>Back has been previously discussed. Sleeping on the back has been shown to reduce the risk of SIDS by up to 40%. While being demonstrably safer, the one trade off is a slightly increased risk of something called positional plagiocephaly, which is molding or flattening of the skull. To minimize the risk of flattening, being sure to do tummy time while awake and change the direction the baby is lying in the crib each night, since babies will often tend to look into the center of the room while they sleep. Doing those two things should give the head enough variation in position to avoid any flattening.  It should also be mentioned that this flattening is oftentimes very mild and is reversible most of the time. </p>
<p>Finally, crib. A firm crib mattress made specifically for infants is the best sleep surface. Softer mattresses also increase the risk of SIDS. </p>
<p>Best of luck with everything!!</p>

<p>Laying on it's back is the safest way to prevent sudden infant death syndrome. Your fear of choking is good, but know that newborns have enough reflexes to prevent it - also the esophagus is underneath the trachea, which helps a lot.
What you should most take care and be aware of is suffocation by things INSIDE your newborns bed. It should be completely empty at all times until it's able to move it's head by it's own. Keeping the airways clear is - obviously - also achieved by lying on the back.</p>
<p>You should make your newborn lay on sides/stomach as well for motoric development, but definitely switch to back when it falls asleep.</p>
