		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Computer Science</strong> : It’s the science (mathematics) of how computers inherently work. It would have an answer to this question: If I had a bunch of random numbers, what would be the fastest way to sort them, is it the fastest way? And why is it the fastest way. It often requires writing code but only to verify and quantify an idea.</p>
<p><strong>CIS</strong>: I’ve got this gigantic set of numbers and letters and words and other data. CIS will answer this question (amongst many other): How can I make sense of this data to find how they’re interrelated</p>
<p><strong>IT</strong>: I’ve got a business to run that requires selling lemonade. But because I’m a genius lemonade maker and the biggest one in town, I’ve set up many lemonade stands around town that are completely automated. IT answers this question: How can I effectively tie in all these lemonade machines to work seamlessly and serve customers without a moments delay? What computers do I need? How shall I set up my storage? What’s the ideal internet connection to use?</p>
<p>Edit: well shit, good morning to me. Glad this is my most upvoted comment! And thank you for the gold and silver!</p>
<p>Edit 2: Because some of y'all asked me to ELI5 some more, so here's my take:  </p>
<p><strong>Software Engineering</strong>: The customers of Lemonade Inc. need an app to order their favorite kind of lemonade right to their door step. A software engineer would be able to: Make an app that's easy to use, and can be installed on the customer's phone.   </p>
<p><strong>Data Science</strong>: Data science is (amongst other things) using lots of data to draw conclusions about a specific topic. If Bob opened the app made by the software engineer, given his previous purchases, which lemonade flavor can I suggest to him that he is most likely to buy? Also, can I perhaps make him buy another one by showing his wife's favorite lemonade right next to his so he would remember to buy her one as well?  </p>
<p><strong>Computer Engineering</strong>: Computer Engineering deals with actually making the physical computer that will physically run the programs made by the computer scientist or software engineer. Example: Hey computer science guy! I hear you want to run that new number sorting method on a set of 1,873,347,234,123,872,193,228 numbers! Oh, are current processors too slow because they need to do 10x more work than required for this specific task? Ok let me see what your method is, and let me perhaps build a custom processor for you to efficiently do everything in as much time as you expect. (Warning: this is a gross oversimplification of computer engineering, and they dont go around making new custom processors for everyone. I've tried to keep it simple and in line with the examples above!)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Computer Science in essence is academic, research focused, scientific. It concerns studies of AI algorithms, network protocols, security research, ... Not many people who study CS continue in this theoretical field, since the demand for practical applications is enormous. </p>
<p>CIS is the part of CS that deals with information gathering and processing. Again, there's a huge practical interest, given what Facebook, Google, etc. do. Smaller companies all try to implement their own versions. But there is also tons of research to improve their algorithms.</p>
<p>IT is a bit different, in the sense that its core business is managing computer infrastructure. They make sure all employees have the correct and up-to-date software installed, the servers keep running, the network is secured, etc. This is almost purely practical.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My rough take; each answers a different fundamental question:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computer Science: What is a computer? (What can a computer do?)</li>
<li>Computer Engineering: How can we build a computer?</li>
<li>Computer Information <del>Science</del> Systems: What can the computer tell us about this data?</li>
<li>Software Engineering: What problems can we solve with the computer?</li>
<li>IT: How can I <del>keep</del> make all these computers <del>working</del> efficient and secure?</li>
</ul>
<p>EDIT: I did not expect this comment to get so much attention! Please, do not base your academic or career decisions on these ELI5, one-sentence breakdowns. I think if you study in any of these fields you can learn enough to jump to any other in practice. Most of what you will actually use every day you will learn on the job or on your own time (if that scares you, you will have a harder time making a jump). The key is to learn <em>how to learn on your own</em>.</p>
<p>Please consult with people actually working in the industry. I myself have an electrical engineering degree, work mostly as a software/controls engineer, and have a passion for computer science. On a daily basis, most of my time is spent working with teams to solve practical problems where software is simply one tool in the box. Feel feel to ask me anything about these areas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
