These cells are part of the hair follicle which produces the individual hair strands. When the melanocytes die, the pigment that affected the color of the hair will be present in a less or non existent concentration, which makes hair translucent or, when coupled with 100,000 other hairs, appear grey.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hair follicles contain specialized pigment-producing cells called <em>melanocytes.</em>  These cells produce <em>melanin,</em> the pigment that gives your skin and hair their color.  These follicular melanocytes inject the melanin in to the <em>keratinocytes,</em> the cells that go on form the shaft of hair.</p>
<p>There seems to be some evidence that there may be multiple follicular mechanisms that slow the production of melanin by follicular melanocytes over time.  Some more recent evidence suggests that greying results from a failure of melanocytic stems cells to replenish the supply of mature melanocytes.  One way or another, melanin is not being secreted in to keratinocytes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Does anyone know what causes some people to go grey very young, while others barely go grey at all, even in old age? How much of it is genetic, and how much is other factors eg stress? </p>
<p>Husband and I are the same age (early 40s) - he is mostly grey (and had some greys already in his early 20s), whereas I have only a few. </p>
<p>A relative of mine is nearly 70 and still has mostly dark hair.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hairstylist and cosmetology  instructor here!</p>
<p>Your hair contains several parts. It grows from the follicle in the scalp and your follicles contain melanocytes that produce eumelanin (black pigment) and pheomelanin (red pigment). </p>
<p>Individual hair strands are made of the cuticle (outer scaley layer), the cortex (the inner layer), and the medulla,  which is only present in certain hair types. Melanin is located in the cortex and medulla. As we age the melanocytes in your hair follicle die off and the hair no longer contains pigment. </p>
<p>When you color your hair with permanent color to cover gray, the ammonia and hydrogen peroxide in color open up the cuticle to allow the artificial pigments to enter the hair. Some colors lift some of the natural pigment in addition to depositing pigment. They penetrate deep enough into the cortex and medulla that they don't wash out. Demi permanent color opens the cuticle a bit to allow the pigment to penetrate the shaft but not as deep, that way the color fades back to the original color.  Demi permanent color does not lift the natural hair color. Semi permanent color (usually unnatural fashion colors) only coats the hair strand. It does not alter the hair chemically in any way, and fades quickly.</p>
<p>Edit: Correction! The melanocytes don't exactly die off but they stop producing pigment. I believe cells produce hydrogen peroxide as a byproduct and as we age our hair follicles get worse at getting rid of the peroxide, this combined with the melanocytes causes gray hair. The hydrogen peroxide is also why gray hair feels wiry and stiff, because it's almost like your hair is being bleached within the follicle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
