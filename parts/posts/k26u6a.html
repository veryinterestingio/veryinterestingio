		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The bifurcated needle was used because it was one of the rare examples of something being: fast, cheap, and good.</p>
<p>The small pox vaccine needed to be delivered just under the skin.  Previously a jet injector had been used.  These basically fire a jet of vaccine through the skin with compressed gas.  Whilst quick they’re expensive and unreliable.  The bifurcated needle allowed the vaccine to just be poked under the skin, a dose could be delivered simply with some rapidity.  The needles were cheap to produce.</p>
<p>As far as I’m aware the smallpox vaccine is the only medicine to be delivered in this way.  Although the technology is still good, and we may see it used again in the future.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The bifurcated needle was developed to replace the jet injector (which is a similar method to how the BCG vaccine for tuberculosis is administered) because the jet injectors were often reused between patients without cleaning the injectors properly- to the extent that single-use sterile caps were developed to be thrown away and replaced between uses to prevent transmission of blood products between patients.</p>
<p>The vaccinia vaccine is frozen and the bifurcated needle was designed to be able to deliver one dose of the vaccine, holding the frozen vaccine between the two prongs of the needle (the bifurcated needle isn’t two needles, it’s one needle split at the end to form two prongs). To ensure proper vaccination is done, the skin is pricked with the needle up to 15 times in rapid succession (I like this <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/clinicians/vaccination-administration2.html" target="_blank">how-to</a> for clinicians from the CDC regarding vaccine administration).</p>
<p>As I mentioned, tuberculosis vaccination involves multiple needles contained within one apparatus, and I’m sure there are other vaccines that use more than one needle but they aren’t coming immediately to mind.</p>
<p>I realise as I’m typing this that it seems like a homework question, so r/HomeworkHelp is probably a better place to go, but I’ve come this far so I’m committed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answers here are a lot more scientific and probably better answer the question asked, but for any morons like me who didn’t even realize that there is no syringe involved with a smallpox vaccination:</p>
<p>The bifurcated needle basically holds a tiny amount of vaccine between two metal prongs using surface tension, and then the doctor jams it under the patient’s skin like 15 times until all the vaccine is stuck under the skin. Then the doctor throws the needle away. </p>
<p>Pretty genius because one bottle of vaccine can be used for hundreds of patients. You just need a supply of disposable bifurcated needles to keep things sanitary. Probably way cheaper to manufacture than syringes or the “jet injector” other comments mentioned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was intended to hold a droplet of the vaccine that was the right size.  You'd dip it in the vial and it held a single dose between the two spines.  Then poke it about a dozen times into their arm.  The doses were <em>very small  (</em>about 2.5 microliters) and not easily measured in any other low-tech, inexpensive way.  </p>
<p>Remember, the smallpox campaign was often vaccinating people in very resource-poor settings.  A single vial of smallpox vaccine could hold hundreds of doses.   How else would you measure an amount that small and then get it into the person's arm?</p>
<p>The bifurcated needle actually allowed for smaller effective volumes than the expensive air-jet pressure-gun that preceded it and at a much lower cost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
