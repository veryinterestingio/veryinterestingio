<p>Do doctors have to create a temporary channel for the blood to flow? People lost limbs before modern medicine, so I assume the body has a way to deal with it on it's own.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically you just close up the artery/vein any way you can, either through the blunt method of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauterization" target="_blank">cauterization</a> or by stitching it up surgically. Blood simply flows to the end of the artery's length and then back via the veins (it goes from the artery branches to the venous branches via the capillaries). It doesn't matter if it suddenly ends earlier than it used to. As long as the artery has been properly closed up and there's no internal bleeding, it's all good. Sometimes there will be portions on the end of the stump that aren't getting proper bloodflow, and they can be vulnerable to tissue death and gangrene, which may require a further amputation until you've gotten it right.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, long story short, there are two separate, parallel blood systems: the veaneous system and the arterial system. One moves blood away from the heart and the other returns it. This you know.</p>
<p>The two systems are connected only by millions of capillaries thought your body.</p>
<p>Think of an electrical system. You have a positive rail and a negative rail. All of the components connect to both, but at no point is the negative and positive directly connected except through other electronic components.</p>
<p>When something is amputated, a length of both the negative and positive rails, and everything connecting between them from the point of the amputation is simply removed.</p>
<p>All the connections before the amputation area are still there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Capillaries. Once blood travels away from the heart and hits a “wall” from the amputation, it follows the path of least resistance, (through the capillaries) and back to the heart.. It’s the same thing that happens in your toes and fingers every day!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those diagrams almost everyone has seen in school are over simplified rubbish. There are dozens of veins and arteries going all over the body so the blood doesn't have to go through the body in a big circle. </p>
<p>Do a Google image search for &quot;human circulatory system&quot; to see more realistic diagrams. Basically losing any limbs doesn't block the blood flow for the rest of the body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answers on here are great but leave out one important piece of the question.  All the arteries and veins and capillaries were functioning normally before the amputation - then you cut through all of them and disconnect the whole system. Kind of like unplugging all the wires in the back of your computer.</p>
<p>When you cut through all those arteries and veins (at least the big ones) you have to close them off either by stitching them up or by burning the ends. Now they become blind ending tubes.</p>
<p>The skin and tissue at the end of the remaining limb also loses a lot of its blood supply. But the body has a way to deal with that. All that healing tissue needs oxygen and nutrients to rebuild. So it sends out telegrams to all the leftover arteries and veins saying “hey I need oxygen!” (hypoxia inducible factor). In response, the blood vessels build new networks of arteries and capillaries (VEGF, et al) to route blood through the end of the limb, and then back to the remaining veins. </p>
<p>This is important, not just for amputation but any surgery, because if you cut through any of the body’s tissues the patient needs to have the ability to heal that wound. If there isn’t enough good arteries and veins leftover then it will never heal because new blood vessels can’t grow in that environment. Alternatively, if someone’s ability to make new blood vessels and/or tissues is compromised you get the similar result.</p>
<p>Hope that fills in a couple of gaps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
