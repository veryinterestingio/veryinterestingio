		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think maybe some background about how the circulatory system works in general would be helpful for helping this make sense.  A lot of people picture it like blood goes down an artery, loops down at the end of an appendage, and comes back up a vein.  So obviously if you cut off the end, how does the blood get across?</p>
<p>But it's not exactly like that.  Consider the plumbing system of a long, dead end street.  Water flows down the water mains, through individual pipes branching off leading up to the houses, through the pipes in the houses to be used in faucets and sinks and showers, then back down through pipes, then to the road, then to the sewer drain and back out of the neighborhood.  This is like how blood flows...down an a major artery, to smaller and smaller arteries, then to capillaries to be used by actual cells, then to bigger and bigger veins and back to the heart.  </p>
<p>Now imagine we amputate our part of the street....bulldoze a dozen houses down at the end of the street, tear up the end of the road, and remove the water mains under it.  Assuming the workers do their job and cap the mains, does this effect water flow to the other houses?  No, because those pipes were only supplying water to those houses that are no longer there.  The other houses aren't &quot;in the loop&quot; of the amputated houses...water that flows to one house doesn't ever go to another house, it goes to the sewer.  It's parallel, not series.  </p>
<p>Amputating limbs works the same way.  The veins and arteries that are cut are only important for supplying blood to the cut-off part, so their loss doesn't have a big effect on the remaining limb, which is still getting blood through the same route it always did.  And you certainly don't have to join any veins and arteries to each other, any more than you'd have to join the water main to the sewer pipe when removing the end of the street.  Instead, you just need to block them off so blood isn't lost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>(With an amputation, it's even more convenient, since all the destinations past the collapsed highway are also gone!)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
