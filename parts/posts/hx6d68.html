<p>The TL;DR is that they don't hurt anything, and may not help anything, but they also may help something, and no one really knows. They're certainly not a miracle cure or the effects would be more measurable, but they're also certainly not harmful.</p>
<p>edit: I'm getting a lot of replies saying &quot;so it's a placebo effect.&quot; To be clear, nothing in the link I posted says that. I'm also not personally aware of any studies that determined that. It <em>might</em> be a placebo, but it also <em>might</em> not be. We don't know. Please don't jump to the conclusion that just because we don't know if there are benefits or not, it's a placebo (indicating that epsom does nothing at all). The fact is that we just don't know. That's not the same thing as knowing it's a placebo.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
