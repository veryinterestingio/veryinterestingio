I lead innovation efforts at IBM, directing research strategies in areas including AI, cloud, quantum computing, and exploratory science. Under my leadership IBM became the first company in the world to build programmable quantum computers and make them universally available through the cloud. </p>
<p>I recently was appointed a member of the National Science Board, and as an advocate of collaborative research models, I also co-chair the COVID-19 High-Performance Computing Consortium, which provides access to the world's most powerful high-performance computing resources in support of COVID-19 research.</p>
<p>IBM is simultaneously creating the supercomputers of tomorrow: quantum computers. Ask me anything about the next great frontier of computing: quantum! </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since the milestone 9-qubit google experiment on state preservation in 2015 [1] the fidelity of 2-qubit gates for superconducting qubits seem not to increase beyond 99% - 99.5%. This appears to be a maximum number any group can achieve independent on the used coupling scheme (cross-resonance or dynamical flux control). These levels are certainly insufficient for useful quantum computation.</p>
<p>What is the reason of this stagnation? Precision of control electronics? Qubit lifetimes? What is IBM's strategy to increase fidelity beyond this level?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Recently, I read a few different articles that suggested that advances in quantum computing might end up being most useful in improving algorithms for standard classical computing. The argument that was made was that classical computers were (right now) less error-prone and more reliable than quantum computers, but that the creativity and innovation necessary to improve quantum computers was still relevant.</p>
<p>Do you agree with this? Or put a different way, in what ways is quantum computing superior to classical computing as they both stand right now?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How difficult is it to get a job researching quantum computing industrially? I just finished an integrated masters where i did a project on quantum computing and was thinking of trying to pursue a phd in it or another masters focused more on quantum computing than my undergrad was. I did electronic engineering. Its a very interesting area as before i was torn between trying to pursue a deeper physics degree or computer science degree, and this seems to be to some degree an amalgamation of both.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
