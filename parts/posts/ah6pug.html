		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sugar free candies everyone is mentioning are also made with sugar alcohols. The reason those candies aren't very popular is because sugar alcohols pass through the system mostly undigested, which leads to cramping, diarrhea, and other intestinal upset, but for the purposes of the actual structure of the candy, sugar alcohols closely mimic real sugar. The reason that sugar free candies made solely from aspartame, splenda, or stevia aren't really made is because, aside from taste, the appealing part of candy is the various textures of it, and those sweeteners can't even come close to replicating it.  </p>
<p>However, they do make <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SmartSweets-Alcohols-Artificial-Sweeteners-Sweetened/dp/B07253TH61" target="_blank">these</a>, but I've never actually tried them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They have. Since at least WWII. The issue is that these sweeteners change the texture of candies, often have odd aftertastes, and in the concentrations needed for candies often cause stomach and digestion issues. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We did a side-by-side taste test of Werther's Original regular and sugar-free candies, and the latter was surprisingly good, almost as good as the full-calorie version. But you wouldn't want to eat many at one time. You will get a tummy ache from the sugar alcohol, and some people are much more sensitive to this than others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
