You can also sort by brand and product for the chemicals. Most are flavorings; ammonium hydroxide (ammonia) is added to make the nicotine compound basic and more readily absorbed by your lungs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Be aware those &quot;there are 500 dangerous chemicals in cigarette smoke&quot; ads are highly misleading.  If you burn just about <strong>any</strong> organic material, a lot of chemicals get created, and most can be dangerous under the right circumstance, a campfire would produce about as many.  Water and carbon dioxide are both &quot;chemicals&quot; and &quot;dangerous&quot;, and both are produced by cigarettes.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, smoking is really, really bad for you, but that statement is mostly propaganda design to use people's ignorance about &quot;chemicals&quot; against them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The fact is that in American school. we were all taught not to smoke. and the way they tried to tell you was that cigarette companies are intentionally putting like 500 substances they list as if they were additives. when the fact is that as tobacco is combusted the plant is decomposed into all those substances from the heat of being ignited.</p>
<p>The leaves get decomposed into all of the substances, and you get the stuff that makes up smoke. it gets deposited in your lungs as tar. which directly damages your lungs . and somewhere in that smoke is the nicotine that wasn't destroyed from the heat of the flame.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh hey I know something about this. </p>
<p>So cigarettes are technically made of tobacco, they do some work to it first though. First they distill out the tobacco concentrate, I'm sure exactly how as their are numerous extraction methods. This leaves you with concentrate, and tobacco paper. The paper is shredded and will come back in later. This concentrate is deposited into vats where something called &quot;the mother liquor&quot; is made. This is where each cigarette company gets to make the most difference in their smoke. Things like burn time and flavor are regulated at this stage, but each company does it differently (Coca-Cola isn't the only corporation with a secret recipe). This mother liquor is then sprayed back onto the shredded tobacco paper, which becomes your cigarettes filling. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The &quot;purpose&quot; of all these chemicals is to produce a good product. Lasts a long time without going stale, tastes good, takes easy to a light, lasts for the right amount of time, etc. Just like any other product, tobacco companies have been optimizing and homogenizing cigarettes to be easier to produce, ship, and curate customer favor. </p>
<p>It's kind of neat, if only it wasn't straight up poison to your body. As others have stated, carcinogens are pretty much everywhere, especially when you burn things. From my understanding (totally open to correction) there isn't anything MORE carcinogenic in tobacco, other than nicotine, than you'd find in say common grass. The difference is people are constantly putting tobacco smoke in their lungs, and not many people go grab a clump of sod out of their lawn and light up when they've had a tough day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cigarettes are almost entirely additives and they are there to make the nicotine more easily and quickly absorbed to make the drug more efficient and addictive.  They use additives to make the molecule shorter so it absorbs easier into the bloodstream they change the ph so it is less abrasive on the lungs so it can be inhaled more deeply with less pain. </p>
<p>Modern cigarettes are not really tobacco. They take tobacco and liquify it to extract the nicotine. The solid matter left is made into paper and bleached. They then spray the liquified tobacco and additives called liquor back onto the paper made from the solids that are then chopped into the bits that fill the cigarette. Up to 1/3 of the product is recycled stale cigarettes that didnâ€™t sell within a certain time. </p>
<p>So compared to say a hand rolled cigar which is literally rolled leaves a cigarette is as about as processed as conceivable.  The twinkie to a pastry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
