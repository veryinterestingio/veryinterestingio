		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The fat, punchy rhythm of the drums are purposely mixed to sound aggressive combined with a chorus starting in a minor key which creates a sense of ugency. When the minor chorus is met with a major 4 and subsequent transition into a major 5 it resolves it in a way that feels like movement and progress are being made, like the relief you get when reaching the top of the stairs or doing the last rep in weightlifting. This is layered with a rising melody in the vocals that climb and reach a peak, especially right before it goes back into the verse. Because the verse is in a minor key and repeats itself, there's a sense that &quot;the fight is never ending&quot; creating a sense of perseverance especially with the return of the major keys later in the chorus. The song also clocks in at edit:116 beats per minute, which is about the fast paced walking speed similar to when you're in a rush, which adds to the urgency of a song.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are actually a lot of variables that go into this.</p>
<p>Music, and any creative work really, has a unique ability to cause our minds to experience feelings, ideas, and concepts more vividly than simply theorizing it. They can create atmospheres and convey feelings that are much more raw than what you would get from simply explaining them.</p>
<p>The musical key of the song contributes, as certain keys have been culturally associated with certain feelings (basically, a lot of sad songs are written in certain keys, so we perceive those keys to be sadder)</p>
<p>The choice of instrumentation contributes. Different instruments have different textures in sound, which can evoke different feelings in the listener. Some instruments emit higher or lower frequencies and those can be combined in all sorts of different ways to create different textures of sound. Drums especially do a lot of work for setting the momentum of a song.</p>
<p>The vocals, obviously, are a huge part of it. Not just the lyrics but also the delivery. The intonation and volume at which the singer is singing. The ways the vocals coexists with the other instruments of the song, how much emphasis is given to certain lines of vocals. If instruments drop out to make more room for the vocals, this can emphasize them and give them more weight.</p>
<p>The associations the music has with pop culture, and the context under which the music is played - in this case, Rocky. If you associate it with a movie scene about getting pumped up and ready to fight, the song is going to inherit those feelings from that association.</p>
<p>The melodies themselves carry a lot of weight in regards to energy and mood. This is basically the entire foundation of music theory and what it seeks to describe.</p>
<p>A good composer is mindful of <strong>all</strong> of these variables, and can craft a truly synesthetic experience out of sound. There's a reason composers like Beethoven, John Williams, or artists like Queen and Van Halen, are so highly regarded.</p>
<p>Might I recommend some Infected Mushroom? They make psytrance (and some adjacent genres) and their sound design is excellent. Listening to them with good studio headphones is an experience like nothing else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
