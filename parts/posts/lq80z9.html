		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you die from blood loss, you'd lose consciousness long before. </p>
<p>The feeling that makes you gasp for air is <em>not</em> due to lack of oxygen: it is due to excess CO2. So even though you'd be lacking oxygen on a whole-body scale, your CO2 levels would theoretically be normal so you wouldn't feel like you were suffocating.</p>
<p>Most likely, you'd gradually drift into unconsciousness and black out as the brain gets less and less oxygen</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I nearly passed out after donating blood because I was dehydrated. My ears started to ring, my vision got blurry/delayed/streaky like I was drunk, my muscles got delayed and less coordinated, and my face felt hot. Sorta felt nauseous. Leaning back with a cold towel on my forehead and a big drink of water and sugar/salt helped. It was definitely disturbing and I was glad to have nurses handy to help me get comfortable and get my blood pressure up again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The process of exsanguination (death from loss of blood) causes the heart rate to drastically increase in order to effectively pump what blood you have all over the body and most importantly to the brain. At some point, the amount of blood making it to the brain is not enough and you pass out. During this whole process, you become cold and dizzy because not enough blood is circulating around the body. You can feel extremely heavy/weak and, indeed, get short of breath with little feats of exertion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
