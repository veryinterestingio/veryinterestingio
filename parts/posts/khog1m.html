		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it depends on the degree. Regeneration only happens on the basal layer of the epidermis. Usually 2nd degree burns burned skins layers that goes beyond the epidermis. As a result, the regenerative layer is burned and cannot produce new skin layers anymore.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Skin has multiple layers - some regenerate faster than others.  Damage to the outermost and fasted growing layer will not leave a scar, but damage to deeper and more slowly growing layers will.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Destruction of the underlying tissue that makes and grows new skin keeps it from healing itself . And yes that’s how I’d actually explain it to my nephews and nieces that I have and had to do before . Then actually explain each word if they have or had any questions .</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many types of skin tissue, but there is only one kind of scar tissue.<br />
Scar tissue tends to knot up.  That is the scar.  It sits there, and can bind.</p>
<p>If you put long slow pressure on scar tissue it will relax and blend in with the surrounding tissue.</p>
<p>Example:  I had a botched operation on my forehead, think multiple stab wounds to the same location along with a ballbat hit.  Wore a tennis sweatband for most of a year and the scar is almost impossible to see.</p>
<p>Point:  scar tissue is scar tissue and looks like same.  Unless you learn how to blend it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
