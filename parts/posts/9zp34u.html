		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ability to find patterns was essential for human development, be it on understanding animal habits or the envioriment around us, therefore liking patterns was a good trait that was passed down the generations since the more patterns you were able to identify the better a hunter or farmer you were allowing for you to have more children that would share the same interest for symetry and so on until today</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Brains seek negentropy and organization. That makes things easy to catalog. 100,000 is much easier to remember than 115,125 even though they are close in value. </p>
<p>Being able to recognize patterns is essential for retaining information. It makes it more compressible. Even zip files use this, they recognize patterns, so instead of 77777777777777 they just record it as &quot;14 sevens&quot; and that takes up less memory space, yet no information is lost. Brains use those same &quot;compression&quot; tricks to be able to represent and remember more information. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans like symmetry in other humans and in food as it suggests good health and no deformities or issues that suggest some reason to avoid it.</p>
<p>The love for symmetry in general likely stems from both that aspect as well as a tendency towards creating repeating patterns. Patterns in turn allow humans to identify, communicate and understand one another, after all that's basically the concept from which all written and spoken language is derived.</p>
<p>The golden ratio is a bit of a tough one, there're a few theories, but many just raise further questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The human eyes and brain process images in the golden ratio more quickly than other aspects.</li>
</ul>
<p>This, first, raises the question of why that might be the case and also doesn't really justify why rapid image processing would feel &quot;satisfying&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>Because other humans and some animals tend to be roughly similar to the golden ratio, we learned to identify the shape rapidly and dervie small pleasure from it to draw attention when scanning a horizon.</li>
</ul>
<p>This features a bit of a leap; most animals and humans  <em>aren't</em> in the golden ratio, though they may be roughly approximate. Humans and predatory animals tend to be too narrow (thinner rectangle) and prey animals too tall (fatter rectangle). It also suggests that instinctively identifying the ratio rapidly would evolve a satisfaction response, which seems unlikely.</p>
<ul>
<li>It's a learned response, if there is one at all. Humans see a lot of useful objects that roughly fit the ratio (doors, books, milk cartons, etc) and learn to &quot;enjoy&quot; the shape.</li>
</ul>
<p>This theory can be questioned with the distinct reverse: that the shape of these objects are so designed because we enjoy the ratio in the first place. Beyond that, while many enjoy the golden ratio and many are indifferent to it, few enjoy other ratios more, despite other easy examples (lamps, soda bottles, chocolate bars etc feature thinner rectangles typically, but few prefer that ratio).</p>
<hr />
<p>Ultimately, jury is still out on the golden ratio and many claim there's no instinctual appreciation for it in the first place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no proof the humans prefer the golden ratio more than any other ratio. </p>
<p>The phi ratio that Fibonacci and others discovered carried some fetish among some lesser artists and lesser mathematicians, like Pacioli, looking for a secret to beauty in paintings. There's none. You can't reduce art or beauty to a formula. That is why Pacioli's roommate, another famous artist, ignored that ratio in all his works. That roommate was Leonado di Vinci.</p>
<p>Humans however do search for patterns to reduce complexity and comprehend reality in smaller units. It also means patterns made of well-known ratios are easily ignored by the human brain. If your art needs attention, then avoid known patterns.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
