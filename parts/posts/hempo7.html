		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically there's always some Radon floating around, but generally not very much</p>
<p>Radon is primary created by the decay of Radium in the ground which turns into gaseous Radon.</p>
<p>If you happen to have cracks in your foundation and live in an area with elevated Radium levels then Radon from the surrounding soil can enter the basement, and since basements tend to have poor air flow it will &quot;accumulate&quot; there, basically this means that your basement is always sitting at a reasonably high level of radon, not that it will keep increasing over time.  It'll strike a balance between the production/leakage into the basement, and the decay of the Radon in the basement</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in the health physics field and we sometimes do radon studies as part of our work. In a nutshell, we worry about radon in basements because it's heavier than air. Radon is continually made if there are radioactive elements in the dirt around your home, which is common in most soils but especially some areas such as along the Rocky Mountains. A basement is essentially a hole in the ground for radon to seep into if it can find any cracks in the house. In a typical home, this is no problem for it and you'll end up with radon getting into basements or low-lying areas.</p>
<p>ELI10, Radon is produced as part of a uranium decay series, and exists naturally in all soils. Where you have high uranium and/or elements it has decayed into, you'll end up with high concentrations of radon as the decay process is continually occurring. The thorium decay series will also cause a different radon to form as it decays, often called thoron. What makes radon more &quot;dangerous&quot; than either uranium or thorium, which are relatively safe in their natural environments, are that it goes through a phase change. It goes from a solid (radium) to a gas (radon) back to a solid (polonium) . This allows it to move from the soil into your home and onto surfaces such as dust as it changes phases. This makes it easy to inhale and give a dose.</p>
<p>Installing a fan in your basement or under the slab mixes up the air, diluting the radon and lowering its concentration. In the same sense, during our studies outdoors we see radon under windy conditions drop to near zero, and in calm conditions we see much higher radon levels. It just gets mixed into the rest of the atmosphere and dilutes to low levels.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Radon has a short half-life, but it's always being produced. It itself is the decay daughter of another unstable isotope.  I believe the ultimate source of it is actually uranium with a million year half-life.</p>
<p>To stop getting radon in an area, first all the uranium has to be go away, either, mining, fission, or decay. Then everything produced by uranium has to go away. Again mining, fission, or decay.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I spoke with a guy at Argonne National Lab about this during an open house some years ago. Radon is the product of radioactive decay. Typically it doesn't really exist in soil levels as deep as your basement, and older homes don't typically have radon problems, so what's happening? A lot of cement is produced from aggregates quarried in Colorado, and the rock there has high concentrations of radioactive isotopes. The radon is coming from the concrete in your basement. When barometric pressure is up, gasses stay in the concrete. When pressure goes down, you get an influx. Your radon detectors might even go off. Then you open the windows and let it vent and the problem seems to go away. Radon can occur in regional water sources, since aquifers can go pretty deep. The problem is not that there's radon in your water. When you fill a cup of water from your sink, the agitation from the faucet is plenty to knock all the radon out before you get the cup to your face. The problem is when you're taking a shower: you've basically chosen to isolate yourself in a box of radon, and you're not running for your life.</p>
<p>Radon mitigation is as simple as adequate ventilation in your basement, and there are filters I think you can install if it's in your water, but your municipal water supplier can also build mitigation into their water towers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
