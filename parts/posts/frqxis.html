		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a clock on the motherboard driven by a quartz crystal that vibrates at a fixed frequency. That is connected to a counter chip that simply tots up the number of pulses from the crystal and sends out a pulse of its own when the count reaches a certain value, the number of pulses in a second. It's just the same as the way billions of digital clocks work.</p>
<p>It's the reason that there is a small battery on the motherboard, to power the time keeping circuit even when the power is off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Computers have a &quot;real-time clock&quot; which is powered by its own battery that's always running. This clock is also updated when the computer connects to internet. This clock is then used to measure time intervals. The clock uses crystal oscilation to generate a solid frequency used to measure time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ELI5:
You know those sprinklers that go tk-tk-tk-tk and sort of work their way around in a circle... But make that constant ticking noise at a fixed rate. So imagine the electricity is the water. The mechanism vibrates when a constant water source is connected.
There's a circuit that does this too, and since you know it &quot;ticks&quot; at a specific rate, you can count time with it.</p>
<p>More specifically, it's a crystal/quarts oscillator. It turns out that quarts, depending on how it's cut, produces a an AC wave at a specific frequency when driven from a DC source, convenient! So these extremely accurate crystals are what's used for that.</p>
<p>Hopefully that makes sense!

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few ways a computer can keep track of time.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Internet synchronisation - a central Web server broadcasts the time for every timezone. The computer needs an Internet connection to be able to be in sync.</p>
</li>
<li>Built in clock - if you saw a naked motherboard, you'll be able to see a coin-like battery (the same type they use for watches). Even though the computer is disconnected from the Internet, the battery can keep the internal clock ticking so that the computer will still be displaying the correct time when you turn it back on (without net connection).</li>
</ol>
<p>For the more technical answer, modern timekeeping is based on atomic clocks. Atomic clocks measure the number of oscillations of a cesium atoms. Really complicated and mathematically heavy but let's just say scientists pegged the length of a second to the time a cesium atom produces a particular number of oscillatotions/atomic vibrations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add,</p>
<p>The clocks used in consumer grade electronics are sensitive to geometry, material properties - and most importantly, HEAT. This will cause frequency drift. That means clocks will run faster when hotter and slower when cooler. Since the clock is THE reference point on the computer, there is no way of knowing the amount of drift going on.</p>
<p>In practice, the drift is small, nearly irrelevant for most use cases, especially in consumer grade electronics. If the system drifts a few fractions of a second over the course of a year, it's not going to throw your world in to chaos, clearly.</p>
<p>But that's where standard reference times come in. Your computer, with an internet connection can sync with some atomic clock attached to the internet. There's variability in that process, too, but it's way better than using the time reported on the news as your reference.</p>
<p>Atomic clocks don't vary in the way oscillators do. Typically they drift due to relative speed of motion and quantum effects. Naturally, they're expensive, require cooling down to near absolute zero, etc.</p>
<p>You see some fancy clock mechanisms used in some electronic equipment. Rubidium clocks are far more accurate and stable than a typical quartz clock, and quartz clocks can be &quot;oven controlled&quot;, also known as XOCO's. You wrap a quartz clock with a heating element and insulation, keeping its temperature stable to within 1 degree. Then you wrap that in another heater and insulation to dial in the temperature to a fraction of a degree. Holding the clock temperature stable makes the clock extremely stable. You'll see this sort of stuff around telecommunication equipment and radio transmitters. Still no atomic clock, but the more stable the frequency of the clock, the more accurate you can dial in your radio transmissions. Also, super computers. Modern super computers are composed of nodes on a network, but each node isn't a standalone computer - that's cluster computing. No, super computers are big, and take up entire data centers; and yet you have to keep all these components synchronized because they're all parts to one singularly large computer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
