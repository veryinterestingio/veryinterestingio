Does one big pod(?) of dolphins make a huge beacon of sonar that allows each dolphin in the group to see what the others are seeing? If not and it’s comparable to “how can you tell when your mother or sister calls you?”, is it the frequency that each individual dolphin uses to determine which sound was theirs? Can they only hear one frequency at a time? If not, underwater must be so loud...</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually can answer this specifically for moustached bats. I’m not sure if a similar mechanism exists for other animals that echolocate, so I can’t speak to dolphins or anything. </p>
<p>So as you probably know, bats hunt in huge swarms, so it’s important for a bat to be able to distinguish his own echolocation call from that of other bats. When the bat makes a call, he listens for the harmonics of that pulse in the returning echo, specifically the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th harmonics. The difference between the echo and the initial call tells the bat all sorts of information about whatever the call bounced off of, including size, shape, speed and direction of movement, etc. It’s so finely tuned that bats can tell when an insect’s wings are moving forward vs backward and use this to predict their motion. </p>
<p>The bat has a clever mechanism for ensuring that he only hears his own echo. The first harmonic of the call comes out very quietly, too quietly to be picked up by other bats. However, the bat itself hears the call through its own skull, rather than through its ears. The bat’s brain will only respond to a <em>combination</em> of the first harmonic with any other harmonic of the call. If it only hears the 2nd or 3rd or 4th, it won’t react. It has to hear the first and one of the others. And since it can’t hear the first harmonic of any other bat, he can only be following his own call. So the first harmonic acts as a sort of password to ensure that the bat is not even hearing any of the other hunting calls</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR: Yes. <a href="https://www.dolphincommunicationproject.org/pdf/GreggEavesdroppingReview.pdf" target="_blank">Link</a>. Echolocation requires two sounds - a) the original sound, b) the echoed sound. The difference between the sounds is how they 'see.' If a dolphin can hear both the 'original voice' and the echoes, it can interpret the sonar signal/visual, but in a less detailed way.</p>
<p>This means a dolphin can see by using the clicks and echoes that originate from another dolphin.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Anytime a creature makes noise, the sound is traveling into their head as well as out to their surroundings. You can observe this by humming, and then plugging/unplugging your ears. The sound changes because you are hearing either a) the sound as it traveled through your skull, or b) the sound from the environment <em>plus the sound through your skull</em>.</p>
<p>When animals echolocate, they hear a reference sound (through their skull) and an echo (from the environment). The difference between these sounds is what allows the creature to 'see' and it gives them their normal resolution. This is one way a dolphin knows which echo is theirs, so they can tune out other clicks.</p>
<p>Echolocation has a limited range and resolution. Some studies put a dolphins limit to <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4684-7254-7_3" target="_blank">seeing a 75mm object from 11m away</a> (seeing 3-inch object from 35 feet away). This varies by material such that soft targets, like meat, are more difficult to detect.</p>
<p>However, the study linked in the TLDR explains how scientists know this. They silenced a dolphin's echolocator using an insulated plastic membrane, then put a speaker in the tank. The speaker made echolocation clicks. The dolphin, which couldn't produce its own sounds, could use the speaker's sounds to find objects (but took longer, and was less accurate).</p>
<p>This all means that there is a limit to what a dolphin can see through echolocation, both their own and the echolocation of other dolphins.</p>
<p>Additionally, different species of dolphins use different frequencies and click patterns when echolocating. This means that the only way for dolphins to 'see' what other dolphins detect is if they are of a similar species (conspeficics).</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>To clarify:</p>
<p>Dolphin A can hear Dolphin B clicking and understand &quot;Dolphin B is using a pattern that is used to look for fish, therefore Dolphin B is tracking a fish.&quot;</p>
<p>Also, Dolphin A can hear Dolphin B clicking and understand &quot;Dolphin B is 2m long, facing east, moving away, tracking a fish that is 1m long, and they are both 10m below me.&quot;</p>
<p>Then Dolphin A makes its own clicks and understands &quot;Dolphin B is 1.75m long, facing east, moving away at 0.5m/s, tracking a fish that is 0.6m long, and they are 9.8m below me.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I forget the video but, it explained the complexity of dolphin communication is so difficult to “translate” mostly due to their range of hearing. Scientists were able to conclude the dolphins they studied had specific calls for individual divers. Yet in an attempt to reply back by playing a type of soundboard, they felt like nothing was conveyed to the pod. Their speculation was that there were overlapping frequencies being sent from the dolphins that were not recorded because they may be out of range of their equipment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
