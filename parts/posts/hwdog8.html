		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am an interdisciplinary scientist and, in 2001, obtained my Ph.D. in Geological, Marine, and Environmental Sciences from the University of Trieste (Italy). I have been an astrobiologist at the SETI Institute's Carl Sagan Center since 2009.  My office and lab are based at the nearby NASA Ames Research Center, which I joined for my NASA postdoctoral research that was focused on the habitability of subsurface biospheres during a robotic drilling mission simulation in the Rio Tinto's underground (Spain).</p>
<p>I enjoy doing science to advance our understanding of the universe we can see and to inspire old and new generations of my fellow humans - from any latitude, longitude, and altitude - to pursue happiness through scientific knowledge, exploration, and discovery.</p>
<p>For the past 15 years, I have expanded my interest to the habitability of mineralogical Mars analogs, in particular as a science team member and field instructor joining NASA's Spaceward Bound expeditions to remote places including the Mojave Desert, Antarctica, Atacama (Chile), Australia, New Zealand, Israel, the Namib Desert, and the Tibetan Plateau (see links below). My ultimate goal is to achieve a broad picture of where life and its signatures are most successfully distributed, concentrated, preserved, and detected. This knowledge helps us to understand how to search for life beyond Earth. To achieve this goal I am involved in a broad array of research, laboratory, experimentation, and field exploration activities.</p>
<p>For instance, I have been studying the distribution of life indicators in Death Valley National Park (California) in support of the Curiosity rover mission and other planned searches for life on Mars. Last but not least, over the past three years, I have been implementing innovative laboratory experiments to simulate the plumes of the Saturnian moon Enceladus and similar environments to support future flyby missions to detect life on distant Ocean Worlds.</p>
<p>More specifically, I have been working at the Ubehebe Volcanic Field (UVC), in Death Valley National Park, where I am applying results from this research to support missions to Mars such as the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission objectives in collaboration with MSL scientists. In Death Valley, I have been conducting long-term monitoring of the weather/climate and surface water cycle, formation, and stability of short-lived water bodies, source-to-sink of sedimentary clay minerals (clays) to support the astrobiology of clays and life detection protocols.</p>
<p>Another project relates to Planetary Protection (PP) involving contamination control plans to clean, disinfect and sterilize spacecraft-like hardware and certifying cleanliness levels using non culture-based biological assays e.g., LAL (Lymulus Amebocite Lysate) and ATP (adenosine triphosphate) Luminometry. The ultimate objective is to prevent biological contamination of terrestrial origin on other planets. I was Co-I of a NASA funded PP project (2008-2011).</p>
<p>I am also passionate about sharing what I do with students, teachers, and the general public. So, I have gotten busy with a variety of education and public outreach projects. In close collaboration with the National Park Service, I volunteered to support Park Ranger programs for several years, culminating with MarsFest Planetary Science events in Death Valley.  I have also led field trips for the Road Scholar Lifelong Learning program for the Death Valley Natural History Association in 2014, engaging senior citizens to explore planetary analogues. As a former elementary school teacher (1988-89), I believe that outdoor, hands-on science education is the best way to go to learn the beauty of the scientific method and that everyone can do it. In addition to being a scientist, I have been engaged and led Education and Public Outreach events with non-profit and corporate organizations since 1989.</p>
<p>Last but not least, I have been involved as an instructor during the one-week Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) summer camp since 2011 and led the Field Program as Director for the past six years.  The REU program is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to the SETI Institute and managed by M. Tiscareno (PI). The objective of the field trip is to engage the REU interns to explore the biological and geological features of extreme and planetary analog environments in the framework of the astrobiology research done at the SETI Institute.</p>
<p>This year, due to COVID-19, I am converting the hands-on field trip into a virtual format. During the AMA day I will be at the SETI ATA facility - in Hat Creek - to visit the nearby Lassen National Park and obtain visual material to share and discuss online with this year's REU Students!</p>
