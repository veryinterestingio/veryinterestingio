		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Waterlogged soil is anoxic - there is no oxygen for the roots to “breathe”, so the cells die and are consumed by soil microbes. Additionally, the roots which plants grow when cut and placed into water are slightly different than “soil roots” and are designed for metabolism in water rather than an aerated medium. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is because of the presence of bacteria and other micro organisms in soil.  Usually the soil is well aeriated but when it becomes water logged, the organisms start to compete and start to eat other competitors. That's why the roots start to rot.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>Also, if the presence of water is too much, and very little is used, then it forms a hypertonic condition in the roots and this causes the cell walls of the cells in the roots to break and causing the lysosomes to release chemicals ( I don't exactly remember which) which break down the rest of the cells in the roots. This could also be a reason. I just remembered this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are supposed to change the water every few days when growing roots. Also, water by itself is less of a breeding ground for anaerobic bacteria as there’s less nutrients and more gas exchange.</p>
<p>If there’s water sitting in your soil, there’s basically zero gas exchange, so oxygen will deplete and anaerobic bacteria will thrive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I do hydroponics / aeroponics with plants, but mind you: only as a hobby. This is a hobbyists explanation. (Initially wrote this as a reply, but then decided it might stand on its own? You decide.)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Root rot is also a risk when you are &quot;only&quot; using water / a nutrient solution. Root rot is partly caused because the roots do not get enough oxygen, and partly can be / is caused by bacteria.</p>
<p>To keep the risk low, you keep the temps of your nutrient solution low and blow lots of air through it, using air stones like from aquariums. You can also add a bit of H2O2 to help keep your nutrient solution free from bacteria causing rot. At the same time this increases oxygen levels in your solution to prevent the roots from &quot;suffocating&quot;.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You CAN hang your plants directly into the reservoir / the nutrient solution, this is called &quot;Deep water culture&quot;.</p>
<p>Or you hang them into a container or pipe of some sorts and spray or drip your nutrient solution onto the roots, then let it flow back into the reservoir and repeat the cycle.</p>
<p>There is also a technique called &quot;Ebb and Flow&quot; which basically means you flood the plant roots with nutrient solution completely, then let it flow back into the reservoir and give the plant roots some time to dry off. Repeat cycle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>And to add on to all the points about bacteria that people have been making there's also an abundance of beneficial bacteria.</p>
<p>I'm an amateur at some hobby hydroponics and one of the things that I've learned now the semi-hard way is that you can't fight nature but you can harness it.</p>
<p>My most recent crop I nearly lost due to trying (and failing) to fight some sort of infection with peroxide and similar disinfecting agents. I talked to some more experienced hydroponics growers and ditched the h202 in favor of a concentrated beneficial bacteria product; In a week I went from literally losing all the protruding roots and nearly losing the plant to having almost the most root mass I've ever seen in plants this young. </p>
<p>It massively out competes the damaging bacteria in my reservoir <em>and</em> does a lot to help the plant grow stronger and faster.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
