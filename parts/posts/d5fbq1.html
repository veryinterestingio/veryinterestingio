		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey AskScience! My name is <a href="http://www.people.virginia.edu/~htc3rw/" target="_blank">Thankful Cromartie</a>, and I'm a graduate student at the University of Virginia Department of Astronomy and a Grote Reber Doctoral Fellow at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Charlottesville, VA. My research focuses on a special class of neutron stars called millisecond pulsars. </p>
<p>Yesterday, a paper I led along with my colleagues* in the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (<a href="http://nanograv.org/" target="_blank">NANOGrav</a>) collaboration was published in Nature Astronomy. It details our measurement of what is very likely the most massive neutron star ever detected. The source, called J0740+6620, weighs in at 2.14 solar masses. </p>
<p>In short, this result was obtained by observing a general relativistic effect called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro_time_delay" target="_blank">Shapiro delay</a> in a pulsar-white dwarf binary system with the <a href="https://greenbankobservatory.org/" target="_blank">Green Bank</a> telescope, and combining that data with five years of NANOGrav observations of the pulsar. No other neutron stars have measured masses that exceed 2 solar masses outside their 1-sigma confidence intervals, so we're really excited about this result! The main motivation behind these kinds of measurements is to constrain the very poorly understood neutron star <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_state" target="_blank">equation of state</a>.</p>
<p>The paper can be found <a href="https://rdcu.be/bRdPP" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a href="https://go.nature.com/307tCUg" target="_blank">here's</a> a more accessible summary of it that I wrote for Nature Astronomy. You can find me on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/HannahThankful" target="_blank">@HannahThankful</a>. </p>
<p>I'll be answering questions between 3:00 and 5:00 pm ET (19-21 UT). Ask me anything about pulsars, using them to detect gravitational waves, the neutron star equation of state, observational radio astronomy, astrophysics grad school, or anything else you're curious about!</p>
<p>*I want to especially highlight my close collaborators on this work: Dr. Emmanuel Fonseca at McGill University, Dr. Paul Demorest at NRAO Socorro, and Dr. Scott Ransom at NRAO Charlottesville.</p>

<p>EDIT: I'm going to be answering questions for a while after 5pm. This is fun!</p></div></div>
