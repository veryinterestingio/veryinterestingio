		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The aspect ratio of the source material doesn't fit or match the aspect ratio of your screen. </p>
<p>A widescreen HD TV is 16:9. Old non HD TV was typically 4:3. A lot of movies now aren't filmed in 16:9 they're filmed in an even wider 21:9 aspect ratio, so they still get &quot;letterboxed&quot;.</p>
<p>As to why movies are still filmed in this (and other) wide formats, I can't tell ya.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cinema is often shot at 2.39:1 (that was intentionally wide in order to differentiate films from 4:3 television).  When it was relatively new, movies could be considerably wider.  A few movies from the very wide era, remain classics today.  </p>
<p>Your 16:9 television was picked as a compromise between the classic movie format of 2.39:1 and the then 4:3 standard of TV.  The idea being that there would be bars on each type of content but the bars would average out to being smaller than if other sizes were used.  TV pretty quickly matched the new screen size, and some movies followed, while other movies are still shot in the older wide formats.</p>
<p>In both 4:3 and 16:9 television formats, movies can be shown with black bars, or cropped to fit the narrower screen.  Broadcasters make a choice based on what they believe their audience would prefer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This may explain part of the reason:</p>
<p>Most TV shows and commercials are shot with an aspect ratio (height vs width) that fits your wide screen TV. However, some movies old and new are shot in a wider aspect ratio. If they showed the movie on your TV the sides of the images would be cut off. So you can see the whole image (as it was meant to be seen) they put black bars at the top and bottom.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the risk of repeating what others say, here's my version, with how I understand it, and my own questions:</p>
<p>So originally movies were filmed in the ratio 4:3, where for every 4 inches wide it's 3 inches high. Let's call this &quot;square.&quot; So we're talking about like the old silent movie and black and white days. The &quot;square&quot; is the shape of pictures and film reels, so it all made sense.</p>
<p>The TV's came out so logically they made them the shape of movie screens.</p>
<p>Then the movie business was afraid of losing customers to the convenience of TV so they started filming wider screens to offer a grander experience. But that meant there was no one standard any more and you had different ratios all over the place. Thus black bars.</p>
<p>Then widescreen TV's came out because now they had to catch up and because there's no one side for movies they came up with 16:9, which is kind of in the middle of everything. So that's gonna mean different size black bars for different movies.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>What I don't understand is NEW TV shows that have black bars- this must mean that TV show producers are choosing to film wider screen than what fits on common TV's. Which I don't get.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
