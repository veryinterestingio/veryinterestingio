		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you have a flashlight, it will illuminate a few feet in front of you. Not very bright, definitely not as bright as a high-powered lamp. But, if you move quite far away from a person holding a flashlight, you can still see the flashlight, even if you can't see anything it's illuminating.</p>
<p>Same with cell phones. The signal may be weak, but it can still be &quot;seen&quot; by the tower from very far away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it this way:</p>
<p>Cell towers are shouting really loud, so that your tiny cell phone can hear its message even when you're far away.</p>
<p>Cell towers are also listening using extremely large ears (antennas) so that they can hear your tiny cell phone whispering from far away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The important thing is the ratio between broadcast strength and receiver sensitivity.  You phone and the cell tower should have the same ratio, but naturally the cell tower is going to have both better transmitters and better recievers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, These are NOT high power broadcast transmitters. Your average modern cell tower only radiates about 35 dbm (3 watts) . Standard 5g cell phones can transmit up to about 33 dbm (2 watts.)</p>
<p>Its all about the antennas.  (we landed men on the moon with an 11watt radio.... and a very nice antenna...)...</p>
<p>The antennas focus the radio energy so the receiver can &quot;see&quot; the transmitter even though the power level is very low...   A good receiver only needs to &quot;see&quot; about -90 dbm (0.000000000001 watts) to pickup the signal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cell towers are much more sensitive to all the cell phone signals than your cell phone is, they also have much more processing of the signals to clean it up and fix bad packets,etc.  </p>
<p>When you look at old cell phones from the really early generations, they were so big because their transmit power had to be so high since there were so many less cell towers around. </p>
<p>Like Zachs phone in saved by the bell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
