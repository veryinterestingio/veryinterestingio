		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, whales can and do get the bends. When examining the skeletons of dead sperm whales, scientists noted patches of dead bone, which is a telltale indicator of the bends. See <a href="https://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/feature/even-sperm-whales-get-the-bends" target="_blank">this</a> article from the Woods hole oceanographic institute for more info.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually isn't this the whole idea behind why some whales beach themselves? Recently it's been proven that military sonar makes whales surface quickly, subjecting them to the bends and they get beached in the process. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One reason why they don't get the bends - or get it as badly - is that they do not hold their breath. Instead, they load up their muscles with oxygen, breathe out, and then submerge, surviving on that stored oxygen until they surface and breathe <em>in</em>. </p>
<p>So there isn't much high-pressure air, with its toxic nitrogen, in their lungs to be absorbed into their blood. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The bends are caused by inhaling pressurized/too much nitrogen at depth which escapes your blood and tissues as the ambient pressure decreases as you surface. This is a danger for SCUBA divers because the pressure regulator that's used to allow them to safely breathe at depth equalizes the pressure of the gas being inhaled with the current ambient pressure, which increases at depth. Whales don't inhale at depth, they suck in air on top and do not breathe again until they resurface. That means that all the nitrogen they inhale is at surface pressure.</p>
<p>I am neither a lungologist nor a whaleologist, though, just a diver, so, I might be completely wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I thought you can't get the bends unless you're breathing from a tank? Isn't the point basically that when you breath from a tank while compressed, you have to let that decompressing air out as you rise?</p>
<p>But if 100% of your air comes from the surface, then there is not change in volume regardless of how deep you go... Right? Which is why free divers don't release air as they surface from deep dives.... Or am I totally misunderstanding all this? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
