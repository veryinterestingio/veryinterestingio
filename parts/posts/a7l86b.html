<p>This is commonly referred to as the &quot;square-cube law&quot;. Basically, the strength of something relates to its cross-sectional area - how thick it is. If you scale up something by a factor of 2, then the cross-sectional area of the arms/legs/etc increases by a factor of 4, i.e. the square of the scale factor.</p>
<p>However, the <em>weight</em> of something increases with its <em>volume</em>. This increases as the <em>cube</em> of the scale factor. So if you double the scale, your object now weights 8 times as much.</p>
<p>In practice, what this means is that small things can support themselves with very thin spindly legs, while large things need very solid legs directly underneath them. If you want to scale up an ant to human size, you can't keep its legs in proportion, or else it will just collapse. You need to make its legs much bigger, and more directly under its body, or else it won't even support its own weight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/Astrokiwi has it right with the square-cube law, and I'd like to add that you can observe this law in humans alone as well. Smaller people can in general lift more as a ratio of their bodyweight than large people, or do more reps of a bodyweight exercise like pull-ups.</p>
<p>Just as an example, the world record Olympic weightlifting total for 69kg men is 359kg, and for 105kg men is 437kg. That's a bodyweight ratio of 1.52 but a strength ratio of only 1.22. In fact it's even worse than the square-cube law would suggest for the big guys in this case because they also have a higher bodyfat composition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thankfully, ant and similar exoskeletons don't hold up at larger scales; at that volume to weight, their &quot;walls&quot; would give and their insides wouldn't stay inside anymore. No giant arthropods either, not without redesigning how their frames handle all that increased weight. So giant engineered antlike creatures? Maybe. Giant ants? No.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't listen to these guys, the ant wouldn't be able to lift anything because it wouldn't be able to breathe. It would just die. That's why large insects don't exist in the first place, there's not enough oxygen in the air for them to grow larger and still breathe. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No.  Ideas like this </p>
<ul>
<li>Scaling an ant or a spider up to human size, or city-sized monster </li>
<li>Scaling a human down to ant sized or microscopic The Magic School Bus sized</li>
<li>Scaling a toothpick and marshmallow or hot glue popsicle stick  structure you build for a class project, up to the size of an actual building</li>
</ul>
<p>depend on, among other things, the assumption that all geometric features scale lineraly, when they do not.  </p>
<p>For example, suppose we very roughly approximate the shape of a spider's body as sphere, with eight thin cylinder legs.  </p>
<p>The cross section of the leg would be a circle, and the area of a circle scales according to A=pi*r^2, meaning that if you increase its radius, the area increases according to the square of the radius (eight legs would still scale according to the radius: 8A=8pi*r^2).  Whereas the mass would be proportional to its volume, which scales according to V=(4/3)pi*r^3, and an increase in the sphere's size means that the volume (and the mass) increases according to the cube of the radius.  </p>
<p>Because cubed growth (1, 8, 27, 64) is much faster than squared growth (1, 4, 9, 16), when the spider model is increased in size, the change in mass of the body will quickly &quot;outpace&quot; the change in the cross section of the spider model's legs.  And if it were possible to do it in real life, a giant spider, scaled up preserving the exact same shape, anatomy, and physiology, would have trouble holding up its own weight.  </p>
<p>In fact, for similar scaling reasons, ants blown up to enormous sizes wouldn't be able to breathe (which depends upon diffusion rates across a membrane, or a &quot;surface area&quot;) or carry out other metabolic functions (not just stand or lift things).  </p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why having both monster movie sized insects and skyscrapers made out of the cheap materials used in desk-sized elementary school projects is not going to happen.  </p>
<hr />
<p>In general, these are called scaling laws (with one of the most famous being called the &quot;cube-square&quot; law), and in biology, when applied to living things and the anatomies or the geometric limitations on the metabolic processes happening within them, they're called allometric scaling laws, and the topic within biology that includes this is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allometry" target="_blank">allometry</a>.  </p>
<p>It's a really interesting concept because it provides a relationship between biology and fundamental laws of physics, saying that the anatomies that living organisms can achieve is related to or constrained by <em>geometric properties</em> of living in a three dimensional universe governed by laws of physics.  </p>
<p>And because it deals with this very universal underpinning (how the geometric or physical laws of the universe affect body &quot;shape&quot; or shapes within the body), it provides rough explanations of patterns observed in biology across <em>enormous</em> scales, like providing an allometric relation or a scaling law that can describe the resting heart rate in mammals both as small as a mouse and as big as an elephant, or an equation describing the metabolic rate of organisms ranging from ones as small as bacteria to ones as large as blue whales.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
