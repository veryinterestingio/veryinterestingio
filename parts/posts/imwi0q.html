		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lets say you have a piece of paper. A standard, off the shelf piece of single-sheet printer paper (those ones that come in reams of 500 or so) is around 0.08mm thick.</p>
<p>If you fold this piece of paper in half, you're doubling its thickness, from 0.08mm to 0.16mm. Do this 42 times, that is 2^(42), or 4,398,046,500,000. Multiply that by 0.08mm (and convert that to km) is 351,843.72 km.</p>
<p>The distance from Earth to the Moon is about 384,400 km.</p>
<p>Not quite there, but perhaps the original theory used paper slightly thicker than 0.08mm. If we had a piece of paper 0.0875mm thick, then that's 384,829.07 km. We've made it!</p>
<p>Now, if we fold this 0.0875mm thick paper a 43rd time, then the distance reached is  769,658.139 km. Notice the large jump in distance? 44 times? 1,539,316.28 km. We're starting to get to some really large numbers.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Just for completionists sake; 103 times is  887,355,420,000,000,000,000,000 km. That's a lot of football fields. ;-)</p>
<p>Edit: fixed a few typos. And oh boy, did this little comment blow up! Thanks, and thank you OP for the fun question!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some maths:</p>
<p>A standard piece of paper is around 0.1mm thick, so fold that once and it doubles to 0.2mm thick, fold it again and it doubles again to 0.4mm thick, so...</p>
<p>0, 0.1mm</p>
<p>1, 0.2mm</p>
<p>2, 0.4mm</p>
<p>3, 0.8mm</p>
<p>4, 1.6mm</p>
<p>5, 3.2mm</p>
<p>6, 6.4mm</p>
<p>7, 12.8mm</p>
<p>8, 25.6mm (just over an inch thick)</p>
<p>9, 51.2mm</p>
<p>10, 102.4mm</p>
<p>11, 204.8mm</p>
<p>12, 409.6mm (so for the Americans, that is well over a foot thick after 12 folds)</p>
<p>13, 819.2mm</p>
<p>14, 1638.4mm (so 14 folds in and it has now rocketed past a meter thick)</p>
<p>15, 3.3m</p>
<p>16, 6.6m</p>
<p>17, 13.1m (17 folds in and it is now notably taller than most two storey houses)</p>
<p>18, 26.2m</p>
<p>19, 52.4m</p>
<p>20, 104.8m (20 folds in and we have now broken 100m)</p>
<p>21, 209.7m</p>
<p>22, 419.4m</p>
<p>23, 838.8m</p>
<p>24, 1677.7m (24 folds and we are well past a kilometer, and broken the mile thick mark)</p>
<p>25, 3.5km</p>
<p>26, 6.7km</p>
<p>27, 13.4km (27 folds and we are now well above the typical cruising height of a plane)</p>
<p>28, 26.8km</p>
<p>29, 53.6km</p>
<p>30, 107.3km (30 folds and we have now reached the edge of space)</p>
<p>31, 214.7km</p>
<p>32, 429.4km (32 folds and we have passed the height the ISS orbits)</p>
<p>33, 858.9km</p>
<p>34, 1,717km</p>
<p>35, 3,435km</p>
<p>36, 6,871km</p>
<p>37, 13,743km</p>
<p>38, 27,487km</p>
<p>39, 54,975km (if the folded paper fell over at this point, it would be long enough to stretch the full way around the equator)</p>
<p>40, 109,951km</p>
<p>41, 219,902km</p>
<p>42, 439.804km </p>
<p>So at 42 folds, our paper is now 440 thousand kilometers thick, around 55 thousand kilometers taller than the moon is far away from the earth (around 385 thousand km)</p>
<p>Screw it, let's keep going to the sun...</p>
<p>43, 879.6 Mm (megameters - 1000 km)</p>
<p>44, 1.75 Gm (gigameters - 1000 Mm)</p>
<p>45, 3.51 Gm </p>
<p>46, 7.03 Gm</p>
<p>47, 14.0 Gm</p>
<p>48, 28.1 Gm</p>
<p>49, 56.2 Gm</p>
<p>50, 112.5 Gm (we have now blown past mars)</p>
<p>51, 225.1 Gm</p>
<p>So not only does it only take 42 folds to make it as far as the moon, but you only need to fold your piece of paper an extra nine times to get to the sun - 150 million kilometers away (or 150 Gm for those following in scientific notation)</p>
<p>A quick note at the end to say this was done as quick 'back of the fag packet' maths, and based on a paper thickness of 0.1mm (as provided to me by a quick Google search) - so use a slightly thicker paper and that tiny difference in thickness will very quickly add up into a different end number, and that is assuming I didn't make any silly errors on the way (though I got the same number of folds as expected, so I shouldn't be too far wrong). Either way it is quite nice to see the numbers written down like that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
