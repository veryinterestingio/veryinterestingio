		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At least in France pruneau (prune in English) are made from a specific kind of plum. <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prunier_d%27ente" target="_blank">This one</a></p>
<p>Others plums can be dried but don't have the exact same taste, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prunus_domestica" target="_blank">look very different</a>, bigger, smaller, red, yellow and usually round.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I say at least in France, because France is the origin of the prune (this word means plum in French, probably someone got confused when importing the fruit from France), prune are named pruneau here. And usually USA has the habit to industrialise and change traditional recipes to make them cheaper, so it's possible you get prune juice in USA made from whatever (even apple).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is some confusion about naming.  </p>
<p>Commonly, in north america, Prune is the term for dried plums and plum refers to the fresh fruit. Americans were squeamish about the term &quot;prune&quot; because of the supposed connotation with them being laxative so the industry switched to &quot;plum&quot;, so prune is an obsolete term for plum. Prune juice, for whatever reason, didn't get changed.   </p>
<p>Prunus is the subgenus, of which plums are a member.  </p>
<p>Also, the varietals of plum grown specifically for drying are called prunes.  </p>
<p>Long story short, you're drinking plum juice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
