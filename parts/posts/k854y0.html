		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The trend is believed to have started with the 16th century Syphilis epidemic. Syphilis caused patchy hair loss and men started wearing wigs to cover over the embarrassment.</p>
<p>The next major change was in 1655, when the King of France started losing his hair and started wearing a wig. Thus it became fashionable.</p>
<p>The trend lasted until the 18th century. The French saw the wig as a sign of the aristocracy and the fashion was done away with during their revolution. Shortly their after the English levied a tax on wig powder and their wealthy elite simply stopped wearing them.</p>
<p>Interestingly though courtroom uniforms in many countries still use wigs. This is a leftover from this time as wearing a wig and cape was considered part of formal dress like a suit and tie are now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They used hair pomade to help style the hair, but the pomade would be greasy without powder.  Powder made dark hair look grey, and light hair look white.  Wigs simply reflected hairstyles of the day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
