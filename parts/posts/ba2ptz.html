		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's several steps in the wash that have a variable length, mainly the spin cycles.</p>
<p>The machine will try to balance the load in the drum by speeding up and slowing down. It then tests if the load is balanced by speeding up and sensing how much wobble there is. If there's too much it slows down and tries again.</p>
<p>This can take anywhere from 1 to 5 minutes and for a long cycle happens 3 or 4 times.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Often the delay will be caused by an uneven load during a spin cycle. My machine is a front loader and if the load isn't balanced it will keep restarting the spin cycle until it balances. So the timer says 8 minutes remaining for as long as it takes to balance the load. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The time remaining is dynamic and can change based on inputs from the machine's sensors.</p>
<p>Mine often beeps to say it's done, but then won't unlock the door for another minute or so. Bitch, you weren't done! Beep a minute later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yeah those aren’t “timers” per se. The machine has a lot of sensors to tell the state of the load inside and it’s estimating how long is left. </p>
<p>It’s the same as when a computer tells you that installation will finish in two minutes but actually takes 30. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
