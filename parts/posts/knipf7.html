		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've always been amazed by the crispness of details the images modern book printing houses produce. The color saturation and edge bleed are spot on. How do industrial printers accomplish this and how come my laser Canon at home can't compare? I'm aware of the basic principles of laser printing - the laser ionizes parts of the paper to create a negatively charged ink mask to which positively charged ink particles get tacked on to then everything is rolled with a hot roller, however how do they reach the resolutions and color densities? Does it all just have to do with the laser beam width and ink particle size?</p></div></div>

The dyes they use have the consistency of honey, and correspondingly higher pressures to make them flow.  They expend a lot of effort if the machine has to be turned off, even for a day.</p>
<p>Your inkjet printer uses at dye that's &gt;50% alcohol, so it can sit for weeks without clogging itself up.  It's also designed to be used by a literal 5-year-old, so it's not adjustable in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and it costs $100-ish.  A Heidelberg press will cost you $500K, plus $500-$1000 a day in maintenance fees/parts/supplies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is not going to be fit for a five year old, but I can explain it to you. Most of the answer is in the paper (and the coating on the paper) and the careful calibration of the machines. Once you get a nice surface, via a special absorptive coating or other methods, you can put down plenty of ink or toner and have it stick. </p>
<p>You can get nearly professional quality with inkjet coated papers and inkjet printers at home. Personally, I don't know of a home laser printer that would provide photo-quality printing, they may exist but I doubt it. The inkjet coating allows the print material to hold a lot of ink, which results in the high optical densities (aka high saturation). Museum reproductions of fine art are made using inkjet-coated substrates like canvas and paper and high end inkjet printers. The inkjet print heads are very accurate at metering out consistent droplets at insanely high rates, so the machines can be dialed in to have very fine detail. Almost all of the tiles with wood grain and other designs are printed with inkjet. The vast majority of the portraits and photos from drug stores and costco are inkjet. </p>
<p>For industrial xerography, the machines run on essentially the same technology as your home laser printer but with finer resolutions, more colors, and way way better calibration and print material. Some of these machines will add a specialized coating to the paper right before they print on it to maximize image quality.</p>
<p>There are other processes but those are vastly different from your home laser or inkjet printer.  Offset or Flexography are the technologies if you want to look them up. Essentially these are highly accurate stamping machines. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even amid the spectrum of consumer printing technology, color laser printers are not known for their fidelity, only their speed and economy. Inkjet printing is way more messy, with those inks that can spill or dry out, but it’s also capable of much better resolution and color fidelity. There’s a reason why all high end consumer photo printers are inkjet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My laser printer can almost match litho (or offset) and is certified by Xerox to be 99.8% litho accurate. However it is a commercial printer, not a home laser, and comes with it's own RIP that is a literal Linux PC to match colours, and be the brains. The cost alone for it is around 4k a month, but that is for a LOT of print, like 250,000 sheets of SRA3. It prints anything up to 450gsm gloss too, which I doubt any home printer could handle.</p>
<p>Bleed is not an issue, as nobody ever prints edge to edge commercially, the media is always trimmed afterwards. Edge to edge print is not really a thing still, as it creates too many issues with ink going on the bed. </p>
<p>My inkjet however prints better than most CMYK litho, as it has orange and blue inks, CMYKOB which really make some designs &quot;pop&quot;, but then that is a commercial &quot;giclee&quot; printer too, so was 10's of thousands new (I rent with a service and ink/toner plan on both my printers though).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they are using printing presses. Your printer may be 1,200 dots per inch. Those printing plates were made at usually well over 2,000 dpi, and often over 4,000 dpi. And then they were printed with ink by a professional who ensured the right amount, and then they were perfectly dried on the way out. It actually takes quite a bit of wasted paper to get the run going just right to produce the copies you see. They also tune the ink absorption in the paper to the type of ink they're using to ensure spread isn't beyond an acceptable limit. There are a huge number of inks and papers available to them. </p>
<p>The high resolution also enables a higher line per inch in the pattern for your photos. The photos may also look better due to using a six-color press. </p>
<p>And unlike your printer that has to make almost all colors out of a combination of the few they have on board, presses can use spot colors -- a pass of the press using an ink that is exactly the color they want. So you may see a bright bold red off a press-printed page, but it'll be muddled coming off the laser or inkjet printer. That red will be one solid field of ink of that true color  instead of other colors mixed (like a photograph print) to achieve the perception of that color.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
