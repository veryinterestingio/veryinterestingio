		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a strong social factor in depression, so the first question should be: did pre-historic/pre-agricultural Homo sapiens suffer from depression?</p>
<p>That said, there's been been quite a bit of research in chimps. Captive chimps frequently develop depression-like behavioral disorders</p>
<p>p.s. regarding the first point above: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A correlation between depression and modernization predicts a very low prevalence among hunter-gatherers. Community-based investigations of mental disorders using cross-culturally valid diagnostic tools among traditional populations are needed to assess this possibility. There is scant evidence that depression is rare among people living close to the human EEA, e.g. the Kaluli of New Guinea (Schieffelin, 1986), the Thai-Lao of Thailand (Keyes, 1986), and the Toraja of Indonesia (Hollan and Wellenkamp, 1994; Hollan and Wellenkamp, 1996). The rare case studies of depression reported by anthropologists should be interpreted with extreme caution since there was no systematic community sampling, nor formal diagnostic instruments used. Departure from a hunter-gatherer living is an opportune window for insight into the effects of modernization. The Ik of Uganda purportedly become more depressed upon shifting from hunter-gather to agricultural practices (Stevens and Price, 2000). After indigenous circumpolar peoples rapidly modernized, there was a rampant incidence of diabetes and suicide rates tripled within a decade (Shephard and Rode, 1996).  </p>
<p>Other lines of evidence suggest modernization is associated with depression. Indexing modernization by measures of belief in magic, hunting, gathering, agriculture, and technological complexity, a cross-cultural analysis of community women in rural Nigeria, urban Nigeria, rural Canada, and urban U.S. found the degree of modernization to correlate with a higher prevalence of depression in a dose-dependent manner (Colla et al., 2006). Adoption of the American lifestyle appears to explain higher rates of depression in Mexican Americans born in the U.S. compared to Mexican immigrants (Vega et al., 2004). As metropolitan China has undergone rapid cultural transformation over recent decades, the risk of suffering from depression appears to have risen dramatically: in a retrospective study, Chinese born after 1966 were calculated to be 22.4 times more likely to suffer from a depressive episode during their lifetime compared to those born earlier than 1937 (Lee et al., 2007). In developed countries, urban dwellers have a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders, and specifically mood and anxiety disorders, compared to rural counterparts (Peen et al., 2010). British households rated as more traditional, e.g. church-going, have lower rates of depression (Brown and Prudo, 1981). In an investigation of affective disorder prevalence among the Amish, a community that maintains a traditional agrarian culture with notable unity and social connectedness, the prevalence of MDD was found to equal that of bipolar disorder- about 1% (Egeland and Hostetter, 1983). The above evidence suggests higher depression prevalence and risk is associated with general aspects of modernization.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Molecular geneticist here— I’ve studied molecular evolution and have conducted meta analyses on ancient DNA. </p>
<p>We have some ways of detecting, through specific genetic sequencing, if “early humans” have similar genetic markers that would make them predisposed to suffering from mental conditions, such as depression. <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6274/737" target="_blank">Here is a paper published in Science</a> that discusses (in depth) how certain Neanderthal DNA sequences are enriched in anatomically modern humans (AMHs). </p>
<p>Since AMHs and other early hominid species coexisted in time and geographical place, there was the potential for (and there is definite evidence that) these species interbred and thus, “modern humans” still carry a percentage of Neanderthal DNA.</p>
<p>The authors found that areas of Neanderthal DNA associated with neurological/psychiatric conditions were significantly <em>enriched</em> (they showed a higher prevalence than expected) in AMHs, and thus they speculated that these regions may have conferred some benefit to early humans (or perhaps, these regions responsible for neurological “disorders” may, at certain levels of expression, have allowed for enhanced communication, increased spatial awareness, hyper-vigilance, and “higher-level” thinking/problem solving, etc. </p>
<p>Several studies have shown a correlation between high IQ and certain psychiatric conditions, so it’s possible that these regions (which may confer a “negative” effect now), once conferred a very strong positive effect and were under high selective pressure to be maintained in the population— explaining why we see a higher prevalence of these regions today than we would expect. This doesn’t mean that a genetic predisposition for depression was beneficial, at any point, though. It may have been located close to a region that was very beneficial and it simply genetically “hitchhiked” to a higher frequency than it should have. The paper is long and full of jargon, so if biology/evolution is not your background, but you’re still really interested in this topic — I’d be happy to provide a more comprehensive analysis of the paper and its findings! :) </p>
<p>However, as others have said, since mental illness is a biopsychosocial phenomenon, we would need evidence of anthropological or social/behavioral clues to know whether “depression” was experienced in the same way by Neanderthals as it is defined now... and whether it was something that was advantageous in itself or if the genetic markers for depression rose to a high frequency due to simply being genetically linked to a different region, which may have provided the possible benefit of lower levels of cortical arousal (perhaps giving the advantage of remaining calmer in stressful situations?). You could write an entire thesis on this topic alone— from a molecular evolutionary, archeological, anthropological, psychological, or neurobiological standpoint (I could name some more, but I think you see how vast and interesting of a question this is). </p>
<p>Overall, if this is something that interests you, look into it! Check out google scholar and look for Neanderthal dna and depression, or anthropological evidence for neurological conditions in early human species. There’s a fair amount of research in the area, but there’s a lot of speculation too. </p>
<p>Anything that interests you or if you find topics you have questions about— feel free to send them my way. This does fall slightly under my area of study (though I’m less familiar with ancient DNA and anthropology, I could brush up on it to help decode some of those long methods-based papers if you’d like) — it’s interesting to me too!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As /u/Pokk97 mentioned - we have good evidence that higher order primates can become depressed.  We also have seen it in some higher order marine animals as well (e.g., a mother orca showing behaviors that could be categorized as depressive after separation from her baby).</p>
<p>If we establish that chimpanzees can suffer from depression, then we can look back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimpanzee%E2%80%93human_last_common_ancestor" target="_blank">our closest common ancestor</a>.  Since that ancestor is not living, we cannot conclude anything definitive about it.</p>
<p>From that split, one branch became modern chimpanzees and another branch ultimately evolved into humans including many side branches that are now dead-ended, such as Neanderthals.</p>
<p>It is possible that depressive behaviors independently evolved in the chimpanzee line at some point after the split, and then also independently evolved in humans, <em>but not any of the intermediary species</em> between our common ancestor and modern humans.</p>
<p>However, that is not particularly likely.  Depression is not fully understood but it can be treated by altering brain chemistry that is not unique to humans, so it is likely that a depressed chimpanzee would respond to anti-depression medication the same way a human being would.</p>
<p>Lastly, simply having the anatomical potential for depression is not the same as observing it clinically.  Again, as /u/Pokk97 pointed out, depression is a combination of potential and environment.  The environment in which H. Erectus lived vs. a modern human lives is so different that a clinical diagnosis of depression in an H. Erectus might never be possible, even if the fundamental diagnostic brain chemistry in a depressive modern human example and an H. Erectus example were the same.</p>
<p>Anthropologically speaking, it is not particularly likely that Neanderthals or H. Erectus would be depressed.  They were too busy simply surviving day to day that they likely did not have time to consider their level of happiness as it would have been overshadowed by their basic needs of food, water, and shelter.  The characteristic lack of motivation that comes with depression would probably not manifest in the same way as it does today, as even modern depressive individuals usually still feed themselves.  Since that activity occupied more of their time, the symptoms of depression might be impossible to even observe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can induce depressive like states in rats through social isolation, so I’d assume that certain factors can lead to depression in all forms of mammals. I’m not a psychologist by any means, so take it with a grain of salt, but I’d assume that if rats and chimps can get depressed, Neanderthals could as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
