		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I recently got my BCG vaccine as I work in a lab but when they informed me of the blistering and scaring phase I was a little perplexed.
What makes the site blister and scar only after several weeks/months? I know it’s to do with your immune system reacting but what is specifically involved / what’s the processes involved and why does sometimes it cause such a prolonged severe reaction at the site of injection? ( How come its only with live vaccines too?)</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the smallpox vaccination, &quot;leaving a mark&quot; is the sign that the vaccine worked. The vaccine requires multiple punctures giving multiple infection start sites, so it becomes very inflammatory - leaving behind the scar tissue. The TB vaccine is different, in that it is a single injection, but BCG is extremely immunogenic and causes severe local inflammation, which can cause a long-lasting scar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
