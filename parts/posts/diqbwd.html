		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Monosaccharides - Single subunit, very easily digested (or rather, straight up absorbed) in almost no time at at all. Glucose/dextrose, fructose. All are just converted into glucose in the body.</p>
<p>Disaccharides - Two subunits. Slightly more complex, takes a little longer to digest (e.g. sucrose/table sugar).</p>
<p>Polysaccharides - Many subunits. Varies in complexity and digestibility. Starches and glycogen are used for energy storage in plants/animals (respectively). Cellulose can only be partially digested (fiber). Provides your body with a moderate, constant supply of &quot;energy&quot;.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Before performance - Carb load. Doesn't matter what kind of carbs, as long as you get enough in your body. What you don't use in the next 2-4 hours is converted to glycogen and stored. Starches are dense so you can get a lot in at once.</p>
<p>During/after performance - Simple carbs. Glucose/dextrose is the most readily utilized by the body (takes about 10-15 minutes after consumption). Liquids are preferred, as the body does not need to manually break it down.</p>
<p>Recovery - Again, doesn't really matter, as long as you're eating enough. The more energy you give your body, the more likely it is that your body's cellular machinery can function optimally.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>tl;dr Doesn't really matter for most intents and purposes. Drink glucose/dextrose if you want a quick (10-15 min) boost of energy / if you want to raise your blood sugar. For everything else, you can eat anything you want (as long as you also incorporate fats, proteins, vitamins, and minerals). The more complex the carb is, the longer it takes to break down (but it will provide you with a steady source of energy).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT (eli3): Carbohydrates are like mini-batteries. Your body can use these batteries only if the batteries aren't still packed together. The simplest carbohydrates (monosaccharides) are one battery, so your body can immediately use them. Some batteries come in packs of two (disaccharides), so you'll need to separate them before you use it. Some batteries are heavy-duty and come in packs of hundreds to thousands (polysaccharides). It takes your body a while to separate them, but you won't need new batteries for a while. Whatever batteries your body doesn't use now will be stored and used later. Whenever you exercise, your body uses energy from the batteries. You want to store them before a big event (heavy duty polysaccharides), and quickly replenish them during and afterwards (simple batteries or double pack) without waiting for your body to break them down.</p>
<p>Simplest carbs = monosaccharides = fruits, glucose, dextrose (or even honey)</p>
<p>Two-pack = disaccharides = table sugar (sucrose), lactose, maltose</p>
<p>Heavy duty = polysaccharides = starches, glycogen</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit 2: The battery analogy pretty much fails when we look at fats. The most I could say is that if carbohydrates represented AA batteries and clusters of AA batteries, then fats would be D-cell batteries and clusters of D-cell batteries. It's also very difficult to condense the entirety of carbohydrate metabolism into a single reddit post, so please no bulli.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're playing Need for Speed. You want a quick boost of speed that doesn't last long but is immediately applied so you use Nitros. Once you run out you must rely on acceleration and power generated from the gas in the car. </p>
<p>The nitrous is simple sugar and the gas is complex. Quick to be used and energy doesn't last long, compared to gas which is slower to use, and slower to actually be used (to generate speed in this instance). </p>
<p>If you've ever run before you may or may not have broken through the &quot;wall&quot;. That essentially is once the body switches from simple to complex sugars as the main source of energy. That is why people carb up before a race, to have more complex sugar.</p>
<p>Also why someone may be in great shape but still feel terrible for the first 3ish miles. It may take that long to switch to complex carbs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Marketing might tell you otherwise and simple carbs post workout might make you feel better but they won't help you max your performance. That's where a dietitian becomes worth the money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
