		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Seashells are formed by a variety of animals. They secrete the material of the shell, as far as I know it's always a  calcium compound, from their bodies. A conch is a large snail, but clams, scallops, oysters, crabs, shrimp, and nautilus, among others, also make hard shells. Once the animal dies, the soft flesh is eaten or otherwise rots away, leaving just the shell.</p>
<p>Different animals have different needs, which determine the shape of their shells.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did my undergraduate thesis on hard clams, so I’ll talk about them specifically, but this applied to nearly all marine mollusks. They lay down a calcium carbonate shell from the inside and the exact composition of this shell varies based on some physical demands. What is cool is that in clam shells (and oysters and mussels), the shell being laid down during stressful periods (really hot temps like summer or really cold temps like winter) will be different than optimal conditions. This creates a branding pattern in the shell that resembles that of tree rings. This banding pattern in used to age the clams and can be used to identify growth rates as well. </p>
<p>For snails and such, I can’t really speak for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The shape they take is a form of &quot;fractal&quot; geometry. Which is basically: repeating a simple rule over and over again. It's found alot in nature because organisms are coded with that simple rule, resulting in complex (emergent) geometry when aggregated. Tree limb growth is another example of this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
