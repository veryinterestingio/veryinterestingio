It just kinda made me think, if we were inside our bodies, would it be loud or just kinda quiet, I don’t know if there is a scientific explanation.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Newborns are soothed by very very loud shhhhh-ing sounds, because this is similar to what they are accustomed to hearing from inside the womb. </p>
<p>When an infant is crying inconsolably, you’re actually supposed to match the shhhh sound to the intensity of the crying so they can hear it properly and feel safe.</p>
<p>It’s why vacuuming, hairdryers, and loud road noise in the car also tend to soothe a baby to sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our intestines also make noises, Bowel sounds are sounds made by moving food, fluid, and gases in the intestines, most of the time you use a stethoscope to hear it, but it can be louder. In fact if they don't make noises for 5 minutes or longer it's a bad sign for possible fecal impaction, blood supply blockage to the intestines or other issues. All of which need to be seen by a doctor asap, to avoid permanent damage or death.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
