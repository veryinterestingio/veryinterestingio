<p>It's not entirely unlike paying your water bill. We're reusing the actual water and it won't run out in any way that matters, but the delivery system doesn't just happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few misconceptions here to clear up.</p>
<p>The first misconception is that you pay your internet service provider or cell service provider for data. What you're actually paying them for is to <em>transfer</em> data that you're getting from somebody else. Let's say, for example, that you load the Reddit website. Reddit is producing the data that comprises the Reddit home page. What you're paying your service provider for is the cost of getting that data from Reddit and then transferring that data from Reddit to your computer. It's kind of analogous to renting a moving van - the moving van company doesn't have any stuff to put in the van; they're assuming you've already got stuff to put in the van or you wouldn't be renting it in the first place!</p>
<p>The second misconception is that you pay for a <em>quantity</em> of data. What you're actually paying for is a <em>rate</em> of data. For example, if you pay for 100 Mbps (that's &quot;megabits per second&quot;) service, then you're paying for the ability to transfer 100 megabits of data every second. It would be like renting a moving van that you can drive back and forth between two buildings - you can keep transferring stuff by driving back and forth as long as you rent the van.</p>
<p>Now let's get to the heart of your question - why does it cost money? Just as in the moving van analogy, the stuff <em>inside</em> the van - the data - isn't what costs money. Instead, what costs money is the infrastructure needed to transfer it. In the case of internet service, that's a big network of expensive hardware like routers and fiber optic cables, which all costs money to install, maintain, run (e.g., power with electricity), and upgrade. You and all of the internet service provider's other customers are basically collectively paying the costs of installing, maintaining, running, and upgrading that equipment. Again, the moving van analogy works well here.</p>
<p>EDIT: Some have asked about monthly caps (e.g., you can only download up to 100GB per month). The short answer is that this is still a rate! 100GB/month.</p>
<p>There's a long answer, too, if you're curious. Imagine that you're an ISP, and you have 1000 customers who each pay for 100 Mbps service. If they all use their internet service at maximum capacity at the same time, your network will need to be able to handle 1000 x 100 Mbps = 100 Gbps of data transfer.</p>
<p>However, it's pretty unlikely that all of your customers will ever be downloading at maximum capacity at the same time. Let's say that you estimate that it's rare that more than 100 of your customers will ever be downloading at maximum capacity at any one time. Thus, if you build your network to handle 100 x 100 Mbps = 10 Gbps, that will be sufficient to handle all of your customers' traffic needs <em>most of the time</em>. You'll still occasionally get unlucky - more than 100 of your customers will do this at once, and their service will be shitty. Figuring out how much you want to pay for infrastructure vs how frequently you're willing to give your customers a shitty experience is a business tradeoff you have to make. If you want to dig into this more, this technique is called <em>statistical multiplexing</em>.</p>
<p>By introducing monthly data caps, you limit the amount of time that any given customer can be downloading at maximum capacity. This, in turn, means that you can get away with a network that has lower total capacity and still deliver your customers a good experience most of the time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You’re paying for the upkeep of the infrastructure across which the data travels, and to allow additional equipment to be purchased to support an increased amount of utilization.</p>
<p>Having tiered pricing structures for different amounts of data (data caps) is (I think) done very arbitrarily and there is no real reason to charge more based on total amount of data.  </p>
<p>It “made sense” to charge customers using a metered approach because people are accustomed to that with other utilities.  </p>
<p>And companies like AOL, Prodigy, and Compuserve (when you used your phone line and a modem to dial in) charged more based on your usage because you had to dial into their servers, effectively taking a spot that another customer could be using and using a real amount of physical server resources of theirs.  They charged based on time connected, not the amount of data transferred - though maybe they also had tiers based on data usage - and that made sense because you were physically connecting to one of their servers.  AOL was notoriously bad about charging ridiculous amounts when you started going over your monthly minutes.  ISPs wanted that same kind of money, and people went along with it for a while until collectively people understood more about the technologies.  </p>
<p>The answer to your question is simply greed, of course. :)  </p>
<p>Think of the data as the voices on a phone call.  Your body is the server which “stores” your voice and from which it is transmitted, the phone company does not have any involvement with the upkeep of your body.  They only handle the phone lines that your voice is transmitted along.  Asking about if there is an unlimited amount of “voices” doesn’t make any sense, and the phone companies don’t incur extra costs if you speak more when you make a phone call.  They only handle the medium along which the voices travel.  They are concerned with maintaining their phone lines and adding additional lines to support more customers.  The lines can handle up to some amount of concurrent phone calls simultaneously but there is no limit to how much you talk once you’re connected to someone.  You can also think of concurrent phone calls as allowing higher speeds, so maybe for me to have 100Gbps download speeds, it requires the equivalent of 100 simultaneous phone calls.  So the speed of your internet absolutely requires more resources, but once you have those “phone lines” in place to handle that speed, it doesn’t make any difference how many bytes of data are “spoken” on those phone calls.  I’m mixing up the metaphors a bit but it was fun thinking and writing about it this way.</p>
<p>edit- when I say “how much you talk once you’re connected to someone” in that last part, I didn’t mean length of the phone call.  I meant if there are gaps of silence in your phone call or if you were to scream nonstop for the duration of the call (a lot of silence during a 5 minute phone call could be equivalent to 5 megabytes of data, whereas nonstop screaming during the same length call might be 20 megabytes of data, either way, the phone lines themselves are not burdened additionally because there is less silence on a call)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Internet is just an interconnection of computers, mobiles, devices etc. On a larger scale you can think of internet as interconnections of interconnections.</p>
<p>Now, if we stick to the above definition, we need some kind of medium to connect different devices. The easiest one that we can think of is wires, radio frequencies etc. Let's talk about wires, one just has to connect two PCs with some wire + some secure mechanism, and boom u would have an internet of two PCs. Where &quot;data&quot; equivalents to transfer of information between them.</p>
<p>Now imagine, you implement the above, ask yourselves a question are you really paying for the &quot;data&quot;, nope!. You are paying for the wire + that secure mechanism. Now your next question might be, &quot;why do I have to pay a monthly fee?&quot;, it's for the maintenance and for keeping all the helping systems up ( electricity charges, cooling charges etc )</p>
<p>&quot;Why do we have data - caps?&quot;, partly cause of network congestion, sometimes the infrastructure could not handle stuff, and partly cause of business ( more the data limit the more money for the company! Since you have to pay more )</p>
<p>&quot;Bandwidths and speed?&quot;, these both require money, the quality of wires used, hardware used etc</p>
<p>&quot;Can it run out?&quot;, if we again refer to the above example, we know that it's just like connecting a few computers together. So theres no question of running out unless the wires are cut or the secure connecting mechanism dies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
