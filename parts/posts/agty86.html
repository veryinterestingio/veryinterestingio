		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anesthesiologist here.</p>
<p>There are two broad categories of general anesthetics, which are divided based on how they are administered: intravenous and inhalational.</p>
<p>Let's start with intravenous. The most common IV general anesthetic is Propofol by far. Propofol is the milky white drug you sometimes see on medical shows. You may know of it as the &quot;Michael Jackson Drug&quot;. Us anesthesiologists sometimes refer to it as &quot;Milk of Amnesia&quot; (or maybe that's just me). The induction dose (the slug we give you at the start to put you to sleep) is calculated based on body weight. Typically around 2 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. For the super obese patients we use an adjusted value that's somewhere between their actual body weight and their &quot;ideal body weight&quot;. Younger patients, alcoholics, and red heads will need more milligrams per kilogram. Older patients, and those with certain neurological or medical issues, or those under the influence of certain drugs (medical or recreational) will need less.</p>
<p>After I determine you are unconscious, I will stick a breathing tube down your throat, hook it up to my anesthesia machine, and dial in the inhalational agent. In terms of inhalational agents, the three most common ones are Sevoflurane, Desflurane, and Nitrous Oxide. These agents are not dosed by milligrams, but by concentration in percents. We measure the percent concentration of the agent in the exhaled breath. Sevoflurane is dosed to about 2%, Desflurane 6-8%. The remainder percent is typically a mixture of pure oxygen and medical air. Nitrous Oxide by itself would not be sufficient to keep you under general anesthesia (it would require &gt;100%!), so if we use it, we usually use it to &quot;cut&quot; either the Sevo or the Desflurane (i.e. 50/50 O2/Nitrous plus 1% Sevo). Each agent has its unique advantages and disadvantages, and I use many factors to determine which agent is best for you.</p>
<p>How do they work? Big picture wise, they decrease the activity of excitatory circuits in the central nervous system and increase the activity of inhibitory circuits in the same (particularly that of a chemical called GABA). They suppress your sympathetic nervous system as well, which may reduce your blood pressure and/or heart rate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add that there is sometimes a misconception that the anaesthetic dose is one-shot, i.e., we give all the anaesthetic you need at once.</p>
<p>This is only true for very minor and short procedures.</p>
<p>Major operations require continuous titration (read: adjustment) of anaesthetic drugs to keep you asleep and alive (at the same time).</p>
<p>So the next time you need an op, just remember that telling the anaesthetist to &quot;give me ‘less’ drugs&quot; doesn't make sense in that context.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a question about the anesthesia. I had two &quot;major&quot; surgeries a few years ago. I had my wisdom teeth removed and I had my gall bladder removed. Both time I was put under the anesthesia. Both times I woke up in the middle of the operation. Like when I had my gallbladder removed, I woke up from anesthia and the nurse freaked out and put a mask over my face and I was out again.
How come I kept waking up during  the operation? Also how come I  never woke up until 3-4 hours after the operation? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
