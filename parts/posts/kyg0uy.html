		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>England, Scotland, Wales and Nireland are all countries, but they are not sovereign states. Only the UK is a sovereign state with the power that grants. </p>
<p>The distinction between the constituent countries is solely for internal governance. England for example has no international relations, neither does scotland, only the UK is a recognised political entity on the world stage.</p>
<p>For all intents and purposes, England, Scotland, N Ireland and Wales do not exist outside of the UK, because no country can deal with any of those 4 independently.</p>
<p>And as to your example, no. An Englishman has no social status as ‘English’, he only has British citizenship. As does a Scotsman, as much as the Scottish may dislike it.</p>
<p>Edit: This is ELI5, please stop flaming me because i left out a technicality that you personally care about. These are the broad strokes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Country&quot; doesn't mean what you think it means here.</p>
<p>The UK is a sovereign state, in the same way that the USA is a sovereign state, or Canada is a sovereign state.</p>
<p>England is a country within a sovereign state; Ohio is a state within a sovereign state; Ontario is a province within a sovereign state. In this instance, country = state = province (generally speaking). England, Ohio, and Ontario are not sovereign states themselves - they're <strong>governed by</strong> a sovereign state.</p>
<p>Basically, different words are being used in different regions that mean largely the same thing. The USA just decided to call its subdivisions &quot;states,&quot; even though the term &quot;state&quot; generally refers to a <strong>sovereign</strong> state. (The USA is not the only sovereign state to do this, but it does lead to some degree of confusion in instances like this.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an Englishman, I can tell it's a bit of a mess - governed pretty much entirely our historical and traditional hatred of each other - but the same hatred you might have for a sibling, we can call the Welsh names - but so help us if anyone else gives them the side eye.</p>
<p>Best explanation I've seen is in this video by the incredibly eloquent CP Grey, but I'm not sure if I'm allowed to link to it here.</p>
<p>England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are the big players, and are to most of us what we consider &quot;the UK&quot;, if you live in the border towns (say Bristol) it is entirely possible to live and work in separate countries - but a house would never be in two countries simultaneously. The borders between the countries are more like the borders between states in the US and less like the Mexican border. There are some toll bridges and roads between countries - but you're paying to use the road, and not to get checked to enter the country.</p>
<p>As far as government goes, England has the main body of government - what you see on TV (maybe) with Boris Johnson and the MPs in the Houses of Parliament - but the other countries have what is called &quot;devolved Parliaments&quot;, where they have certain powers over what happens inside their own countries (for Scotland they have the first Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who seems to have gained a decent amount of acclaim, especially compared to Mark Drakeford of Wales, Northern Ireland doesn't even seem to have a head of their assembly).</p>
<p>Then you have the Commonwealth - a political alignment of over 50 countries, most (if not all) used to be part of the British Empire from the old days when we would sail around the world sticking our flag into wherever we landed - but at some point the British Empire used to include Australia, India, the initial 13 American colonies, a good chunk of Africa - all ruled under a single monarch.</p>
<p>Tldr - it's a cluster fuck, multiple countries, single ruler with some devolved powers for the individual countries - much like how states have local powers.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
