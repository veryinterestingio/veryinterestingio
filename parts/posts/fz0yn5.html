Maybe a noise in the night, that conscious you were not aware of, but subconsciously you heard it and you and your brain will not rest until you're absolutely certain danger isn't prsent and crisis has been averted.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sleeping in one giant lump is a fairly modern phenomenon, possibly due to electric and gas lighting making it cheap and easy to carry your daytime well into the evening. There’s a lot of evidence that people used to go to sleep in the evening, get up at midnight for some candle-lit reading or a shag, then go back to sleep until the early morning. It’s probably the natural way of doing things, but we have this new social structure of going to bed later and sleeping through.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Your brain produces certain hormones that suppress some brain functions and a build up of that hormone is what lulls you to sleep. It also produces a baseline amount of those chemicals to keep you asleep, but perhaps your brain needs a bit of time to re-up the dose that put you down in the first place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
