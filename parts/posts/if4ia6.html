		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We basically have different levels of relaxation or paying attention.  When you pay close attention to things, your body increases its activity because something important is going on and you might have to fight or flee.</p>
<p>Humans did not evolve to sit in lectures.  So either your brain decides it is unimportant and you get bored and sleepy or it is important and your body prepares for action.  In reality you probably cycle through those states throughout a day of lectures.</p>
<p>Being in a heightened state of readiness is exhausting.  So at the end of the day you are tired.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Synapses (neurons communicating with other neurons) depend on the gradient of sodium and potassium and our bodies actually use a lot of ATP (the molecule used for energy) to maintain that gradient. So the more you think, the more ATP your body uses to pump sodium outside the neuron and potassium into the neuron. </p>
<p>Now that doesn't exactly explain why we feel tired after a lecture (the answer is probably a lot more complicated than that) all I'm trying to say is that thinking actually requires a lot of energy to happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thinking requires neurons firing and expending energy. The brain uses much of the energy consumed in food. The more energy you spend learning, eg a full 8 hours worth of classes, you'll be tired after.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Paying attention to detail that you aren’t necessarily passionate about often results in the steady depletion of will power. It’s just like exercising a muscle, if the brain used to long without rest it gets fatigued.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Analogies of a brain to a computer aren't totally wrong, but they have a very problematic way of leading to the wrong conclusions. What is actually happening when you are trying to learn and memorize, is that your brain is attempting to form new or strengthen existing neurological pathways. In addition to that it is also storing that in the areas of your brain associated with shorter term memory. In order to make it longer term and usable for things like tests, your brain requires sleep. Your age is also a factor here.</p>
<p>Most of the time when you get tired after learning a whole lot, it is your brain trying to tell you to rest so it has time to perform the necessary actions to manage your longer-term memory. In addition to that, you have a limited amount of what we can call Focus. Focus is very different from caloric energy in that it is not something that is generally replenished by consumption of food or drink. When focusing very heavily for extended periods of time, you will feel depleted due to the harder limits of your focus.</p>
<p>If you are interested in the far more technical explanation, I would recommend that you read up on the hippocampus, neuroplasticity and short and long-term memory encoding. It gets very technical very fast so take your time when reading, it is very easy to misunderstand and before you know it you will be writing articles for BuzzFeed on how to hack your brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
