		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Language isn't necessary for complex thought. Many people actually don't have an internal monolgue at all (meaning they don't think in words). Personally, I do have an internal monologue, but I don't think in words 100% of the time. Sometimes I think in images or in really abstract ways that are hard to describe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I had difficulty verbalizing my thoughts in a timeframe that allowed others to follow and it did help my communication. I now have difficulty trying to think without the framework of language, English specifically because it is the only language I am fluent in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it as when you know something without thinking out the actual sentence.  Say you turn on your phone, open up reddit and instantly go to your favorite sub.  You know what you're doing but you're probably not thinking about it in terms of an internal monologue.  This is a simplified answer but it obviously can be applied in many different ways.  Conversely you'll often have thoughts and feeling that you dont totally work out in a monologue but you know that feeling.  And sometimes you'll listen to a song or read a book that you instantly connect with.  Finally someone gave the monologue and words to the complicated thoughts and feelings you've had all along.  I've heard to it refereed to as &quot;ghost thoughts&quot; before.  Something you can feel and know is the but can't see.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
