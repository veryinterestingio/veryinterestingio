How does that happen, given the same voters? How are their election processes different (for the national bodies, but I guess I'm curious if it's the same in the state bodies too)?  Thank you in advance!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main reason is that the entire house is elected every two years (such as today), but only 1/3 of the senate is elected.</p>
<p>So it's not that the senate &quot;went red&quot; it's that most of the senate seats that were up for reelection were democratic seats, so it was very difficult for them to have not only held their seats but taken over republican seats.  65 senate seats weren't up in this election, of those 42 were republican.  So the worst technically possible outcome for republicans was a 42-58 split.  </p>
<p>Also, the house has seats based on population, so big states will have more seats.  But the senate has two seats per state regardless of size.  Low population states tend to be republican due to being more rural, and so rural areas (and so republican areas) tend to have more republicans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Does the house introduce a bill/law and then if it passes it goes to the Senate? I feel like I knew how it worked at one point in my life but haven't really thought about it for years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 100 Senators. Of these, 2018 saw elections for 35 seats. So the majority of Senate seats were not in contention tonight. This left a narrow path for the Democrats to flip the Senate and they came up short.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, all 435 House seats were up for grabs today. This gave the Democrats much more room to hold their solid districts and pick battlegrounds to focus on in their much wider path towards flipping the House.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The key difference is that there simply weren't that many republican senate seats up for election this year.</p>
<p>Democrats winning the Senate was always going to be extremely unlikely simply because only a 3rd of the seats were up for election, and 26 of those were democratic seats, and included a few like North Dakota, and Missouri which are traditionally red states. Meanwhile, the remaining republican senate seats up for election were mostly in seats that are usually pretty safe.</p>
<p>In the House though, the entire House is up every 2 years, and while most seats on both sides of the aisle are fairly safe, there were a lot of Republican seats deemed up for grabs because they had representatives in a lot of districts Hillary Clinton won in 2016, or they had Republican incumbents retiring, or their district lines had been re-drawn.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just adding my 2 cents</p>
<p>The house is supposed to be rash and quick to change. They are elected every 2 years so it can change quickly with the population.</p>
<p>The senate is Supposed to be level headed and stand back and say , not so fast lets think this over.</p>
<p>And its set up so that every state can have a say.  Small states would just be pushed a side if it was just the house.  going back to the founding of america the small states didn't want to join if Virginia was just going to push them around. So if you have the house you can have your power in numbers and you equalize it in the senate</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
