		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the past week, multiple vaccine candidates for COVID-19 have been approved for use in countries around the world. In addition, preliminary clinical trial data about the successful performance of other candidates has also been released. While these announcements have caused great excitement, a certain amount of caution and perspective are needed to discern what this news actually means for potentially ending the worst global health pandemic in a century in sight.</p>
<p>Join us today at 2 PM ET (19 UT) for a discussion with vaccine and immunology experts, organized by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM). We'll answer questions about the approved vaccines, what the clinical trial results mean (and don't mean), and how the approval processes have worked. We'll also discuss what other vaccine candidates are in the pipeline, and whether the first to complete the clinical trials will actually be the most effective against this disease. Finally, we'll talk about what sort of timeline we should expect to return to normalcy, and what the process will be like for distributing and vaccinating the world's population. Ask us anything!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctors - thank you for taking the time today with us. </p>
<p>When we hear about the various efficacy rates, Pfizer being 94.5%, how should we interpret that?</p>
<p>Would it be:   Out of 1000 recipients, 945 of them developed immune response (55 did not)</p>
<p>Or: for all recipients, out of 1000 exposures to the virus, 945 times they did not contract the virus?  </p>
<p>Or: in 1000 exposures, 945 times, the vaccine prevented serious illness from resulting?</p>
<p>(I use 945/1000 as the 94.5% number but I realize in the clinical trials, there was much larger population to work with)</p>
<p>Sorry if this seems an elementary question but Iâ€™d really like to understand what efficacy rate means, and how important that number is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A significant part of the population is worried about late-onset side effects of the new mRNA vaccines that could not have shown up yet as the trials have been fairly short.
My question is: If the mRNA contained in the vaccine decays within hours or days after vaccination, wouldn't all side effects have to show up within a few days after receiving the vaccine? These may well be long-term side effects, I'm just wondering about the possibility of side effects that don't show up until many months after application.
In my mind it's like getting food poisoning from food I ate 4 months ago, it doesn't quite add up.
Thanks for the AMA!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
