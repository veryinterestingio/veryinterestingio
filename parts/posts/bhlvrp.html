The blades LOOK  as though they are spinning slowly but in reality theyre travelling at quite a high speed.... the combination of their size and distance at which you view them makes them appear to be moving quite slowly when in fact the opposite is true</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They often actually don't, they just look like they're moving more slowly because they're so large. Let's say it takes you one second to make a step. If you're 100 times larger, that step is 100 times times longer so by moving at the same speed, that step takes 100 times longer. Even if you were moving at a significantly larger speed, it could still take longer. </p>
<p>If the camera were right next to one of these things, their movement would look extremely quick. But because the camera has to be far away in order to capture their full size, things also look slower because of parallax. It's the same reason why if you're driving along a road, objects by the roadside appear to be moving much more quickly than mountains in the distance, even though of course your relative speed is the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Now imagine a giant with a reach of 30 feet. Let’s say he punches twice as fast as the man at a rate of 6 feet per second. Even though he is punching faster, it takes him 5 seconds to fully extend his arm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Big things weigh more than you might think. Imagine a man who is 6 feet tall. Then imagine the same man who is 60 feet tall. The giant man won't weigh ten times the 6 foot man, he'd weigh *thousands* of times more. Tonnes.</p>
<p>This comes down to something called the square-cube law. As something grows, it's volume (how much stuff their actually is) grows a lot faster than it's surface area (how much stuff it looks like there is).</p>
<p>Realistically a giant human wouldn't - couldn't - be built the same as a normal human. They'd need elephant like feet to spread their mass - or even more realistically their bones would splinter inwards and they'd suffocate on their own mass like a whale beached.</p>
<p>But realism for movies means the giant moves slowly instead, since we assume they can exist without imploding, because starting any movement takes a lot more energy for the same reason a car can accelerate to 60 faster than a truck.</p>
<p>The truck weighs more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
