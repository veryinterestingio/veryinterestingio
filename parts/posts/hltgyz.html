		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans show teeth to intimidate as well, and many animals show teeth as a submissive gesture.</p>
<p>Dogs will “grin” by pulling their lips back rather than up and it’s a signal to say “you’re the boss, I won’t hurt you.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile if you lift your lips upwards and wrinkle your nose, it’s a facial expression that conveys anger and distaste and often seems threatening if you add a frown.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In primates, showing the teeth, especially teeth held together, is almost always a sign of submission. The human smile probably has evolved from that. &quot;In the primate threat, the lips are curled back and the teeth are apart--you are ready to bite.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of the reason humans don’t use their teeth to intimidate and threat display (most of the time. We definitely bare our teeth when we’re mad enough) is we don’t use our teeth to attack, the majority of the time. Normal human threat displays are clenched fists, squared shoulders, and invading personal space, things that show we’re getting ready to grab or punch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I saw a British educational series on human gestures that showed chimps have a &quot;fear face&quot; where they show submission and fear by displaying their teeth. And in humans, it is not a far leap to take the fear face and turn it into a smile that says &quot;I am not a threat to you.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s because we have evolved to not rely on our teeth for fighting. There for it changes the way we see body language. Similar to how our mouths are the most bacteria infected among mammals. It because we use other methods to clean our wounds so we don’t need antiseptic saliva like dogs rodents or primates. </p>
<p>Think about it this way: we can do more damage with our knuckles than with our nails. A clenched fist is a sign of aggression among humans, while an open hand is a sign of peace. </p>
<p>Among felines is the opposite. And open paw means claws are out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
