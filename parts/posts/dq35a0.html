		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>IN general, it means that there is a patch of oil or wax on that part of the paper. It means that the ball in the point of the pen doesn't grip the paper, so it doesn't spin around. The ball spinning is what pulls ink from the barrel of the pen and deposits it on the paper, so if the ball isn't turning the pen won't work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the ball of ballpoint pen needs to roll to work. On some surfaces the ball doesn't roll, it slides instead. So it can't work. But when you try it on a paper, the drag force makes it work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of times, that particular pen is just cheap. Sorry. The ball works like a little ball bearing. If the ring/cup holding the ball is not precisely made, the ball gets stuck more often and need rougher paper surface to get enough friction to get the ball rolling instead of skipping. To make it worse, rolling stuck ball on the paper is what smooths out the paper and only makes it harder to write on. I grew up in a poor country and a pen costed 10 cents, but it just sucked. It lasted two weeks before the ball just stops rolling all together, and I would then put the tip on lighter fire just a bit to get it rolling again. Sometimes on fire for too long, the ball would fall out, and ink would drip out like crazy.</p>
<p>Good quality ball pens work better especially on smoother papers (i.e. photo quality paper). The ball requires less friction to roll. When it just rolls smoother than cheap Chinese pen.</p>
<p>Still I use different kinds of pens for different paper texture and thickness. Ball pen only for rough or thin papers. Gel pen for thick and smooth paper. Marker pen for glossy paper.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The initial place is ground smooth by scraping of it when the ball is stuck a bit, so the ball slips instead of rolling, not leaving paint behind. A new place on the paper is rougher offering more friction, so the ball turns, leaving paint behind again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
