		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason “a tomato is a fruit” became the go to is due to the Supreme Court case <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nix_v._Hedden" target="_blank">Nix v. Hedden</a></p>
<p>There was an import tax which taxes “fruits” and “vegetables” differently. In an attempt to avoid higher taxes it was claimed that tomatoes are actually fruit and thus subject to lower taxes.</p>
<p>The court found that the tax law was using common parlance for “fruits” and “vegetables” not botanical definitions. Rightly so I’m my opinion, since, as you point out, there is no botanical definition of vegetables.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the words for different parts of a plant were developed, people knew nothing much about plant biology, so came up with names based on culinary usage.  Fruit, berry, vegetable, nut and so on all referred to the culinary uses of those parts of a plant.  Fruits are sweet and big, berries are sweet and small, nuts are hard and crunchy, vegetables are not sweet and basically &quot;everything else&quot;.  When we came to develop language for the biology of plants, we found that certain biological structures were well aligned with most of the culinary uses of that type of structure, so the culinary word was applied also to the biological structure.  There are plenty of examples, however, where the culinary and biological terms do not match.</p>
<p>Most people know that a tomato is a culinary vegetable but a biological fruit.  In addition, the Uber-pedants will remind you that bananas are berries, but strawberries are not; that peanuts, almonds, pecans and a number of others are not nuts.  I think the commonness of knowledge of a tomato being a fruit is because it is fairly obvious, in that it looks a lot like other fruits, while the other examples are less obvious, for example a banana looks nothing like other culinary berries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other than childish trolling and jackasses, I cannot believe anyone makes a point of calling a tomato a fruit to distinguish it from a vegetable in a normal cooking/culinary context. Yeah tomatoes are fruits as are cucumbers, chili peppers, pumpkins, etc. </p>
<p>Most of the time, &quot;vegetables&quot; is used to mean very generally stuff from plants. If we don't use much of it in a recipe, then it is vaguely and arbitrarily called a &quot;spice&quot;. </p>
<p>Unless there is some academic / professional setting, this is very irrelevant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say no vegetable is a vegetable, but it's an awkward term because it's a negative definition. In use it means &quot;anything from a plant that isn't a fruit, herb, spice, etc&quot;, so as we came up with new categories the list of things that get called a vegetable shrinks. </p>
<p>If you want something to really go off on, look up the botanical definition of &quot;berry&quot; and check out a list of things that are berries. Excluded from the list: strawberries, blackberries. Included in the list: bananas, eggplant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
