		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sun.</p>
<p>Spacecraft are generally amost entirely in direct sunlight, and have no atmosphere or anything to transfer heat to. Because of this, most temperature concerns on spacecraft are &quot;how to remove heat.&quot; Generally, this is done with heat radiators. For example, <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3PrMs.jpg" target="_blank">these ones</a> on the ISS. The solar panels are black, and the radiators are white. The radiators can rotate just like the solar panels, and can be angled perpendicular to radiate heat away, parallel to absorb heat, or any angle in between depending on the thermal needs of the station.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't heat, they try to cool the ISS. Most people think of space as cold and it's true, but it's not the same cold as we are used to. There is just not enough atoms around the ISS to absorb the heat from the ISS and cool it down, like cold air would cool you down for example. The heat in the ISS is stock there and can only radiate away, but that is a really slow process. At the same time there isn't an atmosphere to spread the energy of the Sun that hit the ISS AND there is a lot of instruments and system on board the ISS which produce heat (think of your computer that heat up). </p>
<p>Overtime heat accumulate in the ISS (or any other spacecraft) and they need to radiate that heat away and for that they have huge radiators. The space shuttle had its radiator on the inside of the dorsal door and so they always had those doors open in orbit, the ISS have radiators panel at 90 degrees from the Solar Panels.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, retired NASA engineer and Shuttle manager here.  My baby was Atlantis, and we put many parts on the station.   The problem with the ISS is not that it needs heating, the problem is it needs cooling.  All of the electrical equipment on board would overheat and fry itself, and bake the astronauts on board at a toasty 140 degrees F.  To prevent this, we have, simply put, two Giant refrigerators outside the station that use super cooled Amonia to remove the heat generated by the station.  And it works very similar to your home thermostat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's no air to take heat away, so there's no need to heat them. Sunlight, human bodies, and machines all heat up the place, and big fins let heat escape as infrared light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
