		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For what it’s worth, I used to work for a company that manufactured flushable wipes. They broke up in water in much the way toilet paper did, hence marketing them as flushable. The problem that they had to overcome, that they did not anticipate, was that flushable and non-flushable wipes look almost identical. So when your plumber pulls a wipe out of a clogged drain it’s because someone flushed a wipe that was unlikely to have been marketed as flushable.</p>
<p>They (the company I used to work for) went so far as to have some municipalities send us samples of wipes pulled from their sewage systems (after receiving numerous angry emails and calls, occasionally from places wanting to send up bills for cleanup and repair). Our internal findings determined that the samples sent to us were make-up removal wipes or other similar items that never should have been flushed and wouldn’t have been marketed that way.</p>
<p>My personal opinion is that the the marketplace is confused, I’ve locally tried to purchase flushable wipes and found flushable and non-flushable ones are put side by side on the store shelves and even with me having some knowledge of the items, found it hard to tell them apart. My wife came home with some recently that in very small print said these were not intended to be flushed. Yet were sold along side the flushable wipes with similar packaging.</p>
<p>Two things to keep in mind. 1) We had a large R&amp;D department at my former job, there were labs and transparent septic systems so people could actually study paper refuse as it worked its way through a typical flush cycle. This stuff was extensively studied. They also tested competitors products and found they also had similar flushability.  2) I did none of this actual work myself. I worked in finance. We had internal blogs and resources were these sorts of information was readily available. But I know nothing of the chemistry or nuance of the items in question.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>*Consumer Reports checked out four flushable wipes from Cottonelle, Charmin, Scott and Equate. They all say they’re flushable and make claims like “sewer and septic safe” and “breaks up after flushing.”</p>
<p>In Consumer Reports’ standard tests, toilet paper breaks down quickly. But when testers ran the same test with the flushable wipes they didn’t break down at all. Consumer Reports gave up after ten minutes. Testers even ran them for ten minutes in a mixer, the wipes still didn’t break apart.</p>
<p>Consumer Reports did find that after soaking overnight, two of the products did break down, Cottonelle and Scotts. But even after 12 hours, the ones from Charmin and Equate still stayed in one piece.</p>
<p>Consumer Reports advice, if you use these products don’t flush them down the toilet.*</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It might be worth mentioning that some break down really well and some really don't. Before lockdown, I wouldn't go out without a pocket pack of contenelle wipes. They would tear apart super easily and were great for public restroom visits.</p>
<p>When we tried another brand, I was blown away by how difficult it was to rip the wipes into halves or thirds (more uses and smaller pieces going in the bowl).</p>
<p>Now, I'm always home and we added 25 dollar bidets to our toilets. <em>Edit: They are typically under 50 bucks (we got a great deal on ours)</em>.</p>
<p>I don't really use wipes, anymore, but hot damn some of them really really aren't flushable despite the fact that some seem to be quite effective and <em>perhaps</em> &quot;safe&quot;(ish?) to flush.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work for a government environmental program in the US. we get CONSTANT pleas from municipal water treatment programs to educate the public on the fact that most &quot;flushable&quot; wipes do tons of damage to wastewater treatment infrastructure. they are flushable, but most are not biodegradable, so they cause where costly damage when they build up enough to clog up these systems. unless the manufacturer can honestly say that the wipes truly break down in water, you should put them in the trash. that's gross, but it's better than damaging your local water infrastructure with them. unfortunately, these labels are not regulated for some reason ($$) so they can continue to put this misleading label on their products.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have tested some flushable wipes, and after being submerged for a bit and some agitation, they do fall apart pretty easily. I think the problem is people flushing wipes that are not actually labelled as flushable. Then, plumbers see the damage and say &quot;don't flush flushable wipes&quot;, either because they're assuming that's what they are or they just want to do away with the whole thing to avoid the issue altogether.</p>
<p>My conclusion is: if I buy a new brand, I test it out first. If it doesn't work and it should, I'll return it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
