		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thickness of the bubble film is comparable to the wavelengths of light.  Some reflects off the outer air/soap boundary, and some reflects off the inner boundary.  (Most lightmasses through both). These two sets of waves interfere with each other and produce the colors you see.  Lots of neat effects from the layer thickness variations, and as the material flows around. In the film.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s a natural phenomenon called “Thin-film interference” in which light waves reflected by the upper and lower boundaries of a thin film interfere with one another, either enhancing or reducing the reflected light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called thin film interference and it has to do with the wave-like nature of light. </p>
<p>Light reflects off the two surfaces of the bubble (or the oily layer on it, same thing happens on a a wet oil stain in a parking lot), and because the reflective layers are so close together they cause interference (based on the principle of superposition, where the sum of the wave heights becomes the effective resultant). Sometimes this interference causes constructive interference (and some colors appear brighter), others its destructive (and some of the colors are 'cancelled' and not seen).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The phenomenon is known as thin film interference. Thin films like soap bubbles or oil films on the surface of a puddle create interference patterns among the light rays passing through the boundaries between the fluids.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
