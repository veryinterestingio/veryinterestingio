		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Earthquakes do not radiate from a single point. What you see represented on a map, i.e. an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicenter" target="_blank">epicenter</a>, is the point on the surface above the point on the fault where an earthquake rupture starts (i.e. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocenter" target="_blank">hypocenter</a>). A 'patch' of a fault ruptures/slips during an earthquake, and the size of the patch that slips is directly related to the magnitude of the earthquake that results, e.g. <a href="https://www.resolutionmineeis.us/sites/default/files/references/wells-coppersmith-1994.pdf" target="_blank">Wells &amp; Coppersmith, 1994</a>. While these rupture patches can actually have pretty complicated shapes, we can idealize them as a quasi-elliptical area on the fault plane with a maximum displacement somewhere near the center and displacement decreasing to zero at the edge, e.g. <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/rupture-surface.png" target="_blank">this cartoon</a>. An important misconception to avoid is that the epicenter represents the center of the rupture, or the location of where there is maximum slip. It does not, it represents where the rupture first started, which often does not correspond to the center or location of maximum displacement. For example, take a look at this map of <a href="https://www.kyoshin.bosai.go.jp/kyoshin/topics/Kumamoto_20160416/inversion_rp_en/images_en/fig2.png" target="_blank">slip distribution</a> for an earthquake in Japan. The colors represent the amount of slip (slip on a fault plane, which is then projected onto the surface of the Earth, so this is not slip at the surface) and the star indicates the epicenter/hypocenter (again, on the fault plane, projected to the surface). This highlights that (1) real ruptures are messy and (2) the epicenter is not colocated with the area of maximum slip.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, earthquakes have to start somewhere, at some point in time and space. They start with a rupture along a fault plane. This point of first rupture is then recorded - for the sake of book-keeping and cataloguing - as the epicenter regardless how far the rupture travels, potentially tens of kilometers in the up and down direction and hundreds of kilometers horizontally. The first epicenter may be joined by other secondary points of rupture, all merging into a potentially large rupture that can takes tens to hundreds of seconds to run its course.  None of those secondary ruptures is &quot;honored&quot; by the designation &quot;epicenter&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just imagine a normal rock-face. They aren't smooth, they are rough. </p>
<p>So when they slide next to each other, they might get trapped when 2 hills collide. This prevents the plate from moving and the pressure is instead bending it, getting higher and higher at the point of contact. At one point, the material will no longer be able to hold and snap. That's when all the built up kinetic energy is released an the plate &quot;catches up&quot; to release tension. </p>
<p>That sudden release of kinetic energy is what we call an earthquake. And because the 2 walls sliding past each other only block each other on some parts, not the entire surface, those do not spread over the entire distance of the fault.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sympathetic faults resulting in offsets occur when strain release along the main fault or vibrations on ground motions disturbs the state of stress of another fault causing it to behave like semi liquid causing it to displace. surface displacement can occur gradually due to creep or withdrawal of non tectonic fluids .</p>
<p>Liquifaction can occur when surface water rich sediments are shaken and behave like semi liquid material and displacements are seen as is seen in destruction of building during an earthquake.</p>
<p>Creeps o landslides a can occur when stress or liquids released during earthquake  loosen loosely solidified deposits  are affected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
