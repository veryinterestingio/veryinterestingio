But mostly it's shorter stretches, from 10s to 100s of basepairs. They are widely used in molecular biology and genetics labs.
If you want to generate a whole genome from scratch that's a bit more complicated. Genomes can be very large and repetitive which can make quality control more tedious.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically it’s possible but extremely challenging due to the sheer size of the human genome.</p>
<p>There was a group that did this in bacteria over a decade ago now: they got small pieces of dna and assembled them piece wise until they were able to build an entire bacterial genome from scratch. They replaced the DNA of a related bacteria with their construct, effectively permanently changing that bacteria’s species.</p>
<p>This much harder in humans, for a ton of reasons. Aforementioned is size: the experiment in bacteria assembled just under 500,000 base pairs of DNA.  The human genome is ~3,000,000,000 base pairs. We also have 23 chromosomes, each of which is it’s own, long, unbroken strand of DNA.  This is in contrast to the bacterial experiment, where they only needed to assemble one single chromosome.</p>
<p>As for the ramifications? It would be a masterful feat, technically speaking, to faithfully recreate and assemble a persons genome, but I can’t really say about the implications.</p>
<p>Edit: corrected number of bases in human genome (thanks for pointing that out!)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can fairly easily synthesize DNA de novo in a lab. There are table-top synthesizers for just that purpose. There are two issues: fidelity, and speed.</p>
<p>Chemical DNA synthesis has a low but non-zero error rate, so the longer the sequence, the lower the proportion of the DNA is the correct sequence (there are also some mechanical issues in making sequences that get very long); in practical terms, 200 - 300 nt long pieces is really the upper bound with current technology, and there's an added step of filtering to get specifically the sequence desired.</p>
<p>The process takes time too, a few minutes per base. At 3.2 billion bases for the human genome, you're looking at 30,000 years of synthesis time (which, admittedly, you could parallelize to make it go faster). There's a startup in Europe that's aiming to be able to automate the process of making overlapping long oligomers (200-300mers) and using enzymes to fill in the gaps to build out segments of 10 kb at a time, ostensibly with 0 errors. They are still working on the process.</p>
<p>Another issue with the 23 and me data is that they don't sequence the DNA at all. Rather they use DNA microarrays which look for the hybridization of DNA fragments with probes on a microchip. The technique is used to detect the presence or absence of short segments of DNA associated with genetic variations. All in all, they are only looking at a tiny fragment of the genome, and they don't distinguish between which chromosome the sequence is from. It would be impossible to recreate the complete genomic sequence from such a small slice of the data.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other comments have covered bits of this, but there is an important detail missing: We use bacteria (usually) to create larger constructs. It is a standard tool in biology to create entire proteins, mutant or wild-type, using bacterial as mini-factories. For larger chunks of human DNA, you are best off using CRISPR techniques in mammalian cells. Even then, trying to edit DNA in a living cell becomes much more difficult. Not all DNA is accessible in a given cell. The human genome is about 2 m long, and it is packed into a nucleus that is \~6 micrometers in diameter. This is done by wrapping DNA around proteins called histones. This has a major impact on what portions of the DNA can be accessed, which is part of how DNA expression (what proteins are made from genes) is controlled. That severely limits what DNA we can edit, because if it's wrapped around histones, then the molecules we transfect into cells can't bind to the DNA to initiate the editing process. That remains a major practical limitation to DNA editing today, not to mention that not all mammalian cells can be edited.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and it's not as hard as you think. (It's also not nearly as easy as this comment will make it sound) I just started watching a YouTube channel a few days ago where he does exactly this! And he teaches on livestreams if you want to learn it yourself. You won't be able to actually do it though, unless you have access to a very expensive lab, but you can learn the theory.</p>
