		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Familiar inheritance of position, absolutely.  It looks like macaques have been studied the most, Google turns up a number of scholarly articles including <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4834345/" target="_blank">The Influence of Gender, Age, Matriline and Hierarchical Rank on Individual Social Position, Role and Interactional Patterns in Macaca sylvanus</a>:</p>
<p>>  One major kinship phenomenon among the animal kingdom is the matrilineal rank inheritance (MRI) (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4834345/#B53" target="_blank">Kawamura, 1958</a>) observed in macaques. It consists of the transmission of hierarchical rank from mother to daughter; the latter acquires the hierarchical rank directly below that of her mother. In addition, as according to the youngest ascendancy rule, young females outrank their older sisters (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4834345/#B83" target="_blank">Thierry et al., 2004</a>). The MRI process is made possible by nepotism, in that related females support each other during conflicts against non-kin females and help juvenile females outrank their older sisters (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4834345/#B17" target="_blank">Cheney, 1977</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4834345/#B24" target="_blank">Datta, 1983</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4834345/#B15" target="_blank">Chapais and Gauthier, 1993</a>).</p>
<p>Note this inheritance in non-human primates only happens in female philopatric species - those where females stay with their birth group and the males leave to join other groups (perhaps to avoid inbreeding, there is a lot of research on it) - and the inheritance is strictly through the female line.</p>
<p>The closest relatives of humans are male philopatric - males stay with their birth group and females leave to join other groups.  Humans are the only species of primate to have inheritance through the male line.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spotted hyenas' social heirarchy is organized primarily by relation to the matriarch. The eldest daughter of the matriarch is the second highest rank, and eventually becomes the next matriarch assuming another hyena doesn't kill her and her mother. The male offspring of the matriarch are highest ranking among the males, but are still lower rank than the lowest ranked female.</p>
<p>Tangentially related: Spotted hyenas are some of the most fascinating carnivores in the world and if you have time you should definitely read more about them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some birds will stay with their parents and help raise their siblings instead of leaving to find a mate.  Although it may be interpreted a selfless act it is common when territory is limited in quantity or quality. By doing this the bird increases it's chances of inheriting the territory of it's parents. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as i know, individual in families and social groups – upon death of a relative – still maintain their social ties and don't inherit it.</p>
<p>De facto, in real life, even nobles and aristocrats make themselves known as &quot;socially powerful&quot;. If they want to maintain their status, they have to act toward it.
A random baby of a farmer, doesn't know, by generic inheritance, that a Rothschild property can seldom be approached.</p>
<p>For example, a monkey toddler can learn, by her fearful monkey mother grasping him, that he shouldn't play with alpha female kid.
And that memory can last for decades.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
