		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>with knuckles its a simple hinge joint that goes forward and backwards and there are only one or two muscle attachments per knuckle.  </p>
<p>with the neck, there are a lot more muscle attachment sites and a lot more joint surfaces and facets that can crack.  cracking yourself is not in and of it self bad but i've seen plenty of people give themselves mild forms of whiplash where your neck just locks up after cracking it. most of the time its because they overstretch one part of their neck and then crack it which causes a mild muscle strain</p>
<p>Additionally, where people usually need the crack, in the junctional areas of the spine (where the curve switches) is not very easy to crack yourself so you end up cracking the middle hypermobile part and not the part that actually needs it.</p>
<p>TLDR: no, but you can lock your neck up on rare occasions</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anyone else get the urge to crack your neck while reading this?</p>
<p>Edit: but there are definitely more nerves in your neck. You could possibly pinch a nerve if you do it the wrong way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I recently read up a little bit on this, because my neck cracks a lot, I crack it a lot, and it's been acting up more and more lately.</p>
<p>Apparently, there's potential to puncture blood vessels and stuff. Essentially, there's a ton of vital stuff in your neck that you don't want to screw with.</p>
<p>And that's what I read. I've been trying to do it less lately, but it isn't going well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
