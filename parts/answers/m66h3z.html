		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello Dr. Faris! I am a former UC Davis exchange student (I studied linguistics) and I have to say I loved UC Davis! Hoping to come back to visit one day.</p>
<p>Now that I have this amazing opportunity, I wanted to ask about a case that happened in my home country a little while ago and shocked the whole nation. A 16-year old boy was bullied to death by his friends (link here, content warning: description of extreme violence <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koskela_teen_murder" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koskela\_teen\_murder" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koskela\_teen\_murder</a></a>)</p>
<p>Everyone is obvioulsly wondering how this could happen. I would like to hear your comments on if there are any factors that caused the bullying to go as far as taking the victim's life. Could it be a hierarchy thing gone too far - getting rid of the weak individuals? The victim is said to have been shy, lonely and quiet. Or could there be something else behind the horrible actions? The case has really shaken our sense of humanity, so it would be interesting to hear your take on the matter. Thanks!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Does friend-on-friend bullying look different from other sorts? As a teacher, I was taught (by school counselors) that friends getting in tiffs with each other is not bullying, yet I have seen pretty cold and cruel behavior among kids that call each other BFFs. Is the friendship itself real or is just grooming/positioning? What can I do as a teacher to help?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
