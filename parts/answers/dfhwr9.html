		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every action of the driver in front gets amplified massively along the length of the jam. If a car in a lane slows down 10 kph to take an exit, then the other car will have to slow down, and the other etc. </p>
<p>Through driver error some cars might slow more than others, meaning that the ones behind them will slow the same or more, since they can't accelerate due to there being a car infront of them.</p>
<p>This is just one example of many actions that due to slight variations will get amplified.</p>
<p>Others have also mentioned bottlenecks. If a lane is closed for a kilometer, then suddenly there's an entire lane worth of cars trying to fit in a space that can hardly fit them.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it's in essence a ripple effect,<br />
First driver slows down (for whatever reason), the one behind it, reacts and slows down a bit faster and so on and so on.<br />
It might be a fraction of a second , but over a long enough distance, and time, it can cause cars to completely stop for a second or so, then by the time the car gets moving again the car behind it is stopped for longer, and so on and so on again...  </p>
<p>This is now a &quot;rolling traffic jam&quot; which moves in the opposite direction of direction of travel. This jam can be anywhere from a few car lengths to a few hundred car lengths long.  </p>
<p>As &quot;rush hour&quot; passes their are less cars so their is more distance between vehicles and so the ripple effect is broken and traffic moves as normal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are running down a corridor, you can run at the fastest speed you want, and you'll get to the canteen as quickly as you possibly could.</p>
<p>If your whole class gets let out, some people will run faster than others. The slower runners might get in the way of the faster runners, but there is plenty of space to maneuver around them, so most people will make it to the canteen almost as quickly as they could have if they had a free run. But a slight slowing down will happen.</p>
<p>Now the whole school gets let out at once. All the doors open and people file out. Those faster runners are going to encounter a lot more obstacles in their way so they'll have to slow down, especially as people come out the doors. There are now a lot of people in the corridor and it will likely be moving far slower than anyone would want to be going, but we have to slow down to avoid colliding with people coming out of their class rooms, etc.</p>
<p>Now at the canteen there is only a single door. So whilst the corridor can have 10 people running side by side, only a limited number can get through the door. This creates a bottleneck. </p>
<p>The other people coming out of the classrooms are slip roads coming on to a motorway. The bottlenecks on the road are junctions, roundabouts, traffic lights, speed limits, etc, that will force cars to slow down at one point, this has a knock-on effect with all the other cars behind because they too are slowed down.</p>
<p>During class, very few people are in the corridor, so going through one door won't slow you down. At lunchtime (the rush hour equivalent) hundreds of people are trying to use the canteen door but still only one person at a time can go through, and the rest of the school must form a queue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
