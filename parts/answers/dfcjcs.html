		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two reasons:</p>
<p>A. The ISS is at an altitude of approximately 250 miles. At that height, the Earth takes up a <strong>HUGE</strong> portion of the sky. Take a look for yourself here,</p>

</ul>
<p>B. Curved reflective surfaces, like the poly-carbonate visors the astronauts wear, reflect light at wide angles. This is why you can see a warped solar panel (likely not the one behind Astronaut Drew Morgan or Christina Koch) and the helmet light (on the side of the helmet) also in the reflection. That's just how convex mirrors work. The portion of the Earth in the reflection is likely the portion of the Earth visible above the two astronauts out of frame. You'll notice the cloud patterns in the &quot;behind part&quot; do not match the &quot;reflection part&quot;.</p>

<p>If you google &quot;Astronaut Selfie&quot; you'll find that they basically all look like this.</p>

<p>Here's another one by Aki Hoshide that tries to get the whole Earth in frame. </p>

</ul>
<p>You'll notice the spacestation is curved in this view and even bits of the helmet are visible in the upper edges like the one you posted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While u/AsAChemicalEngineer provided a detailed answer.  Iâ€™m here to offer hopefully a simpler answer. </p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/aD6vHIC.jpg" target="_blank">consider this diagram</a></p>
<ol>
<li>The diameter of the Earth is 7,917.5 miles. </li>
<li>ISS is in orbit about 254 miles above the earth. </li>
</ol>
<p>The Earth is massive in comparison to ISS. The Earth is 31x larger than the altitude of the ISS. </p>
<p>Basically from the angle that the photo is taken, half of the earth is behind the astronaut and the other half is in front. the relection you see is of the half of the earth in front of the astronaut.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the same reason that when you're driving you can see the reflection of the yellow lines on the road on your hood, even though those lines are under the hood.</p>
<p>You're not seeing the reflection of the lines directly under the car; you're seeing the reflection of the lines that are dozens of yards in front of the car, because those are the lines that are &quot;visible&quot; to the leading surface of your car's curved hood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you are standing on the streets in front of a huge building, half of it is in front of you and half behind. Now imagine you are also wearing the same reflective helmet like a mirror. A photo of you would show half the building behind you, and also the other half that is in front of you through the mirror reflection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
