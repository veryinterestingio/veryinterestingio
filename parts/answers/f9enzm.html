		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The house wins on a double bust. If you play by the dealers rules, you will bust 28% of the time, as will they. 7% of the time you will have a double bust, and the casino takes your money. The other 93% is a statistical split.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a player there are several &quot;little&quot; advantages that you get over the house: Extra money on blackjack, ability to split, ability to double down, and most importantly ability to react to what the dealer has.</p>
<p>The dealer has 1 big advantage - namely that in the case where you both bust the dealer wins.</p>
<p>The end result is that the dealer's 1 big advantage is <em>juuuust</em> a bit more than all of yours (if you play optimally) and much more so if you make mistakes.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT: I <strong>understand</strong> that the dealer does not actually deal out the hand if you are playing 1:1 and you bust. I stand by how I explained it because it demonstrates where the house's edge comes from even if they don't play out the hand (and therefore don't bust) for sake of speeding up a forgone conclusion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing I havent seen so far that should be noted: The full phrase should be the house always wins EVENTUALLY. It's not about winning every hand. I've gone to Vegas now at least once 11 years running and I think I'm net down about $-400 (I don't gamble much) but there are years I have won out and walked away with more than I went in. If I had hit the $1,000,000 3 card poker royal flush combo, its likely they'd never get enough back from me to make up that loss.</p>
<p>But over time and the entire breadth of their customer base, their advantages mean they win.</p>
<p>So for example, if someone is very good at video poker, puts in $5 bucks and drinks all night for free (as others here have claimed to do and I have seen occur personally), they may walk away as a loss for the house.</p>
<p>But the guy next to them who started out trying to do that, got tanked on cheap gin and tonics, and dropped $200 in the video poker covers that loss.</p>
<p>This is also built into their other pricing models for food, booze, etc.</p>
<p>Like any business, some customers may cost you more money than they make you due to mistakes or pure bad luck. But if you're structured correctly with the odds of things happening, over time your end result is a positive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
