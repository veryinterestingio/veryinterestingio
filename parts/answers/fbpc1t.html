		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some insecticides are systemic. They're sprayed onto the soil so the plant takes up the poison through its root system and is spread throughout the plant . These poisons have a limited life span so there are time limits to harvesting after spraying. If a grower sprays too close to harvest, washing fruit will not remove the insecticide.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main purpose of washing your fruit and veg isn't to remove chemicals that may have been used during the growth of the plant.</p>
<p>Instead you're washing off dirt, and any germs that may have come from the person who harvested it or touched it before it arrived in your kitchen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don’t mean to gross anyone out, but I’ve been fruit picking grapes before and I can tell you that people often cut themselves on the shears and got blood on them. Not only that but a group of of them got drunk the night before and vomited all over a case of grapes. They also sweat and rub sunscreen and god knows what other germs over everything. The people picking it aren’t the most sanitary...I hope that fruit goes through some sort of wash before it gets to the stores but just wash it just in case!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
