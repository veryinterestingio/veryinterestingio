		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Astronauts on the ISS don't actually shower like we do on Earth with running water. They basically take towel bathes. They use liquid soap and a little water on the skin, scrub with a towel, and then wipe once more with a wet towel to &quot;rinse&quot;. For hair, they use rinseless shampoo and a little water, and use either a towel or their hands to massage it in. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOIj7AgonHM" target="_blank">Here's a video of astronaut Karen Nyberg washing her hair on the space station</a>.</p>
<p>Skylab, The U.S. space station from 1973-1975, had a zero-g shower similar to what you'd use here on Earth, but it wasn't very efficient in terms of both the amount of water used and the time it took to use it, so they abandoned the idea for the ISS.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
