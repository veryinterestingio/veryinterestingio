		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you're seeing has partially to do with the fact that you've taken a plant away from its own resources. </p>
<p>Imagine, for a second, that you were picked up, and plopped somewhere in the arctic. Whoever put you there would need to do a lot of work to keep you alive.</p>
<ul>
<li>You would not be able to work your normal jobs, so you would have lost an income and a way to spend your time</li>
<li>You would need to have food and heat provided for you, as you cannot follow your typical survival strategy of &quot;pay electric company for money and turn on heater&quot; or &quot;drive to store buy food&quot;</li>
<li>You would not be able to create your typical social support network</li>
<li>Your medical system would be completely inaccessible to you</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let's apply this to plants. Note this is not 1:1</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal places where soil nutrients can be found are unavailable. Plants can't find animal manure or worm tunnels, so you'll have to provide things yourself</li>
<li>Rivers, streams, and underground water sources are missing entirely. there's no pool to tap into when the weather gets dry.</li>
<li>Plants sometimes share nutrients through a fungal network. This is not an option for your potted plant</li>
<li>Unless your plant is native to the area, many of the species it has  a symbiotic relationship with will simply be missing. If a plant is typically protected from aphids by ladybugs, but ladybugs aren't found in your area, there might not be a species that will see the plant as fertile hunting grounds, leaving your plant unprotected.</li>
<li>Your plant does not have the room to stretch out that it normally would. A wild plant will have roots that cover a vast area, allowing it to gather what it needs from where what it needs is. your potted plant only has a pot to search.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A wild plant, by its very nature and existence, is perfectly suited for the location it’s thriving in.</p>
<p>It’s a little bit survivorship bias and a little bit survival of the fittest. </p>
<p>A potted plant has at the very least been yanked out of where it feels most comfortably and is frequently the product of decades, or even centuries, of selection for charactistics that are <strong>not</strong> optimizing for survival in the wild, but rather appearance, or fruit production, or flavor, or any of the other numerous characteristics humans select for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Darwin… plants evolve to adapt to their environment. Potted plants did not evolve to their environment. </p>
<p>If you want to have perfect potted plants, you need to mimic the plants’ natural environment. The closer you get (temperature, sunlight, soil nutrition, water, noise, latitude, mycology etc.) the more robust your plants will be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
