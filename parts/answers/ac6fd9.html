		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s due to a phenomenon known as TIDAL LOCKING.</p>
<p>This happens when</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>a moon (or any celestial object) orbits another object at a close enough distance, so..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>..the gravity of the “host” object is strong enough to pull one side of the moon towards it in such a way that..</p>
</li>
<li>...the moon rotates at the same rate as it orbits</li>
</ol>
<p>In half a rotation, the moon would have turned 180 degrees and showed its other side. But at the same time, it went 180 degrees around the Earth, so now the other side of the earth sees the same side.
Here’s a handy <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking#/media/File%3ATidal_locking_of_the_Moon_with_the_Earth.gif" target="_blank">gif</a> !</p>
<p>The one we actually see is the one on the left. The one on the right is what it would look like IF the Moon weren’t tidally locked.</p>
<p>Also, the “dark side” of the Moon is misleading!
Both sides of the Moon can be lit up or in darkness, depending on the time of month.
On a Full Moon, the face you see is bright.
On a New Moon, the face you see is dark.</p>
<p>What most people mean by “dark side” is generally the side not facing the Earth.</p>
<p>(Edit: 180 degrees, forgive my 3am high ass brain)</p>
<p>Edit: so here’s some extra explanations about the mechanism of tidal locking:</p>
<p>I actually simplified the answer a lot. It’s not about one side experiencing a stronger force, it’s about one AXIS of the Moon experiencing stronger force.</p>
<p>Just like how the oceans facing the Moon experience high tide as they are pulled towards it, the Earth itself is pulled towards the Moon. Thus, the Oceans on the opposite side also experience high tide.</p>
<p>It’s this ‘bulging’ effect that effects the spin of a body.
Back when the moon was molten rock, this bulging was large enough to ‘lock’ its rotation the way it is today.

<p>Edit: the dumb mobile app isn’t showing any new responses after yesterday. I might have made a few errors in the explanation, so please DM me if there’s any edits I should make to clear things up!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Tidal_locking_of_the_Moon_with_the_Earth.gif" target="_blank">Here’s a visual</a>. It’s called synchronous rotation. The left animation is how our moon moves. The right animation would be if it had zero rotation. You can see in the left image how the same face is always pointing towards Earth. This is because the time it takes to make one orbit around Earth is nearly equal to the time it takes to make one rotation about its axis. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Moon rotates just like most other objects in space.  However, the time it takes to rotate is exactly the same as it takes to go around the Earth.  From our perspective, the same side is always facing us.  The process by which this is maintained is called Tidal Locking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
