		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You and everyone else that is a human, have two different nervous systems that work together in the body.</p>
<p>One is under your conscious control... For things like moving your arms, chewing your food, and deciding to make a silent-but-deadly fart on the elevator.</p>
<p>The other controls things automatically, such as your beating heart, the digestion of your food, and dialation of your eyes.</p>
<p>Where your bladder and rectum are concerned, there are two groups of muscles, called sphincters, that act as a valve, to either release, or restrict the flow of your pee and poop - one is on manual control, the other is on automatic.</p>
<p>When you decide to go to the bathroom, you make a concious effort to open one of the pair of sphincters - the one under your concious control. </p>
<p>The other sphincter is under automatic control, and usually it will play along too, but sometimes it does not.</p>
<p>This is why some people are &quot;pee shy&quot; when peeing in public.  The automatic nervous system wont relax control of the sphincter under it's control.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it's the other way around... It has released, and is not going to clamp back down again until you are empty.</p>
<p>This is also why you sometimes get &quot;pee shivers&quot; when you are nearly done.</p>
<p>The automatic nervous system is releasing control of your bladder back to the manual nervous system again and for a split second, it's like a light switch toggling back and forth between the two systems, so you &quot;shiver&quot;, before the manual control is resumed.</p>
<p>Sorry for the long text wall... I hope this answers your question.</p>
<p>--
TL;DR:  You have two sphincters, one on manual, one on automatic...and your brains (automatic and manual) fight for control over your bladder, while peeing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two urethral sphincters that controll the release of urine.   One is controllable, and the other is involuntary. </p>
<p>Once you start peeing, both are open, and while you can close the voluntary sphincter, you cant close the invomuntary one</p>
<p>Something like that. Its been many mokns since i studied the urinary system</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
