		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1 methyl pentane = wrongly named hexane. Naming the ___ane part always uses the longest chain of carbons. Looking at hexane as a pentane with a methyl group at the one position does not use the longest carbon chain as the reference for naming. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because 1-methyl pentane is identical to n-Hexane (same for a hypothetical 5-methyl pentane)</p>
<p>the problem is likely in the way you draw these things in your head/notes vs the reality.</p>
<p>try to draw both and number each C, now compare them and see how they differ...</p>
<p>likely the only difference between the 2 is the angle at which you drew the methyl... in reality that angle isn't different and they both look <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Hexane-3D-balls.png" target="_blank">like this</a> (still a flawed representation but it illustrates the point...)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As u/uncleswillis said, when figuring out what to call it, you count the longest carbon chain, the 1-methyl group is on the first carbon so it just adds onto the chain. This makes a 6 carbon chain and therefore just hexane.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like you found your answer.  While we're here, help me out with an A-level chemistry reminiscence? In my chem classroom we had a big chart on the wall called The Boat, which was a diagram of all the different reactions possible between types of organic molecule.  It was shaped kind of like a sailboat, with (I think) haloalkanes in the middle, and then the curving bottom of the hull was alcohols, aldehydes/ketones and carboxylic acids, and the big triangular sail was between haloalkanes, alcohols and something else I don't remember.</p>
<p>Is this a standard thing that I just can't find anywhere, or is it something my teacher invented and do you have an equivalent?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
