<p>Having looked after plenty of elderly patients who are wannabe WWF wrestlers one day, and meek and polite old ladies and men the next after antibiotics, it's easy to conclude UTIs cause delerium.</p>
<p>However, honestly, there is little evidence for it. If you dip test (testing for protein, nitrites and leukocyte esterase among other things) or send a sample for MC&amp;S testing (seeing if it will grow bacteria) in most elderly people, you will find there are some bacteria present versus what you would expect in a 20 year old.</p>
<p>They are also, especially dip testing, an incredibly easy test to do. So people tend to see someone with delerium, dip test their urine, show a <em>possible</em> UTI and bang, off to hospital for some antibiotics.</p>
<p>In actual fact, delerium can also be caused by dehydration, constipation and poor nutrition, among other factors. Of course in a hospital environment all three are much more closely monitored and greater resources are available.</p>
<p>So, you properly feed someone, make sure they drink and poo and that means the magic antibiotic tablet must have worked!</p>
<p>That's not to say UTIs aren't sometimes the cause, and antibiotics aren't sometimes the solution, but the current situation of assuming it's the default cause is ridiculous. Firstly, antibiotic overuse in the elderly causes issues, notably suseptibility to c diff. Secondly, especially with covid, bringing elderly patients into hospital as the first solution instead of making sure the care home is actually feeding, encouraging drinking and making sure they aren't constipated puts the patient at risk and (here) is a massive waste of NHS resources.</p>
<p>tl;dr UTIs are a possible cause of delerium, but in my experience as a nurse neglect is often the cause, with the fact that almost all urine samples from elderly people <em>could</em> be interpreted as a UTI used as a covering factor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To be clear, this is not 100% accepted.  It's commonly taught in medical schools to check a UA in an elderly person with a new onset delirium without any clear cause.  However, I don't think there is any strong literature about this topic, and it seems mostly founded in a confirmation bias.  You check a bunch of UAs, some of them come back looking like UTI.  You could probably find a bunch of dirty UAs in population of old people in nursing homes, even if they are at their cognitive baseline.</p>
<p>This is something commonly said, but unclear how real it is.  If it is real, it's probably some hand-wavy &quot;local inflammation causes increased levels of specific serum cytokines, which in turn disrupt neurologic function in susceptible individuals, something something...&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few points to consider here:</p>
<p>Normally, we have extra capacity in our body to do more than just regular function. E.g. our heart and lungs are able to work harder when we exercise. In other words, we have some reserve capacity in case we need it. This applies to the brain as well. As we age, we lose these capacity. We lose it even more, and faster, when we have a disease that affect a particular organ. You can think of dementia patient as having severely reduce brain ability, to the point of having no reserve beyond just regular day-to-day activity.</p>
<p>When you are sick, the body would try to ramp up a stress/immune response to get over the illness. Kind of like the fight/flight response. If the brain is already at its limits, then it will simply make less 'important' functions (like memory, executive function, logical reasoning) go dormant, while focusing more on the survival (brainstem) functions. This would result in delirium.</p>
<p>Any kind of mental or physical stress can cause this. UTIs just happen to be one of the most common infection that the elderly get. </p>
<p>As an aside, you can kind of simulate this yourself. Take a random online quiz when you're in tip-top shape, then take another random quiz after you drank a gallon of water and really need to pee. Your performance is probably somewhat reduced when your brain is distracted by the extra sensation in your bladder. Same principle, except that to a demented patient, daily living is like a pretty hard quiz already.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
