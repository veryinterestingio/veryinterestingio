		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;About 8% of our genome is composed of sequences with viral origin, namely human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs). HERVs are relics of ancient infections that affected the primates' germ line along the last 100 million of years, and became stable elements at the interface between self and foreign DNA.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Undergrad studed in microbiology here. I can assure you that it happens everywhere.</p>
<p>A lot of viruses (especially DNA viruses) will incorporte their genome during their infection cycle. RNA viruses like retroviruses  (HIV) can also incorporate their genome by converting their RNA genome to a DNA genome. </p>
<p>A popular example is the herpesvidiae, which are very widespread in the human population.</p>
<p>That being said, you probably meant something like:
&quot;Have we ever modified humans genomes with viruses&quot;</p>
<p>Yes. We used viruses as genitic tools for a long time and we even attempted to modify humans with adenoviruses in the 90s or early 00s, but if I remember well, the patient died shortly after.</p>
