		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Paper products are made from wood fibers that are basically matted together in random orientations like felt. As the paper dries, little hairs and random kinks in the fibers cause them to link up like tangled hair. Pressing/rolling operations enhance this effect.</p>
<p>Paper fiber is very hydrophilic, meaning it can soak up water easily and will soak up far more than its own weight in water. As the water wets the paper, capillary action pulls the water into the spaces between fibers and forces them apart. At the same same time, the fibers themselves absorb water, swelling up.</p>
<p>Between the swelling and the capillary action, the fibers are simply not as able to cling together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

When they're dry it's harder to untangle them so they keep their shape. When they're wet they become very slippery and loose so they don't hold up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The fibers that make up those materials are held together by hydrogen bonds. Now don't let the name mislead you - hydrogen bonds are not actually chemical bonds. Rather, they are intermolecular forces that rely on molecular polarity. Polarity can basically be described by the distribution of electrons that can make a part of a molecule partially positive or partially negative. So the partially positive part of one fiber is attracted to the partially negative part of another, and thus we get a sheet of fibers held together by hydrogen bonds.</p>
<p>Now introduce water. One of the most important properties of water is its polarity, so when you put these often hydrophilic (or water-loving) fibers in the presence of water, the partially charged parts of these fibers will form hydrogen bonds with the water instead. Thus, it takes much less force to actually pull these fibers apart after it has been exposed to water as there are fewer attractions holding the fibers together!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water covers the paper fibers making them slippery and it can move in between fibers causing expansion. This expansion means that fibers that were previously touching and providing structural integrity are now free floating. The reason water doesn't cause paper to instantly disintegrate is that even with the reduction in friction there is still quite a bit of entanglement in the fibers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
