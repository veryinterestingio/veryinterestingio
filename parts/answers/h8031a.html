		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s not well understood. It seems loss of liver function and lower ADH (alcohol dehydrogenase) levels in the liver and GI system are an important factor. It’s likely that vascular changes and lower sex steroid levels also contribute. </p>
<p>Here’s a decent layman article if you want to read more: <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fatherly.com/health-science/why-hangovers-get-worse-with-age/amp/" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fatherly.com/health-science/why-hangovers-get-worse-with-age/amp/</a></p>
<p>A related fun fact: the primary reason you pee so much after a few drinks is that alcohol (which is ampiphathic - midway between hydrophobic and hydrophilic) directly screws up the stability of cell membranes. In this case, it’s the cells of your posterior pituitary, which normally releases ADH (anti diuretic hormone - yes this is a different ADH - medical acronyms suck), but the vesicles with ADH can’t fuse with the disrupted cell membrane in the presence of ethanol. ADH normally goes from the pituitary to the kidney to say “hey! Hold on to water and don’t piss it out” but it’s stuck in your brain after a few drinks.  This stored-up ADH is then released in overly high quantities as you sober up, hence why a hungover person can drink a few liters of water before they start producing urine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
