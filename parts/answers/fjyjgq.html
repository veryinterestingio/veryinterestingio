		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>UV light is a short enough wave length that it can penetrate into cells/viruses.  When it does, it causes damage to the pathogen’s DNA.  Essentially it gives pathogens supercharged cancer.  It damages bacterial/viral DNA so badly that the cell can’t replicate and dies.  Which is why most UV sterilization protocols are a minimum of 15 minutes, sometimes up to an hour, to make sure enough damage is done.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a biologist but I do want to chime in that the optimal wavelengths for disinfection are close to 270 nm and are commonly produced by a mercury-vapor lamp. That I have seen, no LED can produce this frequency. Please don't fall victim to LED sanitation devices.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>UV light has a lot of energy per photon. Enough energy to knock electrons off many common chemicals that make up living things bodies. Once that happens you have what's called a free radical, they like to react with anything they are near. It can also break bonds in chemicals necessary for life. So UV creates free radicals that go around and wreck the complex web of chemical reactions we call life. They are capable of screwing up most pathogens so badly that they just die. Every living thing can take a certain amount of UV but eventually it's just too much for their system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The same way it can cause us cancer - it mutates DNA.</p>
<p>In humans we have a LOT of DNA and a lot of cells, so if DNA gets mutated in a cell and not repaired, it’s unlikely to kill us - it’s probably not going to be in an important region of our genome and even if it is if we need to we could destroy the cell and have plenty of others to take over for it.</p>
<p>Bacteria have less DNA and are unicellular, so a mutation is more likely to be lethal</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So at my hospital we have these machines that you put touchscreen devices in to sanitize. They are slid into a mirrored box with 6 UV bulbs for about 1 minute. Is that enough to actually accomplish anything? The device automatically ends this cycle after 1 minute so we dont choose the length of time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
