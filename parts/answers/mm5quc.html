		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Egg whites are 90% water and 10% protein strands. When you whip egg whites, these proteins uncurl and bond together into a net that traps air bubbles to create the foamy meringue. If there's fat in the mix, the fat gets in between the proteins and prevents them from bonding into the net, and air bubbles pop instead of creating foam.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Egg whites are about 90% water and 10% protein. When you beat egg whites, you force the proteins to stretch out. As they stretch out, they begin to bond with each other. Meanwhile, you're whipping air into the water, forming little bubbles. As the proteins bond, they form a stable network that traps the bubbles inside - hence you get &quot;stiff peaks&quot; because you have a network of firm proteins supporting a bunch of air bubbles.</p>
<p>If you have some fat in the mixture, the proteins would rather bond to the fat than bond to each other, and thus you don't get the structure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
