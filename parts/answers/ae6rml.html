<p>Metabolic activity of the brain has been shown to be pretty constant across time and across different mental activities. Transient task-related changes in brain activity are often small in magnitude relative to baseline activities (e.g. using changes in local blood flow as a proxy, task-induced 'activation' are often &lt;5%).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is no - blood flow is generally constant and the influx of glucose saturated cerebral spinal fluid is also constant. It's far more complex than that but generally the changes are not significant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the conscious brain is such as small fraction of the whole brain, although it feels like we are focusing our whole mind on a task and thinking as hard as we can, we are only doing so with the small amount of brain that we control. So maybe that part of our brain will be burning more calories, but this will add to an insignificant amount seeing as the rest of the brain will keep on doing what it always does. (Unconscious information/ stimulus processing, reflexes, bodily function etc.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually just read an article about something related to this in English and from my understanding, whether youâ€™re thinking intensely, or not thinking at all, the brain always uses roughly around the same amount of energy. I could be wrong though so take that with a grain of salt. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
