		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A point on the medical side of this question: alcohol swaps are fairly terrible at sanitizing skin. If we really wanted to sterilize skin before your vaccination, IV insertion, whatever, we’d scrub the site with chlorhexidine for at least 30 seconds and allow it to dry, which is what is done before surgeries, central lines, chest tubes, etc. The procedures performed after an alcohol swabbing are all very low risk for infection, swab or no swab. The alcohol will certainly kill some stuff, but the thrust of the benefit is for the patient’s perception of cleanliness, which receives a fairly intense sensory experience (cold skin from rapid evaporation, pungent aroma, etc) and associates this with good clean care. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
