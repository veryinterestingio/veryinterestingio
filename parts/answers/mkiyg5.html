		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a dark room, turn on the faucet (slowly enough that its clear) and shine a flashlight into the stream. See how the light bounces around and draws a spot of light at the bottom of the sink? That means some of the light didn't go straight through the column of water.</p>
<p>The same thing is happening when clothes or a surface gets wet: some of the light which would normally be reflected by the dry surface gets deeper into the wet surface, so you don't see it getting reflected back to your eye. This makes it look darker.</p>
<p>EDIT: Adjusted wording a bit for clarity. Thanks for the awards!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I thought this scishow episode did a good job explaining it. It's kind of tough giving an eli5 explanation of this without pictures. </p>
<p>But the main thing is that some of the light bounces off the shirt, bounces off the inner surface of the water, and back towards the shirt again instead of towards your eyes.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The clothes appear darker <strong>if you're on the same side as the light.</strong> If the you are on the other side of the clothes from the light source, the wet part will appear brighter.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that light can move through water, so when water gets into the fibers of the fabric it creates little passages for light to get through. When the light can pass through the cloth, less light bounces back to your eye so the spot appears darker. Super dark materials use this effect, but instead of using water they use carbon fibers to create a light trapping forest</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In fact they don't, they only turn more transparent.</p>
<p>Try to create a wet spot on a cloth and then point it to the sun or to a light bulb. You will see that that spot appears brighter, not darker.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
