		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mars does not have tectonic plates, it began to form them at some point in the past, but this ground to a halt. </p>
<p>On Earth, volcanoes form in two main ways, at plate boundaries (think pacific ring of fire, the italian volcanoes), and secondly at hotspots, where a plume of hot magma melts through the crust (think Yellowstone, Hawaii or Iceland (but Iceland is a hotspot on a plate boundary)).</p>
<p>The Martian volcanoes are all formed by hotspots. The reason they are so large is that the crust stays still relative to the plume, so the volcano just keeps growing, whereas on Earth, such as at Hawaii, the crust moves over the hotspot, leading to a chain. All the Martian volcanoes are now dormant or extinct, as Mars, being small, cooled down quicker than Earth, so the Martian crust is far thicker than Earth's crust, and its mantle is believed to have largely solidified.</p>
<p>Marsquakes today are believed to be from a couple of main reasons:</p>
<p>As things cool, they shrink. This shrinking inside Mars causes stress and fractures which are released as Marsquakes.</p>
<p>Secondly, impacts cause shockwaves which travel throughout the planet. These quakes are easier to verify by looking at satellite imagery to check for new craters.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to a talk by the NASA Chief Scientist Jim Green, which I attended yesterday, it's because Mars is still cooling. As (most) material cools, it contracts. This global contraction causes stress as it can't be done continually and smoothly, so sometimes things will snap/fracture/break and cause a marsquake.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I was taught, mars has a solid core which means that it would not have plate tectonics. The lack of a solid core creating a magnetic field, is what led to the planets atmosphere getting weaker due to solar radiation eating away at it. As for the recorded quake, one of my professors said that it was due to the crust shifting due to pressure differences build up from when the planet did have plate movement, as well as other material in the crust shifting, although this isn't 100% certain. It was a relatively small quake that wouldn't be felt on earth's surface at magnitude 2.5, so this is a probable cause.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mars has a liquid core similar to Earth, but it is not as hot or as dense and the outer crust of Mars is significantly thicker.  As a result, there is still geological activity, but to a lesser extent as Earth.  Geological features like mountains and trenches are formed by tectonic plate boundaries and since Mars has these features it is reasonable to assume they also have tectonic plates. </p>
<p>However, even the composition of Earth’s core is theory ... as is Mars’s ... so none of this can be certain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
