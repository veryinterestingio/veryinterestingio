		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the population gets so low, the genetic diversity is <em>definitely</em> reduced—no chance about it. This makes the species more susceptible to problems in the future even if the population comes roaring back. They are more likely to all die from the same disease, for instance. The genes are so similar that it is less likely for a few members of the population to have immunity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yeah - when zoos do Species Survival plans, they actually take this into account.</p>
<p>Green SSPs are self-sustaining, meaning that we have enough individuals to avoid inbreeding and maintain a healthy captive population.</p>
<p>Yellow SSPs aren't self-sustaining but have the potential to become self-sustaining without seriously harming wild populations - usually means we don't have a high enough reproduction rate in captivity but have enough captive individuals to create a good breeding program with a bit of improvement.</p>
<p>Red studbooks have populations of fewer than 50 animals and are not self sustaining. They can't actually be considered an SSP because breeding under these conditions is not recommended without serious improvement. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Which is why its important to protect species / habitats <strong>before</strong> they become endangered!  Yes the population numbers might return after conservation efforts, but the genetic makeup of the species/populations won’t necessarily be the same as before. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s a term called a genetic bottleneck. When a population is reduced to a very low number from a very high number, the remaining animals’ genes will basically decide the short-term fate of the species. There are only those genes to choose from, aside from mutation which is a very slow process, hence the “short-term” part. That being said, you don’t need a lot animals to have decent variation. Obviously it varies, but around 50 is still enough to not have a negative impact. Also, arguably the surviving animals are the most fit and should have the genes that will best help the species survive. </p>
<p>To give an example, I once read that cheetahs are all so closely related that you could take skin from one cheetah and transplant it to another random cheetah and it would not be rejected because cheetahs are so genetically similar. This is because something like 50,000 years ago, there was a big cheetah extinction and only a few members were left. Those members’ genes then decided what kinds of immune molecules cheetahs could express (since the immune system is responsible for transplant rejection but that’s a whole other story). </p>
<p>A similar situation occurs when a small population settles a new area. Say ten chimps leave a population of 1,000 chimps and settle the jungle across the river that no chimps live in. And now with the river there is no exchange between the two populations. Those ten chimps that moved will have the genes that determine their descendants genes. This is called the Founder Effect iirc. Given enough time, the two populations may even evolve into different species as long as the two groups can’t mate (in this case due to the river). </p>
<p>Source: I’m a molecular biologist but I did three years of evolutionary genetics research in undergrad. Since it was undergrad my memory is a little rusty so some of the terms I used may not be exactly correct, like Founder Effect. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
