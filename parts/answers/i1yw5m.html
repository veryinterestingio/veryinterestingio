		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol works on GABA receptors in the brain, which is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter - it slows down the speed and ease that neurons communicate. Developing a tolerance to alcohol means that your brain produces less GABA since it can rely on the alcohol to fill those receptors. </p>
<p>Quitting cold turkey, suddenly you have no natural GABA and no alcohol, so nothing is stopping your neurons in your brain from talking faster and faster, eventually developing into a seizure. Seizures are incredibly unpredictable and can suffocate you outright or lead to a nasty fall, car crash, bathtub drowning, etc. </p>
<p>Same thing happens with barbiturates or benzodiazepines like Xanax, Valium, Ativan, Klonopin. Benzos, barbiturates, and alcohol are considered the most dangerous drugs to withdraw from for this reason, moreso than even opiates.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you take a drug that changes the way your body behaves, your body gets used to it. This is called &quot;tolerance&quot;. Alcohol slows down some important things in your body, and your body reacts by speeding things up just to stay alive. When you suddenly remove the alcohol, the body doesn't have time to adjust, and is still &quot;speeding&quot; without alcohol to slow it down. This can lead to seizures.</p>
<p>There are other drugs with similar effects, like anti-anxiety drugs (benzos). But most other drugs don't interfere with vital processes the way these do, and so withdrawal isn't as dangerous.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Its steadily getting to a point where I'm having more and more beer then at the end of the night spirits. So I'm trying to moderate it. But my question is this I'm having less but my liver hurts is that normal? Like I have a pain on my right side when I'm lying down and can barely sleep. Anyone else experience that?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Are you saying other drugs don’t cause death from withdrawal? <a href="https://americanaddictioncenters.org/withdrawal-timelines-treatments/risk-of-death" target="_blank">Because they do. </a> Alcohol isn’t alone in how dangerous it can be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
