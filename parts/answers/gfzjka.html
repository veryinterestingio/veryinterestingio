		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Underneath the surface of your skin, there are pockets that produce oil. These oil producing pockets are called glands. The ones on your face are called sebaceous glands and they’re the same ones that oil your hair. These glands are known to be larger on and around the nose, their size depending heavily on genetics. These larger glands help produce more skin oil (sebum) which in turn is believed to act as a barrier against microbes and helps better regulate temperature of the skin. </p>
<p>I do not believe we understand what exactly causes these glands to be larger in certain areas of the face.</p>
<p>edit: I should note that it’s impossible to shrink the size of these pores</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
