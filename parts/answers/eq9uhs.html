		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Concrete 100% submerged is significantly less susceptible to deterioration than concrete that goes through wet/dry cycles which would be in shallower depths. For shallow depth repair work, you can install temporary cofferdams around the work area to dewater the immediate area to complete the required work. Also divers can do many repairs, albeit slower/costlier in general.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>For something like a dam you can drain the water if needed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

There are also coatings and cementitious grouts that can be applied underwater for spot repairs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
