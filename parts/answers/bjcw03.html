You can have zero-calorie soft drinks because it's possible to make pop without sugar; but there's no way to make an alcoholic beverage without alcohol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol itself turns into sugars and therefore has calories.</p>
<p>You could have a cocktail made with an artificial sweetener, but it can't be zero calorie because of the alcohol.</p>
<p>Beer still contains carbs from the mash it was made from. If you removed the parts that give it extra calories, you would end up with a weird beer-ish spirit. And this spirit would still have calories from the alcohol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol is the second most calorie-dense food there is - it has 7 calories per gram. You would need to find a calorie-free substance that gave you a similar feeling to get calorie-free beer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
