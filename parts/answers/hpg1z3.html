		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>tl;dr: no and no.</p>
<p>longer version:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>more likely to destroy any kind of pathogen?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your body has two kinds of immune responses. One could be considered as the front lines defense and fights anything it thinks shouldn't be there. Think fevers. The other is more like special forces that goes after a specific target. When you hear about antibodies, you're hearing about the second one. This second response learns as it goes; when you encounter a new pathogen, it takes time for this system to learn how to recognize and fight it.</p>
<p>A vaccine prepares the body to be ready to execute the second type of response faster, so it can hit the ground running when you come across that specific pathogen. The first will generally react as soon as it recognizes that there's a threat in general and doesn't need to be primed in the same way, so there's no real vaccines to help it. </p>
<p>So no, it will only prepare the body to destroy one kind of pathogen. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>does my immune system become more active for a short time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, but not in the way that you think. When you feel sore after getting your flu shot, that's your immune system responding to the pathogens in the vaccine. The first immune response activates because it detects a threat, but once the second response removes it, it settles down. It's not active in a way that would make it strategic to take several vaccines to keep your immune system at the ready. </p>
<p>The effects of the vaccine on the second immune response; however, lasts for a very long time. In fact, the main reason you need to get a flu shot every year isn't because last year's wore off, it's because the flu virus has mutated again. If you ever come across that previous strain again, your body would be ready and you'd probably never even know about it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. Depends on who you ask. There is some research that shows that certain vaccines induce cellular responses that can protect or respond to other pathogens.  <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31158520/" target="_blank">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31158520/</a></p>
<p>Especially if you're being exposed to more broadly recognizable PAMPs, which is technically not what a vaccine is. But some vaccines can contain these if they have an adjuvant or they're whole pathogen vaccines. sorry this was sort of a half assed response but gives the general idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That depends on what you were actually injected with, the adjuncts may boost your response to all antigens that you are exposed to at that time, obviously, including self-antigens, i.e. this may be how in rare cases immunisation is correlated with the incidence of autoimmune disease. Also, the TB vaccine causes a long term elevation of the activity in the innate immune system, this is being studied in Australia at the moment r.e. helping boost the body's response to covid-19 before and a specific vaccine is available. They were testing it on health workers I believe. I have been vaccinated for everything that a human can be routinely vaccinated against so I hope I have acquired that protection too, however, I do also get autoimmune issues after influenza vaccinations each year.   </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would say yes. Any immunologically active compound will initiate the inflammatory process necessary for memory response.</p>
<p>We need some inflammation meaning that the immune system needs to rev up at least slightly in order to perform its essential functions.</p>
<p>Some people will be concerned when they develop a fever following a vaccine or in some cases a rash. This is actually a very benign and normal physiological response that shows that your body is doing exactly what it should when exposed to (what it thinks is) a pathogen</p>
<p>Look up adjuvants. Adjuvants are added to vaccines to amplify the expected inflammatory response. We NEED this response so when a vaccine isnâ€™t as immunologically active on its own as we need it to be, we can augment the response.</p>
<p>So in conclusion I would say that yes, having a vaccine temporarily increases the inflammatory activity of the body which includes all of the less specific immune processes that occur as well.</p>
