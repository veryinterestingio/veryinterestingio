<p>Why exactly does the activity of hydrogen ions tend to bottom out at 1/10^(14) in most cases?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't. However, many textbooks and reference books show a scale from 0 to 14, intended to symmetrically bracket water (~7); as you note, these aren't limits but may give the impression of limits. As noted in <a href="https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/5737/is-a-negative-ph-level-physically-possible" target="_blank">this useful discussion</a>, &quot;<em>The 0 on the pH scale is an artefact of our system of units. Physically, there is nothing special about the concentration 1 mol dm^(−3) (pH 0) any more than there is about the concentration 1 lb-mol ft^(−3).</em>&quot; The use of 14 for symmetry is thus also an artefact. I can't answer your main question except to say that I can't think of a reason for a maximum or minimum chemical potential for a proton in an unspecified medium, so I also can't justify an upper or lower pH limit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>pH is the minus log (base 10) of the concentration of hydrogen ions. </p>
<p>Assuming we’re talking about a mysterious kilogram of material/plasma/sci-fi soup that is compromised solely of hydrogen ions without any isotopes other than protium, then molar concentration would be 1000 M. </p>
<p>-log10(1000) = -3. </p>
<p>Hypothetical lowest pH is -3.</p>
<p>Doesn’t really work for the other end of the scale as you can’t log 0. Maybe if you used pOH instead?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>pH is a logarithmic number. That means there is actual limits to its positive value. </p>
<p>If the concentration of hydrogen is 0, pH equals infinity. In practise, this situation probably can’t ever be reached.</p>
<p>If the concentration of hydrogen is very high, pH becomes slightly negative. Assuming the maximum density of hydrogen atoms is similar to liquid hydrogen (which is quite a stretch; liquid hydrogen is H2, while pH is about H+ in water solution), the minimal pH is about -1.85. I have no clue how high the actual concentration <em>could</em> be, but I think this is a good lower limit for pH.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>pH is the logarithmic measure of concentration of protons in a given solution. A pH of -3 would correspond to (approximately) a concentration of 1000 mol of a strong acid. Since it’s a logarithmic scale and assuming the equation works for any concentration then you’re only limited by the maximum concentration of acid you can dissolve in a solution. For example, fluoroantimonic acid is dissolved in a solution of hydrofluoric acid and has a pH of -31.</p>
<p>As for the rest of OP’s question, if we were to graph the pH correction formula then as we approach absolute zero the pH correction tends to infinite, the acidity itself is unchanged. So I guess the greatest theoretical pH you could reach would be (plus or minus) infinite but the actual acidity of an acid im not sure.</p>
<p>Someone more qualified can answer or correct any mistakes I’ve made.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
