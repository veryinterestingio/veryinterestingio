<p>What they actually do is lift the whole package a bit and then let it drop. The attachment via the  mesentery will pull it into a coiling that is the most relaxed.</p>
<p>Easy peasy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>So yeah it’s both kinda random and ordered.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I am curious: what about post pregnancy intestines? </p>
<p>I know that the uterus shrinks gradually(ish), but there's a pretty significant change right after birth. What happens to the intestines? I've often thought they just kind of flop down Willy nilly and end up disheveled (it's one of my irrational fears/thoughts in postpartum). </p>
<p>Do they go exactly back into place, assuming there is no prolapse, of course?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The process by which the intestine coils is actually very organized. It starts as a straight line and then grows longer than it can fit in the body and turns 270 degrees around in a loop, then forms a sort of fan structure. That makes the base of the organization which most people have (the equivalent of having a bridge and two nostrils). Some people are missing a twist or retain weird pouches but those are more defects than random variation. Otherwise there's just mild variation like you would expect with noses. It's all just organized chaos. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AscKR_cQExY" target="_blank">Here</a> is a sweet animation going over the way the intestines form. Learning it from the embryo turning into a full human makes it all a bit simpler I think.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>General surgeon.  I do surgery on the intestines virtually every day.</p>
<p>Intestines can vary by person.  In a totally untouched abdomen with no abnormalities from birth,  the small bowel is attached to its mesentary which keeps it from tangling on its self and causing what is called a volvulus.  when I say small bowel here, I mean jejunum and ileum, the duodenum is a beast of a different nature and is totally fixed exactly where it is.  It encircles the pancreas and you can barely see it when you get into the abdomen unless you go looking for it. </p>
<p>Jejnum and ileum can moved around some but they aren’t able to twist on themselves. </p>
<p>Of course, it seems I never get to operate on regular anatomy, as those people don’t need surgery usually.</p>
<p>All sorts of things can make the small bowel get fixed.  Any time somebody has surgery or inflammation for any reason of the intestines (appendicitis, inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, trauma, and endless other reasons) scar tissue grows in the abdomen called “adhesions”.  This can fix the small bowel in certain areas and cause all sorts of problems.  Just last week one of these bands of scar tissue allowed a girls bowel to wrap itself around it and cut off its blood supply and die, she lost 1/3 of her small bowel.</p>
<p>The colon is fixed. </p>
<p>I was a senior resident before I understood how the mesentary of the small bowel and colon truly work and exist in 3 dimensions and be able to visualize it well.  It is complex.  And when you add on endless weird abnormalities it can get really complex.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
<p>Edit: few typos as I was writing this on mobile between cases.  Please ignore them</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
