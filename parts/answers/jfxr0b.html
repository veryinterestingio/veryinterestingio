		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because &quot;seeing&quot; is just one way of observing something. Imagine I tell you to close your eyes and put a cup in front of you. You are allowed to touch the cup. Just because you can't see it clearly doesn't mean you don't know it's there. I could then pour some coffee into it and let you taste - again, without &quot;seeing&quot; it, you know the coffee exists. If anything, you know it with greater certainty than if you just looked at the brown liquid and assumed it to be coffee.</p>
<p>So we can clearly use all our senses to observe something, but why exactly should an observation be limited to the human senses? That's the idea behind a lot of science - find <em>some</em> way to observe a given phenomenon, then somehow turn that information into something we can understand with our senses, for example a graph we can look at.</p>
<p>Electrons are subatomic particles. When we want to observe something we think is there, but can't easily use our own senses to observe, we try to find a different approach. With particles we often know some things about them that are unique, kind of like a fingerprint. This could be their mass, momentum or other properties. Commonly, we will measure the energy of a particle, as it tells us a lot about it. Think of the cup example I made, what if I put an apple next to the cup. You could clearly tell by touching them that you had two different items in each hand.</p>
<p>Now, you might be tempted to say &quot;okay, so you measure some energy, how do you know that is an electron and not some other particle?&quot;. Well, as I mentioned they are unique, so we really just need to theoretically say &quot;a particle with these properties is called an electron&quot; and then whenever we find one such particle that match our definition, well that is an electron.</p>
<p>Edit: Thank you for gold, glad my comment could help!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thompson is credited with the discovery of the electron. He was investigating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray" target="_blank">cathode rays</a>; with his discovery we know that these are streams of electrons.</p>
<p>He could manipulate the rays to hit or not hit a target using magnetic fields. When they hit the target, electricity was produced. When they missed, there was no electricity. So he first proved that the rays carry electricity.</p>
<p>Second he could repeat the above using electric fields (i.e. the field produced by un-moving charge) instead of magnetic fields.</p>
<p>Finally, he could also use a balancing act of magnetic fields and electric fields to calculate how much charge each gram of the cathode ray has. He found this number did not change when he tried different metals and different gases in the tube. From this we know that there is a fundamental universal quantity of charge. This heavily implies that charge should have a fundamental particle, i.e. the electron.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How do you air exists? You can’t see it either, but you can see it affects other things when it pushes on them. </p>
<p>Electrons are the same. We noticed that something changes atoms and molecules in chemical reactions and that the same something can interact with magnetic fields. They decided to call that something an electron.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans only have 5 sensory organs, which basically means that if we can’t see it, touch it, taste it, smell it, or hear it, then it ‘doesn’t exist’ to us until someone builds a machine to detect it.</p>
<p>Consider radiation, it has existed since the first stars collided in the universe, but ‘we’ didn’t know it was there until 1895 when the affects of radiation were observed on objects placed close to it.</p>
<p>LOTS of research was done, fast forward a few years and eventually the Geiger Counter was invented that can detect the presence of radiation that is invisible to us.</p>
<p>There are still a great many things that we don’t know exist because we don’t have a machine that can detect them yet...</p>
<p>Machines like the Large Hadron Collider at CERN have been built just for the purpose of ‘detecting’ things that we can’t see, touch, taste, smell or hear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a variety of famous experiments that demonstrated the existence of, and properties of, electrons. This list is not exhaustive, but are some of the most influential, or certainly the most historically significant.</p>
<p>The Millikan Oil Drop experiment, which allowed phsyicists to meaure the fundamental charge of the electron:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_drop_experiment" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil\_drop\_experiment" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil\_drop\_experiment</a></a></p>
<p>The Davisson-Germer experiment, that confirmed the de Broglie hypothesis and allowed physicists to see electrons exhibiting wave-like behaviours such as diffraction for the first time: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davisson%E2%80%93Germer_experiment" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davisson%E2%80%93Germer\_experiment" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davisson%E2%80%93Germer\_experiment</a></a></p>
<p>The Stern-Gerlach experiment, which allowed physicists to observe that electrons have instrinsic spins (called spin up and spin down), that causes them to be deflected one of two ways in a strong magnetic field. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern%E2%80%93Gerlach_experiment" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern%E2%80%93Gerlach\_experiment" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern%E2%80%93Gerlach\_experiment</a></a></p>
<p>And, going back to the source, JJ Thomson, the man who discovered the electron in a very famous experiment involving cathode ray tubes, demonstrated that the rays were not made of light, but had mass and were electrically charged. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._Thomson#Experiments_with_cathode_rays" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.\_J.\_Thomson#Experiments\_with\_cathode\_rays" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.\_J.\_Thomson#Experiments\_with\_cathode\_rays</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
