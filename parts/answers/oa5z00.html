		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good morning Reddit! I am excited to step aside from the bench for a few hours today to chat with you. Ask Away! Our work focuses on trying to understand how immune cells adapt to solid tissue environments where they carry their protective functions, ie: a CD8 T cell embedded in your skin protecting you from herpes... the trick is that these cells actually reside in that tissue for years without ever leaving (&gt;10 years), how do they do that while exposed to harsh conditions? Are they like well-educated hikers that pack in their own food?, or do they work like ticks, sucking food out of the tissue? or a combination? Understanding how immune cells naturally live in tissues is key to determine new approaches to use these same cells against solid tumors... where they currently do not work very well - HAPPY to be here!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
