		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a high pressure ejection of your nose to get something out that picking it won't get, gotta collect that air... Also alot of people sneeze out of their mouth when the whole reason you sneezed in the first place is because your nose got all irritated... Close your mouth and let the air release from your nose. It's a bit of strong pressure but you'll more likely get the cause of it and not need any follow up sneezes.</p>
<p>Edit:toned down</p>
<p>Edit 2: sentence structure and if nose releasing hurts you, I don't know how today describe how you should only allow half or partial air to be sent to your nose instead of all that air you inhaled. I'd describe it as a nose &quot;chuff&quot; sound.</p>
<p>Edit3: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-sneeze-properly-2014-3" target="_blank">&quot;The goal is to expel the irritant from the nasal cavity,&quot; said Moss, so it's important to sneeze at least partly out of your nose.
However, because the nasal cavity isn't big enough alone to handle the release of such a large volume of air, some of the sneeze pretty much has to go out your mouth.
