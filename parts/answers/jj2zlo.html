		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an interesting question and all the replies so far are slightly missing the point. The fact that these names appear very quickly across all the US and to a lesser extent UK and Canada implies there must be some common inspiration or celebrity or fictional character that people heard and used. Maybe it was just organic word of mouth but it seems very quick for that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m no expert but I read an article about this recently: <a href="https://theconversation.com/a-brief-history-of-black-names-from-perlie-to-latasha-130102" target="_blank">https://theconversation.com/a-brief-history-of-black-names-from-perlie-to-latasha-130102</a></p>
<p>The gist of it is that there have always been distinctly “black” names in the US and the names do t necessarily have a distinct old world cultural tie to, say, Africa.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That picture though was a was a bit misleading. Kamala Harris’ name is from her Indian-American heritage, not from her African-American heritage. It’s a commonly used, even if a bit old fashioned, name in India.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some thoughts that might make looking for information more straightforward:</p>
<p>1)Are those names a remnant of the slave names or are they a counterpoint against them; were they used mostly after the abolishion or also before?</p>
<p>2)Who named the salves and what were common names? Were they completely different?</p>
<p>3)The names often sound French-ish. Is there a connection to french-english rivalry (e.g. They chose names in a sense of rebellion again the English &quot;masters&quot;) </p>
<p>Also owners might have wanted to differentiate between their employees/friends/family and the slaves they owned which would easy be accomplished by a different naming convention </p>
<p>Also: It's possible French sounding names sound exotic and noble, which then would go back to the point of &quot;giving the kids powerful names&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
