		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very unlikely. This is a respiratory virus, and the levels of viremia are much too low for any arthropod vector (mosquitoes, biting flies, gnats, etc) to ingest enough to carry an infection mechanically or biologically. More to the point, none of the coronaviruses that I'm familiar with have insects as biologic vectors (meaning the viruses are not capable of replicating in insect cells).</p>
<p>Closest you'd come is if someone coughed heavily on a mosquito and then you snorted that mosquito up your nose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Extremelly, extremelly unlikely. For the same reason mosquitoes do not spread HIV. The vast majority of mosquito borne diseases are not transmitted by the mosquito injecting infected blood from one person to another, the viruses actually have to infect the mosquitoes. That's why dengue, zika, chikungunya tests in mosquitoes most of the times target the salivary glands of the mosquitoes (yes), because that's where those viruses replicate in the mosquitoes. Mosquitoes then inoculate anti-coagulant substances when feeding, and those anti-coagulant substances are present on mosquitoes saliva, only then are the viruses inoculated in a new host. Thus, as HIV, if coronavirus does not infect the mosquito and does not migrate to it's salivary gland, the they very, very likely do not spread COVID.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites.</p>
<p>To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>short answer is no. mosquito-borne viruses are of a different family of viruses altogether and they have evolved over history to efficiently replicate in both mosquitos and mammals as part of their life cycle. In general, even when a new virus gets discovered, you already know a good amount about it based on its viral family. For example Zika, Dengue, West Nile, Yellow Fever, all are mosquito borne viruses and they share a high % of physical similarities. You could guess that Zika was a mosquito-borne virus just by looking at it. SARS-CoV-2 (covid-19) is very similar to SARS-CoV-1 and indeed it has the same routes of transmission, symptoms, etc (with some variation of course in severity, etc.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
