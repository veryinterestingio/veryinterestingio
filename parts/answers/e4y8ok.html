		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Poor explanations so far so here goes.</p>
<p>ELI18:</p>
<p>There's Non-Volatile storage (A hard drive for example) and Volatile storage.</p>
<p>Non volatile storage is able to persistently store data by hard-writing it to for example a block in flash memory.</p>
<p>Volatile storage works more directly with electricity. Each bit has a capacitor, this is what makes up the data in RAM. These capacitors &quot;leak&quot; very very fast, and so when they lose power they will immediately leak until empty, where data is lost.</p>
<p>Programs use RAM to store data that may be used frequently, because using RAM is much faster than pulling from the hard drive. </p>
<p>Programs aren't perfect, and frequently make errors. It might store data it thinks it hasn't stored but it has,  creating memory leaks meaning things slow down because there's less memory.</p>
<p>Restarting the machine clears the RAM, and as such clears the errors the program has caused.</p>
<p>ELI5:</p>
<p>You have a sink. You wash the dishes every now and then.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a bit of food comes off and goes into the food filter at the plug hole, but the water still drains so it's okay.</p>
<p>Eventually there's too much food in the filter and the water is taking too long to drain. You pull out the filter and clean it, and the water now works fine.</p>
<p>The sink is your PC. The tap is a program. The water is data. The filter is memory. The food is programs making errors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If something isn't working right, it's likely that this is because the software got into a state it shouldn't be in.</p>
<p>If you turn it off and on again, you might reset it to a known state, namely the one that it's in when it's turned on.</p>
<p>Some problems aren't solved by this... If you managed to store into persistent storage that the software should go into a weird state at startup, then you'll have to do something else, like a factory reset.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's start with an analogy. I'm going over to my friend's house, but I don't know where he lives. My friend gives me directions, but he's not very good at giving directions and he doesn't really know the names of streets very well. So I'm supposed to &quot;go north on that one main road&quot; and then &quot;turn right at that big funny tree&quot;, &quot;go down about 3 or 4 stop signs&quot; and finally my friend lives &quot;2 doors down from the brown house&quot;. I hop in my car, do my best and...get lost. At this point, I could call my friend and try to get directions from wherever I am now (and I don't know where that is, exactly) or I could go back the way I came, go back to my house, and start over.</p>
<p>power-off is a known state for electronics, where RAM is cleared and the processor is not doing anything. The boot-up process is pretty well defined as well, with specific tasks happening in specific order. After that, things aren't well-defined. The system needs to respond to inputs which come at seemingly random times in seemingly random order. As these inputs are handled the system, assuming it's not perfectly designed, may start to become more and more disordered. Eventually, bugs start being triggered (there are, on average, between 15-50 bugs per 1000 lines of code depending on developer skill, and while many of these may be very minor, when you run long enough you're bound to trip over some of them).</p>
<p>Powering off and on again clears memory, removes the built-up disorder, and moves into a well-defined boot-up process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason most tech problems are solved by turning things off and on is that it stop everything happening and gives the &quot;tech&quot; a fresh start.</p>
<p>Basically most issues are caused by tasks trying to get through a doorway an one task is standing in the doorway, yes tasks can still squeeze through but untill the problem tasks moves issues will occur. Rebooting removes both the task in the way and all the tasks waiting to go through.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's usually state conflicts which are a result of bad programming. </p>
<p>For example, let's say that a device that can be connected to a computer and has a battery, like a camera, wireless mouse or a cellphone has these two states, &quot;connected&quot; and &quot;charging&quot;, each of which can be either true or false:</p>
<p>Let's make a table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: left;">deviceIsConnected</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">deviceIsCharging</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Makes sense</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">true</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">true</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Battery is full</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">true</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">false</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Doesn't make sense</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">false</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">true</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Makes sense</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">false</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">false</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now let's imagine that for some reason the device managed to get into a state where it thinks it's charging but not connected, which isn't possible. Maybe the user was fiddling with the cable, or there was some weird issue in the device's programming or in the hardware.</p>
<p>The programmer hasn't thought that this situation might ever occur so the program doesn't know where to go from here and it's basically broken.</p>
<p>A surefire way to fix it is to start from scratch by turning it off and on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
