		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the answer is, &quot;<a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190313-will-mosquitoes-bite-me-more-when-ive-been-drinking" target="_blank">we don't know</a>,&quot; but it seems that mosquitoes are more attracted to drunk people, than sober people, and according to the article I linked fruit flies do get drunk, but have a high tolerance. </p>

You could drink a nearly infinite amount of 0.2% alcohol solution without becoming intoxicated yourself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
