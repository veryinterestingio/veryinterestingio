		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To create a perfume you need to be able to extract or create a scent, create a medium to carry that scent, a method to apply that scent and to make sure it doesn't immediately dissipate.</p>
<p>Scents are usually essential oils. You can obtain or create essential oils from natural sources through methods like pressing, crushing, dissolving, distillation and so on. If you know exactly what chemicals create a scent, you can also create synthetic scents in a lab. In other words, you can quite literally take something like a pleasant flower and crush, dissolve, boil or otherwise extract the oils that carry its scent.</p>
<p>Essential oils are pretty powerful so you dilute them into a medium that will allow the user to spray or dab some onto their skin and make it stick. Usually alcohol. Alcohols evaporate fast so dabbing some on your skin won't leave a wet spot as the alcohol evaporates but leaves the scented oil.</p>
<p>As for what makes a male or female perfume, that's really just psychology, stereotypes and a whole lot of marketing.</p>
<p>Things like flowers, candy, cookies and other sweet things are often associated with women. And so their scents make a good basis for feminine products.</p>
<p>Men are often idealised as tough, rugged, hard-working, adventurous and so on. Lots of male scents try to invoke that with scents that are reminiscent of the ocean, mountains, woods. Sharp scents, spicy scents and so on.</p>
<p>If you look at perfume commercials you'll notice that advertising rarely describes the scent itself. They usually try to sell you an idealised image. Do you like this rugged man sailing his ship? Are you enticed by this cosmopolitan woman in her perfect gown? Now you can smell like them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, there is basically nothing scientific for the assignment of a perfume to a gender. As for the chemistry :</p>
<p>Alcohol (we usually mean ethanol by that) is an excellent solvent for many things that are similar to alcohol and is therefore very useful for organic chemistry (chemistry of C-H binds). Many compounds that we recognize as characteristic smells are very similar to alcohol (esters). </p>
<p>So by immersing animal materials, flower petals and other good smelling things in a bath of alcohol, we often can leech out these compounds because the compounds want to be in both the alcohol and the material until they are roughly equally in both. We call this process extraction. </p>
<p>Making coffee is another form of extraction. Making decoffinated coffee beans is much fancier but follows very similar principles that I outlined here. Alike seeks alike in chemistry: we call the preference of one material to interact with another selectivity. </p>
<p>Different compounds might need other solvents or other processes though. Extraction is useful because it provides very mild conditions for volatile materials like the good smelling stuff you want to extract. </p>
<p>Keywords for further research: extraction, esters, ethanol, diffusion</p>
<p>I am really hitting the limit of what is possible with an ELI5 level explanation here. This is extremely broad strokes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no chemistry behind deciding if a perfume is for men or women. It is entirely artificial. </p>
<p>Like basically everything that's divided in men/women and isn't used with your genitals. And even then it doesn't automatically follow that penis=man and vagina=woman, but that is an entirely different discussion.</p>
<p>As for authentic perfume crafting: I'm not sure about that. I know that in classical times they soaked rose leaves in water or alcohol to extract the perfume. And especially the alcohol works well with lots of other well smelling plants (like lavender, or rosemary, etc). But that is not the same as how it is done currently as that is a very expensive and labour intensive process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
