<li>The New York Times now maintains <em>eighteen</em> different best seller lists, and there are even separate lists for hardcover releases (more popular, more publisher investment) and paperback releases (less popular books still get on a list, and only have to compete with other less popular books).</li>
<li>In order to use the mark &quot;New York Times Bestseller&quot;, a book only has to exist on a list once, at any position, at any time. Getting on the list is more about marketing for a single spike in book purchases all at once than about sales in aggregate.</li>
<li>Your book must be released in the US to qualify for the list, so English books published in other nations are excluded. If you purchase books in the US they are more likely to be from a NYT list.</li>
<li>If a book is on a New York Times bestselling list, it is probably heavily marketed to you both before and after this accomplishment, meaning you are much more likely to pick that book than a random book.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An additional note since we're discussing book sales...E-books can't qualify for any NYT lists because most of them are self published by individual &quot;indie&quot; authors and the &quot;Big 5&quot; publishing houses have shut any and all mention of those books from public view. E- books have a HUGE market share that no one talks about because the only ones who know how much they're making (ie; retailers) won't talk about it. </p>
<p>Interesting tidbit- Romance novels in general make more money each year than every other genre of book, combined. Their profits are in the billions. (I'm a romance novel author ;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Having so many categories and such lax rules about length of time on the list, etc. makes it easier for the NYT to market their brand on millions of copies of books every year. Also makes some of us much more likely to have read a shit book at one time or another thinking it had to be great because it was on the list.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
