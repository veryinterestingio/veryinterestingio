		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because as example the US customs does not have access to the &quot;British citizen passport database&quot;. The data on the passport is the same as the written one, including error correction keys and nowadays some biological data as well (such as fingerprint). It also depend on the issuing country and how old your passport is.</p>
<p>All they can do is check that it's correct and matches you as a person. And cross reference with their own data of persons denied entry etc.</p>
<p>TL;DR; there is no secret world wide database with everyone's information for them to connect to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two kinds of machin-readable data in passports -- first is MRZ, that thing on the bottom of the front page in block letters starting with P. It's basically just a copy of all the standard information -- name, last name, nationality, birth date, issue date, expiry date and document number. This data allows to check person's identity through various black and red lists -- like interpol, restrictions on entry/exit or whatever. Lists that the country you are entering or leaving keeps. You could print whatever shit you want there. In the year 2020 EU still doesn't have a database of entry-exit events to automatically catch overstayers who break 90/180 rule</p>
<p>Then there is the chip. It's usually called &quot;biometric passport&quot; with that rectangular symbol on it, but having biometric info, like fingerprints, iris scan or high-res digital photo is not the main point of it. Nobody really checks fingerprints against the passport on every-entry exit and photos are reaaly subjective to check against. The main point of biometric passport is the fact, that very same data that is printed in block letters is also included inside (with the photo) and <em>signed</em> digitally. So having access to the country's public key, you can be sure that information in there in authentic. That needs an explaination of assymetryc cryptography and public key infrastructure, which I won't give here.</p>
<p>The problem however -- such information, while not being fakable still can copied, so there could be two (or hundred) people having <em>same</em> passport in different places. Or it could be stolen, which works too. They should look similar enough, but that's workable around. Or you could fry the chip in microwave or stupidly sign the data with wrong key and officer would likely shrug it over, because whatever -- this dumbfuckistan can't issue a passport properly. A fucking shiiit-hole, sir.</p>
<p>Another issue with fake passports -- they are not necessary fake, but sometimes are just fraudlent. As in real, but with fake data -- somebody bribed or tricked authorities into issuing one by impersonating something else or inventing persona, using fake birth certificate (fun fact -- you could use birth certificate issued in one country to get identity documents and citizenship rights in another and same problem with cross-check applies. then don't have chips or photo too). Sometimes the state issues them to their own special services on purpose. Sometimes blank is &quot;lost&quot; or deemed defective but then sold on black market. Some countries have black-lists of revoked and stolen passports published, but nobody checks against them on the other side of the world anyway.</p>
<p>There is no global database of passports or any kind of cross-checks between countries. Not all countries even issue biometric passports and not all of the countries routinely verify them properly.</p>
<p>Obviously, when somebody is closely investigated or randomly caught up, there is more time to dig and check whether the documents are authentic, including asking the embassy of issuing country, but on routine border checks or plane boarding, it's often up to &quot;this looks legit&quot; kind of check. There is also more time when passport is submitted to the embassy for a visa. And you can't really expect underpaid border agent to know what real passports issued in the last 10 years by all of the 200 countries in this world look and feel like.</p>
<p>In places other then border crossing -- every officially-looking piece of plastic shit would get your through ninety-nine percent of the time.</p>
<p>All of this is also why one sometimes needs a visa. Every country trusts it's own system better then other countries systems. This is also why one sometimes doesn't need a visa -- level of trust into document issuing process is high enough and passport itself is as good enough as visa.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what everyone else has said, there is virtually no likelihood of a worldwide checkable database ever. For instance, there are countries that, if you have a record of visiting them, lots of other countries won't let you in, due to political discord between them. (I believe Israel is an example). Well, those countries can't afford to stop having visitors, so they don't stamp your passport, they give you a separate entry approval paper on the way in that you have to keep and show on the way out, and then you can &quot;lose&quot; it. So they are not going to leave a trail of accessing passport data for visitors. Most countries in the world are not really &quot;friends,&quot; even ones that let each others' citizens in, that's more strategic alignment of interests than friendship. They don't trust each other enough for access to each others' citizens' data on a mass scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing I see missing from the explanations here is the concept of a &quot;checksum&quot;. Many forms of ID / important numbers (including your credit card numbers) use part of the number as a way to validate the rest of the number, which contains the actual information.</p>
<p>For example, take a hypothetical shortened credit card number of 1637 2827. One simple way to use a checksum would be to say &quot;add the first 7 digits together. The ones-digit of the result should be the 8th number&quot;. The first 7 digits of this example add up to 27, and the 8th digit is 9. 7 is not equal to 9, so we know this card number is invalid. But 1637 2627 would be a valid number, as would 1637 2829.</p>
<p>This is a very efficient way to validate a number, if you know the rules the number should follow, and it doesn't require any connection to the internet or a database. The rules are much more complicated than the above example, to make it hard for just anyone to create new valid numbers, but if you know the rules you could do it.</p>
<p>So clever people can create fake passports and other IDs that scan like the real deal, even if they're fake, but it's hard enough that not just anyone could do it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reliability of any system lies in it's weakest link.<br />
Introduce a vulnerability or voluntarily allow an exception and now you have a very flawed system. </p>
<p>Example : if there is a way for special agents / spies to get fake IDs, then the very same process could be used by other people in other circustamces.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
