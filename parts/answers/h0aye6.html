They will get dimmer and more spread out as they reach their final higher orbit.</p>
<p>They are somewhat controversial right now, because they have been interfering with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21190273/spacex-starlink-satellite-internet-constellation-astronomy-coating" target="_blank">certain types of astronomical observations</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>They are internet sattellites that should provide low latency satellite internet to North America within about a year and the whole world not long after</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>SpaceX is launching a new “string of pearls” every two weeks right now for new satellite internet service. While they’re moving into their normal orbits, they are quite bright. Once they reach a parking orbit, they align vertically and aren’t very visible anymore. </p>
<p>There’s going to be tens of thousands of them in the very near future.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
