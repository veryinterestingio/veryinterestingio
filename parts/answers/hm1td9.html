		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Firstly, because it's not just about cleanliness it's also about oxygen content. Natural bodies of water will absorb oxygen from the atmosphere, but a small fish tank, without some kind of filtration system, will end up depleted of oxygen.</p>
<p>Secondly, it's a specific kind of &quot;impurity&quot; in your fish tank that hurts the fish. Their water is filling up with their own feces. If any natural body of water were as full of feces as an unfiltered fish tank, those fish would be sick and dying too. Other kinds of impurities are more tolerable for the fish, not harming their health even though they wouldn't be good water for you as a human to drink.</p>
<p>Also though, natural bodies of water that become heavily polluted will eventually see the fish and other wildlife in them die. Even parts of the ocean can become so polluted that they are &quot;dead zones&quot; where few if any organisms live.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because its not perfectly clean water.</p>
<p>A properly set up aquarium will have a living, biological filter, that converts the chemicals in fish poop, uneaten food, and decaying plant material, into harmless nitrate.  Well, relatively harmless.  It does build up overtime, and this is why you have to do water changes every week.</p>
<p>This &quot;biological filter&quot; is not the same thing as the physical filter on the back of the aquarium, but rather the community of beneficial bacteria that lives on every surface in the tank.  Although, the bacteria are concentrated in that mechanical filter, because it has a lot of surface area.</p>
<p>A healthy aquarium will have a microcosm of tiny life, all living in symbiotic happiness, much like the natural bodies of water in nature.  Keeping a fish in fresh, filtered water is not good for the fish.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll add to what others have said: a who maintained fish tank is not perfectly clean filtered water. Ideally you should set up a tank and let it run without fish for a bit, and then only change the water in fractions. It'll be colonized by bacteria and otherwise have an ecosystem of its own.</p>
<p>The filter is just a replacement for certain natural processes, like water movement, plants filtering out some contaminants, etc. But it's not making the water 'filtered' in the same sense that, say, bottled water is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So many factors are present in a natural environment that being muddy or not clear will outwin a super clear HD aquarium water like </p>
<ol>
<li>Plants</li>
<li>Oxygen content</li>
<li>Beneficial Bacteria (important for fish poop to change form for nitrogen cycle ) </li>
<li>Space</li>
<li>Water Parameter</li>
</ol>
<p>So many factors are present like water temp I may have missed and there is also instances of Fish dying on natural environment but mosly due to climate change and low oxygen content</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fishes poop, and poop becomes toxic when bacterias eat it, in an open ocean or river or lake that would be fine since it get diluted, however in a close tank you have to constently refill the tanks because otherwise the toxicity will rise enough to kill the fish.</p>
<p>Hopefully that explains it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
