The main purpose was to assist the climate control system  and keeping the car cool when parked.  I think they estimated it only added a few miles <em>per week</em>  to the car's range.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was on a R &amp; D design team for Fisker 10 years ago. We researched all sorts of ideas on how to generate power from solar power collecting paint, regenerative breaking, turning heat into electricity....(I actually wrote a book on it!)....it actually takes a lot to make and store power. So the best thing we found was how to be more efficient (aerodynamics, better tires, better bearings, smarter motors, new battery technology....)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Solar power just isn't efficient enough (yet?) to justify the cost.  Add to it the cost of replacement/repair, and adding hundreds of dollars to the cost in order to maybe someday getting a return on that investment doesn't make sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
