		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Snoring is due to the fact that your mouth muscles are not tightened and that you usually have your head tilted back (or at least horizontally with your nose pointing to the celling). Basically, your palate loosen and your to<del>u</del>ngue roll back a bit thus kind of blocking the airway, but not totally which is why it makes so much noise.</p>
<p>Now, when you are awake, your mouth muscles are more tightened so you are not blocking your own airway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically; Muscles relax when you're relaxed.</p>
<p>It's another reason why people snore even more when they're drunk. It's a depressant and relaxes muscles even further when asleep.</p>
<p>There is a little flappy thing in your throat that is the main cause of it. While awake and alert, it's used to help with vocal inflection, eating and drinking. </p>
<p>While asleep, it's main purpose is to annoy romantic partners.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that men tend to have thicker necks with more fat on them which adds pressure to the area and causes men to snore much more often than women.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Snoring is usually caused by some sort of obstruction in the upper part of your airway. During sleep, your muscles start to become relaxed and they may collapse a little to block your airway which results in snoring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
