		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I want to add to some of these answers as a gas phase chemist: </p>
<p>The composition of the atmosphere at each level is different in the evening vs. the morning. The sun having been out all day drives a ton of complex chemical reactions in the atmosphere - so by the time the sun sets, there's an entirely different mixture of chemicals in the air than when it comes up.</p>
<p>That's not the whole story but it does cause some of the differences.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that one is constantly getting brighter and the other is constantly growing dimmer/softer. It’s subtle but it’s there and is noticeable (hence the reason we watch in the first place). This is in addition to what is mentioned about particles and humidity. That’s also why it’s harder to tell the difference in photos as opposed to experiencing it in real life or seeing it on film.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One difference is that a lot of smog and water vapor builds up in the sky during the day, between car exhaust, other pollution, water evaporating from day's sun and heat... the refraction of light off all these particles in the sky is what causes the vibrant colors. The cooler air and lack of modern activity during the night means less of that stuff in the sky at sunrise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's <a href="https://www.livescience.com/34065-sunrise-sunset.html" target="_blank">an article on that exact subject</a>.</p>
<p>The key excerpt is the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All &quot;twilight phenomena&quot; are symmetric on opposite sides of midnight, and occur in reverse order between sunset and sunrise, the authors note in &quot;Color and Light in Nature&quot; (Cambridge University Press, 2001). That means there's no inherent, natural cause of a major optical difference between them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, in the absence of other factors (increased pollution through the day, etc) there is no real natural difference, but there may be a difference is in the observer's awareness of the time of day and your body's physiological response as well.  For example, your eyes may be more sensitive in the morning due to being dark adapted, so your perception may be a bit different than it is in the evening.</p>
<p>The one thing that <em>is</em> different between sunrise and sunset is the angle at which the sun leaves/approaches the horizon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the astrophysicist Neil Degrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York, there's also a trick for distinguishing a sunrise from a sunset played in reverse. Because of Earth's tilt, the sun doesn't rise or set along a vertical line, but at an angle. &quot;When viewed from all latitudes north of the Tropic of Cancer (23.5 degrees north latitude), the sun always rises at an angle up and to the right, and sets and an angle down and to the right,&quot; Tyson writes on his website. &quot;That's how you can spot a faked sunrise in a movie: it moves up and to the left. Filmmakers are not typically awake in the morning hours to film an actual sunrise, so they film a sunset instead, and then time-reverse it, thinking nobody will notice.&quot;</p>
