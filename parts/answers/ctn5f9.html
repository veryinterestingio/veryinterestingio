		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add, many bookies would have 'runners' who were young lads who would be sent to collect or drop off winnings. Kids were better at avoiding the police (or even outrunning them) which allowed for backstreet bookies to operate as mini businesses with 'employees'. Neighbourhoods tended to be a lot more closely knit so people would pay up, because it wasn't worth the social repercussions of not doing so.</p>
<p>We live in a society where we pay up front and most of our interactions are relatively anonymous, but in the past communities really did know each other a lot better and had more social lives. For example, we have cars and go to the supermarket weekly now and put our food in the fridge, whereas in the past we would walk to the local shop daily to buy food for that evening. It wouldn't be uncommon to buy products at the shop 'on tick' and you would be trusted to do so - afterall, you would be reliant on this neighbourhood shop to survive. Bookies worked on this same neighbourhood system.</p>
