		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally, as people get older they become less active and eat the same amount of calories or more and therefore gain weight. Men tend to gain more weight around the stomach than other areas as opposed to women who tend to put on more weight on their legs etc.</p>
<p>While, there is some decrease in metabolism with age, its fairly small. The main culprit is lack of activity compared to youth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stress hasn't been mentioned here yet that I have seen.  As life gets more stressful, and believe me it f***ing does, you release more junk (I think it is cortisol) that retains more fat. Men tend to put it on their bellies.  Some men accumulate fluid in their abdomen, and some drink too much alcohol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They eat more kcal than they needed per day. And its not a decline of exercise, its <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/2u8m7b6sp1lqzn3/5762476.jpg" target="_blank">a recent trend</a> since pre-1990 men would still have 'slowed down' with age.</p>
<p>Acceptable portion sizes increased as well as regular snacks. They measured the activity levels and kcal expenditure using doubly labelled water(insanely accurate) of the Hadza, a tribe of modern hunter-gathers that have a rough lifestyle in order to secure food. Comparing with city dwelling desk drivers, the difference in overall expenditure was minimal.</p>
