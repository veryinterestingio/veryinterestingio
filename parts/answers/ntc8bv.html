		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you get a phone call and a number shows up on your caller ID, that's not always because your phone knows which number is calling it. The phone that's calling you can send the call <em>and</em> tell your phone what number to show, plus maybe a name as well. Scammers use a VoIP phone and can just alter the data that their phone sends to your phone, your phone doesn't know any better and just shows what ever the other phone tells it to show.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called spoofing, and it actually exists for legitimate reasons. For example, a business with many individual phone lines may want them all to show up the same on caller ID so that customers call the correct number back. Or a person may want calls from their cell phone to appear to come from their office phone. Unfortunately now we're dealing with people misusing this system.</p>
<p>It used to be somewhat complicated to spoof a phone number but these days it's trivially easy. That's because a lot of phone traffic isn't actually done over traditional phone networks, it's done over the internet using a protocol called voice over IP (VoIP), in which case all you have to do is send deliberately incorrect caller ID data.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Phone guy here.  Depending on the carrier, I can send whatever the hell I want over as the caller ID.  I can legit send 123 to your phone.  Now you have to sign all sorts of legal docs saying you won't do anything untoward... But when has that ever stopped anyone.</p>
<p>It's just a field in the PBX (phone system) and we can put whatever we want in there.  It's normally used to send the main number of the facility or department, but nothing stops me from sending complete bogus junk.</p>
<p>Also, VoIP has nothing to do with it.  It may make cheating easier, but I can send absolute trash over a standard PRI (old fashioned telephone service on a T1) with the right settings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
