		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A fungal example of this would be Aspergillus flavus. It’s best known for contaminating maize and peanut fields. Normally it’s already a bad time because it produces aflatoxin, the most carcinogenic naturally occurring compound as far as I remember, but it can also infect your lungs if you are immunocompromised.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Zygomycosis, In particular infection from black bread mold (Rhizopus spp.) is a opportunistic infection that can occur in immunocompromised humans. This is the mold you see on berry type fruits and bread obviously. Route of infection seems to be inhalation of the spores when you go to smell if the food went bad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
