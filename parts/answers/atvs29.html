		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No ion can directly pass through the cellular membrane. However, there are channels that are <em>usually</em> open that allow ions, such as potassium to pass. These are appropriately called leak channels. They are not voltage gated, so if you looked at their IV curves it’s essentially an ohmic (straight line) relationship. When people say the resting membrane potential is set by potassium, it’s because the membrane is more permeable to potassium. Or in another way, there are more channels that allow potassium to leak out of the cell, reduce the net positive charge of the cell, and drive the membrane potential towards the reversal potential of potassium.  </p>
<p>When you think of channels, a smaller ion does not always mean it will pass through if a larger ion can. There are selectivity filters that can make each channel specific to certain ions. These selectivity filters depend on interactions between the amino acids in the pore and the ions as they pass through, and/or if it’s electrically favorable to strip its hydration shell momentarily to allow passage. It’s pretty complicated actually. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The ion causes a conformational change it a the potassium channel that allows it to exit on the other side of the membrane. Think of it like a subway turnstile that is only unlocked when the right size object enters. Sodium ions can get into the opening, but they aren’t the right size to cause the conformational change, so they can’t get through</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like a lot of answers here don’t go into detail enough, so I’ll give it a try. Please do correct/add to anything I say.</p>
<p>Membrane bilayers don’t conduct ions very well inherently. This is due to the hydrophobic layer in the middle composed by the hydrophobic fatty acid tails, which makes it unfavourable for charged ions to enter. The reason it’s unfavourable is due to the tails not forming any charge-charge interactions with the ions (think +ve and -ve attraction, the alkane/alkene groups aren’t able to form these). This means that K+ and Na+ cross the membrane very slowly.</p>
<p>To increase the speed of conduction across the membrane, there exist ion channels.  These of course have the issue of specificity - you only want certain ions to be conducted at certain times, you can’t just have a hole in the membrane. In the case of action potentials, you specifically want to first conduct Na+ out of the cell down the concentration gradient, and K + into the cell immediately afterwards, also down the concentration gradient.</p>
<p>One thing to differentiate is obviously the positive charge. Amino acids like glutamate and aspartate have negative charge to interact with the cations. This means that the presence of these amino acid residue in the lumen of the channel will discriminate against negatively charged ions like Cl-</p>
<p>Then there is of course size. It is relatively easy to differentiate between, say, Ca2+ and Na+ - have a narrower lumen for Na+</p>
<p>Here comes your question - how do you differentiate between K+, a larger ion, and an Na+, a smaller ion that will surely fit into a larger hole required for K+?</p>
<p>At this point you differentiate by the difference in energy of hydration. Each ion will use a certain number of water molecules to solvate itself that will form a somewhat-ordered shell. These shells contain different number of water molecules depending on the size and charge of the ion. </p>
<p>Ion channels use this. They have a narrow enough channel that the solvated ion will not fit - the solvation shell needs to be shed first. To be energetically favourable, the channel needs to fully compensate for the energy of solvation, which is done by ordered negative static charges at the narrowest region of the channel. Let’s take a K+ channel, for which the model protein is Kcsa. At the narrowest part, the protein has a concerned TVGYG sequence. This sequence is flexible due to the Glycine residues, which allows carbonyl oxygens to orient themselves towards the lumen. These carbonyl oxygens, which have a negative dipole, are oriented perfectly to interact with the incoming K+, compensating for the energy of solvation. In the case of Na+, a smaller ion, these carbonyl oxygens are too far apart to all interact simultaneously with the incoming ion, so Na+ conduction is unfavourable.</p>
<p>Hence you have a channel that differentiates between different idols and allows only K+ through. This is done by charge differentiation, size occlusion, and difference in water solvation.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A very interesting and important question. Considering that Na has a smaller atomic radius than K, why can't a Na+ ion pass through a K+ channel pore? The reason that the Na+ ion does not pass through a K+ channel pore has to do with water molecules that are associated with the Na+ ion.  Essentially, because Na is smaller, more water molecules form weak bonds around it than around a K+ ion. So when the Na+ flows down a channel, it has a larger H2O baggage around it than K+. Because of this it does not fit through a K+ channel pore. In solution, Na+ and the H2O around it is slightly larger than the K+ particle with H2O around it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
