For dark matter to be sitting in a clump at the center of a plaent or a star not only would it need to fall in, but it would then have to slow down.</p>
<p>Gravity is nearly perfectly restorative, meaning that all the gravitational potential energy is converted to kinetic energy.  This means the dark matter would fall straight through the planet, never interacting, then pass out the other side.  </p>
<p>The dark matter, being unable to interact via em or the strong force has no way to get rid of this kinetic energy, so never slows down enough to remain bound to any system smaller than a galaxy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, sort of.</p>
<p>Dark matter should indeed tend to be a little denser at massive bodies such as stars.  However, it would only be <em>very, very</em> slightly denser because it interacts so weakly with regular matter (and with itself), there is no possibility for &quot;accretion&quot; because nothing will slow it down when it reaches the center of a massive body.  If it comes in towards a massive body with almost any momentum at all, it will pass right through the body and then leave the body with roughly the same momentum.  It will do this over and over again, with its kinetic energy being exchanged for gravitational potential energy and then vice versa again, with nothing to damp these oscillations and no way to permanently lose that kinetic energy because there is no &quot;friction&quot; to slow it down and keep it there near the center of the star.  Ordinary matter only accretes into stars because it interacts electromagnetically, so it all &quot;bumps into&quot; itself at a star, slowing it down, converting the kinetic energy into thermal energy.</p>
<p>So, only the very slowest of dark matter particles should accumulate inside stars and other massive bodies.  And perhaps, if dark matter does interact very, very rarely and weakly, there <em>might</em> be a very slight friction helping dark matter to accrete a little bit.  But it can only be a very small amount.  We're talking like, the density of dark matter within a star would only be on the order of 1% denser than its density in interstellar space.  Not enough to make any significant difference on the scale of solar system dynamics.  It is only relevant for galaxies and larger structures like galaxy groups.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We tend to think it's more like galaxies and galactic clusters form along dark matter lines. And dark matter does interact with normal matter. It interacts gravitationally.</p>
<p>We still have absolutely no idea what dark matter is. At the time, we absolutely know that it's there. It's akin to seeing leaves blowing in the wind, but not yet understanding what molecules are or what air is made of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know why no one else has brought up the fact that, depending on the particle, this is entirely possible and has been explored theoretically, including by at least one person I know personally.</p>
<p>Yes dark matter doesn't interact electromagnetically, however direct collisions with the nucleus of an atom can occur so long as the candidate particle interacts via the weak force. This is the basis of many dark matter detectors, collisions with atomic nuclei release energy as a photon and this can be detected if you're particularly clever (and guess the correct particle mass).  Admittedly, the only claimed detections of such particles that I know of were from the DAMA NaI detectors at LNGS and these are highly controversial.</p>
<p>I did some theoretical work for a similar project called SABRE, and as part of it attended a workshop in which this exact possibility was discussed with regards to the sun. I can't recall how it worked, this was several years ago now, but there was the possibility of using this to detect dark matter. It should be noted that even with high densities, due to the vast space between nuclei, these collisions are very rare, and the accretion is going to be slow. For something like the sun, we have relative velocities ranging from ~200-700m/s iirc so it's going to take a fair bit to slow down a particle enough to become trapped within a body like the sun.</p>
<p>It's very early in the morning down under, but when I hear back from my friend who worked on this I'll update this post.</p>
<p>Edit: friend got back to me, for 10GeV WIMPs capture rate is on the order of 1.8 tons per second from hydrogen, and around 6 tons per second from collisions with helium. Though I'd take those numbers with a grain of salt, they're very rough.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11674" target="_blank">Here</a> is a paper which examined this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'mma ask what's probably a dumb question...</p>
<p>So gravity is functionally the deformation or space-time, and there are lots of demonstrations of the effect using 2D planes and weights.</p>
<p>Wouldn't that scale to us being 3D objects in 4+D space and dark matter might be an external deformation in space-time and not strictly in our 3D plane?</p>
<p>It reminds me of non-miscible fluids where it reaches a stable layer and spreads, which would probably look both like dark matter in how it pools and with the continuing expansion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
