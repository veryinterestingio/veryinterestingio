		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Servers are like  playgrounds.  And even though other people come and do sports or have races and make the playground fun, when you have so many people using the playground, someone has to do some upkeep.  The jungle gym needs to be replaced.  The grass needs to be mowed.  The nets need replacing on the basketball court.  So, because everybody is having fun on the playground, there really isn't one kid responsible for fixing these things.  So, there's a groundskeeper who keeps the playground fun and safe for everybody.  And occasionally, that groundskeeper asks for a little bit of money to help pay for his time and the money he spent on the new equipment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Wikimedia Foundation runs Wikipedia, so that's who would get donations.  According to the 2017-8 financial report from [1], the Foundation had operating expenses of about 81.5 million dollars.  Here's some interesting points from the document:</p>
<p><strong>Salaries and wages -</strong> <em>38.5 million dollars; \~47%</em>: this is where most of the money goes.  According to [2], the Foundation employs about 280 people.  People cost a lot, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Grants -</strong> <em>13.5 million dollars; \~17%</em>: Did you know the Foundation actually gives grants [3]?  Grants cost money.  This is the second-highest expense category.</p>
<p><strong>Internet hosting -</strong> <em>2.3 million dollars; \~3%</em>; I'm guessing this is the cost of running servers.</p>
<p><strong>Donation processing expenses -</strong> <em>4.5 million dollars; \~6%</em>: This costs more than internet hosting!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>“Where your donation goes</p>
<p>Technology: Servers, bandwidth, maintenance, development. Wikipedia is one of the top 10 websites in the world, and it runs on a fraction of what other top websites spend.</p>
<p>People and Projects: The other top websites have thousands of employees. We have about 300 staff to support a wide variety of projects, making your donation a great investment in a highly-efficient not-for-profit organization.”</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People here keep saying it's the hosting, but that's only a small piece of the spending.</p>
<p>Other spending might make some improvements (research projects, etc), but is ultimately unnecessary to keep the site online. The ads are somewhat deceptive by making it seem like they're barely hanging on by a thread.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a dumbed down version but.. Do you live somewhere? you probably pay rent or a mortgage, well a server is a space for a website. All websites need a server. A website as big and as busy as wikipedia needs many servers and very fast servers.  Servers are computers. That is where your money is going.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
