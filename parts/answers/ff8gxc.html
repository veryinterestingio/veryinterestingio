		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, when you're dealing with gases, you have to understand that, in order to expand, a gas must heat up.</p>
<p>When you use compressed air duster, there's more room in the can that the gas then has to occupy. In order to do that, it has to absorb heat from its surroundings; in this case, the can, which we sense as the can cooling down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you compress a gas, the thermal energy contained in that gas is condensed into a smaller area. This raises the average energy in the gas in relation to volume, and thus the temperature. </p>
<p>When you let that gas cool down, and then release the pressure, the energy is then dispersed into the new larger volume, lowering the temperature. </p>
<p>This is how refrigerators and air conditioning work</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The can doesn't contain compressed air, it contains a liquid propellant (frequently difluoroethane) and its vapour under pressure. If the can was full of liquid air it would be covered in frozen water from the air around you and freeze your hands when you pick it up.</p>
<p>When you use the can, vapour that is sprayed out is replaced in the can by liquid propellant turning into vapour. To make that <em>phase change</em> from liquid to vapour, each molecule of propellant has to take a little energy from the environment (its 'latent heat of vapourisation'). When you're holding the can, you are the environment; so you feel your heat transferring to the can as 'cold'.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you press the nozzle the compressed air inside the can is released. The compressed air starts as a liquid which has evaporated very quickly and the off gas that’s produce exits the can in the form of air. The heat from the outside of the can (like your hand) is absorbed during this process which is what allows the change in the state of matter. When the nozzle closes the pressure from the evaporated gas that was released keeps the non evaporated gas a liquid. When the can gets too cold there’s not enough heat being supplied from the outside of the can to allow for the evaporation to take place. Which why, after long bursts it’s difficult to get the canned air to keep blowing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>imagine you have a small, wet towel. towel is a gas, and water is heat. and you put it a small bucket , it will squeeze out the water from the towel and the water will get all around the bucket, because you compressed the towel and it wasn't able to hold the water anymore, but if you wanted to bring out the towel it will decompress again, and it will absorb the water again, and it will dry the bucket. so that's how the gas takes heat from the can with itself</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
