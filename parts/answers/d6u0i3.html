		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi :-) </p>
<p>In addition to what had been said (manual sorting, or just burning it in a cogeneration plant) there are a lot of methods to sort automatically.</p>
<p>Magnets: Get all can lids, nails and stuff out of the garbage.</p>
<p>Air: Lighter stuff will be blown onto a different path.  Also, electro static.</p>
<p>Lasers, light: By shining light or lasers on/through plastics, you can determine what plastic it is. To some extend.</p>
<p>Optical recognition: Especially in bottle recycling, cameras and computers will check if bottles are damaged or still contain dirt.</p>
<p>Soak it: Some things float or dissolve. Think paper vs plastic, wood vs metals.</p>
<p>Burn it: When you burn stuff, you can not only use it to heat water and drive a turbine (generate electricity). Things like metal will melt and can be retrieved later. Depending on the metal, they have different melting points and density, so this way you can seperate many different metails.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in a paper mill that runs partly on recycled paper. We have a bunch of different systems in place to get rid of stuff that shouldn't be there.</p>
<p>A lot of it is based on density. Plastic floats, sand/stone/metal sinks. Very simplified, you swirl it around in hot water, plastics get skimmed off the top, heavy stuff taken out at the bottom, paper dissolves in the water and ends up as pulp again, ready to be made into new paper. </p>
<p>Organic stuff is killed with heat, mostly to avoid mold spores getting in the finished paper. I've seen live rats fall in there though, so it's not just microscopic stuff lol.</p>
<p>I've found engine parts, kitchen knives, rubber boots, hard drives, and lots of other weird things. We have routines in place for what to do if we find guns or grenades.</p>
<p>I've heard stories of much crazier stuff, but they may just be urban myths.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sorting centers that I have inspected (environmental inspections) have a line of low-wage workers working on an elevated conveyor belt station, manually picking out the obviously cannot recycle stuff and tossing it onto the floor, where it eventually gets scooped up for landfilling.  Automated air and magnet separation systems are used for additional segregation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
