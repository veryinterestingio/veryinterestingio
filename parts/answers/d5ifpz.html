		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually, animation in larger studios is rigorously planned and very well coordinated. Usually a storyboard is created showing all the scenes as still images. When the storyboard is finished, voice acting is done, which is combined with the storyboard to create the &quot;animatic&quot;, a kind of power point presentation with the still images with the voice acting in realtime running in the background. This is used to check the pacing of the movie\episode, so there are no boring slow parts or scenes that are hard to follow because they move on too quickly. After that, animation work is done and the still images are replaced with the raw animated footage. While that is happening it's not uncommon that certain things are still subject to change: voicelines are getting re-recorded because they were too wordy or didnt quite fit, scenes changed or shots added\removed. After that, everything is double checked and sound effects\foley is done. Those are a lot easier to edit to fit the footage. Then the final movie is exported and the local Studios get a Version without voicelines for dubbing in their respective language. In that case, the voicelines are recorded within a margin so they just &quot;feel&quot; right when running to the video, and usually depends on resources the studio has left for post production and localization. Sometimes, idioms or sayings need to be changed because they don't exist in the country the movie is translated to. This is a Job for writers, which translate the text so it's meaning isnt &quot;lost in translation&quot;.
Back in the analog days there were timetables with marked frames which showed when certain key actions would start and end. Those were transferred to digital and that's where the Name &quot;keyframe&quot; comes from.</p>
<p>Edit: thanks for the silver, kind stranger! This is propably the best i can hope for from my arts degree.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work at a studio where we sent our materials to Korea to be animated. For that project, and many like it, there are two jobs called timers and track readers. </p>
<p>Track readers listen to the audio track and write down the phonetics of the track frame by frame at 24 frames per second (although it's usually 12 frames per second because that's the speed of classic animation). They then ascribe a mouth shape for the character. These are labelled A through H usually, and have no relation to the sound. A is closed mouth, B through D are open 'ahh' sounds. E is an oo sounds, f is actually ffff. And on. This way, animators who don't speak English know how to animate the mouths.</p>
<p>A timer takes the storyboard, which is like a series of comic panels put together as a movie, and literally times out the movement. A character starts walking and their last walking pose is 48 frames later, well on something called an X-sheet, the timer indicates what frame each foot contacts the ground on, how fast the arms swing, whether and exactly when any variance in the wall cycle occur. For actions like a point, they will often indicate how the action is to occur and when. Is the hand down at frame one and hand pointing at frame 9 based on the boards? They might right large overshoot on frame 7 to give the gesture more force, or indicate an 'ease in&quot; (where the action gets progressively closer to the final pose) to indicate and slower move.</p>
<p>These two jobs are getting a lot less common as digital animation develops, but are still used on major TV shows that contract animation overseas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to do stick-figure animation. It's actually quite simple. You have a timeline, a bar that represents every frame of animation.
You simply put the music in and you can literally match it per <em>frame</em>. You can add or remove frames, start music or sound effects at different times, whatever you want. Very simple.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work as an animator in a small french studio and storyboarded for many productions. There are pretty in depth and interesting answers already, so I will just speak from the perspective of how we do it in france. </p>
<p>When you have an animatic, it almost already looks like the final film but roughly animated. That's the key to the whole thing. Usually the storyboard artist will record a draft track for the voice acting to find the timings and emotional beats of the film. By this stage, you will be able to know whether or not the movements will look natural. When this part is done, the actual voice acting is made, maybe there will be some changes, but by the time the animator receives the shot, they will already have all the acting cues to match perfectly with the sound with good movements and timing.</p>
<p>The sound effects are usually done after the animation is out, and it's the sound designer who matches the sounds with the visuals. It's done afterwards so that it will be possible to be precise with the small details that make it sound natural; the rustle of cloth, contacts, etc. </p>
<p>So in short, all the work is already done beforehand by the storyboard/animatic artist to ensure that it is easy for the animator to match the voice acting in their shot, the music and sfx are done separately to match the visuals, and then there's a final round of tweaking at the end to make sure everything lines up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
