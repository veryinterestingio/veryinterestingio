		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As many have pointed out, drinking alcohol dehydrates you, so you shouldn't drink alcohol to hydrate yourself.  But I think what you're getting at is the comparison between water content of different drinks.  A 1.5 oz shot of vodka and a 12 oz beer have roughly the same alcohol content, but the beer has a lot more water content. 4 beers should leave you less dehydrated than 4 shots of vodka, and possibly less hungover, all else equal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While it is true, as others have pointed out, that alcohol is diuretic, the larger issue with getting dehydrated by low alcohol content drinks, like beer, is that when you drink it in quick succession (e.g. a beer every 20-30 minutes, when you are out in a pub with friends), your body cannot utilize all the water that is in it, because you pee it out too quickly (mostly due to the large volume of the water you are drinking - which is why you might have clear pee when you drink a lot of beer), while it absorbs all the alcohol, so the alcohol outweighs the water content.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you could hydrate yourself by drinking the beers throughout the day (e.g. a pint every 3-4 hours), as then your body would manage to process all the water in it over the gaps, which would outweigh the alcohol content. Obviously that also depends on the type of beer - there are some strong ales with alcohol content of like 10% abv., where this theory could fall short, but for the most common beers that are around 4-5% abv., it should hold (water).</p>
<p>(But hopefully it goes without saying that drinking actual water is much better, since that has no alcohol in it)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other comments: the more important factor in hangover recovery is the sugar content. Ethanol is first degraded into ethanal and that is what causes hangover symptoms. However, ethanal degradation is inhibited by sugar, so more sugar = more ethanal = more hangover.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
