		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) does affect the brain more often and to a greater degree than most common cold viruses, but brain involvement during viral infection is not unique to COVID-19. Many other viruses can affect the brain, including other coronaviruses. See this page for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_encephalitis#Etiology" target="_blank">summary</a> of viruses that can directly affect the brain.</p>
<p>Here's a quote from a 2018 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6212673/" target="_blank">review paper</a> talking about coronaviruses in general, before the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2) was discovered: &quot;As described so far, coronaviruses are respiratory viruses that exhibit neurotropic capacities that not only allows them to achieve latency and avoid the immune response of the host, but also have neurological implications that can complicate the disease associated to its infection.&quot;</p>
<p>In other words, even in 2018, it was known that coronaviruses can affect the brain. With that said, the common cold is usually caused by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinovirus" target="_blank">rhinoviruses</a>, not coronaviruses. It's very rare for rhinovirus infections to directly involve the brain (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30850156/" target="_blank">source</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33464018/" target="_blank">source</a>). Still, rhinovirus infection can indirectly affect the brain by inducing cytokine release that causes things like fever and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sickness_behavior" target="_blank">sickness behavior</a>. Sometimes fevers from the common cold can even lead to seizures, but this is relatively rare and usually only happens in young children (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6422444/" target="_blank">source</a>, <a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Febrile-Seizures-Fact-Sheet" target="_blank">source</a>). The common cold does not usually cause high fevers in adults (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7112468/" target="_blank">source</a>), but again can still indirectly affect the brain by causing low mood, fatigue, brain fog, etc. (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130811/" target="_blank">source</a>).</p>
<p>Unlike the common cold, COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) can directly affect the brain in multiple ways (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34321155/" target="_blank">source</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7687409/" target="_blank">source</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34324964/" target="_blank">source</a>). As one <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8272134/" target="_blank">paper</a> writes, &quot;There is enough evidence to conclude that neurological symptoms and complications are an important feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19 prompts a range of neurological complications, from common and somewhat mild symptoms, such as transient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosmia" target="_blank">anosmia</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageusia" target="_blank">ageusia</a>; to more severe complications, albeit rarer, such as stroke, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_encephalitis" target="_blank">encephalitis</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy" target="_blank">encephalopathy</a>.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>tldr:</strong> COVID-19 affects the brain more than the common cold virus, but other viruses can still affect the brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interesting question that sent me down a rabbit hole of articles. As far as I can tell common colds and flu cause a brain fog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mental haze that comes with a head cold lasts longer than you'd think.
Cognitive impairments start in the incubation period – 24 to 48 hours before other cold symptoms strike – and persist for a couple of days after the coughing and sneezing stop. The cognitive effects are more severe with influenza, Smith said. Even after flu sufferers return to work, &quot;they can be impaired for a couple of weeks afterwards.&quot;</p>

<p>Also came across this from 2010:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Influenza can be associated with various neurologic problems: encephalopathy (a state of confusion), seizures, neuropathy, as well as others… during the 1918 influenza pandemic, there was also an outbreak of a strange illness known as encephalitis lethargica, in which people developed neurologic problems including, in some cases, features of Parkinsonism—problems with balance, slow movements, and facial masking [a symptom in which facial muscles become immobilized]. But, the relationship between the influenza pandemic and the outbreak of encephalitis lethargica remains unclear.</p>
