		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've noticed on some online employment applications they ask my race, age, sex, and I will ALWAYS check &quot;prefer not to say&quot; because these questions are labeled &quot;optional&quot; and I don't give anyone any info if I don't have to.YET sometimes you can't continue until you fill in the &quot;required information&quot;- you know,the ones saying optional.Ive also seen the question &quot;Are you older than 45?&quot; Wait-- it's not illegal to ask a potential employee that? Yeah,I've been sending resumes out for awhile now.Its garbage, and I hate it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
