<p>As a physician I'm truly astounded by the connections between the gut microbiome and Parkinsons and Alzheimers disease. Do you have any recommendations for someone with a general medical background to learn more about this exciting new area of medicine?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just a comment my MIL had stage 4 melanoma with tumours in her breast and lymph nodes. Completed a round of immunotherapy and is labelled as a complete recovery. The tumours in her breast you could feel are gone and the lymph nodes clear. Her immune system just eradicated them. It’s truly amazing she would have been dead and now two years later she’s fine. She was told her micro biome had something to do with it. She grew up on a farm and I think because of her diet which consisted of hardly any processed foods this set her guts up with great bacteria. She still has to go every 3 months for a scan but everything appears fine. Science and our bodies are truly amazing. Thank you doctor for everything you do!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Are fecal transplants the only way to truly get &quot;good&quot; bacteria in the large intestine, or is there promise for coatings that will allow oral administration?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
