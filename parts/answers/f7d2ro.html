		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electronic devices have energy stored in a battery that's restricted in where it can go by the location of wires.  When you add water, electric current can take other paths.  Some paths go through components that were designed to be protected from direct battery current by resistors.  When those protections are bypassed, the components can be exposed to more current than they can carry, causing permanent damage to them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 2 main reasons why water is bad for electronics. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Corrosion through bi-metalic leeching and electrolysis. This includes the physical decomposition of metals but it also includes the deposit of new metal which can cause short circuits. </p>
</li>
<li>Changing capacitance and affecting the flow of electrons. </li>
</ol>
<p>Pure water is not very conductive and in a pure environment it would not cause much damage if any. However in the real world the water is seldom pure and these impurities make the water conductive. </p>
<p>Conductive liquid covering your circuits can change the capacitance of components which destabilizes the circuit and it can even lead to damage. It can also cause electrons to bridge a gap between two points it wasn't designed for if they are close enough together, the water is conductive enough, and the voltage potential is high enough. Thus current can move through a circuit in a way it wasn't designed for and damage it. These are the reasons why it's bad to try to turn on a wet device, and why a device which is powered off can get wet and be dried out later without failing. </p>
<p>In addition, there are the corrosive effects. Water causes rust and oxidation, particularly in iron compounds like chokes, inductors, and transformers. There is also electrolysis to contend with. When you put 2 different metals in a conductive solution, ions can flow from one to the other which causes material to be deposited at one end, and corroded from the other. The material deposited may short circuit the tiny legs of integrated circuits, it may rapidly corrode other components which can lead to shorts and breaks. </p>
<p>Remember how tiny everything is now days and how delicate the little metal legs and traces are that connect chips to each other. It only takes a few seconds of corrosion to dissolve part of a trace or short circuit 2 tiny wires thinner than a human hair. </p>
<p>Even if the device is powered down, if it is left wet long enough it can still corrode due to the difference in potential between different metals, a bit like how a battery works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, it's not actually the water that's the problem.  If you had distilled water it may hurt some electronics, but many it would not because it isn't very conductive.  It's the imperfections, heavy metals, etc etc suspended in the water that cause the problem as they conduct electricity.</p>
<p>If you think about a car battery (just picking a super large thing everyone is familiar with) the water and things inside it will connect the + and the - ports causing a short.  Now imagine instead of a battery with just two exposed electrical pieces you have a computer motherboard with tons and tons of port it can cross all together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electronics work because the elecricity follows the conductive metal in specific ways to do what we want. Water is conductive, so it makes the elecricity go where we don’t want it. </p>
<p>This alone doesn’t necessarily kill a device. If you open up your device and dry it thoroughly, then there is actually a chance you can get it to work again. </p>
<p>But, if the device was on when it got wet, there is a chance the water could have made electricity go where it wasn’t supposed to go while the device was doing something important, which could cause an error on the coding or functioning of the device. </p>
<p>Also, water is corrosive. If your device gets wet, and you don’t do a good job of drying it, it will cause a lot of the wires in your device to corrode, especially around things that store a lot of energy (like batteries or capacitors). Oftentimes, corrosion is not conductive, so any corroded wires essentially cut off the conductive wires.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The water isn’t actually conductive enough to cause many problems electrically. The rust is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
