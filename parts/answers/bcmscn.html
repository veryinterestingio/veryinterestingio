		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the plant. Some plants like navel oranges were found as a mutant plant, or part of a plant. People cut off branches and grafted them to the roots of other orange trees to make more seedless orange trees.</p>
<p>Some plants will grow fruit without seeds if the flower does not get fertilized. Growers cover the flowers, or clip off the female part, or do something else to keep them from getting fertilized. </p>
<p>Some plants will grow seedless fruit if they are a hybrid.</p>
<p>Some plants grow seedless fruit when the seeds themselves are fertilized by another species, because the plant embryo dies before it can grow into a seed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>These is a really interesting video I saw recently about this l, I’ll link it once I find it. </p>
<p>Basically: the normal watermelon plant has a set of 2 genes. The mutant one has sets of 4. </p>
<p>Both of them have seeds in them. But when they’re hybrid it has sets of 3 genes and it confuses the plant so it doesn’t make any seeds. </p>
<p>My explanation was stupid, I’ll get the link in a while.</p>
<p>Edit 2: thank you kind stranger for the silver.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plants like salvia (the drug) almost NEVER seed. Seeds actually cost more than the plant material. It drops living leaves that implant in ground and begin to grow as new plants. The other way to make new plants of plants that rarely seed is cuttings, (like Khat another drug mass produced in Africa that RARELY seeds). can’t say for sure but I’m 70% sure they’d do this if they even wanted to make more plants. they cut a larger branch. Cut it in the right way on a good spot and it’ll regrow a whole new plant. I’m a gardener and really into botany and psychoactive plants,</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Best explanation of how some of the seedless plants are produced I know of is here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIGEQYUtUDQ" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIGEQYUtUDQ</a></p>
<p>It's explained by Myles Powers, a chemist skeptic which tries to highlight the hypocrisy of Greenpeace. If you don't want to watch the full thing, essentially, a plant is tricked into producting a plant with 4 groups of chromosones (instead of 2), then bred with a normal plant to produce a plant with 3 chromosones, which is incapable of properly splitting its genetic material. Once bref again, some of the offspring plants have either all or none of the genetic material. The fruit that receives the material with no chromosones is then a barren fruit, with no seeds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
