		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well this isn't going to be really like you're 5 but I'll try to explain. Prepare for a long post no TL;DR because I’m too lazy.</p>
<p>Let's start with history.</p>
<p>The original energy drinks that started in Japan and still are in Japan are not caffeine drinks, they were food supplementation because Japanese people would work themselves to death by not eating enough or living extremely unhealthy lifestyles of eating just instant ramen and other junk food. </p>
<p>In to the rescue came
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipovitan" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipovitan</a></p>
<p>Notice it was produced by a pharmaceutical company and it is like todays supplement market basically just that a vitamin supplement with added taurine. It was known as a 栄養ドリンク eiyo dorikku or &quot;nutritional drink&quot;. These promoted stuff like 疲労回復 (recover from fatigue), 滋養強壮 (analeptic [nervous system stimulant]), 栄養補給 (nutritional supplement), 眼精疲労 (reduces eye fatigue)</p>
<p>As you know people gobble up supplements like there no tomorrow so the energy drink industry blew up in Japan.</p>
<p><a href="https://gyl-magazine.jp/energy-drinks-in-japan/" target="_blank">https://gyl-magazine.jp/energy-drinks-in-japan/</a></p>
<p>Notice that on this list the first caffeinated energy drink is a foreign one Monster Energy. The energy drinks we know in the vast are vastly distinct from the original Japanese ones.</p>
<p>Here’s a really good post in Japanese describing the differences.
<a href="https://gigazine.net/news/20151123-what-is-energy-drink/" target="_blank">https://gigazine.net/news/20151123-what-is-energy-drink/</a></p>
<p>You can use chrome to translate it's perfectly understandable.
TL;DR In Japan eiyo drinku are supplements and can contain taurine and other vitamins, red bull and monster energy on the other hand are &quot;sodas&quot; or what the Japanese call &quot;soft drinks&quot; and can't contain it so they add other stuff. </p>
<p>But in the west this is different. There is no supplementation laws for drinks so our western drinks are all in one, both the Japanese taurine + vitamins supplement drinks and they have high contents of caffeine and sugar. And noticed that the biggest can of energy drink you can get in Japan is 355ml while in the west you can easily go up to 700ml or more…
So enough with Japan…
So the guy that &quot;invented&quot; red bull went to Thailand of a business trip and he suffered from jetlag, he tried one of the krating daeng (literally red bull) that was the local energy drink and his jetlag aka sleep had been &quot;cured&quot;. He was a toothpaste businessman that wanted to expand to their product to Thailand so he knew about business.
This original krating Daeng was very different from energy drinks of today. It was much like the Japanese one a nutritional supplement for the working classes that was supposed to get your energy back not in the sense of I won’t sleep tonight and will perform better but in the sense that you won’t feel like shit tomorrow and for the next 5 days because you’re overworking and eating badly.
Now in the US as the 80s were rolling and there was more to do at night with video games, TV, and other things, there drive to stay awake for young people.
In the US consciousness there was two things that promoted wakefulness the so called “sugar rush” that doesn’t actually exist where it was believed children were so hyper because of all he sugar they took, and while sugar does provide a temporary boost in energy and alertness there is also a big crash associated with it when it ends, but it’s certainly not the “sugar rush” of US myth. And naturally there was the very old caffeine thing you use in the cartoons all the way in the 1910s where people are shaking and can’t sleep from too much caffeine.</p>
<p>And son in 1985 Jolt Cola was born, its slogan reads &quot;All the sugar, twice the caffeine!&quot; Intended as a drink for teen and young adults so you can stay up longer, work better, study better and so on..
Jolt cola made it also to Europe.  And also many knockoffs and similar dinks where made after it found big popularity.
And so we come to the first true “energy drink” of today.
You remember Dietrich Mateschitz, now in Europe there was other drinks that were very similar to Red bull before it appeared there was one company called Lisa that had a product named Power Horse. Very similar to todays red bull.
So when he came back, he basically did an all in one thing. He combined east and west to make Red Bull. A highly caffeinate drink with tons of sugar, tons of caffiene, vitamins, taurine and whatever else they could chuck inside.
Combined with a huge marketing success Energy drinks where born and all of their competitors and knockoffs.
Because people wanted to stay awake.</p>
<p>Now. For the part that interests you. </p>
<p>Why are energy drinks harmful to us?
Well there 3 things to consider. Speed of drinking, drinking environment, preexisting conditions and mixing.
The goal of coffee is generally to keep you awake, you drink it hot, you drink it slow. Limiting the caffiene intake also only taking in caffiene and the other flavonoids in coffee nothing else.
Energy drink on the other hand are more like Cola. Cola in the US is consumed in ridiculous quantities. Same with say beer. You can easily drink 2 liters of cola in one night or party. Same with beer. Caffeine acts as a diuretic allowing you to drink more and making your thirsty at the same time. This is why they put salt inside of these so you don’t literally die from fluid loss. </p>
<p>So energy drinks are consumed in big quantities and often chugged. </p>
<p>Energy drinks are also used at parties in combinations with alcohol. </p>
<p>Males are by far the vast majority of ER victors because of energy drinks mostly because they’re prone to reckless behavior and “partying” or “endurance runs” and other unhealthy shit. </p>
<p>There is also a link that suggests that while energy drinks without a doubt boost alertness, interfere with sleep and other stuff <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5524057/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5524057/</a> there is a risk of the cocktails of vitamins, stimulants and other things n them that prove dangerous in high quantities. Especially the higher blood pressure after energy drink consumption. </p>
<p>So energy drinks are basically medical supplements turned into highly chugable, highly caffeinated &quot;sodas&quot; that seem to increase blood pressure more than pure caffeinated rinks such as tea or coffee. They're also linked by marketing to extreme behaviors such as extreme sports and other activities that make fatalities more likely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Iirc it's not the caffeine in energy drinks but the huge amount of suger and taurine.</p>
<p>Suger boosts caffeine absorption giving you a quicker stronger hit increasing stress on your body functions.</p>
<p>If you want the caffeine coffee is healthier and a better choose because it's ingredients are more understood and it has Alot less suger</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What’s more confusing is that it’s bad because it speeds up your heart, but also speeding up your heart rate is the goal for cardio exercise. </p>
<p>Similarly researchers found that saunas are really good for long term cardio health, reason being heart rate stimulation (with no accompanying exercise)</p>
<p>So why is speeding it up one way good but not the other?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no reason to think energy drinks are worse for you then coffee. Caffeine is pretty much harmless in moderation, taurine is a protein found in meat and cheese, vitamins are... well, vitamins. Sugar might not be very good for you, but there are plenty of sugar free alternatives.</p>
<p>Of course, overdosing caffeine is no good, no matter what the source.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
