		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for doing this AMA! I would love to learn more about how you’re using remote sensing in this research. Are you estimating the biomass of trees in an area? Do you also include information about what type of trees or forests you’re looking at, and if so, how are they different? Is there anything unusual or unexpected you’ve learned from this research?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming some kind of agricultural forestry practice, what is the best known strategy for storing carbon in working forests and their wood products?   I live in rural Oregon and this is a hot topic, with timber spokespeople consistently claiming that sequestration is greatest during the first few years of growth, so we should prioritize shorter harvesting rotations.  Is this accurate?</p>
<p>Sources would be great so that I can share any info with local citizens and decision makers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! Thank you for the AMA!</p>
<p>I am currently pursuing a grant within my firm (architecture and engineering) that would allow me time and resources to analyze the levels of embodied carbon for one of our major projects currently under construction. Considering my specialty lies within the landscape, the degree to which trees might be able to offset the carbon footprint of the campus is of special interest. Are there reliable tools that you might be able to recommend to better help me calculate and assess the role of trees in offsetting the overall carbon footprint of the site?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On land where there are few trees do they tend to spread out rather than gain height? If so how does this effect the cannopy? I kbow part of this is the natural reforestation process but people who have lawns theme towards pruning trees to be &quot;full&quot; instead of &quot;tall.&quot;. Is that detemental to the ecosystem does it not matter?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
