For the regular black european ants, each ant colony has its own odor. Even if their queens are related.
If caught by the other colony, they would get killed and perhaps eaten.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most eusocial insects (such as ants and bees) use pheromones and scent to identify each other.  So a “lost” ant would not smell the same as the ants in a different colony.  While some species might be willing to accept a newcomer, most will not (especially for ant species that are hostile to other ant colonies).</p>
<p>The same is true for bees, though it’s even less common then because bees can fly so they can usually get back to their hive even if it means a lot of traveling.  An interesting thing about bees; worker bees are prevented from laying eggs by the queen bee’s pheromones.  If a queen swarms (leaves the hive with a retinue of worker bees, which happens when the hive gets too big) without leaving a queen egg or if the queen dies, the worker bees might start laying eggs, which will always be drones (make bees that only live to fertilize the queen bee.  They do not do any work).  If you try to introduce a new queen into the hive after the workers have started laying their own eggs, the worker bees will immediately kill the new queen.  However, this means the hive is doomed because the workers will start to die off and the drones can’t survive on their own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the book Emergence, they explain that it's more useful to think of the entire colony as the organism, made up of self-organizing ants.  A colony has a life span of about 15-20 years, iirc, while a worker ant lives only a couple years.  Also, ants from a younger colony will act more rash and aggressively, while ants from an older colony will be more cautious and will avoid fighting.   Not sure how much it answers your question, but figured sharing some nerdy I go would be fun!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
