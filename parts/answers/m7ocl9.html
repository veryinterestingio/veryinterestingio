		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Carbon and also methane capture seems to be getting a second look right now. Carbon capture solutions from low tech kelp farming and reforestation to higher tech solutions like underground storage are often discussed; while methane capture solutions like burn off and animal gas collection are as well.</p>
<p>What role do you see carbon and methane capture playing? Is the moral hazard too great to fund these efforts or should we be all in everything given the climate urgency?</p>
<p>Edit: included methane capture and CC underground storage. I live in CO that recently enacted methane monitoring laws.</p>
