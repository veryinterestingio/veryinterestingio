Kresak &amp; Kresakova 1987). At this rate, the comet might be
severely diminished or even vanished in about 15,000 years.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a really great question because asking it led us to discover most of the solar system! For many years, astronomers had a paradox: comets have relatively short lifespans of maybe millions of years maximum, and the solar system is billions of years old; however, there are still observable comets! The answer, as reasoned by Ernst Ã–pik and then more famously by Jan Oort, is that there is a vast collection of objects that we can't see that occasionally get bumped into the periodicity that we see for comets like Halley.</p>
<p>Research has <del>shown</del> suggested that the number of these objects range in the billions, meaning most of the things in the solar system are in what we call the Oort cloud! And because it takes up the sphere 0.03 to <del>3.2</del>  .8 (ish) light-years from the sun it's the vast, vast majority of solar system by volume.  </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>edit: 3.2 light years was a ridiculous estimate! The Oort cloud is not experimentally confirmed, although presumed by most scientists. It's exact nature is hotly debated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
