		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our time system originated in Summeria and was spread from there to basically every other civilization. Summeria used a base-12 number system (single digits went 0-11 for 12 total single digit numbers). 60 is much less an oddball in base 12 math. Their number system never caught on, but their time system did.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the minutes/hours system is much older and based on the sumerian number system.</p>
<p>They were obsessed with the number 12, and 60 being a multiple of 12, 5 and 10 seemed usefull to them. So they used that as a base for their number system.</p>
<p>They also split their currency like that 1 Talent=60 Mina, 1 Mina= 60 Shekel</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The system is ancient but has stuck around because 12 and 60 are <em>superior highly composite numbers</em>. Basically there are an unusually high amount of numbers that evenly divide into them which makes it super convenient. Hours is 12 btw (or 24 in some regions), not 10.</p>
<p>1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, 1/10, 1/12, 1/15, 1/20, 1/30 all divide out nicely from 60. Compare to 10 which is just 1/2 and 1/5.</p>

<p>Milliseconds are in decimal because base 60 doesn't actually make any sense to use at that scale. We would need 60 unique number symbols because of the infinite precision problem. Milliseconds and frankly our entire numerical system COULD have been in base 12 though and there's a legitimate push to make that happen. Also base 6 which is again a <em>superior highly composite number</em> but mostly a meme movement because it's called &quot;seximal.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The civilizations that first divided the day up into smaller units of time (at least in the West) used base 12 (Egyptians)  and base 60 (Babylonians/Sumerians) number systems instead of a base 10 number system and their systems were adapted by the Greeks.</p>
