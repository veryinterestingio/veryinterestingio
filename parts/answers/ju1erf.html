		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In principle, viruses could have arisen from the top down (as free-living organisms that progressively stripped down their genomes) or from the bottom up (as genome parasites, like transposable elements, that gained the ability to spread from host to host).  (The third possibility is that viruses came first, as the origin of all life forms.)</p>
<p>It's hard to be completely certain, but the consensus is that probably both top-down and bottom-up apply: Some virus groups originated as bacteria (or something like them) that became stripped-down parasites, and others originated from transposable elements that gained protein coats and the ability to spread between hosts.</p>
<p>It's also possible that both events happened multiple times, so that different virus groups may have arisen independently from each other even though they had the same kind of origin.  <a href="http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-origins-of-viruses-14398218" target="_blank">The Origins of Viruses</a> reviews these possibilities in more detail.  </p>
<p>Viruses don't leave much to work with; they don't fossilize (except metaphorically, in their hosts' genomes), and their genomes mutate so rapidly that you can't work backward very far  phylogenetically.  The most powerful way of looking at common ancestry may be to use common structure features of proteins to look for similarities. For example, the group of &quot;large double-stranded DNA viruses&quot; -- which is a small subset of &quot;all viruses&quot; -- has been proposed to form five clusters, based on structural features of their proteins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, studies on virion architectures have unexpectedly revealed that their structural diversity is far more limited. Here we describe structures of the major capsid proteins of double-stranded DNA viruses infecting hosts residing in different domains of life. We note that viruses belonging to 20 different families fall into only five distinct structural groups</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One way of viewing this if you entertain the [RNA world hypothesis] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_world" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_world</a>) is that life eventually evolved from functional RNA that gained the ability to replicate itself and other RNA molecules (an RNA polymerase made from RNA?), and RNA viruses are therefore a relic of the RNA world that continued to adapt for billions of years through natural selection. In this sense, it would seem very possible that, if there was another planet on which life came about through RNA evolution as one of the early stages, viruses would exist there also.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
