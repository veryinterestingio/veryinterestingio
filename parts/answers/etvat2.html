		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of top posts seem to forget to mention that even though our heart muscle has lots of mitochondrias it still needs rest. After every contraction it rests enough to continue. That's why you want to train your heart at 80% of your max BPM so it doesn't get tired or enlarge. Short bursts going above is completely fine and can be good for you, but not prolonged fatigue.
Heart does get tired, but recovers much faster than other muscles.
It SEEMS like our heart is constantly beating, but it has 4 parts with several muscles each. They all take turns contracting and rest when they don't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Heart muscles contain much more mitochondria and are able to sustain essentially an unlimited amount of contractions until we die.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>And check out a Khan Academy YouTube video on the types of muscle. If you think cardiac and skeletal muscles are cool, just wait until you find out about smooth muscles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
