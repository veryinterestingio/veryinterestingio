		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most intrinsic problem is that Newton's second law (F=ma) is actually only a low speed approximation. If you are thrusting in the direction of your motion, the force is actually:</p>
<p>F = (1-v^(2)/c^(2))^(-3/2) ma</p>
<p>When v is much less than c, that first term is basically 1 and you get F=ma. But as v gets closer to c, the first term gets bigger and bigger, and starts to asymptote towards infinity.</p>
<p>This means that the faster you go, the more force you need to get the same amount of acceleration. And the force you need ends up increasing so rapidly as you approach the speed of light that you can never beat it, and never reach the speed of light.</p>
<p>(Side note: it used to be taught that your <em>mass</em> increases as you approach the speed of light, but we generally prefer to say that <em>force for a given acceleration</em> increases instead, because the required force actually depends on the direction of the force, and it's more weird and confusing if your mass depends on what direction you're being pushed from)</p>
<p>But as a secondary point, space isn't <em>entirely</em> empty. There is a thin medium of ionised gas throughout the Milky Way, containing clouds of denser &quot;molecular&quot; gas. Even though the density is extremely low, as you approach the speed of light, you are going so fast that you are smashing through a pretty large volume of space every second, and you do indeed feel a drag force from smashing into these interstellar plasma particles (mostly protons). And not only does this slow you down, over time these high energy protons are going to cause significant damage to your ship!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Relativity aside, there is another problem. Space is not empty. Interstellar space has a density of about 1 hydrogen atom per cubic meter. Very thin, but at high relativistic speeds, you would be traveling through a whole lot of cubic meters. The numerous atoms, dust particles and such would be identical to a beam of extremely high energy radiation beamed right at you. I may not be exactly right on this, but the bottom line is that the faster you go, the more micro collisions you will experience and with progressively greater energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just because there’s no resistance, doesn’t mean you will accelerate infinitely. It just means whatever speed you reach, you won’t lose it. Acceleration to light speed still requires enough energy to move your mass to that speed. Also as above poster mentioned, space isn’t totally empty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, because there is still resistance of movement based on mass. More mass or higher speeds requires more energy to move it faster. The way it works out, if an object has ANY mass, it requires, at some point, infinite energy to achieve speed of light (which is obviously not possible). So the issue is not air resistance or some such, but the energy required to accelerate an object.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
