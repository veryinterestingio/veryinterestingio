		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a very complicated question since modern processors take like 3 months and over 1000 steps to make, but ill do my best to skip all the detail and make it really ELI5</p>
<p>They use special chemicals and light to draw a pattern, or mask, on the silicon. They can then modify or remove the parts of the silicon that is not exposed. This process along with several other specialized processes for each step is repeated to modify the silicon to make transistors, replace parts of it with wiring to connect everything and then build a big stack of wiring on top of it that connects it all to the rest of the computer. </p>
<p>They key processes used are:</p>
<p>Lithography (drawing a pattern with light and chemicals)</p>
<p>Implant (modifying exposed silicon by adding trace amounts of other atoms to it)</p>
<p>Etch (removing exposed silicon (or other materials) by either chemical solutions or chemical plasmas)</p>
<p>Deposition (depositing a film on the silicon, sometimes to fill in silicon that was removed with etch, sometimes to make a new film that will be etched to have something else filled into it)</p>
<p>Polish (smoothing out the wafer after various steps make it rough or deposit too much material)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They use chemicals to build a thin layer, use light to burn it off in places, then more chemicals to actually modify the exposed parts of the chip (e.g. acids to create channels for conductors).</p>
<p>The advantage of using light is you can shine it through a bigger guide (that creates the necessary patterns) and reflect it down to a very small size.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lithography is the term your seeing over and over here. But it's not as simple as everyone is making it sound, it's a really amazing process to generate appropriately small wavelengths of light. </p>
<p>Eli5 version is, imagine light is like a marker, you can only make lines as thin as your marker tip, in order to make a smaller marker tip they use one marker (a laser) to make a new marker that's smaller, by shooting a laser into a perfectly round ball of tin, that tin then emits new light if a smaller wavelength (aka smaller marker)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how you can use a magnifying glass to burn stuff by concentrating rays in a tiny area?</p>
<p>Manufacturers use a magnifying glass with a pattern on it, then the concentrated rays burn out very tiny patterns in a tiny area. The burnt areas have different physical properties to unburnt areas, and with the right pattern this creates a transistor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
