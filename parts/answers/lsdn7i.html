		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, let me introduce you to r vs K selection.</p>
<p>All living creatures have to have babies, to pass their traits on to the next generation, ensure that their species survive.  But there's 2 general strategies, r and K</p>
<p>r selection are the creatures that have many offspring at once.  Think of insects or fish.  They have lots of babies, and most of these babies will die.  They put very little effort into raising these young.  Basically they reach sexual maturity early, have a hundred or more babies at a time, and sometimes die soon after, leaving room for their offspring to take their place.  Think of salmon spawning in a river then dying.  Think of insects, which typically have one large clutch of eggs then die soon after.  These species are short lived, but just spew out their offspring, most of whom will die.  If ever there's a favorable change in the environment more of their offspring will survive and can very quickly take over.  If the environment changes for the worst, well they had hundreds of offspring, one or two might make it.</p>
<p>K selected have fewer offspring.  They devote a lot of attention to these offspring, investing a lot of time and effort into teaching them how to survive.  Their plan is to have fewer offspring, but invest a lot of effort into protecting and teaching their offspring so that most will survive.  Because the parent(s) need to invest so much effort into raising their young, the parents have to be long-lived to allow time for them to pass on their knowledge and provide protection.  Think of humans who's offspring are completely helpless for the first 2 years or so, and are not ready to take care of themselves until they are teenagers (or in the case of my nephew, 30+ years old).</p>
<p>Elephants are highly K selected.  It takes a lot of effort to raise a young elephant, so they don't reach sexual maturity before they are teenagers.  When they become pregnant it's 22 months, almost 2 years, before they give birth.  They only give birth to a single offspring.  This offspring is dependent on it's mother for at least 5 years, and up to 10 years.  A baby elephant nurses for at least 2 years, it can't survive without it's mother's milk, and if orphaned before this will die of starvation.  After giving birth the mother will not be able to get pregnant again for at least 4 years, so their first child will be almost 6 years old before there is a chance at a brother or sister.  An elephant can become pregnant well into their 50's or even 60's, although fertility drops after age 30.  All of this mothering gives baby elephants a high chance of survival.  70% of elephants will live to the age of sexual maturity.</p>
<p>For all of these reasons, an elephant has to be long-lived.  It, like humans, invests so heavily in raising their offspring that they have to be able to stick around for years.</p>
<p>Now giraffes, on the other hand, are kind of in between r and K.  They reach sexual maturity at around age 7, half the age of an elephant.  They are pregnant for 15 months, and give birth to a single offspring (usually).  The offspring are weaned off their mothers milk at age 1, although they can begin to eat solid food at around age 4 months.  Baby giraffes are reliant on their mothers for less than 2 years, generally becoming independent at 15-18 months.  Meanwhile the mother giraffe can become pregnant again almost immediately after giving birth, so she can be nursing one young while pregnant with it's sibling.  Sadly, only about 50% of giraffes will survive infancy.</p>
<p>For a mammal that's even more r selected than a giraffe, look at a dog.  Dogs are pregnant for 63 days, and give birth to multiple offspring.  They can get pregnant at 10 months, and the puppies are weaned at about 30 days.  And dogs only live about half as long as giraffes.</p>
<p>Clarification: I stated that elephants have to live a long time because they are highly K selected.  In actuality it's more of a &quot;there's a genetic push for an elephant to live longer lives.  A long lived elephant, since they remain fertile right up almost to the point of death, will have more offspring.  These offspring will in turn inherit their parent's long life, so there is a selective pressure for longer lives in elephants, which allows them to devote more effort into raising their young.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Genetics. They process that food differently, they have different behaviors, and ultimately, it wasn't selected for by evolution.</p>
<p>Elephants are very social and are matrilineal. Matriaches lead their groups based on knowledge they've learned throughout their life. This is then passed down. Additionally, by living longer, there are more older adults to care for young.</p>
<p>I don't know enough about giraffes to contrast their behavior, but <del>I thought it was similar to horses where males fight for control of groups of breeding females. IF I'm right on that, then</del> there isn't the social network there to reinforce long life. (Edit: don't really know how to phrase it... but, This is about evolutionary selection and the role society and group behavior influences the prevalence of certain genes in a population of animals [and the other way around, can't form a society if everyone dies too fast. <em>Looking at you, MAYFLY</em>] In this case, genes that would help giraffes live longer such as promoting a stronger heart and circulatory system)</p>
<p>Lastly, brains. Elephants are smart and learn a lot. They're problem solvers, they remember stuff, etc. Giraffes, I don't think they're at elephant level intelligence. So, a giraffe is gonna learn everything it needs to (or can learn) much faster than an elephant, so the longer lifespan of the elephant accounts for this as well.</p>
<p>Everything I've said about elephants is magnified in humans if that helps conceptualize it.</p>
<p>EDIT:
My most popular post is actually in my area of expertise and not one of my random back-asswards comments. I feel lucky. ⭐</p>
<p>There are lots of additions that could be made to this! This was just an unemployed microbiologist's remembrance of Zoology class and all those nature documentaries. Thanks to everyone for the replies!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Elephant pregnancy lasts 22 months, and an elephant is not an adult until 18 Years of age. Giraffe pregnancy only lasts 14 months, and they are independent by two years of age.</p>
<p>If you want to be an elephant, and raise two baby elephants, you’ll need to at least be living into your 30s without aging. Giraffes could have easily had 10 or 12 babies by that age, so there isn’t really any reason for them to continue living beyond that (biologically).</p>
<p>Once you have passed your genes on, and not just through reproduction but also by caring for kin, then your natural purpose has been fulfilled. It takes elephants a long time to do this.</p>
<p>One additional point, elephants have 3 copies of the P53 tumor suppressor, the most of any animal iirc. Idk how many giraffes have but probably not that many. The shorter your life needs to be, the less protection you get from cancer, the earlier you die. Rats can easily get cancer within 6 months if they’re predisposed to it, and many will get cancer by age 2 (about the end of their life in the wild).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because their predecessors occupied different ecological niches and faced different selection pressures.  That these animals now live in an overlapping environment today and have similar diets today may not be enough to meaningfully ascertain what drove their evolution.  Giraffes have ancestors that evolved in south Central Europe and elephants from Africa.  Maybe a look at those environments over time will tell you more about their adaptations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Question in the question: isn't it related to the fact that giraffe's hearth is overworking their whole life in order to pump blood up to the brain?
