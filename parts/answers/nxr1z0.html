		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! </p>
<p>Parasitoids tend to be very specific to their hosts (even if they attack different species within a family) as they need to overcome the defense mechanisms that the host has to defend themselves from the parasitoid. </p>
<p>Some caterpillars create melatonin bubbles around wasps eggs, others have white globules that attack the unknown element inside their bodies, and some wasps use different mechanisms such as venom, paralyzers or even polydnaviruses that hits the hostâ€™s immune system and lowers the capacity of the host to attack the wasp egg. </p>
<p>Evolutionarily speaking knowing what are the defense mechanisms of each host is very costly, and they tend to specialize to be as effective as they can, after all, their lives depends on it.</p>
<p>Because of this itâ€™s not very common for a parasitoid to attack a great range of hosts, for that we have predators which are VERY generalists ðŸ˜ˆ</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did work with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichogramma" target="_blank">Trichogramma</a> egg parasitoids and they were not very species specific, they can parasitize lepidopteran eggs of many species. For example, althigh the species we used was intended to control European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) we could rear them on the eggs of Mediterranean flour moth (Ephestia kuehniella) which are much cheaper and simpler to rear.</p>
<p>Trichogramma females will measure the eggs to determine the number of larvae they can feed and lay a corresponding number of eggs inside.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most species have evolved together with host species of insects since 150 million years: When the insect changes into two species, so does the wasp. The wasp stings often also contain &quot;viroids&quot; which are hoops of RNA which integrate with the host RNA, and dozens of other sting chemicals, like proteins that change the host's hormones. The behavior to i.e. attack a tarantula is hereditary too, so it's another reason why they have evolved with the host species, so there's &gt;250 thousand of species of them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Read &quot;The Extended Phenotype&quot; by Richard Dawkins if you want detail. Wasps are great examples of how it's not the organism which is naturally selected (contrary to what many biologists think): It's the <em>gene</em> which is selected. Organisms are gene vehicles. </p>
<p>To the specifics of your question, I don't know exactly other than to say that given enough time, peculiar things can happen among such animals. I don't see anyone on this thread answering your question with good detail, and frankly it's a complicated subject. I imagine that an ancestor of a particular wasp species targeted an ancestor of its host species and the genes that led it in that direction were evolutionary successful, and then over much time, the wicked relationship between parasite and host became more complex and specific. These parasites can end up doing things that aid the evolutionary success of the <em>host's</em> genes too!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
