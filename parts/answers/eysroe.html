		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do sew together muscles and nerves and veins the best they can, but the general goal is not to make it perfect or even good, the goal is to turn it from totally disconnected arm that is across the room to a really bad injury the body can heal.   </p>
<p>Like you don't sew the bone together so it's perfect, you get it good enough it's just a broken bone that could heal, and like you don't sew the muscles to the point it's a perfectly working muscle, you just sew it till it's a big injury that could heal. etc. You don't sew every single tiny vein, you sew enough of them just good enough the arm won't die then it will heal that over time itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You've got the right idea. You can think of the vessels of the body as being plumbing/pipes that can be sewed together. They generally flow in a logical, predictable way, and the plumbing gets smaller and smaller in diameter as you move away from the heart. Very small vessels require microscopes to repair. Nerves can be reconnected in a similar manner. Other soft tissue--bone, muscle, tendons, skin-- also need to be approximated for structure support and functional outcome.</p>
