<p>Smoke is an exception; that actually does have more particles in the air that can stick to things and smell longer as a result</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's not true</p>
<p>Chemist here. </p>
<p>The things you mentioned are complicated. Smoke is not &quot;a smell&quot; but particles and it's harder to remove &quot;solids&quot; from something than actual gasses. This example is therefore not so good. You can smell these solids also if they reside on other furniture for instance - this won't happen to gases (following text).</p>
<p>Rotting food contains very highly concentrated bacterial gaseous products so it takes more substance (air) to dilute them but it's not really <em>stinking more</em>. Think of a fart (Eli5 right?): Stinks extremely but vanishes very fast because it's mainly composed of sulfur gasses and not very highly concentrated (and by the way is also a bacterial gaseous product from your guts)</p>
<p>Another counterargument is the <a href="https://www.gardenia.net/plant-variety/syringa-vulgaris-common-lilac" target="_blank">flower common lilac</a>. Also good smelling but too much of it and it will last for several days in your flat, especially in times of blooming.</p>
<p>Everything is a matter of concentration</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an asthmatic, I notice all the smells that set off an asthma attack.   It's mostly the &quot;good&quot; smells that everyone likes to spray around, whether it's air freshener or the perfume they bathe in.</p>
<p>I'd assume this is mostly a perception, although I'm sure there are certain particulates that do actually hang in the air longer </p>
<p>Also you will go nose blind to anything your around for long enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would think because our olfactory system is adapted to pick up things that can cause us harm better than others, unless the other is overpowering the &quot;bad&quot; [dangerous] smell</p>
<p>Edit: also the soot in smoke will stick to things as someone had pointed out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
