		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A muscle cramp is caused by dehydration, muscle strain, or overuse of a muscle, among other factors. When it occurs, a sudden and involuntary contraction of the affected muscle takes place. To answer your main question, most muscle cramps are harmless, and last between 30 seconds to 15 minutes. A muscle cramp will not permanently damage the muscle tissue, but it will cause fatigue as the muscle is constantly contracted during the cramp. If you are experiencing frequent cramps, the suggested course of action to remember is RICE, which stands for Rest, Ice, and Elevation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cramps can be a sign of magnesium deficiency.   The role of magnesium at the cellular level is to prevent calcium from entering cells too much, calcium contracts muscles, magnesium relaxes, so in a cramp , your muscle takes in to much calcium and your muscle contracts and cramping occurs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there's a fair amount of inaccuracy around here.  I'll try to give you a better answer without getting too much into extraneous detail.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>> What happens when a muscle cramps?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>A muscle cramp is an involuntary, continuous, transient muscle contraction.  At the molecular level, myosin requires ATP to 'unlock' from actin.  When that ATP cannot be delivered in sufficient quantities, myosin remains 'locked' with actinand the muscle fiber does not relax.  This is the molecular mechanism for a muscle cramp.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There are two basic pathways which can lead to that situation - the cell is unable to produce ATP in quantities to continue to satisfy demand, or the demands of the myosin fiber for ATP suddenly exceed production.  The first is generally associated with fatigue - the cellular mechanisms for generating ATP are no longer functioning at peak efficiency due usually to decrease in intracellular pH (free H+ in the cytoplasm), lack of production capacity (insufficient mitochondria), or lack of substrate (no longer able to deliver sufficient oxygen, for example).  The second can be caused by trauma - someone punches you just right and the sarcoplasmic reticulum is sufficiently damaged to cause a sudden release of Ca2+, or by a nervous 'misfire' - a neuron that controls the sarcoplasmic reticulum fired unexpectedly and caused the sarcoplasmic reticulum to dump an excess of Ca2+.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>When either of those situations occur, the muscle will cramp.  Things like 'dehydration' or 'overuse' is going to cause one of the two aforementioned scenarios to occur.  For example dehydration is going to increase the potential for a nervous misfire as well as impair the efficiency of intracellular ATP generation via increasing pH (among other effects).  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>> <strong>what happens if it cramps for too long</strong> </p>
<p>At the very extreme end of the scale, there is potential for muscle atrophy to occur.  Without the ability to relax, the intracellular mechanisms never get a chance to repair or recover, and they eventually become damaged or die.  This is what would happen if a muscle remained contracted for weeks or months.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>However, even if the muscle fibers remain contracted for just a few minutes, that's long enough in an effectively ischemic state to cause some damage as well.  It's not enough on it's own to cause any long-term damage, but it can cause some muscle soreness for a short period of time.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple sets of nerves, each with specific functions. One set causes muscles to contract, the other causes them to relax. These two sets work in conjunction with each other to maintain muscle tone, and manage locomotion.</p>
<p>Sometimes the set of nerves that manages relaxation is damaged. Damage can be caused by multiple factors, notably diabetes and chemotherapy. When this happens, it becomes increasingly difficult to get the cramped muscles to &quot;uncramp,&quot; and cramps remain longer and longer.</p>
<p>Long periods of cramping generally lead to muscle damage.</p>
<p>Diabetic and chemotherapy related polyneuropathy are generally irreversible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had a cramp in my calf after working 12 hour shifts, and drinking my fair share of crappy beer. It locked up on me climbing some stairs. Wouldn't release for a few minutes. turned my calf green and black for a week. Had to get crutches. Which I learned are conveniently placed in the back of many drug stores. Hopping through a store isn't as fun as I remembered it as a kid. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
