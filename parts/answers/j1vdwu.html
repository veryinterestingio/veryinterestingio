		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Almost all plants are toxic to some degree, but various animals have evolved different levels of resistance to these toxins in order to allow them to extract the various nutrients found in plants. Exclusive herbivores have great resistance to plant toxins, like the koala which can chow down on highly poisonous eukalyptus leaves all day long, while omnivores, like us, have moderate resistance, and carnivores have little to none. </p>
<p>Onions and garlic are quite toxic, because they are one of the most important parts of the plant, being it's main strategy for reproduction, and to warn of this toxicity they release a pungent odour. We humans, who are quite adept at breaking down this toxin (although some people report gastrointestinal problems after consuming large amounts of raw onion) use this pungent odour to flavour our food; but dogs and cats, being mostly obligate carnivores, have a hard time dealing with the toxins.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;Why&quot; question is always hard to answer, as it is almost philosophical. Dogs, Cats and humans have evolved in different ways, to fill different niches. </p>
<p>Onions produce organosulfur compounds as defensive mechanism, which tend to cause anemia in many animals. That is the reason it is poisonous to many animals. See, for example, <a href="https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1678-91992011000100002&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en" target="_blank">Allium species poisoning in dogs and cats</a> by Salgado et al.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, humans have evolved to be omnivores, with the capability to handle a wide range of foodstuff that are toxic to other animals. The compounds in onions are among the things our digest tract and metabolism can handle well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
