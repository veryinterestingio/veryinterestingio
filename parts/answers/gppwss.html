		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is my area of expertise! The majority of <a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/report_to_nation/infographics/trends_incidence.html" target="_blank">increasing cancers</a> are associated with some kind of exposure. Melanoma is sun exposure. Liver is alcohol, tobacco and hepatitis exposure. Uterine and colorectal (not on the seer list, but for those under 50 it’s seeing a big increase) are obesity. Kidney is smoking and obesity. Oral cavity is HPV exposure and smoking related. </p>
<p>Probably the only cancer that is increasing in the source above that doesn’t have a direct known cause is <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-myeloma/symptoms-causes/syc-20353378" target="_blank">multiple myeloma.</a></p>
<p>This is also a very US centric answer. In <a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21492" target="_blank">other parts of the world</a>, stomach and Kaposi sarcomas are a much bigger problem. They can be caused by Helicobacter pylori and HIV infections.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Ovarian cancer is related to circulating estrogen, and so obesity has to be a factor here when fat cell secretes estrogen. I think that's why, in the UK in particular, as that demographic continues to rise, then so will rates of that specific cancer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Colorectal surgeon here. Although the overall rate of colon cancer is declining, mainly driven by better screening (aka more people getting colonoscopies or other colon cancer screening tests), we are (anecdotally) seeing an alarming increase in colon and rectal cancers in people under the age of 40 and nobody is quite sure why. A lot of us think it may be due to diet but it's not clear. This year alone I have seen three cases of patients in their early 30s with Advanced stage cancers because their PCPs dismissed their complaints of blood in the stool as hemorrhoids without ever doing a work up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thyroid cancer seems to be increasing.  Some researchers think it is simply being “discovered” more often by imaging, but even if you control for the use of ultrasounds, CT scans, and carotid dopplers, there still remains an increase that cannot be accounted for.  Most thyroid cancers are sporadic, but family history and a personal history of neck irradiation are the 2 main risk factors, perhaps contributing up to ~5% of cases, each.  Research is focusing on other possible environmental exposures (eg flame retardants, coal ash), though, so far, not much has been found to be a compelling explanation for this increase.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
