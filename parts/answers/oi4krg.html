<p>For documentaries, wearing white is so people are less 'obvious' on camera &amp; in movies it's a &quot;cool effect&quot; thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are absolutely right. And this is why in my experience most people wear black, red or blue. There are three reasons for wearing white in the arctic. One is for fashion and esthetic reasons, it is of course secondary to survival but sometimes you can get away with a nice fancy white overall. Secondly is for camouflage which is useful for nature documentaries or just for accidental crews in the shot. And the third reason is to use cheap military surplus gear which are white for camouflage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reasons to wear white in the arctic. </p>
<p>1) Camouflage. Military and Nature documentary people wear white to hide better in the arctic. </p>
<p>2) During the summer it is actually possible to overheat inside of your survival suit due to constant sunlight. So you will want to actually reflect a fair portion of the solar heat and maintain body heat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who spent 14 years doing search and rescue in Arctic Canada, I concur.  Maybe not black, but red or yellow, but black is better than white.  Also paint the inside of your boat a bright distinct colour - Something that can be seen from 1000 to 3000 metres altitude.  Always consider your visibility from the air, as thatâ€™s how most of the searching is done in the Arctic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
