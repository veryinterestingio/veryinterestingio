		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Milk likes milk more than it likes air. When a cheerio floats on milk, it has milk in/on it, which attracts* the other milk molecules and pulls them up. You can see the surface of the milk curves up to meet the cheerio.</p>
<p>When you have 2 cheerios, the curved parts like each other more than they like air, so they behave like magnets.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure if &quot;attraction&quot; is the right word here, it's more that the milk is taking the path of least resistance.</li>
</ul>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you look closely at the side of the bowl, you can see that the milk clings to the side of the bowl and climbs up a small amount. The milk clings to the side of the Cheerios as well. Because Cheerios float, they want to be at the highest point of the milk, which happens to be along the edges of the bowl and near other Cheerios where the milk level is slightly higher due to it clinging and climbing. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Isn’t this adhesion and cohesion at work. The same thing that helps water creep up soil and not stay at water level.</p>
<p>Water likes to stick to itself on a small scale. It has to do with the tension held by water droplets and it’s want to absorb into other materials.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because each individual Cheerios piece is meant to sink, but they can’t get through the milk’s surface <em>tension</em> (assuming it’s a dairy milk). Thus, the milk’s surface molecules direct pieces of Cheerios to “stick” to each other.</p>
<p>It’s fluid mechanics/physics at work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
