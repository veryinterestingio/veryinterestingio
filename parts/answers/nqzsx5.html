		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way that most books I've seen describe this scenario, you'd think that this is a question of all of the atoms in your hand and all of the atoms in the table lining up so that nothing collides, thus letting your hand through. That's not really what it means for your hand to phase through something though.</p>
<p>When your hand hits the table, the atoms in your hand and the atoms in the table don't touch. They are repelled by microscopic magnetic fields. These fields are super weak and basically meaningless at any distance that humans can easily imagine. However, magnetism is of course stronger the closer two objects are, and at atomic levels the force suddenly becomes overwhelming.</p>
<p>The magnetic fields involved are determined by the behavior of the electrons in all of these atoms. Electrons don't move like the nice little spinning balls that you see in science videos; thanks to quantum physics, they literally don't have a position unless being directly measured in some way. Instead, they have a zone where they are likely to be, and this zone is what determines electric fields. Even a single atom will nearly always exhibit roughly predictable behavior in it's electron &quot;orbitals&quot;, but in theory strange things such as the field suddenly condensing in one area for a short amount of time could happen. </p>
<p>In order to &quot;phase&quot; through a table, what actually has to line up is the electron orbitals in both your hand and the table. The odds of this happening are not zero, but like it's basically zero. In fact, for any even remotely interesting portion of your hand, the odds of phasing through the table is basically zero. However, if say 10% of your hand were to phase through, the result would not be your hand stuck in the table. However astronomically low the odds were of your hand getting 10% into the table, the odds of the electrons <em>staying</em> that way are so low they make the first part look like the most normal thing in the universe. All of those electrons go back to normal, and suddenly you have an awful lot of magnetic fields very close to one another than absolutely do NOT want to be very close to one another.</p>
<p>The result, pretty simply, would be a decently large explosion.</p>
<p>Edit: I've seen a ton of people tying this to spontaneous combustion. I think most of them are jokes but just so that nobody gets confused, when I say the odds of this happening are low, I mean so low that it is basically certain that this has never happened once in anywhere in the entire history of our universe, and will never happen before the heat death/big rip.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing that's kind of a meta-comment to what I imagine is part of the motivation for your question. When talking about &quot;low probability&quot; in this case (and similar ones), &quot;low&quot; can mean an event so unlikely that it's unlikely to happen even once in the lifetime of our universe. It can even be taken further, and say it's unlikely to happen once in thousands or millions or billions of the universe's lifetimes. That's the scale of probabilities you're talking about here. So to say that something is &quot;more likely&quot; than something else might be technically true, but it could also simply mean that it goes from 1-in-a-billion-universe-lifetimes chance to 1-in-a-million-universe-lifetimes chance. It's still unfathomably unlikely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Macroscopical objects don't behave like quantum objects simply because they're too big for chance to really play a role.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Going against all the other answers here, but pretty sure this is a no. There isn't a probability that your hand gets stuck in the table. This situation is an example of something called quantum tunneling, but scaled up to the real world which is why the probability is so astronomically low. </p>
<p>To explain this we have to think about how much energy is required for your hand to be in a specific place. Above the table and below the table require very little energy, you can obviously rest your hand there and nothing is out of the ordinary. However the point where your hand is inside the table requires an enormous amount of energy, you are never going to have enough regardless of how hard you hit the table. What quantum tunneling does is allow an object (usually a tiny particle) to pass through a state it doesn't have enough energy to exist in, so long as on the other side is a state it does have enough energy to exist in. Even though your hand can't exist inside the table, there is a chance it can pass through anyway.</p>
<p>The reason this happens is because of something called energy-time uncertainty. You might of heard of position-momentum uncertainty, where you can never know exactly where something is and exactly how fast it's moving at the same time. This is the same thing but measuring a change in energy over time. If you know exactly how long the change took you can never know exactly the change in energy that happened.</p>
<p>Because you never know exactly how much energy something has, your hand has a probability that it &quot;thinks&quot; it has enough energy to pass through the table. The complicated thing is conservation of energy still exists, your hand never gains the energy, it just &quot;doesn't know&quot; how much energy it has and it turns out that that is enough to allow it to pass through the table.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
