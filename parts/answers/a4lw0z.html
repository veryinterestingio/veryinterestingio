		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There has been a trend for quite some time (decades) to internationalize safety symbols, to substitute pictographs for words in almost any area with safety as the purpose.  This example is just one of many.  It is really just a recognition of the international mobility of products and people.  Not everyone can read, and not everyone can read that particular language, so road signs, along with chemical hazard identification, labels for power distribution systems, and on and on, have all been standardized so the symbol is the same for anyone, everywhere.  The conversion is more complete in some areas compared to others, but it is happening.</p>
<p>It is a safety thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Switching to symbols makes it easy for signs to be understood, particularly by people with vision problems, people who don't speak english and children. Generally speaking it's just safer this way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
