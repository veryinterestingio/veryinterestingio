		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first thing to cover is that <em>we're less concerned with the concentration (and usually the original concentration doesn't matter) and more concerned with the ratio of parent isotope to child isotope</em>. I.e. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiometric_dating#The_age_equation" target="_blank">age equation</a> that forms the basis for most radiometric dating techniques can be cast in terms of a ratio between parent and child isotopes, so the absolute concentrations are not important as long as we think the material we're dating is homogeneous (i.e. no matter how small an amount of the material we measure, if it's homogeneous, the parent/child isotope ratio will always be the same, and always be a function of the age). The key question that emerges then is not about the concentration of parent isotope, but how do we deal with the presence or absence of child isotope in the material originally (i.e. the D0 in the age equation)? Was there any to begin with, i.e. was D0 non-zero? If so, and we don't account for it, then material would look anomalously old. For this question, there's not a single answer for every radiometric technique, but we can go through a few examples. We'll do radiocarbon first because it's weird and then consider two flavors of how we deal with this in most other radiometric dating techniques.</p>
<p><strong>(1)</strong> For radiocarbon it's a bit unique compared to most other radiometric techniques because it's dating biologic material <em>and</em> we don't deal directly with the parent/child pair. For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating" target="_blank">radiocarbon</a>, we're relying on the presence of radioactive ^(14)C, which is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogenic_nuclide" target="_blank">cosmogenic radioisotope</a> produced in the atmosphere when a neutron (generated by a cosmic ray) hits a ^(14)N. While an organism is alive, it's exchanging carbon with the atmosphere (i.e. it's respiring, or if it's a plant, it's transpiring) and the atmosphere is well mixed so the organism will have the same ratio of ^(14)C to stable ^(12)C as the atmosphere. Once the organism dies, it no longer is exchanging carbon with the atmosphere so now the ^(14)C to ^(12)C ratio is a function of time, i.e. the ^(14)C decays away at a steady rate. We don't look at the ratio of ^(14)C to ^(14)N because there is a ton of ^(14)N already in the organism that has nothing to do with decay of ^(14)C. The main complication with radiocarbon is that the original (atmospheric) ^(14)C to ^(12)C ratio does change through time, but we have used a variety of techniques to develop a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating#Calibration" target="_blank">calibration curve</a> (i.e. the starting ratio as a function of time) so we can correct for this difference.</p>
<p><strong>(2)</strong> Now, turning our attention to radiometric techniques suitable for dating geologic materials (i.e. minerals and rocks), we can look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium%E2%80%93lead_dating" target="_blank">uranium-lead (U-Pb)</a> dating. For a variety of minerals, the radioactive parent isotope (uranium) can effectively substitute in for particular elements within the crystal lattice of the mineral, but because of the different ionic radii, lead cannot. What this means is that when some kinds of crystals form, they have effectively no lead in them, but they do have uranium. If we then later measure the ratio of uranium to lead, this then reflects the age of the crystal, because all of the lead present is a result of radioactive decay. Probably the best example of this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zircon" target="_blank">zircon</a>, ZrSiO4. This is a relatively ubiquitous trace mineral (i.e. it's common in a lot of rocks, but is not a main mineral that forms the rock), is pretty robust in terms of chemical weathering (i.e. they stick around), and most important for our purposes, uranium can substitute for zirconium when a zircon crystallizes from a melt, but lead is generally excluded.</p>
<p>For U-Pb, we have a way to test our assumption as well because there are two long-lived isotopes of uranium, ^(235)U (which decays to ^(207)Pb) and ^(238)U (which decays to ^(206)Pb) that have different half lives. If everything is behaving correctly (i.e. there was no original lead in our crystal and no lead has been lost since crystallization), then the ages calculated from the 235/207 and 238/206 systems should be the same, i.e. <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucfbpve/geotopes/indexch5.html" target="_blank">they will be concordant</a>. If they are not the same, we would refer to them as discordant (and if we have several ages from crystals that experienced the same history, we might be able to work out when they crystallized and when the system was perturbed, see the same lecture notes in the previous link). A single discordant age is not very helpful, but it does tell us that our assumption is not valid and that we should not trust either the 235 or the 238 age for that crystal.</p>
<p><strong>(3)</strong> Finally, for some minerals/rocks and some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiometric_dating" target="_blank">radiometric techniques</a> we cannot assume that there was no child isotope originally. For these, we must either assume a starting parent/child ratio (which in a way is what we're doing for radiocarbon, but there we're not assuming a parent/child ratio, but a parent/to stable isotope of the parent ratio) or correct for the fact that this ratio is unknown. For the latter, we can do this with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isochron_dating" target="_blank">isochrons</a>. Basically, when using isochrons, we measure the parent/child ratio and the ratio of the child isotope to a stable isotope of the child element for a series of crystals (believed to have come from the same magma) and construct an isochron. Here we assume that any crystal that crystallized from that melt may have incorporated an unknown concentration of the child element, but that the original starting ratio of child isotope to other stable isotopes of the child element was the same (i.e. the process of crystallization did not cause the isotopes to &quot;fractionate&quot;, which is usually a safe assumption because when minerals are crystallizing, all of the isotopes of a given element behave nearly the same chemically). Some radiometric techniques are done almost exclusively with isochrons (e.g. Rb-Sr, Lu-Hf, Sm-Nd), but we can use an isochron with virtually any radiometric technique.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> The starting concentration is not usually important, what is important is the starting ratio of radioactive parent to stable child isotope and this ratio at the time of measurement (which is proportional to the age of the material). For most radiometric systems we can either assume that there is no stable child isotope in the crystal when it forms because of chemical differences between the parent and child <strong>or</strong> we can correct for an unknown ratio of parent to child isotope with isochrons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It comes down to the equation being able to be solved by just knowing the current concentration percentage and the decay rate of the isotope - the original amount present cancels out from the calculation.</p>
<p>The equation is P(t) = P(0)*e^(rt), where P(t) is the isotope concentration at time t, P(0) is the initial amount of isotope present in the object/sample, e is the natural base, r is the rate of decay of the isotope, and t is time since the material first formed.</p>
<p>If you measure the present concentration and find that it contains, say, 50% of isotope right now (at time t), the formula becomes:</p>
<p>0.50*P(0) = P(0)*e^(rt)</p>
<p>Then, dividing by P(0), the initial concentration, yields:</p>
<p>0.50 = e^(rt), which can be solved for t if you know the rate of decay, r.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing they've used is old trees.  Tree rings give the year and samples from each ring give the &quot;concentration&quot; that you refer to.  Old bristlecone pine trees that are almost 10,000 years old allow calibration of carbon-14 dating way back into the past.  (If you're near southern CA, you can see these trees in the Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest: highly recommended).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can only really talk about Carbon dating, because that's the one I'm somewhat familiar with. For C14-dating, it kinda works the other way around, you have a known concentration in your sample and you see and which point the decay curve the leads you to that intersects with the known concentration curve of atmospheric C14. To know the past atmospheric C14 concentration, you need things you can date otherwise but that also contain carbon. Wood works very well for that purpose, stalactites/stalagmites or corals can also be used.</p>
<p>Because the atmospheric C14 varies, you can sometimes get different possible date ranges for a certain sample. They will usually be within a few centuries of each other, which makes them either good enough or useless.</p>
<p>Of course, the entire process assumes that the source of the organism's carbon was primarily atmospheric. Aquatic and especially marine organisms can be &quot;depleted&quot; and appear much older than they actually are. It doesn't make it impossible to use C14 on them, you just have to be aware of it.</p>
<p>I'm also vaguely familiar with U-Th dating, used to date speleothems. Thorium, the end product, has the convenient property of not being water-soluble, while Uranium is. So only Uranium gets transported into the speleothems and the initial U-ratio can be assumed to be 100%.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
