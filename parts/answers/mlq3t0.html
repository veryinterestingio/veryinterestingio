		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The speed of electrons in superconductors is not very different from the speed of electrons in ordinary conductors/semiconductors:  it's typically measured in <em>micro</em>meters per second.  So ... very, very slowly.</p>
<p>If this is surprising to you, remember that electrical energy is not in the form of electrons, but rather in the form of electromagnetic waves that are transmitted through the electrons, from electron to electron.  The actual electrical energy moves at roughly the speed of light in whatever material you are working with, even if the electrons themselves don't.  Since electrons are charged, their changing movement is what generates the electromagnetic waves which carry electrical energy.</p>
<p>Hope that helps,</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In any superconductor the free electrons are moving randomly at high speed, with a very small overall tendency to drift down the superconducting wire. The random speed has an energy of roughly the Fermi Energy , which can be several electron volts, leading to average speeds of hundreds of km/s. ON the other hand, the tiny drift is what is responsible for the current. The speed v of this drift is directly proportional to the current I according to the  formula I = e n v A where A is the cross sectional area of the wire,  n is the free electron density, and e is the elementary charge. The free electron density in a superconductor, or any conductor, is quite large, on order n\~10\^23 cm\^-3 (depending on the material), and this makes the drift velocity v very small for reasonable currents. A wire with A = 0.01 cm\^2 and carrying 1 ampere has an electron drift velocity of only 0.006 cm/sec, but the drift increases for increasing currents.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing to remember is that in superconductors, there are two types of electrons. In a superconductor the regular electrons are gapped out, which in short makes them an insulator or semi-conductor. The other electrons that used to be in the gap pair up and form the superconducting condensate, and there is a certain electron density for this condensate. This condensate has a quantum mechanical phase Ï†. When the superconductor carries no current, the phase is the same everywhere. If you apply voltage across superconductor, you &quot;wind up&quot; the phase from one end to the other--quantum mechanically this phase winding corresponds to the momentum and hence the speed. Typically you would apply voltage for a short duration to &quot;accelerate the condensate&quot; to get the needed current, then set the voltage to zero and let the current continue. How fast this phase winds though space corresponds to the momentum, or speed of the electrons--so we can conclude that the speed of the condensate depends on how much current there is. There is a limit, which is the critical current; above this critical current, superconductivity breaks down and you are back to a normal metal (or whatever else it is that superconductor).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
