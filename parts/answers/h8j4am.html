		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That depends on why it's being unresponsive.</p>
<p>Usually, it's unresponsive because some process is blocked or waiting on a resource that it can't access. When you click the close button, or when you force it to close via the task manager, you tell those processes to stop doing whatever they were doing. Since they're no longer waiting on resources, the program becomes responsive again--but since you clicked close, it closes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you click the close button, it sends a high priority signal to the software to release any resources it has. One step in this is to immediately terminate whatever the program was attempting to do. Software appears to respond because it gave up whatever job it was trying to accomplish.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The software is a kid doing a really hard puzzle that he cant figure out, and is completely focused on it.</p>
<p>You are waiting on the kid to finish his puzzle but he just cant, so you tell him to forget the puzzle. He says oh okay, drops the puzzle and gets up to leave.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're clearing a stuck process by killing all processes.</p>
<p>Say you have 4 paper balls you're trying drop through a tube into a basket. </p>
<p>1 goes through fine. </p>
<p>2 goes through fine. </p>
<p>3 gets stuck. </p>
<p>4 sits on top of 3.</p>
<p>I spray gas on the balls and light them on fire.</p>
<p>Ball 3 burns enough to drop through.</p>
<p>Ball 4 goes through fine. </p>
<p>Sadly, all the balls burn to ash.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
