		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When actively recalling information, your brain attempts to block out information that is not relevant to the subject or is obviously not what you're seeking. The information that you subconsciously block out could be what you're looking for. This is why you're able to recall it hours later, the answer isnt &quot;blocked&quot; anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your subconscious brain is always working on things. I call it your &quot;back burner&quot;.  While you go on about your life with your conscious brain, your subconscious brain is like, &quot;Dude, I KNOW this, what the hell? Where is that information?&quot; and your subconscious brain works on it, like digging through boxes in an attic. When it finally finds that information, you get that &quot;AH -HA!&quot; moment.</p>
<p>I use this idea as a teacher to encourage my students to at least read through practice job interview questions, just get them in your brain and your brain will work on answers subconsciously for you and you'll have better answers than if you'd never heard the question. They may not be the best answers, but they'll be better than if you never read them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Brain experts, feel free to correct me.</p>
<p>When you try to remember a thing, your brain energizes pathways towards that memory, like turning on lights as you go through a dark building looking for something. Those lights stay on for a while, even when you stop trying.</p>
<p>As you think about other things, you might light up other pathways, but you might also relight some of the ones from the lost memory, just because they were easy to brighten. And because you are nearby, you might lighten up a new pathway that gets nearer to that memory.</p>
<p>This is like when you are looking for drink machine but can't find it, but then you are nearby looking for the bathroom, and you see the machine out of the corner of your eye. If you hadn't been looking for it before, it might not have registered.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I find it easier to remember things as I lay down before sleep at night. I do this a lot and it works incredibly well for me. Seems much easier to remember things from the past or small details from more recent mundane life events. feels like my brain is a file cabinet in that narrow space of consciousness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
