It means that all the parts last 100 years at least and you are forbidden to use like, a screw that typically falls apart after 25 years or something. In reality lots of parts of it will easily last much longer. A big heavy block of concrete is not going to vanish into dust at midnight of the last day of the 99th year. But saying it's rated for 100 years means every single part lasts that long. Lots could last longer, none were supposed to last shorter.   </p>
<p>It's like that mars rover that was 'meant' to last 3 months then lasted like 5 years. It wasn't really shocking it lasted longer than 3 months, but those three months were &quot;every test we have says this is very likely to last three months guaranteed&quot; to like, some 99% chance or whatever standard they used. Parts then might have a 95% chance to last a year and a 50% to last 10 years, but they can only say it's rated for that three months.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can partly answer this, the engineering side of things I have no clue.</p>
<p>The New Safe Confinement building actually contains a bunch of equipment to dismantle and process what remains of reactor 4. So hopefully in 100 years if the structure breaks down everything will be cleaned up by then. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://chnpp.gov.ua/nbk_e/" target="_blank">official site</a> outlines the disassembly process.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/inside-chernobyl-nuclear-power-plant-conferment-shelter-photo/29583945.html" target="_blank">This site</a> also has some info about what's being used inside.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are going dismantle the old containment building and then clean up what is left of the reactor from what I remember. This process will take a very long time but I doubt longer than the lifespan of the structure. The Wikipedia article on it has some basic information on the plan. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_New_Safe_Confinement#Demolition_of_existing_structures" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl\_New\_Safe\_Confinement#Demolition\_of\_existing\_structures" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl\_New\_Safe\_Confinement#Demolition\_of\_existing\_structures</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've worked in both fabrication and QA roles, and it has driven home the fact that everything you're going to come into contact with on a daily basis is built to a budget.</p>
<p>Quality and Cost are inversely related, and it takes a special kind of demand to let quality run the show, with few concessions to adhering to a budget. </p>
<p>In manufacturing and engineering terms, a 100-year life for a project is extremely quality-focused, equivalent to something like the Eisenhower Dam here in the States. Building codes limit minimums, such as the shortest expected life of a part or weakest welds permissible with a given size, so the 100-year label is just that, a minimum. </p>
<p>Add to this fact that engineering typically incorporates overage and safety-margins and is unlikely to have a system which can collapse from the failure of single smaller components, and the structure will likely be whole, hale, and hardy for a term significantly longer than the 100-years its' constructed for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
