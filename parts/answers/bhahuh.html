<p>when we gain muscle, we're making new muscle cells. when we lose it, we don't lose muscle cells but the individual cells get smaller. its then easier to get back to our peak strength because we don't need to make new cells again, just bulk up the ones we have.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Each muscle has a surface area with muscle nuclei as sort of prison officers. When we train in order for muscle to regrow after it's been torn up, new officers have to be hired because the muscle area will expand so it's too much work for our current guards.  After a while when we stop working out our muscles shrinks overtime but the muscle nuclei never go away. Next time you start training, you don't have to go trough the whole hiring process because the guards are all there and the prison yard can expand more quickly to it's previous size.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So much fail in this thread...</p>
<p>First, some clarification. When strength athletes talk about &quot;muscle memory&quot; they mean STRONGER MUSCLES, period. The are NOT talking about nervous system coordination necessary to perform complex tasks. Their tasks aren't all that complex anyway. They're pushing a damn bar up and lowering it back down.</p>
<p>When muscles get stronger, they do NOT add new muscle cells. They grow their EXISTING muscle cells, cramming more contractile protein into them, along with additional &quot;myonuclei&quot; and associated infrastructure to control the additional contractile protein. Once you HAVE those additional myonuclei, you generally KEEP them for a very long time, even if the contractile protein disappears through lack of use (that protein is metabolically expensive to keep around, so the body won't keep it if it doesn't need it).</p>
<p>Also, the process by which muscle growth occurs requires certain genes to be switched on. Once those genes are switched on, they STAY switched on.</p>
<p>So if you stop training for a while (even a few decades), then go BACK to training, you STILL have the genes switched on, and you STILL have the myonuclei and associated infrastructure ready and waiting.</p>
<p>All you have to do is convince your body to build up the contractile protein again, which isn't necessarily a whole lot of fun, but is FAR easier and quicker the second time around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>“Muscle memory” is a word for a practiced motor function that requires less conscious effort to execute.  To an extent, it represents physical conditioning of the muscle to perform certain repetitive tasks.  (Eg A swimmer’s physique will emphasize different muscles than a bicyclist’s.) However, much of the improvement is in the brain.</p>
<p>When you perform a certain task, your brain has to activate or “recruit” the correct muscles for that task.  People who practice a task over and over get better at it, of course.  A big part of the reason is that your brain gets better at recognizing and repeating a task it has performed many times before.  Ie, it gets better at recruiting the correct muscles for the most efficient movement.</p>
<p>In brain scans, a novice will see more brain activity because they have to put conscious thought and effort into performing the task correctly.  As they gain experience, those same parts of the brain will see less activity.  They no longer have to concentrate and can even perform the action unconsciously.</p>
<p>Research has also shown that it is much easier to re-learn a familiar task than to learn the same task from scratch.  As far as weightlifting or running go, to an extent the answer is: Yes, you could bounce back faster.  If your brain remembers how to perform the motion efficiently, you will likely see better progress than someone performing the exercise for the first time. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>PS... Weightlifters try to maximize efficiency to lift the heaviest weights, and runners try to perfect an efficient running form.  Bodybuilders, however, are not necessarily interested in efficiency.  Experienced bodybuilders might tell you they want deliberately inefficient movements.  A weightlifter doing a power clean is looking for the most efficient and explosive motion.  A bodybuilder is looking for a slower and more thorough repetition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
