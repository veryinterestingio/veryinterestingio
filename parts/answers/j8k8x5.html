		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I thought this would be better understood but the literature surrounding this phenomenon in deciduous vegetation is relatively sparse.</p>
<p>There is a lot of clear evidence that certain genetic pathways are activated during autumn. For example, degradation of chlorophyl explains the color transitions of leaves. Less chlorophyl (i.e. green) means the other pigments become more pronounced. In some cases, certain tree species will produce flavonoids that enhance the altered coloration. The goal here is for the plant to conserve energy (e.g. nitrogen in leaves).</p>

<p>The paper bellow suggests that <strong>the amount of daylight is the major driver of autumn senescence (i.e. plants knowing when it's autumn).</strong> However, they also note that <strong>colder temperatures can expedite the process</strong>. The study focuses on <em>aspens</em> but I would imagine the results could be generalized.</p>

<p>However, this paper below <strong>refutes the claim made above</strong> and suggests that: &quot;Autumn senescence in aspen is <strong>not triggered by day length</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Here is another paper looking at beech trees saying that <strong>temperature is the driver</strong>: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29245174/" target="_blank"><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29245174/" target="_blank">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29245174/</a></a></p>
<p>To me <strong>it seems the question is still up for debate</strong> but I would not be surprised if a combination of both day-length and temperatures were key. This study suggests both factors can become major players depending on the geographic location of a given tree: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4640124/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4640124/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4640124/</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like &quot;how do I know it is <em>NOT</em> Autumn?&quot; - plenty of resources to spare! Abundant sunlight, nutrients and moisture!</p>
<p>Once the resources start to dwindle - it's autumnal. Expect the winter!</p>
<p>Then when the Sun comes back out, the soil warms up and water starts flowing again - the world seems like a great place to get growing!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
