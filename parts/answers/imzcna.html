<li>To alert others to possible danger</li>
<li>To alert others that you need assistance</li>
<li>To discourage your attacker</li>
<li>To stimulate hormone release (e.g adrenaline, endorphins)</li>
</ul>
<p>Many animals have similar alert and distress calls. Some also release specific scents. Even some plants release chemicals when damaged that nearby plants can react to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve only ever experienced pain so severe that I yelled out in pain for what seemed like an eternity. I broke both my radius and ulna snowboarding a little over a year ago and needed surgery to put my wrist back together.</p>
<p>The pain was excruciating to the point where I couldn’t stop crying. I’m not one for tears, but every tiny movement from the top of the slope to the first aid station and then to urgent care was excruciatingly painful. It wasn’t until it was immobilized that I was able to stop crying and rest. Then more crying and pain from surgery and physical therapy. That was a shitty 2 months.</p>
<p>On an entertaining note, when I broke it, the first aid guy asked me to rate my pain on a scale of 1-10. I told him 10. He then said, “WELL, I take it you haven’t had children yet.” I was in too much pain to comment on the sheer offensiveness of what he had said. Ugh.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
