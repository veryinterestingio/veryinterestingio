		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Second year medical student here that just finished my GI block a few weeks ago. </p>
<p>First, the GI tract has its own electrical pacemaker (kind of like the heart) to give your stomach and intestines a rhythm to squeeze to when it needs to. </p>
<p>Second, your body has a way to make sure to sweep up between meals via a thing called the &quot;Migrating Motor Complex.&quot; Kind of like that time in between lunch rush and dinner rush at a restaurant when you tidy up in anticipation.
But imagine the servers get so bored waiting for the dinner rush that they bump up music and cause a ruckus. The squeezing (smooth muscle contraction) of the stomach in particular is what causes the &quot;growling noise&quot; when we're hungry. </p>
<p>Also, just wanted to note that borborygmus is a different noise from the &quot;growling noise&quot; - it's normal digestion sounds in the intestines. It's one of the things we check for on physical exam of someone coming in with abdominal pain to make sure you aren't in acute abdominal distress that requires immediate care.</p>
<p>Edit: Just wanted to say thank you for the hug, kind internet stranger. I actually really needed to wake up to that today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s actually your intestines breaking down food and moving gasses along. They are always making noise, it’s just when the stomach is full you can’t hear it, as the full stomach is smothering the sounds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
