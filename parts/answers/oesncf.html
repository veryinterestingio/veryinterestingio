		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for taking time out of your busy schedule to do this. I didn't have a question but just wanted to say hook em! I graduated from UT with a chemistry degree but I didn't find out how cool you were until near the end of my time there, since I had a friend or two who might have served as your TA at the time or worked with you in some capacity and would have nothing but praise for you. Then, I started seeing more articles and various media about your accomplishments and realized UT was an awesome place to be. Keep up the great work \m/</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
