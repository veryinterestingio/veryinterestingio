<p>You can sometimes make it wake you up if you're focused enough on waking up at that hour while you fall asleep.  This is assuming you're not exhausted enough for the body to ignore your requests.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don’t know if it’s a curse or a blessing, but I have always been able to wake-up about 10mins before my alarm goes off. This happens even if I’ve been traveling through different time zones. I always thought it was due to the anxiety of knowing I have to be up for work or what ever I’m doing that requires me to be up at a certain time. i.e. catching an early flight or having to take my daughter to one of her soccer game...
On occasion I will wake up 20-25 minutes before my alarm which pisses me off because I could be sleeping during that time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You set an alarm to wake you up. There are two possibilities - it wakes you up or you wake up before it. </p>
<p>If it wakes you up you don’t remember it because it just did what it was supposed to - why would you bother remembering something that’s supposed to happen. </p>
<p>If you wake up significantly before the alarm you just go back to sleep. </p>
<p>If it’s only a little bit before the alarm you’re not falling back asleep before the alarm or are and experiencing time smear from light sleeping. </p>
<p>The alarm is eliminating the cases where you’d wake up just after the alarm would have gone off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you ask my wife how many times my alarm has woken her up in the last 20 years she will say less than 10.</p>
<p>Relevant information:   </p>
<p>I get up at different times (job requirements) and always set an alarm.  It only goes off for about 1/3 to 1/4 of the time, and when it does go off it is for less than 2 seconds  98% of the time.
I sleep very well.  I am also a strong dreamer in my sleep.  A lot of my dreams are semi-lucid and almost always know that I am dreaming.</p>
<p>As to how I wake just before my alarm.  I am very aware of my sleep cycle.  The last thing I do before falling asleep is look at the clock and calculate how much sleep I will get.  Be it 4.5 hours, 5.5 hours, or 6.   Only rarely do I get more than 6.5 hours.  By doing this I know how much sleep I am allowed.</p>
<p>I fall asleep in less than a minute.  I wake almost instantly and I have trained myself to get the most out of sleep that I can.</p>
<p>As to how I go t there... It is a long post and if you are really interested, just ask.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
