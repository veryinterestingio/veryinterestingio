		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>R0 is the average of how many people one infected person would spread the disease to in an 100% susceptible population. So very similar to infectivity of a disease, not how many viral particles are needed to infect one person. </p>
<p>Stuff that affects a diseases R0 = how long you can be walking around spreading the disease before you get too sick to leave home, whether it makes you sneeze and cough or not, how well the pathogen can infect your cells (this would be affected by a virus' spike protein binding adherance to human cell receptor like you mentioned), lots of other facts. Also affected by climate (people are more social in different weather), social factors (cities are dense, public transport can be an infection hub, good hygiene reduces spread of disease).</p>
<p>That is why it is quite hard to measure R0 in a real life pandemic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to emphasise what those numbers imply - if each person infects 1.3 people, then a single person will, after 10  transmissions, have infected 1.3^10 = 13.8 people.</p>
<p>If each person infects 2.5 people, then each person will, after 10 transmissions, have infected 2.5^10 = 9,500 people.</p>
<p>If R0 is more like 3, then 3^10 = 59,049 people. That's not a typo - that's the power of exponential growth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s higher than 2.5. More like 3.5-4. Most recorded cases and deaths are much lower than actual. There hasn’t been nearly enough testing to confirm how many people are affected. I wouldn’t be surprise if the actual cases were doubled.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
