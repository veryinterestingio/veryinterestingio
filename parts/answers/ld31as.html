		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>In theory</em>, efficacy is efficacy (in this context; the expected <del>reduction in virus spread</del><em>reduction effect on some criteria associated with the virus</em>), so, being one and the same, it should be perfectly comparable.</p>
<p><strong>But</strong>, as you correctly pointed out, if people use different methods to determine that efficacy, by applying different criteria and essentially define efficacy itself differently (i.e. 'determining all cases' vs 'only determining cases where patients <strong>suffer</strong> from negative consequences of an infection'), then it's not accurate to compare them as they're two different metrics.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to have Oxford rerun their data with the same application of Pfizer's criteria (the reverse might not be possible, since Pfizer inherently excluded data from being gathered), to produce a comparable result (though it's fair to debate which of the methods is more accurate / appropriate).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While the Oxford study collected swabs and picked up asymptomatic patients, those were not included in their efficacy calculations. The paper is linked below. </p>
<p>&quot;The primary efficacy analysis included <strong>symptomatic</strong> COVID-19 in seronegative participants with a nucleic acid amplification test-positive swab more than 14 days after a second dose of vaccine.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You’re 100% on track. Clinical trials are designed with internal validity in mind- how well does this vaccine work versus placebo in this specific study design (endpoint as you’ve mentioned, but also the specific populations which are variable by their inclusion criteria, patients offered enrollment, rates of testing or propensity to utilize acute care, ongoing prevalence of the virus, etc). External comparisons therefore become very challenging. Also, if there’s an interaction between vaccine efficacy with some other characteristic (say, degree of exposure to COVID or emergence of new strains), the comparisons could get impacted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It definitely seems like the bar is variable.</p>
<p>SinoVac for example, was deemed 51% effective because Brazil was very strict about “effectiveness”, so because some people tested positive and had very light symptoms like a headache, those were included against efficacy. Yet Johnson &amp; Johnson’s “66% effectiveness” wasn’t questioned, even though they explicitly said “66% effective against moderate and severe illness”.</p>
<p>The important thing is, not a single vaccine so far has failed to prevent or significantly reduce death and hospitalization, which is the goal</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
