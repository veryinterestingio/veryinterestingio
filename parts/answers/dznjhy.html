		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're just different scales measuring the bore of your weapon (imperial vs metric). To explain; 7.62 mm <em>is</em> 30 calibre. The calibre of a weapon is the diameter of the barrel, and 30 calibre is .30 of an inch across. 0.30 of an inch is 7.62mm. </p>
<p>The different calibers are about range and power. A bigger bullet will go further, faster and harder, but will need more powder to do so. They were standardised when inches were the normal unit. Now, we make new weapons with mm rounds, but the legacy of the old inch based rounds remains.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both of the other answers are correct, but also consider that the caliber doesn't tell you a whole lot in isolation. A bullet's power comes both from how heavy the bullet is and how fast it's moving. So a 7.62 AK bullet is the same caliber as a 30-06 hunting rifle,  but the 30-06 bullet is heavier and has much more gunpowder behind it, so it adds up to radically more power. Therefore, companies do a lot of tweaking the bullet size, shape, weight, against the gunpowder amount and type, which leads to lots of different bullets that look similar but are optimized for different jobs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Guns calibers were mostly standardized in the Imperial system of used when they were first developed.  Even today when a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliber#Metric_and_US_customary" target="_blank">new cartridge</a> is designed the bullet often fits one of the standard calibers.  </p>
<p>Further there are all sorts of different ways to measure a bullet and caliber.  Most measure the barrel diameter, but sometimes this is done in the grooves of the rifling, other times it's done on the lands or raised surfaces of the rifling.  Further some cartridges aren't measuring the projectile diameter, at all.  The famous example is the .44 magnum which is actually .429 diameter.  44 is the diameter of the case walls.  </p>
<p>There are certainly efforts to capture a standard, but most of the time, a wildcatter (independent cartridge R&amp;D) changes a round to meet some need of theirs and other people like the result.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great answers here. To add some of my own views: You're asking two different questions at once. 1) Why the different calibers (bullet diameter), and 2) why the different rounds (ammo). Bullet sizes have been discussed well.  Ammunition size has been touched on but what I have seen is that each has a unique history of how they got there. For example if the round has a rimmed base or not deals with the magazine style. Rimless will fit into a tubular magazine, where rimmed is a lot more awkward, but rimmed cartridges were easier to extract from the gun. Necked rounds give a larger diameter space behind the bullet for more gunpowder. If it were straight walled, the cartridge would be too long and you might have uneven burning problems. Belted rounds are usually because the pressures are so high that you may separate the case between the walls and the base. The extra brass helps the cartridge stay together. Two rounds that I'm somewhat familiar with and love for their stories are the 45-70 and the7mm BR.</p>
<p>45-70 - IIRC this is an OLD west round that was made for reloading in the field. After priming the cartridge (don't ask me how they did that in the frontier, probably used a hammer and a pocket knife) they would literally fill the cartridge flush to the top with what was 70 grains of black powder. Then they would tamp the powder in by shoving the bullet in the neck. It's called a compressed load and it had a good chance of blowing up just because you were pressing the bullet in. (Most rounds have air space between the powder and the bullet)  The reason I love the round is they can throw nearly 1/10 lb of lead down range so slow that you can see it travel but it'll take down whatever it hits. It's just a monster of a round (assuming you don't already own a 50 cal)</p>
<p>7mm Bench Rest - A 7mm round is quite quick and responsive round, on the small side in the groups that I have traveled. But what if you wanted some speed AND knock down power out of it. Well, but a heck of a cartridge behind it. The 7mm BR is made by necking DOWN a 30-06 to 7mm and adding a bit more powder. Think of the energy behind a 30-06, now put that energy behind a little 7mm lightweight bullet. Oh, and by the way, shove all of that into a pistol instead of a rifle. They shoot quick and flat (and a good flame out the end of the pistol!). My exposure to them was through IPSIC and IMSA metal silhouette  shooting, where you can shoot livestock (metal cutouts) without killing any of them. Stand them back up and shoot them again. Fun stuff.</p>
<p>Those are my opinions. Feel free to correct me as you will. It's been fun for me to learn about the history of some of these rounds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ul>
<li>5.56mm = .22 inches (caliber)</li>
<li>7.62mm = .30 inches</li>
<li>9mm = .357 inches</li>
<li>the list can go on...</li>
</ul>
<p>The different sizes are generally because guns were created for specific purposes (war, different kinds of hunting, different firing distances, etc.), made by different manufacturers, or made in different countries. Today, we have access to all of those things due to the global economy, so we are left with lots of different sizes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
