<p><a href="https://blog.petmeds.com/1800petmeds/how-do-cats-know-how-to-use-a-litter-box/" target="_blank">Lone feral cats</a> will naturally cover their waste without any training; they do so to cover the scent from predators and competitors. In groups of feral cats, dominant cats will often leave their feces uncovered as a way of marking their territory, while cats lower in the hierarchy are expected to cover their waste as a sign of subordination. <strong>Since itâ€™s easier to cover their droppings in soft dirt or sand, cats are naturally attracted to this material.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.livescience.com/33147-why-do-cats-bury-their-poop.html" target="_blank">The act of meticulously</a> burying their waste stems from cats' long history of using urine and feces to mark their territory. Cat poop may all smell the same to us, but cats can tell their waste apart from another's thanks to unique chemical scent markers called pheromones, which are present in their urine and feces.</p>
<p>Wild cats will also hide their waste to avoid attracting unwanted attention from predators to themselves or their nest of kittens . Domesticated indoor cats (Felis catus) harbor the same strong, self-protecting instincts. Even though there are no predators in your home, your cat may not be so sure, and will bury its waste just in case.</p>

<p>Basically, the litter box will be the only thing with soft, pliable material for them to dig in in your house. It's also why they sometimes target planters or other pots. After the first time they'll essentially have marked the litter box and make a habit out of it, since they're inherently territorial. Cats are borderline domesticated, so their wild instincts are still rough around the edges. And as posted, they're meticulous and fixated on staying clean.</p>
<p>It's also why you should usually get 1 litter box per cat, and why cats won't simply shit on tiles when they have dirt nearby. Now there's the question of how crazy your own cat can be. Also, what the hell happened to all the posts?</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5059607/" target="_blank">Here's an extensive study covering various issues</a> cats might have to deal with. Note where it mentions cats who are able to go outside have significantly less troubles than purely indoor cats. Also spay and neuter them that's just basic</p>
<p>Edit 2: Holy crap clean your cats litter boxes OFTEN</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/toxoplasmosis" target="_blank">Toxoplasmosis can be Deadly</a> or cause serious birth defects for a fetus if the mother becomes infected. This is why doctors recommend against pregnant woman scooping or cleaning cat litter boxes.</p>

<p>Edit 3: if your cat shits right outside the box it's crazy. Cats are crazy. They're just...<a href="https://www.vet.cornell.edu/departments-centers-and-institutes/cornell-feline-health-center/health-information/feline-health-topics/neurological-disorders" target="_blank">as crazy as people if not more</a>. Also they're basically <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/scientists-confirm-cats-are-pretty-smart-b-dont-really-care-what-you-want-180951194/" target="_blank">psychopaths</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
