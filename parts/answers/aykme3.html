		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This article (<a href="https://www.zooportraits.com/animals-give-birth-twins/amp/#Twins_in_the_animal_kingdom" target="_blank">https://www.zooportraits.com/animals-give-birth-twins/amp/#Twins_in_the_animal_kingdom</a>) does an okay job at summarizing, and misses some points along the way, but yes, theoretically.
Identical twins are born when one fertilized egg separates to form two embryos. That can happen with any animal (though, I would predict more commonly with internally fertilizing?). Fraternal twins form when two eggs are fertilized at the same time. Basically, identical twins are 100% genetically alike (ignoring epigenetics(, and fraternal twins are 50% alike (again, ignoring epigenetics)
Also worth mentioning there are loads of organisms which go though various forms of asexual reproduction, which forms 100% genetically alike offspring but aren't technically twins. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To further this - are babies born from animals that have litters classed as twins? </p>
<p>For example: do multiple eggs get fertilised when a cat becomes pregnant? If so, is there a way to tell if two of the cats have come from one fertilised egg?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
