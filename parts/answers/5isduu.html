		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't specific to engineering students.  This is common in a <em>lot</em> of university level classes.  It's called &quot;grading on a curve&quot;.  </p>
<p>The idea behind it is that, if an exam is too easy, several of the top students might all get 100% (or close to it), making it impossible to tell how they actually compare to one another.  But if you make the test hard enough that you see some separation in your top students, it becomes so hard that the students who are just average are now getting failing grades.</p>
<p>So what you do is make the exam super hard, and then scale the grades so that they fit a bell curve, with a C grade being the middle of the curve (i.e. the average grade).  That way, the students are still all assigned fair grades that represent how far removed from the average they are, but the top students can be properly evaluated at the same time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Engineer here. Read OP's concern about &quot;how do we trust engineers who got that low to make thing that don't kill us&quot;. Several things going on here, so one at a time:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Understand that the bottom surgeon of the class is ALSO still allowed to open up your heart. C's get degrees is applicable in all fields, it just matters far less in Philosophy or History. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the top comment (atm) states, make an exam easy and everyone aces it, so now everyone has an A. So everyone completely and 100% understood the material? Hardly. This is engineering we're talking about here. Not communications. Making the exam the &quot;right&quot; amount of difficult is an art form that some have yet to master. In college I had classes where the first exam had an average of 90, the second one 30, and the final somewhere in between.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The REAL issue comes when the grades are spread out. Aka &quot;wrecking the curve&quot;. It's an issue because now (as the grader) you don't know what to think. You have to look at it statistically: did one person just get lucky? Did several? Was it worded in a way that tripped people up? Did everyone in fact fail or is this one person an anomaly? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engineering exams are typicall 2-4 questions. That's it. It typically takes the entire time for the majority of students. Questions are complex. You're not getting simple questions here, you're presented with a situation where you need to apply what you've learned in the class to solve it. Typically there are many parts to each question and they build on one another:  Solve for the force here. Now, using that force, how far is the beam deflecting. Knowing that, will it fail? Etc. So now let's say you got part a wrong, but followed the proper calcs in part b. You still have the wrong answer, because you were already wrong at the beginning of the problem. Partial credit is going to save your ass here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the &quot;real world&quot; companies don't just let you throw products out there. They're tested. And re-tested. If it's a one-off like a bridge, somewhere, someone very very smart has signed off on it. This means that they have literally said &quot;if this fails I take full responsibility- legally speaking&quot;. If it's something above your company or if they simply don't want the liability, they'll send the drawings out to have them signed off on by any number of PEs out there. (PE is essentially the highest level of engineer, requiring a licensing, exam, and apprenticeship program) </p>
</li>
<li>Engineers are problen solvers. Half of what we do in a daily basis is use what we learned to apply to a situation we've never seen before. Your education was meant more to expose you to what's out there and build on how to approach a solution. This last month I came across a problem that could be solved by using strain gauges. I recalled using them in college, but that was it. Just that they existed and what their purpose was. So to google I went. Refreshed my memory, found the equations I needed, and I was off. </li>
</ol>
<p>So does this mean that all engineers are equal because of the curve that allowed them to graduate with a 30% average? Not even close. Grades in engineering are still just as good of an indicator of who understood the material as they are in any other degree- because the curve took the one person with a 47 to an &quot;A&quot; just as if the average had been an 80 and they still got 17 points higher than everyone else. I have worked with engineers over the years that retook classes 2-3 times before passing them and I've worked with straight A students. It's obvious which are which. Painfully obvious. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a practicing engineer I will give my $.02. Typically on a 50 minute exam a student will be given a set of problems that exceed in difficulty any homework or practice problems given. The equivalent amount of work would typically take around 2-3 hours to lookup solve and verify. Add to this that these problems have compound errors, so one wrong number can create wrong numbers throughout the rest of the problem. As a working engineer I do not focus on 8 different areas of expertise per year (typical different classes in a year). For the first few years i had an &quot;apprenticeship&quot; of sorts in which I spent a lot of time on a narrow scope of problems becoming a SME (subject matter expert).</p>
<p>Tldr;  Engineering school gives you a foundation in which you learn a language of communication with other engineers, prove dedication and intellingence, in order to be trained as an engineer.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's because the material extremely challenging. It is common for profs to substitute the exam average as a C. Because a C is seen as average. So if they class has an average of 40 percent, not uncommon, the grade will be curved 30 percent. </p>
<p>I'm waiting on my grades for a my class where a 56% was a B- 😒 shitty prof he was.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just finished up my finals for my second to last semester of ME today, so I'll throw in with what everyone else is saying - limited time, no/limited references, and harder than average stuff.  For example, today one of the questions on my capstone final was the <a href="http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~qiao/courses/cs4xo3/presentations/InvPend.pdf" target="_blank">full derivation of an inverted pendulum controller starting from the equations of motion</a> (that's only the first half in the slides).  No reference sheets, not even a calculator, and this was from a derivation we only did once as a part of four week lab project.  Those conditions don't exist in the real world, we get to have our library (engineers typically keep all their ridiculously expensive textbooks), can talk to other people, get help, google stuff, etc.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
