		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not immediately, all objects in orbit are tracked by NORAD.  Provided it's not military you can as a private citizen ask for it's orbit details.</p>
<p>Debris in orbit can absolutely become a problem as you describe.  Eventually with enough objects up there any collision could result in a perpetual chain reaction that leaves us locked in.  The term for this (theoretical) state is &quot;Kessler Syndrome&quot;</p>
<p>We currently track objects right down to paint flakes and bits of re-entry insulation, our slowly growing debris field is under close scrutiny.  If it returns radar we track it, it's all moving at several kilometers a second, so no debris is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Edit:. Since this ended on top I'll correct a few things based on other comments.  Radar tracks down to about 10cm.  Smaller stuff we use predictive models for.  Extra research after my comment provided two numbers.  We have about 6,000 satellites of which 60% are dead, we are aware of about 600,000 objects total including debris from anti-sat tests and exploded upper stages (mostly Deltas)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The diameter of Earth is about 7900 miles, giving Earth a rough surface area of 196M miles. Adding 1000 miles to that doesn't seem like much, but it changes the area of the resulting orbital sphere to 307M miles, about 1.5 times as much, just as a frame of reference (the Earth's surface is huge, but LEO is even bigger).</p>
<p>Divide that by 20,000 satellites, and you get 1 satellite for every 15,350 square miles. It would take a lot of launches to have even a 1 in a million chance of any of them colliding, even if they were just launching randomly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Earth is big. Even with ten thousand satellites, there will still be gaps between satellites of a couple hundred kilometers. Further, groups of satellites are arranged so you might have a bunch of satellites in nearly the same orbit, just following one after another. This means there are gaps between those orbital planes without any satellites.</p>
<p>There are already about 20,000 objects that are big enough to track.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
