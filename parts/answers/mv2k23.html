		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have two kinds of vision. The retina at the back of your eyeball has to kinds of light receptors: cones that see color in bright light, and rods that see black-gray-white in dark conditions.</p>
<p>The very center of your vision is almost entirely cones to give you very good image quality for whatever you're looking at. However, your cones only work for bright light. When it's dark, you have a sort of &quot;blind spot&quot; right in the middle of your vision because you have very few rods there.</p>
<p>Airplane pilots are taught specifically to use &quot;averted vision&quot; at night. Whatever they want to see, they look off to the side so that they can see it with their rods. You've just discovered this technique. :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have different zones in your eye that are specialized for different things. The spot dead-center of your vision is highly optimized for fine detail, but at the expense of being able to see very faint differences in brightness. Your peripheral vision however is the opposite. It's more sensitive to changes in brightness, but quickly loses the ability to differentiate fine detail. </p>
<p>The same principle also works for motion, and color. The very edges of your vision can perceive motion fairly well (to spot predators/prey/threats, etc) but is essentially black-and-white vision.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your peripheral vision is better in low light than the vision in the centre of your eye. This is often used by stargazers to observe dim objects by looking just to the side of them (Averted Vision).
Your eye has two main classes of light detecting cells, rods and cones. Cones can differentiate colour and are high resolution, rods only detect intensity of light. The spot in the eye corresponding to the centre of your vision (the fovea) is almost entirely cone cells, giving you very good colour and spatial resolution in the centre of your vision. But there aren’t many rods so it is less sensitive to low light, meanwhile the peripheral vision is mostly rod cells so doesn’t actually see colour and has very low resolution, but is much better at detecting low amounts of light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an old astronomy trick.. you can see stars easier in your peripheral vision than looking straight on. Your peripheral vision is lower resolution, but more sensitive to light and movement,.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Btw, this effect is often used in observational astronomy. When looking at faint objects directly it is advised to train the periferal vision, this way observed object appears brighter and reveals more details. Sometimes it's even impossible to spot the object while looking directly, but when you look slighly off to the side it becomes visible. It is hard at first but then gets better, since it's kind of counterintuitive for our brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
