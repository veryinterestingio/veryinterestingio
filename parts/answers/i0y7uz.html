		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol is a solvent that can dissolve the plasma membrane of viruses and bacteria which is made from phospholipids. It can also denature proteins and further dissolve the contents of the virus. When the membrane dissolves, the virus stops existing. In labs our disinfecting alcohol sprays are 70:30 alcohol to water. The water helps the alcohol better dissolve and penetrate through the plasma membrane, so it makes it more effective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few additions I wanna make to the other comments. Viruses are not living or dead, should be thought of as infectious particles. Many viruses, including SARS-Cov 2, have an envelope. The envelope can be destroyed by alcohol. This doesn’t “kill” them, but they can’t get inside your cells and replicate. 70% alcohol sanitizer is ideal. The alcohol must be strong but higher then 70% will evaporate before it can be effective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Be aware that there are some it doesn't kill. The one that always worries me is c-diff, which causes diarrhoea. Having worked with patients with c-diff, you are always reminded not to use alcohol hand solution, but to use soap and water!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing to note which I feel a lot of people forget is that a virus isn't &quot;alive&quot; per se. In fact, it's barely an organism at all. It has a genetic code, yes, but that's about everything which theoretically could classify it as being alive. Therefore, killing a virus doesnt quite mean the same thing as, say, killing a bacteria or a more complex organism.</p>
<p>So when speaking of killing a virus, it's more like stopping its method of further genetic spreading, be that by denaturalising the genes themselves, or by stopping the mechanism of the virus by which it spreads them, like by solving its shell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add on to what others have said, I’ll give a quick and dirty chemistry lesson. There are 2 classifications of molecules, <strong>polar</strong> (e.g. water) and <strong>nonpolar</strong> (e.g. oil). You know that oil and water don’t mix, that’s because “like dissolves like” or rather “like mixes with like” and polar and nonpolar do not mix. The membranes of cells and viral envelopes are made of molecules called phospholipids, which have both polar and nonpolar properties (for more info read about the <a href="https://flexbooks.ck12.org/cbook/ck-12-biology-flexbook-2.0/section/2.3/primary/lesson/phospholipid-bilayers-bio" target="_blank">Phospholipid Bilayer</a>). You know what also has both polar and nonpolar properties? Alcohol! So alcohol is able to “mix” with the membrane molecules, therefore tearing it apart and destroying the arrangement of the phospholipids. Another great molecule that does the same thing is soap!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
