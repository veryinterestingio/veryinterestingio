		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In order to recover from an injury like a broken leg, the horse would have to stay immobile, laying down, for a long period of time.  Horses are bred to be active animals.  By their own will, they would never stay idle long enough to recover.  Because they would refuse to take it easy, there is a good chance they wouldn't properly recover, and would be in constant pain.</p>
<p>You would have to tranquilize the horse for months in order to have it fully recover, which is not a practical solution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, it really depends on the injury, but most times they are euthanized because of subsequent problems due to the injury. Broken legs are notoriously difficult to manage because of the unique structure of a horse's leg. They bear an incredible amount of weight, especially on the forelimbs, and they are prone to something called laminitis (which is inflammation of the laminae, a structure that suspends their toe within the hoof.) If a horse gets a break in their leg, their weight-bearing is altered and they usually get support-limb laminitis in the opposite limb due to this. While we can try to minimize this with slings, supporting their weight, and medical treatment, it's usually either not enough or there are financial limitations. It then turns into a vicious cycle; they don't want to put weight on the laminitic leg and so resort to bearing it on their injured leg, which can either exacerbate the injury or lead to laminitis in that leg as well. There are some fractures that are extremely difficult or impossible to fix and humane euthanasia is the best option, whether that be the type of fracture (one in multiple pieces or protruding through the skin) or location (such as shoulder or femur.)</p>
<p>There are other injuries, such as rupturing a tendon or ligament, that are either irreparable (depending on what ruptures) or lead to the above scenario of support-limb laminitis.</p>
<p>While laminitis is treatable if caught quickly, it takes a very long time for the hoof to completely recover from it (about a year.) Also unfortunately for horses, just about anything can cause laminitis (eating too much grain, colic, or systemic illnesses that cause fever and inflammation.)</p>
<p>That being said, many horses sustain injuries or fall sick and are treated and recover, but it really depends on the injury/disease, access to vet care, and commitment of the owner.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A number of factors. The first being that horses are really heavy and are unable to stand on the other three legs for the long periods of time needed to heal a broken bone. There are lots of really nasty things that happen when the other three legs are overly strained trying to support the full weight. You're likely to permanently, catastrophically damage another leg trying to heal the break. Another factor is that horses are fairly delicate animals. Being that large, they are incredibly strong so it's very very easy for them to injure themselves. Horses are like a bull in a china shop, except their bodies are the china ship. </p>
<p>As mentioned by others, horses do not do well lying down for long periods of time; their bodies are built to stand up. It would be sort of like you lying flat with your shoulders flat on the ground, but your lower body kicked up, doubled over so your toes were above your head, touching the ground. You can do that pose, and it might even feen good to stretch like that for a bit, but you are not physiologically built to live like that exclusively for months on end. Another aspect of this is that the way a horse's chest, abdomin and organs are situated, a sling isn't really possible for taking weight off the other three feet. Their size alone makes this a doubly difficult problem as we aren't talking about a 12 lb house cat. Casting is equally difficult as you need to stabilize a fracture, transfer a quarter of the weight of the horse and do it Ina way that doesn't cause huge sores from rubbing, all while the animal is living in barnyard levels of dirt. </p>
<p>All of these factors add up to an extremely poor prognosis for large fractures in horses. Trying to do this causes the animal to exist in huge amounts of pain and pain management becomes prohibitively expensive when the animal needs 10x the dose of a human, not to mention the cost of other treatment options. In the end, the horse is extremely likely die anyway, just after months of living in agony. The humane thing to do is to put the animal down and spare it the suffering.</p>
