		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The atmosphere squeezes the exhaust plume. Those engines are calibrated to provide straight exhaust at a higher altitude. As you go higher up, ambient air pressure drops. So if you want a straight exhaust plume at higher altitude, that means the exhaust plume's pressure must be equal to the ambient air pressure. </p>
<p>What this results in is that in lower altitudes, the exhaust plume gets squeezed as it is lower pressure than the surrounding air</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bernoulli’s principle isn’t really applying as the gas is supersonic coming out of the converging- diverging nozzle - <a href="https://youtu.be/p8e8A3sdVOg" target="_blank">This</a> is a good primer on converging-diverging nozzles and what is happening</p>
<p>In this particular case there’s an oblique shockwave that compresses the gas back down  until you get a Mach disc (or shock diamond) and then the shockwave rebounds and the fluid expands and then goes back inwards and so on. In this photo of the plume, you can see the Mach Discs as the brighter white horizontal lines where the hot gas is compressed and becomes even hotter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A nozzle expands exhaust and at the exit of the nozzle the exhaust is actually at or just below atmospheric pressure (for efficiency purposes this is great because all of the mass flow is directed directly behind the rocket in as straight of a line as possible). The atmospheric pressure actually squeezes the exhaust gasses causing this narrowing effect. When you see Mach diamonds on rocket exhaust (A good example is Space Shuttle Main Engines) the effect is caused by the atmospheric pressure squeezing the exhaust plume so much that it is then redirected outward, then squeezed back again, forming the diamond visual effect you can see with the naked eye.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
