		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5:  There is a part of the middle of your brain that makes you stressed, CBD acts to tell this part of the brain to not work as well.</p>
<p>CBD is purified from plants that produce a lot of it, it looks very similar to chemicals that are found naturally in our own bodies. Plants are the best chemists in the world!</p>
<p>Some of the plentiful literature about CBD being upstream of the HPA axis:
Barna, Istv√°n, et al. &quot;The role of endogenous cannabinoids in the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis regulation: in vivo and in vitro studies in CB1 receptor knockout mice.&quot; Life sciences 75.24 (2004): 2959-2970.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm interested in CBD oil but what keeps me from buying it is all the fake shit out there.</p>
<p>I can't seem to get a definitive brand to purchase as some will call others fakes etc</p>
