		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Half life is the time it takes for HALF the material to degrade into the lower element.</p>
<p>This isn't a alarm clock situation where once the time is up, half the material instantaneously turn into a different material. it happens over time, and we can measure the very very tiny amount to extrapolate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The same way that your car can tell that you're going 60 mph without having driven 60 miles or having waited an hour. You can draw a trend line through incomplete data and know the overall rate that decay is occurring in your sample.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
