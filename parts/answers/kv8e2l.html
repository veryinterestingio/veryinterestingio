A gear is a cogwheel used to mesh with another cogwheel. And a sprocket is a cogwheel that links to another cogwheel by means of a chain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A cog is a tooth on a wheel.  When two cogwheels mesh with each other, they are called gears.  When a cogwheel works with a chain (and some sorts of toothed belts), it's called a sprocket.  The remaining applications that use cogs may only have one or two on a wheel, so that the interaction is intermittent, or involve other mechanisms like a ratchet or track.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since it’s been explained already, the way I like to think of it as a gamer is: In the game Gears of War each solider is called a cog and as a team they’re called gears, which is actually a pretty good analogy. Basically gears are made of cogs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
