		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People were not subsisting on hard alcohol back then. They were drinking rather dilute beverages. Ciders and beers have very low alcohol content and they do not dehydrate you when you drink them. In wine growing regions like the Mediterranean, the wine was diluted with water.</p>
<p>Plus, when you consume alcohol all day, every day, your body grows accustomed to breaking it down; the liver produce more of the enzymes needed to metabolize it snd the kidneys adjust to keep the body in tonic equilibrium.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The idea medieval people didnt have access to clean water is a myth.</p>
<p>They weren't stupid and knew what sources were safe and which weren't. They also knew boiling water made it safe, even though they didn't understand why.</p>
<p>Yes, alcohol was widely consumed and ale was safe because the distillation process involved boiling but people drank it because they liked to get drunk.</p>
<p>People generally drank water from springs, wells, clean rivers etc if they were thirsty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
