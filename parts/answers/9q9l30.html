		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ooh something I can answer. I work in a government microbiology lab that actually tests meat samples for contaminants. </p>
<p>Some meats like chicken, have salmonella in their microbiome (salmonella is naturally growing on and in live chickens). So we always cook that meat thoroughly to kill any salmonella.</p>
<p>Beef is a bit different. There shouldn’t be anything harmful in terms of bacteria on the outside of the beef, but their gut can have some nasties (and some of these nasties are antibiotic resistant due to modern farming practices), so as long as the beef is a clean cut (ex: steak) and didn’t come in contact with any part of their digestive system, it should be fine to eat not fully cooked. Ground beef, however, is often contaminated during the grinding process, and can come in contact with part of the cows digestive system. So we need to cook it through to make sure it’s safe and free from any pathogenic or antibiotic resistant bacteria. </p>
<p>There are also some foods like seafood that people do take a risk by eating raw, such as oysters and fish. It is a risk eating them undercooked and I personally do not eat them unless fully cooked for that reason. </p>
<p>Edit: I can’t speak on the policies/quality of meats in other countries, sorry! I’m only familiar with practices in Canada &amp; the USA </p>
<p>Edit2: OMG thanks for my first gold! ? can I interest you in paying my tuition next? ?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's all about the parasites and bacteria that can be found in it</p>
<p>Chickens carry salmonella naturally in their gut so there's a chance your meat could have been exposed to it</p>
<p>Pigs have Trichinella Spiralis worms in their meat. If you don't cook the pork thoroughly they will give you Trichinosis</p>
<p>Beef doesn't really have anything you'd expect to find in the meet. If you sear the outside of the steak you'll kill anything random that got on the surface and the middle was fine to begin with. Ground beef has no sealed middle, it's all surface so we cook it a bit more thoroughly but you can still have it relatively raw</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the part of Germany I’m living in, it’s common to eat raw pork on bread. It’s called Mett. EU law requires testing of all animals for those bacteria so the meat doesn’t have them. Actually IIRC all cases of illness from those worms in the last decade is from eating large game meats or horse. (In Germany at least) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
