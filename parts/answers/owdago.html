		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think this is because of something known as &quot;rete mirabile&quot; that I learned from a podcast on Birds</p>
<p>This is basically a characteristic for birds to minimize heat loss. The arteries that transport warm blood into the bird's legs are near the veins that return &quot;colder blood&quot; to the bird's heart. </p>
<p>By standing on one leg (1 foot tucked up) a bird reduces by half the amount of heat lost through its bare limbs. </p>
<p>different reasons would be simpler things like Muscle fatigue, comfort, or maybe it's just sleeping</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the veins also cool the arteries, the bird's feet are closer to environmental temperature and thus don't lose as much heat as they would if they were at body temperature. And by standing on one leg, a bird reduces by half the amount of heat lost through unfeathered limbs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Because this is one of my all-time favorite jokes:</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why do flamingos stand on one leg?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Because, if they picked up the other leg they would fall down!</p>
<p>I may or may not be an actual dad, but that has been in my repertoire for, oh, 30-40 years now...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Flamingos stand on one legs due to them often feeding in soda lakes and the toxic nature of the water. Soda lakes are normally formed from volcanic craters or rift valleys which are filled with water and rich in sodium carbonate and other chemicals. The lakes are toxic to many animals, but algae, brine shrimps and flamingos can thrive in the conditions. -  <a href="https://youtu.be/j20XEOlUf5Q" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/j20XEOlUf5Q</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another thought unrelated to the other options.</p>
<p>Humans also stand on one foot.  I do it all the time.  I tuck my leg behind my knee and lean.  Or one puts one leg against the wall and then trades off.</p>
<p>It could be just something that increases comfort so that one leg gets to rest for a bit.  Plus the keeping warm thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
