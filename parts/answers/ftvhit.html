		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>SARS-CoV-2 is worse than SARS-CoV because, paradoxically, it’s not as bad. SARS tended to have a faster disease onset and be more severe, so you had far fewer infectious people with mild or no symptoms walking around spreading the disease. In fact much of SARS spread was in hospitals, rather than on the street.  That made it relatively simple to identify and isolate potential spreaders. SARS-CoV-2, on the other hand, has many people spreading it who are not sick and who don’t isolate. </p>
<p>Even so, SARS was just barely controlled. People are complacent today, but SARS came much closer to being a pandemic than most people realize.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The symptoms of SARS was much more severe compared to COVID and was much easier to spot and contain.</p>
<p>Also Available information suggests that persons with SARS are most likely to be contagious only when they have symptoms, such as fever or cough. While SARS-CoV2(covid) can spread while asymptomatic</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 bind to. The (S) spike glycoprotein that binds to ACE2 is slightly different in both viruses and this results in different binding affinities.</p>
<p>&quot;Recent studies have found that the modified S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a significantly higher affinity for ACE2 and is 10- to 20-fold more likely to bind to ACE2 in human cells than the S protein of the previous SARS-CoV. This increase in affinity may enable easier person-to-person spread of the virus and thus contribute to a higher estimated R0 for SARS-CoV-2 than the previous SARS virus.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand, the biggest issue with SARS-CoV-2 is the fact that a-symptomatic people can spread it, unlike SARS-CoV which was only really contagious once the symptoms started to show.</p>
<p>Same with Ebola. It's insanely deadly (and contagious), but would only become contagious once the symptoms started to show</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In many cases SARS became infectious only when the person became seriously ill, BUT because of its high mortality rate, people mostly died before it could spread. Also because it only became infectious when you became seriously ill, we were able to contain it quickly in isolating those people that did get sick so they wouldn't be able to spread the virus. </p>
<p>With COVID-19, many people are asymptomatic, don't know they have the virus, and can easily spread it like wildfire. Thus why COVID-19 has spread to millions of people, and has spread to 6/7 continents, while SARS only infected less than 10,000 people</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
