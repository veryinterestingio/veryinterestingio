		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dopamine and serotonin don't cross the blood brain barrier, so ingesting them won't do anything. They do things outside of the brain though, and it turns out those things are pretty much always bad if no carefully and properly dosed. It's the same reason why you can't buy many other drugs OTC. Melatonin on the other hand is pretty benign. It's pretty much impossible to overdose. If you take too much, you'll just be excessively tired, irritable, and have a headache.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our brains have a special blood brain barrier (BBB) which prevents things from the blood from getting into the brain - for safety. It helps protect the brain from getting an infection. This is SUPER important, because neither our immune system (antibodies) nor antibiotics can pass through the BBB to kill the infection in the brain.</p>
<p>Neurotransmitters - like serotonin and dopamine cannot pass the BBB. However, serotonin's precursor tryptophan can pass! The brain then safely transforms tryptophan into serotonin.</p>
<p>Foods that are high in tryptophan: meat, eggs, spirulina/seaweed, spinach, bananas, pumpkin seeds, and sesame seeds.</p>
<p>Our brains also have a bff, the gut! They're constantly communicating back and forth (gut-brain-axis). The American Psychological Association suggests that the gut produces about 95% of the body's supply of serotonin! When these buddies are out of sync we may experience anxiety, depression, digestive problems and/or bowel problems. Some gastroenterologists prescribe certain antidepressants to treat IBS! One of the best things that we can do to support our brain is to support our gut - healthy digestion ftw! So instead of throwing your money away on that alluring &quot;OTC 5HTP&quot; supplement at your local drugstore eat healthier foods, drink more water, etc. You know the drill.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what others said, it doesn’t cross the blood brain barrier, so you need to get it from stimulants that tell your body to make it. And popping Adderall isn’t legal because stimulant abuse is dangerous.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because dopamine and serotonin won't really cross the BBB. You actually can get the precursor to serotonin, 5-hydroxytryptophan, as a supplement. L-DOPA would be the equivalent for dopamine, and while L-DOPA itself is usually regulated as a medicine, you can get plant extracts containing it OTC. That said, L-DOPA supplementation isn't a great idea unless you want a lot of motor side effects with little benefit (unless you've got parkinson's or something ofc).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
