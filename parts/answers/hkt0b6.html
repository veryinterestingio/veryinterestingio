		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To judge the accuracy and effectiveness of individual models you would have to look at what the models predicted over the past few months and how the predictions fared compared to the reality. If you (or someone with time and data) did this then you could get a sense for how far ahead each model was accurate.</p>
<p>Almost all models will be accurate for 1-3 days into the future. It's the 4-30 days into the future that are tricky. You could judge how good a model is based on how many days on average its forecasts were in agreement with the actual numbers. A better model might be accurate 7 or 8 days out. While a less accurate model would only be accurate 3-4 days out. Really good models could get 15+ days out with accuracy. Special shocks (changes in social distancing and shutdowns) will throw most of them off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is going to be very difficult to diss out any time soon. All the models are based on different underlying assumptions. Like one is assuming we do basically nothing while another is assuming that we did everything in our power. The truth is varied across the country. So you’ll probably be seeing different authors arguing that if you adjust certain parameters to match reality then their model is clearly superior. The other problem is that models predict real numbers, not detected numbers. And our detected numbers are badly off. Texas is likely underreporting deaths by as much as 10x. So it’s going to be a very long time before we have anything reliable to compare model results to, unfortunately.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>tldr:  A good forecasting tool allows us to play out &quot;what if?&quot; scenarios and it includes feedback on recent forecasts to fine tune the next projection.</p>
<p>I have built budgeting and forecasting applications for large corporations for the last twenty-plus years. These are the tools that finance teams use to predict business conditions and set a course for the future.  </p>
<p>Watch the local weather forecast on TV tonight.  They all follow the same basic pattern.  First they talk about things that already happened.  They can be extremely specific.  &quot;This afternoon at 4 o'clock at the city airport, the wind was from the ... and the temperature hit a high of ...&quot; The meteorologist will next talk about what will probably happen tomorrow and for the next few days.  They will get more general and talk about what we call &quot;drivers&quot;.  &quot;A cold front will move through the region in the morning.  As it comes through you can expect temperatures to drop and unstable conditions with showers and high winds...&quot;  </p>
<p>What the weatherman won't do:  1) What If? scenarios and 2) variance reporting. We cannot control tomorrow's weather, so there's really no need to model any options.  (Yes, weather models include &quot;ensembles&quot; of forecasts with slight differences in starting conditions, but that's a different issue.). If they did variance reporting, we'd get something like &quot;Yesterday we predicted <wind>, <precipitation>, and <temperature range> and our the actual weather was different by ...&quot;  That's not happening.  </p>
<p>In business forecasting systems, we do both.  First, we provide the capability to play out &quot;what if?&quot; scenarios.  Many of the &quot;drivers&quot; are controllable:  launching a new product, expanding a factory, changing pricing policies.  So part of the forecast includes making decisions about how the business will navigate through a changing situation.  A Covid forecasting model should provide the same ability.  We can make policy decisions (close gathering spots, quarantine infected persons) or encourage changes to personal behaviors (wash hands, wear masks) to change the rate of infection.  </p>
<p>Second, in business forecasting systems we provide variance reporting so there is a continuous feedback loop.  If some managers are consistently too optimistic or are &quot;sandbaggers&quot; that understate the future, we point that out.  Likewise, a good Covid model will include information about the accuracy of past predictions to allow modelers to better understand what is happening and adjust accordingly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
