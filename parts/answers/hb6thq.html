		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to what everyone else has said, the Linea nigra need not appear only during pregnancy. Since it's caused by a hormone, people with hormone imbalances, or diseases like PCOS, can also get it. Also, people with darker skin (like SE Asians or Africans), are more prone to it, because their skin naturally contains more melanin. Adolescents can also get it, because of the swirl of hormones that occur during puberty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had the linea nigra with my first pregnancy.  By the time my son turned one it had faded but not completely and I found out on his first birthday I was pregnant for the second time. I thought it would come back dark since it hadn't completely faded. Instead it continued to fade over the next couple if months completely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
