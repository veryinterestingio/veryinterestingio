<p>Nothing. Aside from a speck of tiny dust here and there, nothing.</p>
<p>Space isn't black either. Space has no colour. The black you are seeing just means the light coming from that direction is too faint for our eyes to make anything out of it but black (the lack of any light). Turning off the light in your bedroom doesn't turn it purple. It turns it pitch black.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the traditional sense of <em>stuff</em>, space is made of nothing. Gas, dust, rocks, and all the rest of the matter in the universe is attracted to other matter because of gravity until it clumps together. There is like, <em>some</em> bits of gas and dust: maybe around 10^6 particles per cubic meter. For some context, a human body has somewhere around 10^27 particles, and a cubic meter of air has around 10^25 particles. So, think of the difference between how dense you are and how dense the air around you is: two orders of magnitude. Space is <em>twenty</em> orders of magnitude less dense.</p>
<p>You: 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 particles</p>
<p>Meter^3 of air: 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 particles</p>
<p>Interstellar space: 1,000,000 particles</p>
<p>That still looks like a big number, but it's way less than even a single particle per cubic centimeter! That's a whole lot of nothing.</p>
<p>However, quantum mechanics reveals that the entire universe is filled with quantum energy fields that have a little bit of energy. All particles are tiny packets of energy in a field, like a wave rising above the surface of water. Even where there is &quot;nothing&quot;, those fields are churning with energy like the surface of the ocean during a storm. Particles randomly pop into and out of existence, lasting for fractions of fractions of seconds. Those particles don't exist long enough to do anything - and in fact, since they don't interact with anything they arguably don't &quot;exist&quot; at all. But the fields are there, throughout the universe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Space is like normal air, but with the air removed. </p>
<p>Everything we know is made of atoms, right? Space is the lack of atoms. There's nothing there. (without addressing quantum stuff)</p>
<p>The blue in our atmosphere is due to something we call Atmospheric Scattering - basically, the earth's atmosphere is a giant prism, and we see the blue part. At sunset, the sky turns red because the angle is different, and we see a different part of the prism.</p>
<p>Space has no atmosphere for the light to bend through, therefore it's black.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's an ELI5 with quantum mechanics:</p>
<p>The nothingness of space is understood to be a &quot;quantum field.&quot; All that means is, in the same way water feels like nothing to a fish, and air feels like almost nothing to you, outer space is the ultimate in feeling like nothing while still being something!</p>
<p>So what is it? It's a field that contains every particle in the universe. It's constantly in flux, which means particles are constantly appearing and disappearing. These are called &quot;virtual particles&quot; because of how they almost don't exist (but do).</p>
<p>In addition to the source of all particles, it's also the source of &quot;dark energy.&quot; We don't know exactly what it is, but it is pushing the universe apart ever faster. The theory goes that negative mass produces an anti-gravity pushing effect, and the quantum field of the entire universe is the source of this negative mass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
