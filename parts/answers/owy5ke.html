		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s life in the ocean that’s at least as intelligent as the other intelligent non-human life on land. Dolphins and whales in particular are very intelligent, as are many species of octopi. As far as humans, we’re kind of an anomaly, and our vast social and technological achievements are largely possible because of 3 unique traits - 1) dexterity: by walking upright we free up our hands with opposable thumbs to fashion a myriad of tools and carry them with us when hunting and traveling; 2) language, enabling us to communicate arbitrary abstract concepts and allowing for the most flexible and adaptable collaboration in the animal kingdom, and 3) writing, allowing us to use text as a kind of “artificial memory”, enabling us to accumulate more knowledge than we can remember in our brains, and to communicate that knowledge from generation to generation without relying on it being orally passed down like a game of telephone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ocean's size is misleading. Large proportions of all the oceans can technically be classified as deserts. This sounds crazy, but one important meaning of &quot;desert&quot; isn't to do with being arid, but rather density of biomatter. In much of the ocean not near to continents or islands, the water contains very little life-sustaining nutrients and a few meters down, very little energy.   </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans seem to be a fluke. A part that helped us along is fire and cooked meals. …which is a bit more complicated under water. </p>
<p>Cooking had profound evolutionary effect because it increased food efficiency, which allowed human ancestors to spend less time foraging, chewing, and digesting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to make tools underwater, and basically impossible to make fire. A lot of what human intelligence is just consists of manipulating stuff, which in turn helps with intelligence. You can make stuff to record information, and you can make stuff to help you survive harsher climates, and you can make stuff to help you get more calories. </p>
<p>Doing any of that underwater is much harder.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
