		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have a light of known intensity.  Shine it at something that's &quot;black&quot;.  Measure how much light is reflected off it, calculate how much of the source light was absorbed.</p>
<p>Now shine same light against many different things that are different &quot;blacks&quot; from different paints/coatings/materials.</p>
<p>Compare calculations and find that Vantablack or Black 2.0 absorbs the most light as compared to all other sources.</p>
<p>Tout it as the darkest black in the world and challenge others to come up with something blacker (i.e. that absorbs more light than it does).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer to your question how is it measured is answered in the article.</p>
<p>&quot;Dubbed Vantablack, the darkest color in the world absorbs 99.96% of the light hitting it&quot;</p>
<p>Blackness is measured by how much light it absorbs vs reflects.  To invent a blacker black you need to create a pigment that would absorb more light then the currently blackest black.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually know the guys who invented this. You are measuring the amount of reflected light. The problem is that because it absorbs almost all light very little is reflected to measure. Hence you need a sensitive visible light spectrometer with integrating sphere to capture every reflected photon.  It's a difficult job to do correctly even with a very expensive spectrometer (around Â£70k).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You shine a (known) dose of light on an area and then measure how much of it is reflected.</p>
<p>White --&gt; reflects most of the light (diffusely)</p>
<p>Black --&gt; absorbs most of the light</p>
<p>Black and white are just the extremes / endpoints of the scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can have a black material like that too with some cheating. Paint the inside of a box with the blackest material you can find commercially and have a small hole on top. Then you measure the amount of light you get back from your light source. </p>
<p>You can have surprisingly good results though it's uses are limited</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
