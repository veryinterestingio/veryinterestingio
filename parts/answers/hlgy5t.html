		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Inside of a firework, there is a propellant charge and explosive charge. The propellant shoots a cartridge (mortar)  up into the air and the secondary explosive charge (mortar) contains a bunch of little explosive charges (stars) packed in additional exploding material.</p>
<p>Basic mortars are three stage. The propellant charge fires it up into the air, and once the mortar charge reaches it's discharge height and explodes, the explosive packaging shoots the explosive stars in all direction which then explode separately, creating a spherical explosion of stars. </p>
<p>More complicated ones are created in shapes charges and multi stage explosions. The stars in the mortar are packed so that the explosive packing is all on one side for example, this causes the explosive stars to explode in one direction before exploding themselves. This gives it a waterfall effect. </p>
<p>Picture pasting paintballs on the outside of a baloon. When the baloon pops the paintballs are going to blow in all directions and then splatter. Now picture pasting paintballs in a row on just one side of the baloon, the paintballs are only going to go in one direction before splattering. Simple as that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I understand it properly, within the firework itself is basically a powder charge with the mineral salt balls that make the colors.  They farther the balls need to fly, the closer they are to the powder charge in the center inside of the package.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
