		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wood is not a single substance like water or iron, it is the corpse of a dead plant. It is a complicated structure made of countless different substances, all with different melting and boiling points and capable of interacting with each other. If you make it really really hot, everything will become a gas, but there is no consistent state before that. Note, that is NOT what burning is. Burning is not changing state, it's a chemical reaction, specifically combining with oxygen in the air. The cellulose in the wood has not become a gas, it has become different chemicals entirely (CO2 and water, mostly).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Burning isn’t a state change. It’s just a chemical reaction with oxygen in the air that happens at high heat. Complex organic molecules don’t traditionally melt very easily.</p>
<p>Some molecules like carbon dioxide will indeed “sublimate”, meaning that they go directly from solid to gas when exposed to heat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The solid molecules in wood break apart from the heat before they can melt, forming smaller molecules that are liquids or gases. These liquids boil off, also becoming gases. You don't ever see the liquid because it forms within the spongy charred wood, so it doesn't flow out. Meanwhile, the charcoal and ash remain solid well above the temperatures of your fire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your starting assumption is incorrect. Not everything *does* go through a liquid phase--at regular atmospheric pressure, for instance, carbon dioxide &quot;sublimes&quot; (goes directly from solid to gas) at -78C.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
