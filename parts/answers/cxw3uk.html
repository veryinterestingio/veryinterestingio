		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't think of an ELI5 way to put this, so I'll just simplify this:</p>
<p>The molecule that creates a spicy feeling belongs to a group called vanelloids. They bind to receptors all over your body (not just in your mouth), and trick your body into thinking there's real heat.</p>
<p>As to why some brands take more time, it's due to what they're submerged in. Capsaicin, the most common compound, is a fat soluable molecule. This means that it binds to fat easily, and if they're submerged in a more fatty base (such as oil), you would have to wait for the fats to get out of the way. Most hot sauces are made from vinegar, which is way less fatty than oil, and so it kicks in way faster,</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A quick google for a paper that addresses this didn't find anything published, but did link back to reddit! <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/243tkv/why_do_some_hot_peppers_have_a_slower_burn_than/" target="_blank">Ask Science: why do some peppers have a slower burn than others</a>.</p>
<p>Some dedicated redditor linked to a few other threads with similar questions (though some were actually just &quot;why does capsaicin burn). One commenter says they also couldn't find anything on this specific phenomenon, so all we have are hypotheses—not theories—but they're well grounded.</p>
<p>So here's my attempt at explaining for an especially precocious 5 year old (like a person with a 5 year old's knowledge of the world but an adult's capacity for ambiguity and new vocabulary):</p>
<p>The chemical in peppers that gives you the burning feeling is called capsaicin. It directly affects nerves that are also about sensing abrasion and physical heat.</p>
<p>There might be several reasons for why different sauces have different feelings, but I think the best guess is a simple one: acid just straight up makes those nerves a little hyperactive, so capsaicin affects more nerves faster (so more total burning), but the nerves also reset faster, meaning the burning goes away sooner.</p>
<p>There might be other reasons for different hot sauces to burn differently, like more oil might carry the capsaicin to more places in your mouth, evenly coating everything before the capsaicin sinks through the skin of your mouth to hit those nerves all at once.</p>
<p>Also, there's an entire family of chemicals similar to capsaicin, called capsaicinoids*, and most peppers have a bunch of them in different amounts (it's mostly capsaicin though). These other capsaicinoids might affect the nerves differently, taking longer to affect one and sticking around longer, or vice versa, or some other combination of effects.</p>
<p>^(*: bonus fact, caffeine is similar too, a lot of plants have various closer or distant relatives of caffeine in different amounts, which is part of why yerba mate, coffee, guarana, and tea all hit a little differently. &quot;Guarana extract&quot; or similar are still usually just caffeine though.)</p>
<p>^(edit: if I gave gold I think I would like to be thanked for it, therefore by the, heh, golden rule, I offer up my thanks for the shiny flair)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The real reason is that capsaicin is a hydrophobic molecule and not very soluble in water (or saliva). Depending on the food, it will take longer or shorter for the capsaicin to reach its receptor, which is named TRPV1. Btw, there's lots of misinformation in here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
