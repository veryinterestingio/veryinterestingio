		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your eyes contain cells that chemically react to light. Stimulating them strongly can create temporary lasting imprints because either the cell is depleted of the signalling chemicals relative to other cells (you look at a red image then switch to a white wall - the red cells are less capable to signal than the green and blue ones so that portion of your vision looks more anti-red) or the cells continue to fire since they are so strongly stimulated (you close your eyes and see bright outlines).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s called ‘backward masking.’  It’s the same as what happens when, after looking at something with a strong outline, you look away and see its shape, but in reverse (ie black if the shape was white). It’s because our cells are programmed to respond to change. They have ‘got used to’ the original imprint and so respond to the change (ie to the image being removed) by firing again, in the opposite way. </p>
<p>I guess responding to change is an important protective element in our evolution. We need to see the leaves move as the tiger prepares to leap on us!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This works also with objects, your eyes being like a polaroid film that capture the light and capture the image Upside-down in your eyes.
Takes a moment for the &quot;film&quot; (your eyes) to become blank after to bright exposure and thus you can still see it seconds after!</p>
<p>In school they will talk about something called a retina that's in the back of your eye, it captures the image and transforms it into neural signals that get sent to your brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you look at a light source (or a strong reflecting surface) you overstimulate the eye nerves (sensors). The sensors are trying to find the neutral color pretty quickly. They overestimate the brightness of the picture you've seen.</p>
<p>If you close your eyes, the sensors again seek the average and the color you've seen before is suddenly missing. They begin to adapt and you still see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_color" target="_blank">contrasting color</a> during this phase (for example: red -&gt; cyan, green -&gt; violet, blue -&gt; yellow).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All images as and when perceived are then maintained in your space of representation. This is the same space where you can close your eyes and see an image previously seen, recall a memory, sound, smell etc. </p>
<p>After absorbing an image from any external stimulus, it is then maintained in this space of representation for a duration for your active consciousness to attend, relate, reconcile and store in your memory. Depending upon the intensity and attention of your gaze towards an object and the light scema surrounding the object you are gazing upon, you will see the lingering image for a long or short period of time in your space of representation.</p>
<p>Understanding and using this aspect is very relevant for memorizing something.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
