		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>None of the &quot;testosterone supplements&quot; that you see advertised actually contain testosterone.  Instead they contain a variety of inert ingredients that are implied to boost testosterone production (though they never explicitly claim to boost testosterone production as they're not legally allowed to).</p>
<p>As to why those supplements are marketed but fake estrogen supplements aren't?  Testosterone is classified as a performance enhancing drug by the World Anti-Doping Agency because it boosts athletic performance.  </p>
<p>Casual bodybuilders get tricked, just like you did, into thinking those supplements are some legal form of testosterone and take it because they think it will increase  their testosterone levels and muscle mass.</p>
<p>Estrogen is not a performance enhancing drug - it does just the opposite and so there isn't any demand for it among casual athletes.</p>
<p>There are pills that contain actual testosterone, but you can only get those with a prescription and you're not going to get a prescription if your only need for them is to help you workout.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Drugs like Estradiol and Androgel are available for estrogen and testosterone replacement therapy. </p>
<p>The male supplements you see advertised are usually not evaluated for efficacy and usually approved for safety only.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Estrogen supplements are advertised to women for postmenopausal symptoms (brand names include premarin and estrace). It's controversial because there are risks to hormone replacement,  including increased breast cancer risk, but there are also benefits for some women. </p>
<p>I bet you could find ads in Good Housekeeping magazine or something like that. Advertising is targeted, so those not in that demographic might not come across ads that are aimed at age 60+ women.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Women do get marketed estrogen-like or prolactin-like compounds for inducing lactation or breast growth. </p>
<p>I think the reason it's more prevalent for men is that we associate testosterone with masculinity - more of one means more of the other. I don't think women see estrogen in quite the same way and femininity has been talked about in much wider terms than simply biologically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
