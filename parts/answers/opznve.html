<p>It seems like the Delta variant only marginally affects the amount of symptomatic infections, at least for BioNtech and Astra Zeneca, at least for patients who have received both doses, there is a distinct drop off after only one dose. There was a noticeable drop in efficacy (about 7% in both cases, albeit on a significantly lower level with AZ, but that's hardly news) but overall it seems a lot better than initially feared. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most recent published data (coming from Journal New England) shows 88% effectiveness against symptomatic disease for two doses of Pfizer against Delta (relative to 94% for the alpha variant) and 67% for Astrazeneca for the Delta variant (relative go 74% for alpha). </p>
<p>While it's too early to see the clear effect of deaths from this strain, the studies from Israel and PHE have so far indicated similar effectiveness for mortality. For hospitalisations, the PHE study from the UK estimates broadly similar effectiveness for hospitalisations relative to the alpha variant.</p>
<p>However, Israeli data estimated effectiveness against Delta from Pfizer being 64% for symptomatic disease two weeks ago. They have now revised that estimated to 41% for Delta and 39% against all strains generally.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It theoretically depends on the vaccine.</p>
<p>One of the constants of the variants is their spike protein. We knew this was going to be a constant (it is difficult to change evolutionarily) which is why all of the mRNA vaccines target this protein. It trains your immune system to disable the virus if it &quot;sees&quot; it.</p>
<p>These vaccines should function similarly when targeting all variants, unless the spike protein is altered in some way (but this is unlikely, we hope).</p>
<p>Other vaccines that use whole viruses may not function as effectively, because the immune system will need to divide its resources to target a bunch of different parts of the virus. Some parts may change with new variants, resulting in them pushing past the &quot;gatekeepers&quot;, however it is unlikely that ALL parts will change</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
