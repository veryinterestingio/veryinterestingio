		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://www.eolss.net/Sample-Chapters/C07/E2-02-03-02.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.eolss.net/Sample-Chapters/C07/E2-02-03-02.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.eolss.net/Sample-Chapters/C07/E2-02-03-02.pdf</a></a> is another good resource that talks about how widely it varies by latitude and season and such. It gives 1.4 metres of water per year averaged over the whole ocean (far lower right of table 1). That's 3.83 mm per day. 3.83 mm/day times 1 square mile is about 10 million litres/day, which is also 2.2 million imperial gallons, which is essentially u/50StatePiss's answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alternative (fun) way to look at this is look at average rainfall around the world. As every litre of water that rains down has to evaporate at first - average rainfall should be approximately equal to average precipitation. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The yearly precipitation averaged over the whole Earth is about 100 cm (39 inches), but this is distributed very unevenly. </p>

<p>A small caveat of land evaporating less than ocean explains why this gives us slightly smaller number than /u/DammitDadIsOnReddit's 117.4 cm</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Evaporation rate is expressed in mm/day, and ranges from ~1mm a day to ~110 mm/day (for worst conditions, warm water with cold air). <a href="http://www.fao.org/tempref/FI/CDrom/FAO_Training/FAO_Training/General/x6705e/x6705e02.htm#:~:text=Evaporation%20rates%20are%20usually%20expressed,week%20or%2060%20mm%2Fmonth." target="_blank">This linked article is for a pond, but works as a rule of thumb, IMO</a></p>
<p>Lets assume 10mm/day (from example calc below) and multiply by area as required. </p>
<pre><code>1 mileSq = 2.58999 kmSq 

Evaporation over 1 mileSq = 2.58999 * 10^6  m^2  * ( 0.010 m )

                                   = 25890m^3 per day. 

                                   = ~25,890,000 Liters of Water per day or ~6,839,000 Gallons of Water per day</code></pre>
<p>The paper linked below explains the influencing factors, and gives us the equation: </p>
<pre><code>E = 0.0331 V (e – es) [1 – 0.03 (T – Tw)] 24 h day-1 (1)</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>where E is evaporation rate (mm/day); </p>
<p>V is the wind speed in the lowest 0.5 m above the ground (km/h), </p>
<p>e is vapor pressure (the equation is setup to use the English system unit mm Hg), </p>
<p>es is saturation vapor pressure, </p>
<p>T is the atmospheric temperature above the water surface in C, and </p>
<p>Tw is the water temperature in C.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An example (From the paper) to show range: </p>
<p>Suppose the vapor pressure is 15 mm Hg,</p>
<p>saturation vapor pressure is 15 mm Hg, </p>
<p>wind speed is 25/km h, </p>
<p>air temperature is 29 C, </p>
<p>and water temperature is 27 C. <a href="https://www.ospo.noaa.gov/data/sst/contour/global_small.cf.gif" target="_blank">Here's a global oceans water surface temp map, so you can check for your location</a></p>
<p>Inserting these values into Equation (1) (leaving off units since they cancel) gives
E = 0.0331 X 25 (30 – 15) [1 – 0.03 (29 – 27)] 24 h day-1 = <strong>11.66 mm/day</strong></p>
