		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Looking at the answers so far; they’re good answers but some still seem a little technical for ELI5. Think of it like a car. If your car gets a little dent because something hit it, it shouldn’t dent more on its own. If there is rust on the car, it’ll slowly eat away at that area until it’s taken care of properly. The rust is like a cavity and the dent is a tooth chip.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dentin, the inner layer of tooth underneath the enamel,, is much softer than enamel.
If a cracked or broken tooth is not broken into the dentin of the tooth, it may be stable, and in, there's not an increased chance of it developing decay.
If even a small cavity reaches the dentin, the bacteria causing the decay can make the cavity grow very quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
