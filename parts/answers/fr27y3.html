		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people are reflexively <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_resistance" target="_blank">resistant to change</a>, even when that change could or will have a positive effect on them.</p>
<p>Change involves the possibility of negative risk, causing you to lose time or resources. When people evaluate their situation, they often feel safer avoiding negative risk entirely than pursuing a positive risk/opportunity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One reason may be because it's daunting. To start something new will mean you'll either commit time to it or buzzer off.
