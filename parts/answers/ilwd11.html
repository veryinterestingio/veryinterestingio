In detail, there were both intra-oceanic island arcs formed above intra-oceanic subduction zones (e.g. modern day analogues would be things like Java and Sumatra on the extremely large end and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Georgia_and_the_South_Sandwich_Islands" target="_blank">South Sandwich Islands</a> on the small end) and oceanic islands formed as a result of plumes (like Hawaii). The records for the former are not too bad because island arcs tend to be accreted as opposed to subducted, so there are accreted terranes on major continents now which resconstruct to having been intra-oceanic island arcs in the middle of Panthalassa, the large ocean that surrounded Pangea, e.g. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo1401" target="_blank">van der Meer et al, 2012</a>. Oceanic islands like Hawaii don't leave as much of a record, because after they move away from the plume, they tend to erode and sink, becoming seamounts (e.g. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian%E2%80%93Emperor_seamount_chain" target="_blank">Hawaii-Emperor seamount chain</a> represents a chain of islands that formed and then became seamounts as the Pacific plate moved over the formative mantle plume). Seamounts often are able to be subducted (meaning that there wouldn't be a record of their existence if they were), but sometimes they can be partially accreted and there is evidence of some accreted seamounts which may trace back to oceanic islands that would have been in the center of Panthalassa (e.g. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251435104_Plumes_in_central_Panthalassa_Deduction_from_accreted_oceanic_fragments_in_Japan" target="_blank">Kimura et al, 1994</a> - link to research gate because the journal site was being glitchy when I accessed it). Because seamounts are not as readily accreted, there could have been more oceanic islands in Panthalassa for which we have no record.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
