		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because erosion is slow! Even on Earth it's a gradual process, and on Mars (which has much less atmosphere and gravity as someone else already pointed out) it's even slower and more gentle.</p>
<p>BUT:</p>
<p>When comparing the <a href="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L868HCTDT8ueAXXrcyXoWc-1200-80.jpg" target="_blank">overall surface of Mars</a> (which has weathering) vs the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Back_side_of_the_Moon_AS16-3021.jpg" target="_blank">overall surface of the Moon</a> (which <del>doesn't have</del> has much less weathering), it's pretty apparent that Mars <em>does</em> show significant smoothing from erosion and weathering - just like you predicted should be the case!</p>
<p>Since Mars is (mostly) no longer tectonically active, and there's no longer abundant liquid water creating canyons, and meteor impacts are much rarer now than in the early solar system, we can expect that in a few million years the erosion will &quot;catch up&quot; and make Mars even smoother than today. Meanwhile the Moon will continue to look like it does.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're not sandstorms, but dust storms.  Typical particle sizes are about a micron (a tenth the size of a human red blood cell).  Mars's atmosphere isn't dense enough to kick particles as big as a grain of sand up into the air.</p>
<p>This does cause significant erosion, but it's very slow.  <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1985LPSC...16..163M" target="_blank">Here's</a> a paper showing &quot;before and after&quot; results of a dust storm hitting the Viking 1 lander site: the dust filled in tiny centimeter-sized craters and pushed a bit of loose dirt around.  <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2005JE002588" target="_blank">Here's</a> a simulation of Martian dust activity using a Mars weather simulator: it shows that the typical rate of erosion or deposition is about 1-2 microns per year (a meter every million years).  And that's mostly just loose dust moving around: solid rock would be much more resistant to weathering.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;sand storm&quot; is probably media hyperbole over what it's really like. </p>
<p>The air pressure is on Mars is approximately 1% of what we see at sea level on Earth.  Plus the gravity is 1/3.   So if you somehow had your skin exposed to one of these &quot;sand storms&quot; you wouldn't even feel it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sand and dust also protects. I design pneumatic material conveying systems (stuff blowing through pipes) and you can build an elbow like a regular elbow and sand blast the corner away. Or you can build an elbow with a square box on the outside face. That square box packs full of sand and forms it’s own elbow. As the sand wears away a layer it keeps adding it’s own protection.  Lasts forever. Works for sawdust too. </p>
<p>So a hillside with sand packed wind would deposit the sand on the hill and not erode away the base layer as the sand would pack into every uneven surface to protect it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The giant global sandstorms on Mars are caused by its' incredibly low atmospheric pressure and gravity. Put simply our dust storms are far more destructive because the Martian atmosphere is roughly 150 times less dense than Earths at about 0.095 PSI at &quot;sea level&quot; compared to 14.7 PSI. Gravity also plays a role with Martian gravity at about 37% of Earth's. Martian dust storms are bigger but they do not have anywhere near the energy of Earth's. The sand particles are much much smaller with less energy (lower atmospheric pressure means smaller particles airborne) operating against a geography that took far less energy to push up (or down). Mars is also a smaller planet than Earth in terms of  circumference with an Equatorial speed of about 60% of Earth's (about 270m/s vs 460m/s).</p>
<p>The &quot;global sandstorms&quot; you are referring to are simply not highly energetic and have been going on so often that all of the sand is fairly small, doesn't have the bonus of gravity, doesn't have the bonus of atmospheric pressure, and doesn't have the bonus of rotational velocity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
