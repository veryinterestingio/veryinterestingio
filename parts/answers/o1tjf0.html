		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People who have undergone liposuction and regain weight often find themselves gaining fat in weird places (like their back for example). If you were to remove <em>all</em> subcutaneous fat then we wouldn't be able to store any there. You'd start storing a lot viscerally and around the organs. However, you'd most likely experience hyperlipidemia (hyper: meaning high, lipi meaning fat and emia meaning presence in blood) since there just is not sufficient capacity to store the fat and suck it from the blood. You'd eventually start experiencing fat lipiduria and fat deposits in your arteries i.e. you'd be in a whole lot of trouble.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's actually a conditon (a form of lypostrophy) which prevents the storage of fat as adipose tissue. In patients, the fat circulates in the blood causing damage until it is broken down. Patients need to be on a low fat diet to compensate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, there is a group of medical conditions that can allow us to answer this question - patients with <a href="https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/acquired-lipodystrophy/" target="_blank">acquired lipodystrophy</a> lose the majority of their fat cells (adipocytes) due to immune or drug reactions. The fat cells normally are part of feedback loops communicating with other organs about energy stores through hormones such as leptin which is part of appetite control. Loss of fat cells means no leptin, so less control of appetite.
Fat cells are normally told to take up sugars to turn into fat by insulin from the pancreas - no fat, nowhere to store the sugars. This gives you the complications of diabetes, and of high insulin levels - changes to the skin (acanthosis nigricans) and an increase in muscle mass.
Fats that cannot be stored elsewhere will end up circulating in lipid particles (hyperlipidaemia) and accumulating in vessels (atheroma) as well as further upsetting the pancreas (causing pancreatitis - angry pancreas syndrome). Sugars that cannot be stored will accumulate in the liver to be stored as fat (hepatic steatosis), which damages the liver over time.
In short, you really do need your fat cells - I would have to look through the published studies in more detail for a specific reference, but it has been suggested that some complications of obesity are due to stress on the fat cells from too much stored fat in individual cells, so reducing their numbers by liposuction won't help the effects on metabolism such as resistance to insulin signalling.
May have strayed above the age-5 target but hope that is of interest!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off: subcutaneous fat is the soft fat just under the skin /above the muscles.  Women often have more than men. Visceral fat is the fat around the inside right next to your organs, mainly in the belly.  Often we get more of it with age, and overweight men tend to have more as well. It doesn't feel as soft since it's under the muscle as well as the tough lining of the belly.  A quick way to estimate is to measure the waist vs. the hips.  If the belly is bigger or even close to as big, that tends to be a bad sign - though this test isn't perfect.</p>
<p>You can't actually get rid of 100% of the surface fat with liposuction, nor would you want to as it would look really funny.  </p>
<p>The fat inside the belly tends to be worse for your health, making you more likely to have diabetes, high blood pressure and heart attacks.</p>
<p>Most liposuction removes the surface fat. When removing fat from the surface areas of the body, you are left with <em>relatively</em> more fat right around your organs. If you later gain fat, a higher percentage may tend to go around your organs, and this may worsen your metabolic profile. However, results are highly variable across studies.  </p>
<p>One small study suggested results may vary by whether patients exercise.  That makes sense, as exercise generally can reduce fat around organs, separate from the liposuction question.  Exercise can lower this type of fat, even if overall weight doesn't change much or at all, improving health.  </p>
<p>This is also true it seems with liposuction: exercise afterwards and you do better.   The article below shows an increase in belly fat in the liposuction + no exercise group, but no increase in belly fat in the liposuction + exercise group.  Both lost surface fat.  It has some nice CT scan pictures in it; the fat in the CT pics is black in color and you can see a large circle of it on the outside preliposuction and it is reduced after, and then an increase in fat on the inside.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the other newer option is to target the belly fat itself with &quot;VASER&quot;, or Vibration Amplification of Sound Energy at Resonance System, which is ultrasound assisted liposuction.  With this the fat gets liquified and can be sucked out.  This, like exercise, might just be good for us metabolically.</p>
