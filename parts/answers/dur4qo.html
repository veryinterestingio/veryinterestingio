		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Though this may seem pedantic, it's actually important to distinguish between the question of 'when will the earth run out of oil' vs 'when will the earth run out of extractable oil'. While we have improved our ability to extract oil from reservoirs, we are never able to remove all oil from a reservoir (e.g. a good guess on the upper limit of recovery is around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraction_of_petroleum" target="_blank">60% after primary, secondary, and enhanced recovery from a given reservoir</a>) so the answer to the general form of the question as posted would probably be 'never'.</p>
<p>In terms of when we will run out of extractable oil, this is a pretty tricky question to answer with a lot of factors. The first major factor is just the total amount of oil available in reservoirs, which we of course don't ever know with certainty (i.e. we have estimates of the available oil in known reservoirs, but estimating the amount in as of yet to be discovered reservoirs is problematic). Even if we start with the premise that we have discovered all reservoirs which exist (which is probably a bad assumption), knowing when we would run out of oil from those reservoirs is hard to determine. This ends up being a mixture of geology (how good are estimates of the amount of oil, how easy is it to extract this oil through the life of the reservoir based on the properties of the reservoir), technology (are there new technologies developed which allow us to increase the amount of recoverable oil from reservoirs, e.g. horizontal/directional drilling which opened up production on huge numbers of previously non-viable reservoirs), economics (the cost of extracting oil from a given reservoir increases as you extract more as it becomes more difficult to extract, thus the amount that you can extract depends on whether it is profitable to do so), and society / policy (the price of and/or demand for oil can be influenced by a variety of factors that aren't strictly economics). </p>
<p>With the uncertainties of all those in mind, we can consider estimations of things like when certain countries / reservoirs might or have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicting_the_timing_of_peak_oil" target="_blank">reached peak oil</a>, which is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_oil" target="_blank">time at which maximum oil has been extracted from a single or pool of reservoirs</a>. There are a lot of assumptions in estimations like these, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicting_the_timing_of_peak_oil#/media/File:Hubbert_Upper-Bound_Peak_1956.png" target="_blank">US production curve</a> is a good example of how they can be really off. In that plot, the red curve is the prediction for oil production for US reservoirs made during the 1960s and the green curve is actual production. It seemed like the prediction was pretty solid (and that the US had reached peak oil and was in the declining production phase) until around 1990-2000, when there was huge departure, basically because a variety of technological improvements (some having to do with 'fracing' but really it was directional drilling) allowed for economically viable production from 'tight' reservoirs. </p>
<p>Similar to peak oil calculations / estimations, we could consider estimations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_reserves#Estimated_reserves_by_country" target="_blank">'reserves to production ratios' for various countries / reservoirs</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserves-to-production_ratio" target="_blank">reserves to production ratio</a> is basically estimation of how long a given reserve will continue to produce based on current rates of consumption and the estimated amount of remaining oil. This suffers from all of the same issue as the peak oil estimations, i.e. it doesn't typically account for any changes in consumption, changes in the ability to extract more oil, or discovery of new reservoirs. </p>
<p>Ultimately, this leads to a huge variety of estimates. Going back to the estimations of peak oil, references from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicting_the_timing_of_peak_oil#Present_range_of_predictions" target="_blank">few years ago would seem to suggest that globally we've already reached peak oil</a>, but I'm not sure if those have been validated with actual rates of production. The <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=38&amp;t=6" target="_blank">latest EIA estimation is that production can meet demand at least until 2050</a>, which doesn't imply that we would be 'out of oil' after 2050, but just that it's possible there would not be enough production to meet demand. </p>
<p>The <strong>TL;DR</strong> version of all of this is pretty much, we have no idea because there are way too many uncertainties / unknowns to answer with certainty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Run out? Probably never, but at some point it'll become prohibively expensive to extract.    </p>
<p>Also worth pointing out that one can generate oil, from coal for instance. Or even recreate artificially oil from carbon and oxygen. But those processes require energy. In such, oil may one day move from being a raw material to being a product, an energy storage substance with value due to its properties (namely energy density and liquid state making it easy to transport with near zero losses).     </p>
<p>One nightmarish scenario could be oil running out but instead of switching to something else, the inertia of our energy infrastructure force is to use available energy (nuclear, renewable, etc) to keep our oil addiction running. Also, abundant cheap energy makes previously un economical deposits turn profitable (high quality steam from nuclear power plants for low quality ores for instance ; look out for big oil and big gas investments in future nuclear).     </p>
<p>That would be a death sentence for the climate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The issue that blew this up what's the fact that since then we found multiple enormous oil reserves we now have more oil in reserve now than we have ever had</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
