		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Liquids are ‘incompressible’ in that they are only slightly compressible.</p>
<p>If we set ‘z’=1 where a fluid density doubles for a doubling of absolute pressure at constant temperature, liquids have a ‘z’ between about 0.001 and 0.05.</p>
<p>Gasses/vapors typically range from 0.4-1.6.</p>
<p>Z is compressibility.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All liquids are compressible. You just need much more pressure for a much smaller effect compared to typical gases.</p>
<p>If you compress a gas enough (and maybe heat it, depending on the gas) you reach the critical point, a point where the difference between gas and liquid disappears. The clear separation of the two phases only exists at &quot;low&quot; temperatures and pressures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a saying in mechanical engineering (and probably other disciplines) that goes &quot;Everything is a spring.&quot;.  Which is true.  /u/mfb- is absolutely right that all liquids are compressible, but it goes a step further.  All solids are compressible too.  Nukes, for example, are triggered by squeezing a solid ball of Plutonium so hard that it fits in half to a third of its normal volume.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work as an engineer running downhole tools on offshore oil rigs, one of the tools I use is called an accelerator, also known as an intensifier.  This tools is used in conjunction with another tool called a jar which is kinda like a big hammer, used when the toolstring gets stuck for whatever reason, to help get it free again.</p>
<p>Anyway, the accelerator is filled with silicone oil which is specifically used for its high compressibility, so when you take a big pull on the toolstring to fire the jar,  the oil inside it basically acts like a big fluid spring increasing the force of the jar hit.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid</a></a>, water is actually compressible, it just wont compress very much. That article actually covers damn near every question you have.</p>
<p>Im having a hard time finding any liquid that is truly incompressible (and from the article I linked, that is more or less a function of it being a liquid and its structure not being rigid).</p>
<p>It appears water is often considered incompressible from a larger scale standpoint because of how resistant to compression it is, and how little it can compress, but it is technically compressible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
