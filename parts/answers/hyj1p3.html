		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know I actually was curious about this a while back too with the whole no straw movement... You won't believe the reason:</p>
<p>When you throw a straw into the trash / recycling bin, all that stuff eventually makes it to a sifting machine of sorts and will attempt to separate out the plastics that can be recycled... Straws are too light and cylindrical that they often fall off / over / out of the conveyor belts and then will be just swept away and piled back again with general trash, dumped to a dumping ground. Since these straws are light, they often times end up flying away from the dumping site too and end up in the ocean.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The biggest problem is a lack of consistency.</p>
<p>In my state, some councils tell you to put them (and bread clips) in milk bottles and put the lid on. In other councils, they tell you to take the lid off the milk bottles when recycling.</p>
<p>This just leads to consumers not knowing what to do, and recycling the wrong way, which leads to things not being recycled despite being put into the correct bin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You may not be aware of it, but vast majority of drinks can be consumed without a straw. It may sound unbelievable, but there exists this ancient way of drinking a liquid from any sort of cup by putting your lips to the rim of a cup and slightly tilting the cup to your lips.</p>
<p>Try it, it works!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
