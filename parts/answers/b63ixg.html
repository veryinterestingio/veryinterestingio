		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plants, algae and cynobacteria can do photosynthesis.</p>
<p>There are also some weird cases like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elysia_chlorotica" target="_blank">this sea slug</a> which eats algae and captures the part of the algae cells responsible for photosynthesis, the chloroplast, to use itself. It looks like leaf, but is an animal.</p>
<p>It is thought that this is how plants got the photosynthesis ability too. That the chloroplast originally was its own lifefrom, but got co-opted by the ancestors of modern plants and became part of them.</p>
<p>So the answer to your question is perhaps that, photosynthesis is a trick that nature only stumbled across once (or a small number of times) and all current lifeforms capable of photosynthesis either are descendant from the ones who stumbled across it originally or stole the trick from them by eating them and making them part of themselves.</p>
<p>For most animals it wouldn't be terrible advantageous either, so any animal randomly evolving the beginning of that particular skill wouldn't get much out of it and not be in a position to better pass it on to its descendants. You usually get more energy by eating other lifeforms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some animals harvest sunlight in other ways than photosynthesis, which is just one of many ways to do it.</p>
<p>Some wasps, with their big yellow stripes, are harvesting solar energy.    So not only are they unreasonably mean little assholes, they are also unreasonably mean little solar powered assholes.</p>
<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_9254000/9254445.stm" target="_blank">http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_9254000/9254445.stm</a></p>
<p>As to &quot;Why&quot; - like why are not more creatures entirely solar powered?   A likely answer is because photosynthesis sucks compared to just eating the stored energy of something that photosynthesises.   Or eating that thing.  Or eating THAT thing.   (grass-&gt;deer-&gt;wolf).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plant biologist here, u/SirButcher lays out good points regarding the trade offs required for efficient photosynthesis.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>However, another key point is that once an organism has photosynthesis evolution will push it toward a more sedentary plant-like lifestyle.  An organism that acquires energy from sunlight has no need to chase or eat other organisms.  Natural selection will push it toward the efficient traits Sir Butcher described.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are animals that use photosynthesis, although the ones I'm aware of have to steal the chloroplasts from plants.</p>
<p>For example, some sea slugs can use photosynthesis by absorbing chloroplasts from their algae diet into their cells: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elysia_chlorotica" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elysia_chlorotica</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Of course evolution is not an engineer, and there's usually no deep reason behind things being the way they are beyond 'it works well enough for the organism to survive'. Animals could easily lack photosynthesis for no better reason than it just so happened to not evolve in animals. However, even if photosynthesis had evolved in animals, it wouldn't help all that much.</p>
<p>Randall Munroe has a great analysis of <a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/17/" target="_blank">What if cows could photosynthesize?</a>. He works out that photosynthetic cows could reduce their dietary needs by at best a few percent - and that's without taking into account any extra costs associated with photosynthesis. Consider that to photosynthesize efficiently, the cow would have to be hairless or nearly so, which is enough all by itself to present all sorts of extra challenges. The challenges associated with photosynthesis probably aren't even close to being worth it in order to need a few percent less food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
