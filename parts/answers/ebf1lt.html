		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Same reason our eyebrows lower and our jaws clench when we are mad. The brain sends a little signal to the lower parts of our motorcortex. &quot;you are feeling something, you should show it&quot;. This is universal and not taught. It is an evolutionary thing, and is probably due to the fact that showing and communicating emotions makes it more likely that you can work socially with the group, and therefore have a higher likelihood of surviving/passing on your genes. We have also been shown to recognise emotion more easily in people with the same ethnicity as ourselves, furthering the belief that it is an in-group development.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
