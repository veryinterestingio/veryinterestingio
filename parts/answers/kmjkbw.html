		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Baby formulas only like 10-15% protein by weight.  They're about 50% sugar by weight (mostly lactose).  Most protein powders are going to be 70-90% protein by weight.  Lactose dissolves into water much easier than proteins.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Formula is developed to be as close to milk as possible. It has all the vitamins, minerals, sugars, everything the baby needs, which helps it to dissolve more easily. The powder is also quite a bit finer.</p>
<p>On the other hand, protein powders are more pure protein. While proteins will dissolve in water, it takes quite a bit more effort. The proteins absolutely love water, but when they get wet, they tend to form a little ball with an outer wet layer and dry powder in the middle. It takes some effort to break open these clumps.</p>
<p>No matter how hard you try, cocoa powder for chocolate just doesn't dissolve well at all</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One anomer of <strong>Lactose</strong> (alpha-lactose) is often used in food products as a wetting agent to help products dissolve. The alpha-lactose crystals stay separate and hydrate easily.  </p>
<p>Baby formula products generally contain lactose to provide carbohydrates - if that lactose is in the alpha anomer, it will dissolve easily.  </p>
<p>Protein powders made from whey have much less lactose, so do not have this inbuilt wetting agent, and form dry clumps due to surface tension.  </p>
<p>The alpha-lactose anomer can convert to the beta-lactose anomer when exposed to moisture. The beta-lactose forms a agglomeration of lactose crystals, which <strong>clumps</strong> together. This is why lactose-containing products can go hard when exposed to moist air, and become lumps that are much harder to dissolve.  </p>
<p>One of my final year chemistry projects (bachelors degree, many years ago) was to see if I could determine the amount of beta-lactose in a lactose sample - this information is really important in the milk-processing industry, who use specialized drying techniques to maximise alpha-lactose crystallization when making lactose and milk powders. I made no headway on the project - I suspected at the time that some sort of IR Polarimetery or X-ray crystallization method might be required, but I didn't have those sort of resources. It looks like NMR has also been used successfully.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Baby formula makers NEED their product to dissolve perfectly, for the baby's sake.  If an adult doesn't mix up their protein enough, they have only themselves to blame, so companies don't bother changing the formula for dissolvability</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Baby formulas are suckled through a rubber nipple with just a few tiny holes. If the baby formula clumps and blocks any of those tiny holes, the result will be a vary unhappy baby, and then shortly, very unhappy parents. </p>
<p>This means “no clumping” is a MUST-HAVE feature for baby formulas. The same incentive does not exist for adult protein powders.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
