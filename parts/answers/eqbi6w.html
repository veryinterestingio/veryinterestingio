<p>Even if you were right next to it you'd have to generate 200+ decibels (or about equivalent to a sonic boom) to even have a chance of causing an avalanche.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably not, at least not with what our lungs can actually achieve. In addition to that, most deadly avalanches are triggered by the victims themselves and can be categorised as floe avalanches (<a href="https://www.slf.ch/de/lawinen/lawinenkunde-und-praevention/lawinenarten.html" target="_blank">[1]</a> <a href="https://www.alpenverein.de/bergsport/sicherheit/winter/schneebrett-ausloesung-bruchfortpflanzung-schwachschicht-lawine_aid_31035.html" target="_blank">[2]</a> [both sources in German]). The point about that avalanches is that if the avalanche is triggered by the victim, you need an initial shear force on a hard, dense snow package that sits on top of light, less dense snow. Therefor, getting this dense package of snow to move with your voice is not really probable to happen. More likely you will initate the avalanche when leaving your test spot with your skis or you already triggered trying to get to your spot of preference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This was mentioned briefly in an avalanche safety course I took recently; no, your voice cannot trigger an avalanche.</p>
<p>The myth stems from people talking while hiking/skiing through certain conditions. A persistent weak layer of snow (think an icy crust formed on a melt/freeze cycle, underneath a large amount of fresh snow) could cover an entire valley or mountainside. A trigger in one place could &quot;propagate&quot; through this weak layer to a different part of a slope. The trigger is their physical impact on the snow, not their voices.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/nP9FoHENwHs" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/nP9FoHENwHs</a> shows an avalanche propagation test in an area where there was already widespread propagation. Note how the column slides.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/4uL7TvdCe8w" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/4uL7TvdCe8w</a> not as great of a video but shows small propagation on the skiers left, then right in the second slide.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
