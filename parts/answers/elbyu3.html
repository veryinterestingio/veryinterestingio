		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you’re trying to go to sleep the muscles in your body have yet to completely relax. If you stretch and/or meditate for a decent amount of time before bed you will feel more relaxed and be more comfortable.</p>
<p>When you’re waking up your muscles have been resting all night, so you feel cozy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While you sleep your body creates and fills up with a chemical tranquilizer that relaxes your nervous system (to help you stay asleep and to reduce involuntary movements while you are dreaming)</p>
<p>So when you wake up you are basically on a drug.   a very &quot;feel good&quot; drug, very similar to an opiate.</p>
<p>I takes a few minutes of standing (increase heart rate and blood flow) and breathing (oxygenate blood) to clear out the tranquilizer.  This is why you feel groggy when you first wake up as well (because that tranquilizer is in your head too)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain is still half sleep and most of your conscious mental energy will be spent thinking about going to sleep or waking up, not whether or not your body is a position that's 99% comfortable instead of 100%. Kind of like when you're drunk, your brain just doesn't care about minor details when you first wake up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
