		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well you're still running a script that does something to your browser, in general everything your browser &quot;knows&quot; is data you can check. So if there's a script running on said website that &quot;sees&quot; the changes adblocker makes to your browser they can basically tell a script on this website: IF you see THIS happening THEN you show a window AND you keep showing this window UNLESS you don't see THIS anymore.</p>
<p>Sounds a bit stupid and it's a bit more complex to make it work but thats basically what you'd do to make something like this happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adblocker is only on the client's screen. Meaning, they ship a JavaScript script with their website that shows the nagscreen and hides the content.</p>
<p>However, this also means that your browser still downloaded the entire site. And you can easily reverse the effects of the JavaScript that messed up your site with the nagscreen, if you know a bit about Html/CSS:</p>
<p>Modern Browsers let you directly edit what is shown. For example, in Firefox, right click and inspect the background of the nag screen. It will take you to the html code of the site you are currently watching. Delete the element in the tree (by selecting it and pressing &quot;delete&quot;), then go up the element tree and continue to delete elements until the nag screen is gone.</p>
<p>But the main content is still cut off and not scrollable. That is simply done by the script adding the property &quot;overflow: hidden&quot; on the main body element and the one above or below that. Scroll up in the element tree until you find the body node, click on it and disable the &quot;overflow: hidden&quot; property on the right side of the window. Then go up and/or down a level and disable the other &quot;overflow: hidden&quot; property on the other element. And now your site is fully functional, without disabling your adblocker.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
