		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain has a LOT of things its keeping track of and doing without any thought or effort needed from the conscious mind. One of those things it keeps track of is exaxtly this. Your brain knows its you doing it.</p>
<p>Similarly, the part of your brain that helps you navigate obstacles in a busy room isn't entirely connected to your conscious vision. Its possible for a person to experience blindness, but still have their brain process the visual stimuli they don't experience and for them to be able to navigate an obstacle course. </p>
<p>And of course a source of some sort because the claim sounds fucking wild.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I assume it's at least partially because you have to strain your arm/shoulder muscles to massage something else, so you can never <em>fully</em> relax. And partially because physical contact releases endorphins.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

The things that help us survive and reproduce tend to make us feel good, like the constant touch of others / deepening social bonds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
