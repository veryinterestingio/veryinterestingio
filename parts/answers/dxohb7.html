		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You'll want to read about binding affinity to understand this topic broadly. Smooth muscle has relatively more alpha receptors than beta receptors so the net effect is constriction when the dose is high enough to saturate most of the receptors. In low doses it'll cause vasodilation, but that isn't the desired effect of local lidocaine with epi.</p>
<p>&quot;Associated with vascular smooth muscle are a large number of alpha1 receptors relative to beta2 receptors. However, epinephrine has a higher affinity for the beta2 receptor relative to the alpha1 receptor. Activation of the beta2 receptor would produce vasodilation while activation of the alpha1 receptor would result in vasoconstriction. Recall from the lectures on drug-receptor interactions the magnitude of effect is dependent on the degree of receptor occupancy. Therefore, the effect of epinephrine on smooth muscle is dependent on its relative affinity for alpha1 and beta2 receptors and its concentration. At low doses, epinephrine can selectively stimulate beta2 receptors producing muscle relaxation and a decrease in peripheral resistance. However, once epinephrine concentrations are reached which bind to the alpha1 receptor, vasoconstriction will occur. The two effects (smooth muscle relaxation and contraction) will oppose one another. However, as the concentration of epinephrine increases, the predominant effect will be vasoconstriction.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1) Beta-2 receptors are not expressed strongly in <em>all</em> vascular beds, just those of essential organs, whereas alpha-1 receptors are expressed in vascular beds all over the body.  Because of the difference in receptor expression, you can target the effects you want.</p>
<p>NorEpi actually binds less strongly to beta-2 receptors than it does to beta-1 as well as less strongly to beta-2 than epi does.</p>
<p>NorEpi used to be used as a vasoconstrictor with local anesthetic, but was found to have worse hemodynamic side effects when it escapes into circulation. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1422288" target="_blank">Here is a link to one paper that explains this</a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many of the answers here are correct regarding the effects of epinephrine vs norepinephrine on receptors infinity, etc. But everyone is guessing here (educated guess).</p>
<p>Data is king in science!!! One thing you got to remember as a clinician is that pharmacokinetics data DOES NOT translate into clinical outcome. Actually, more than 90% of the time pharmacokinetics data does not translate into clinical outcomes, which is why more than 90% of drugs never get FDA approval.</p>
<p>My point is that we got to where we are because of clinical studies that showed epinephrine is better than norepinephrine in term of cardiovascular effects when using with local anesthesia.</p>
<p>One example: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1422288" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1422288" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1422288</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the instance of anesthesia it’s related to the concentration of the medication. When injected intradermally with Lidocaine it’s very concentrated, in which case it acts on alpha receptors much more readily than beta, so the overall action is vasoconstriction.</p>
<p>That’s why an epipen can produce systemic beta 2 agonism even when a small amount is injected intramuscularly: the site of injection is highly concentrated, but the systemic dose is much more dilute, which allows beta 2 agonism to outweigh the alpha agonism.</p>
<p>Oh and norepinephrine doesn’t work on B2, only on B1 and A1, with A1 being the most effected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Epi hits everything adrenergic.</p>
<p>The net result of this when systemic is peripheral vasoconstriction, but increased inotropy, and increased chronotropy. </p>
<p>If you infiltrate it locally you'll only get net vasoconstriction once all the beta and alpha subtypes all get activated</p>
<p>Also just historically it's what's al ways been used and it if it works and it's cheap there's no reason to change it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
