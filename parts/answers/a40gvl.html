		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A gigantic meta-analysis from the British Journal of Sports Medicine says yes.</p>
<p><strong>Sedentary behaviour and the risk of depression: a meta-analysis</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thirteen cross-sectional studies with 110,152 participants and 11 longitudinal studies with 83,014 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The summary RR of depression for the highest versus non-occasional/occasional sedentary behaviour was 1.25 (95% CI 1.16 to 1.35, I2=50.7%) for all included studies. The pooled RRs of depression for sedentary behaviour were 1.31 (95% CI 1.16 to 1.48) in cross-sectional studies and 1.14 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.21) in longitudinal studies. In subgroup analysis by different types of sedentary behaviour, the pooled RRs of depression were 1.13 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.21) for long-time TV viewing and 1.22 (95% CI 1.10 to 1.34) for prolonged computer or internet use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusions: This meta-analysis of observational studies indicates that sedentary behaviour is associated with increased risk of depression.</strong></p>

<p>It is also important to understand the more complex role that exercise plays for our body as a whole. One of the most interesting longitudinal studies, and one that anyone in almost any medical or research field comes across eventually is called the Framingham Heart Study. It has been going on since 1948 with the children and then the grandchildren of the original participants, and contributed more to our understanding of Cardiovascular Disease than almost any other study. </p>
<p>There have been tens of thousands of write-ups on the data from this study, but I'm going to link one of the early analysis. </p>

<p>Estimating the effect of long-term physical activity on cardiovascular disease and mortality: evidence from the Framingham Heart Study </p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the things Framingham shows is the role of exercise in all-cause-mortality (ANY cause of death from cancer to heart attacks and suicide.)</p>
<p>Of the variables they controlled for - regular vigorous exercise was shown to be one of the most important factors in not only reducing deaths from Cardiovascular Disease, but also reducing all cause mortality. </p>
<p><strong>To bring this full circle to the OP's original question - we have good evidence that sedentary lifestyles contribute to things like cancer and obesity. And we have good evidence that cancer and obesity are additional contributors for depression.</strong> </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There have been many studies that show <strong>correlation</strong> between lack of exercise and depression, but in the reverse direction, multiple studies have attempted to assess the efficacy of exercise as a treatment for depression, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=24026850" target="_blank">meta-analysis has shown only a weak effect, at best</a>. In the six higher quality trials in the meta-analysis, there was only a small clinical effect favoring exercise that did not reach statistical significance. </p>
<p>This makes it seem to me that a sedentary lifestyle and depression are not <strong>causally</strong> linked. However, avoiding a sedentary lifestyle could have other benefits that can at least somewhat offset the negative health outcomes linked to depression, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Be very careful with thinking there are causal conclusions here. Metadata studies can give evidence to just about any plausible hypothesis. There's also a great many other things associated with depression like atomization and loneliness for example. It's a web and one strands is possibly physical fitness</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
