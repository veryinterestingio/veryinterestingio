If you delay everytime you get a bad password, it slows down the attacks to the point either the attacker gives up or it gives intrusion detection systems time to say &quot;Hey, this guy is an asshat, block his IP&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><del>To add to what other people have said: If the system returned a failure as soon as it knew your password hash did not match the supplied password a malicious actor could perform something known as a timing attack where they get extra information based on how long a system takes to return information.</del></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also if your Identity is being verified against a distributed directory, password changes are usually made first against an authoritative directory server. If the directory server that first tried to authenticate you sees you have entered an incorrect password it checks with the authoritative server to make sure your password hasnâ€™t been reset. This way it can log you in immediately after a password change without waiting for all directory servers to be updated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are also systems that might have multiple auth profiles. So first check is against a local database but then the system goes out to an LDAP or RADIUS server. The secondary auth methods take more  time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One reason for this is to make all failed login attempts take the same amount of time, so a malicious user cannot gain information about a login based on the response time. How could they do this? Usually you enter a username and a password. Typically passwords are stored as a hash so they aren't recoverable. To save processing time, a clever programmer may choose not to hash the inputted password until after fetching the user record for the inputted username. That way, if the user record isn't found, they don't have to waste time hashing the inputted password. If they do find it, they can hash the input and compare to the user record to see if it matches.</p>
<p>But, this could leak information. If I enter a username that doesn't match a user in the system, the failed login attempt might return an error more quickly than it would if it found a user with the name I gave but failed the password check. Thus, I could learn at least if the username I entered actually exists in the system. By making a failed login attempt response always take a certain set amount of time, a malicious user cannot know how long it actually took to check the credentials and thus learn nothing about their partial validity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
