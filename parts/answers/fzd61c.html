		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many things can make you vomit or have diarrhea. One common reason is food poisoning. That is when bacteria have been growing in your food, and have produced toxins there. When you eat that food, the toxins comes into contact with thingies on the cells in your intestines called chemoreceptors. They are very mysterious and elusive, but it seems like they can somehow tell a toxin from a non toxin (i mean what is a toxin anyway? Maybe the bacteria have adapted their &quot;toxin&quot; to your chemoreceptors, because they want you to spray diarrhea all over your friends and family so the bacteria can live in their bodies? Then it's less of a toxin and more of a &quot;human chemoreceptor trigger&quot;? Maybe it's all a part of gods plan? Who knows.)</p>
<p>Anyway, when the chemoreceptors are triggered, they telephone the brain and ask it to trigger the vomit reflex. THey also tell the intestines to start spasming, so that the food will travel fast through your body. When the food travel fast, not much fluid will have time to absorb, so it comes out all watery. To make it even faster, the intestinal cells can loosen up and let fluid into the intestines (instead of absorbing water from it), making it even more watery and disgusting. Sometimes, depending on the &quot;toxin&quot;, intestinal cells are actually damaged by it, which starts an inflammation that has the same effect of making the gut leak fluids into the lumen, making your stool nice and runny.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body doesn't differentiate, it just knows it's been poisoned. Diarrhea and vomiting are symptoms of that.</p>
<p>Food borne illness is usually the result of waste products produced by bacteria during its life cycle. In other words, the bacteria didn't infect you its poop poisoned you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our bodies recognize the badness (poison and/or germs) by its products, what it does that makes it bad. (Emits some harmful substance, for instance.) Our bodies have learned the best ways to handle it (which end or both) from way back in our evolutionary past. Bad food of many kinds were parts of the world where our ancestors grew up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is the result of evolution. People that developed this kind of digestive system sensitivity were more likely to survive. People that didn't have it died. Over many many generations, we developed digestive systems that triggered on toxins.</p>
<p>Similar to the gag reflex when you smell something rotten. That smell tells your brain to throw up. People that didn't have this reflex would go ahead and eat whatever and are no longer with us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
