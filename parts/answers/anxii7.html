		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>(I don't work with this sort of stuff, but if I read the diagrams correctly, this is what happens)</p>
<p>Let's say that your freezer is infinitely strong, so the water can't expand at all, and that you start with it filled with liquid water and gradually cool it down slowly from room temperature (20°C). So we start at the [20°C, 101 kPa] point in the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Phase_diagram_of_water.svg" target="_blank">phase diagram for water</a>, and move left.</p>
<p>As we cool down from 20°C the <a href="https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2007/AllenMa.shtml" target="_blank">density of water</a> increases from 0.9982 g/cm³ up to 1.000 g/cm³ at 4°C, leading to a reduction in the water volume. Since the freezer is perfectly sealed and rigid, this leads to a pressure drop until we reach the ocher part of the diagram and water starts evaporating to fill the small amount of empty space left by the contracting water. This takes us down to about 1 kPa (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapour_pressure_of_water" target="_blank">vapor pressure of water</a>) (at the top of the freezer - at the bottom it will be higher due to the weight of the water above it). Further cooling below 4°C results in a slight decrease in density down to 0.999 g/cm³. This is still higher than the original 0.9982 g/cm³, so when we reach the tripe point of water at 0°C and 0.6 kPa, a tiny fraction (about 0.2% by volume and much less than that by mass) of the water will still be in vapor form.</p>
<p>When we reach 0°C, the water would normally start freezing. At first this is fine, since we have some space left over from the slight shrinkage of the water as we cooled it down from 20°C. But by the time 0.9% of the water has turned into ice, that volume has been used up. What happens next? If even a tiny bit more of the water were to freeze, it would take up more space since liquid water has a density of 1 g/cm³ while normal ice (<a href="http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/hexagonal_ice.html" target="_blank">Ice Ih</a>) has a density of only 0.92 g/cm³. This would push the rest of the water outwards, but our infinitely strong freezer walls would push right back, increasing the total pressure in the water and preventing anything from freezing. As the pressure rises, the water can stay liquid at gradually lower temperatures, so we will follow the curved boundary between the green and blue region upwards from [0°C, 101 kPa].</p>
<p>During this period one might think that the freezer will contain just pure, undercooled water under high pressure (plus the small amount of ice we formed before), but while we usually approximate water as being incompressible, that's just an approximation. Water shrinks fractionally by <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Tables/compress.html" target="_blank">about 46e-5/MPa</a>, so by the time we reach the temperature of a typical freezer (-18°C = 255 K) at about 150 MPa of pressure, our water will take about 7% less space. This makes room for some Ice Ih to form. Ice Ih takes up about 8.7% more space than standard pressure water, so we can afford to replace almost half of the water with Ice Ih: Half the water shrinks by 7%, and the other half turns into ice and grows by roughly 7%. To be exact, 44% of the water would turn in to Ice Ih at this temperature. (In general the fraction is x/(x+a-1), where x is the liquid water relative shrinkage, and a is the relative volume between ice and liquid water under standard conditions).</p>
<p>So if you've got your super-strong freezer set to a typical -18°C, it would end up being 56% full of undercooled liquid water and 44% normal ice, all of it being under about 1500 atmospheres of pressure. So opening the freezer would probably yield interesting and violent results.</p>
<p>What if your freezer isn't satisfied with just -18°C? If we keep cooling beyond that, then we soon reach the triple point between liquid water, Ice Ih and <a href="http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/ice_iii.html" target="_blank">Ice III</a> at [-22°C, 210 Mpa]. Ice III has a density of 1.14 g/cm³, so it's actually denser than the water we started with. At this point all the remaining liquid water will turn into Ice III, and you'll be left with a mix of 59% Ice Ih and 41% Ice III.</p>
<p>As we continue to cool below -24.5°C <a href="http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/ice_ii.html" target="_blank">Ice II</a>, with a density of 1.17 g/cm³ becomes energetically favored. However, Ice III is meta-stable in Ice II, so it could take a long time for it to convert. But ideally, all the Ice III would convert to the denser Ice II at this point, freeing up some volume for more Ice Ih, leaving us with a mix that's 63% Ice Ih and 37% Ice II. All of this happens while the pressure stays pretty constant at around 210-212 Mpa. This configuration holds down to around -100°C, which is probably enough for now.</p>
<p>I've made an <a href="http://folk.uio.no/sigurdkn/Phase_diagram_of_water_freezer_example.png" target="_blank">annotated version of the phase diagram</a> to try to summarize this.</p>
<p>TLDR: At standard freezer temperature your incompressible freezer will end up with 44% normal ice, and the rest would be (high-pressure) water. At lower temperatures it would contain a mix of about 60% normal ice and 40% exotic ice. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
