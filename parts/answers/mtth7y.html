		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is likely these are the testing conditions it has been approved under, and so that is what they must say on the box, despite it being potentially safe to remove for longer. Safety and effecacy testing is expensive, so if it doesn't add value then they will go with the minimum test conditions for approval. Using it outside of what is stated would be using it 'off label', which is common for many pharmaceuticals, but means that the company is not liable if it fails when used inappropriately. </p>
<p>For example, the Mirena hormone coil has been shown in research studies to be effective for up to 7yrs, where as it is only licenced for up to 5yrs, as these are the testing conditions it was approved under. The company wouldn't make more sales by paying for expensive testing to extend use for another 2yrs, so using longer is off-label but likely safe and still effective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>TL;DR: Not all hormones are made the same. That 3 hours vs 48 hours isn't a typo.</strong></p>
<p>This is in the realm of pharmacokinetics, if you ever want to google or do a literature search &quot;how long does it take a drug to enter/stay/leave my body for&quot;</p>
<p>You know how you can have vitamin D supplements in tablets ( calcitriol ) vs liquid ( Colecalciferol ), and they can both give you different amounts of vitamin availablility because (in short) they get digested differently?</p>
<p>Ignoring the filler ingredients, they both will deliver vitamin D to your body that you can use, but in different ways.</p>
<p>The way your body processes the actual molecule affects how much usable Vitamin D you get and how long it can hang around for.</p>
<p><strong>Nuvaring /Vs/ Annovera:</strong>   Etonogestrel  and  ethinyl estradiol  // segesterone acetate and ethinyl estradiol</p>
<p>If you have a look at the actual ingredients, while the type of estrogen molecule is the same, they have different a progestin molecule that &quot;delivers&quot; the progestin to you receive.</p>
<p>The progestin in Nuvaring has a much longer a half life (that is, time until you only have half the initial dose left in your system)<a href="https://www.drugs.com/ppa/ethinyl-estradiol-and-etonogestrel.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.drugs.com/ppa/ethinyl-estradiol-and-etonogestrel.html" target="_blank">https://www.drugs.com/ppa/ethinyl-estradiol-and-etonogestrel.html</a></a>  than the progestin in Annovera which is roughly half that <a href="https://www.drugs.com/ppa/segesterone-acetate-and-ethinyl-estradiol.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.drugs.com/ppa/segesterone-acetate-and-ethinyl-estradiol.html" target="_blank">https://www.drugs.com/ppa/segesterone-acetate-and-ethinyl-estradiol.html</a></a>.</p>
<p>(*<del>I'd prefer to be able to compare from the same site, or a handy dandy comparison graph, but I'm not going for precision here</del>. Edited with links to sources with numerical half life values.)</p>
<p>This means that without it there delivering the hormones, your hormone levels drop faster. On the flip side, once it's in, it looks like it kicks in sooner, but that's a separate property and I haven't looked in depth at that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I replied to another comment thread, but at top level <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/rr/rr6504a1.htm" target="_blank">here are the CDC recommendations</a> that planned parenthood and UC berkeley are going off of; search for citations 267, 268, 270 if you want to read the actual studies. </p>
<p>I trust the CDC, but on a personal level I always err on the side of caution when it comes to baby making and would just go with the manufacturer guidelines. as always remember to speak to your physician or pharmacist about this sort of thing if it's of concern.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;can only be removed for x hours/month. Both rings are used in 3 week periods and then removed for 1 week for menstruation. I think you are referring to how if the rings were to be removed for intercourse the guildlines are different. </p>
<p>If you were wondering why Annovera can be used for a year and Nuvaring is monthly then it most likely has to do with the exact composition of the vaginal systems/duration of use, both use Ethinyl Estradiol but <strong>Annovera has Segesterone Acetate</strong> and <strong>Nuvaring uses Etonogestrel</strong>. </p>
<p>Segestrone Acetate is also known as Nesterone (NES.) </p>
<p><strong>NES is a 19-Norprogesterone derivative</strong> while <strong>Etonogestrel is a 19-Nortestosterone derivative</strong>. </p>
<p>I don't have a source directly for the binding affinity of Nesterone in comparison to Etonogestrel so I'm using promegestone as a reference as it is also a 19-Norprogesterone derivative and to my knowledge progestins (man made progestogens) of the same family behave similarily. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>*below here is interpretation and not necessarily fact*</p>
<p>Etonogestrel has a higher binding affinity to target progesterone receptors than Promegestone. Etonogestrel also binds to albumin, This may be why Nuvaring can be removed for longer? Not certain!</p>
<p>I would most likely say that recommendations have to do with guidelines determined while the medication was being researched/conditions the study was carried out under. If participants that removed for longer than two hours had malfunctions I would imagine that the manufactureres would recommend less than two hours. </p>
