		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Microscopes are generally used to focus on really close things and magnify them a LOT. Because they have a small lens, they need a lot of light shining through/on to the object.</p>
<p>Telescopes usually don't have as much magnification, but have much bigger lenses to catch more light, as (apart from one notable exception) starlight has spread out a lot by the time it gets here and so stars are pretty faint. </p>
<p>Apart from this, the main difference is the focal point - really close vs infinity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The microscope focuses to a point just past the lens barrel.  The telescope is focused at infinity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depending on what the lens a microscope uses, you can potentially see things on an atomic level. Electron microscopes use electrons from a filament source. The electrons are attracted through a column ( that contains a vacuum) to an anode while electromagnetic coils focus the beam. Electrons hit the observed objects and causes a radiation to be emitted. Depending on the radiation produced, a computer translate the counts to pixels and produces a gray scale image. </p>
<p>I have no idea how to explain telescopes. But I'm glad to talk a little about my work</p>
<p>Edit:  whoops lens are was sort of a vague blanket term. Electromagnetic coils act as a sort of &quot;lens&quot; by condensing the beam. So for you jerk offs to shit on my explanation, you go ahead and explain the electron microscope in laymen's terms</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
