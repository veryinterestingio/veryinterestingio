		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human hearing ranges from (about) 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz.  If a sound wave falls outside of that range, you are not going to be able to hear it.</p>
<p>However, that doesn't mean that you aren't able to perceive it in other ways.  We can &quot;feel&quot; sound waves outside of our normal range of hearing - both above and below the 20/20,000 thresholds.  The 18.9 Hz wave is no different - you can't hear it, but you can feel it is there.</p>
<p>In many people, this feeling manifests itself as fear or paranoia.  You can &quot;feel&quot; something in the room, but none of your other senses register anything consciously.  This incongruence greats discomfort,t which manifests as fear.</p>
<p>It is called the &quot;Ghost Frequency&quot; because it is theorized that many &quot;haunted&quot; areas simply produce tones close to 18.9 Hz (through resonance or other natural quirks) and people associate the fear response with a &quot;presence&quot; in the area.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The air force did a lot of research on the effects of frequencies in this range, as it causes resonance in the ocular fluid. It can cause smearing in vision, which is a major problem when trying to read your instrument panel. It can also cause people to think they see ghosts, as simple shapes can get smeared, resulting in the stereotypical &quot;ghostly image&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
