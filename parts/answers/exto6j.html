		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is literally a Mythbusters episode on this, and the answer is that two objects hitting each other at 50mph is equal to hitting an immovable object at 50mph. It's counter intuitive, sure. Consider that the forward momentum from one car is transferred into the second car, in the opposite direction, effectively cancelling out 50mphs worth of force, even though the gap between the car is closing at 100mph. I can't find the episode, if anyone wants to provide a link.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This very much depends on more information than you've given.</p>
<p>Let's ignore all the details about crumple zones and small focused points of impact vs distributed impact and compression and decompression if materials, and assume we have cars whose front are just as flat and rigid as a wall.</p>
<p>The force that is imparted on the car in the collision can be seen by the change in the cars velocity.</p>
<p>A car going 50 that hits a wall and stops dead at the moment of impact has had enough force applied to it to reduce it's speed by 50.</p>
<p>That's the same force of that car going 25 being hit so hard by an incoming car that it goes backwards 25mph for a moment.  Or a car going 100 running into something that instantly slows it down to 50.</p>
<p>So two identical cars going 50 mph at each other will have the same impact on each other and will stop dead.  Each each suffers the exact same force as if they had hit an immovable wall.</p>
<hr />
<p>For extra fun, consider this -we've only been dealing with identical cars or super walls.  a massive truck can be going 25 and a small car going 50 that hits it head on might be thrown backwards - the truck might just be slowed down and not stop.  A massive object that's going slower might impart more force than a less massive object going faster</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Consider a car hitting its mirror image at 50mph.  Put a paper &quot;wall&quot; in between them.  Because they're identical, it doesn't even get crinkled.</p>
<p>Now consider that the paper is backed by a solid immovable wall.</p>
<p>From the viewpoint of the car, how can you tell the difference between those two situations?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of this discussion ignores a crucial part of the question: &quot;a fixed, <em>immovable</em> object&quot;. That changes the picture. A parked car is <em>not</em> immovable: it will crumple, and absorb its share of the energy.</p>
<p>So, moving car vs parked car, yes; moving car vs massive steel wall, no.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming perfectly elastic collisions (all energy is conserved), If the object has the same mass, is not fixed and is inertially still there there will be no difference since the difference in velocity is constant. If the object is fixed and immovable (an object of infinite mass) it will exert the same force back onto you at 50mph as an object of the same mass and opposite velocity to you colliding head on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
