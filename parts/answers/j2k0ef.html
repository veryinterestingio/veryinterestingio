		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I want to know what paths y'all took in high school that led you to becoming interested in specific careers in NASA. Was it mostly math and physics? Or were there clubs you were a part of that really set the ideas in motion that it was possible for you as a Latino to make it? Maybe trips to the Houston Space Center? I want to know I have decent answers for my brown baby when he grows up about what possibilities await him!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With what seems like a pretty aggressive schedule for returning people to the moon, are there already plans in place for the research to do there, is something now in development, or a little bit of both? Is research planned &quot;in house&quot; at NASA, solicited from other groups/nation's space agencies?  Anything that's been announced if so?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
