		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Looked this up a few weeks ago, this was the best answer I found</p>
<p><a href="https://www.infectiousdiseaseadvisor.com/home/topics/covid19/clinical-outcomes-of-ibuprofen-during-covid-19-coronavirus/" target="_blank">https://www.infectiousdiseaseadvisor.com/home/topics/covid19/clinical-outcomes-of-ibuprofen-during-covid-19-coronavirus/</a></p>
<p>TLDR: The study was unable to find a significant difference in outcomes between persons treated with ibprofen and those who were treated using a different painkiller (non NSAID). All noted differences between the two were values less than 1%.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: The sample size was smaller than desired due to the age range being limited 26-62 instead of the standard 20-80 with a total of 403 patients and an average age of 45 years. This data and conclusion are not all encompassing of a final decision from the medical community in the topic. However, it should open the door to further study of the events, especially with the resurgence occurring in certain areas of the world.</p>
<p>Edit: Removed personal conjecture about &quot;incredibly small sample size&quot; and added in a more appropriate statement regarding the ages of the test group.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There hasn't been substantiated evidence to suggest that ibuprofen negatively effects someone with COVID, but numerous case studies to suggest that it doesn't have any effect.  To my knowledge there hasn't been a major study done with thousands of people, but with everything COVID-related right now, that's difficult to do</p>
<p>As always, ask your doctor what they think is right for you, my guess is they will tell you it is fine to take.  As others have mentioned as well, if you have success taking it, then it probably isn't best to change based on hearsay that hasn't been supported with science and research</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a 65 year old man who had covid about a month ago, I can say I would have gone insane without Advil to relieve the muscle pain. I was really sick for about two days and then gradually improved over the next week and a half. Advil was a big help getting me through that and I'm not much of a pill taker. </p>
<p>I was aware of the question, and researched it again at the time, but the inconclusive answers were not enough to stop me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
