		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something causes a break between the layers of the skin - like heat that breaks connections between layers, or movement that mechanicaly tears it. The inner layers are living tissue, and so contain 'lumph'- the fluid that surrounds all living cells. This lymph pushes open that break made between layers, pushing the layers apart.</p>
<p>This is fine, however - left alone, the lower layer will seal over and become strong skin, the lymph will slowly be reabsorbed or leach through the skin, the top layer will dry up and flake off, leaving new, healthy skin. As long as the blister is left in tact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the structure of your skin layers is something like legos: you have ridges that fit together between the dermis and epidermis that keep them intact.  Most blisters are friction or shearing injuries, meaning the epidermis is pulled in the opposite direction of the dermis and those ridges are disconnected forming a pocket.  Part of the inflammatory process important to skin healing is moisture, so free interstitial fluid enters the pocket and fills it up.  If a blister is left intact then the epithelium can eventually restick to the dermal layer.  If itâ€™s ruptured then the epidermis dries out and sloughs off, leaving exposed dermis with lots of exposed nerve endings and no protection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Take a book or magazine, and imagine the pages are layers of skin.</p>
<p>Gently pet the pages, they don't move at all.</p>
<p>Now hold press down on a page and move your hand back and forth hard, the pages will seperate and get damaged. That seperation is what causes a blister. The seperation can't repair immediately so your body fills the cavity with fluid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
