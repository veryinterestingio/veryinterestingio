		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's sort of a semantic question depending on how you want to define the terms.  If you just generally decide that any hard structure outside the main body cavity is an exoskeleton, I think it's fair to say that turtles have both.  Although looking at a <a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dk-find-out/image/upload/q_80,w_1920,f_auto/DCTM_Penguin_UK_DK_AL674019_xat5zk.jpg" target="_blank">tortoise skeleton</a> shows that their shells are mostly composed of extensions of their ribs and vertebrae, so they are kind of &quot;hollow&quot; and don't really have any additional protection inside.  Perhaps a better example would be something like an armadillo, which still has a pretty <a href="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3361/3475185390_02d356bb0e_b.jpg" target="_blank">normal mammalian skeleton</a> underneath its shell.  I think a strong case could be made for <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/magazine/rights-exempt/2019/06/pangolins/pangolins-worldwide-trade-extinction-3.adapt.1900.1.ImmersiveLeadHorizontal.jpg" target="_blank">pangolins</a> as well.</p>
<p>I can also think of some good extinct contenders off the top of my head.  There are a few well-armoured dinosaurs, most obviously the ankylosaurians, but also some sauropods like <em>Saltasaurus</em> (<a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/008/316/648/large/paulo-leite-saltasaurus-3.jpg?1511964455" target="_blank">pictured together here</a>).  Another great example is the extinct group of fish called placoderms, of which the most famous representative is <a href="https://66.media.tumblr.com/4bd333166ee4166c5a0254084a14c3f3/tumblr_o1vxrufQZD1rj34fvo1_1280.jpg" target="_blank"><em>Dunkleosteus</em></a>.</p>
<p>Depending on how rigorous you want your definition of exoskeleton to be, you could even consider some species like crocodylians, which have <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/australian-freshwater-crocodile-osteoderms/pgFwhSt2SjUsCA" target="_blank">osteoderms</a> built into their skin as a form of protection.  Also, while all of the above examples are vertebrates that have evolved additional external coverings, there are probably some examples of the reverse (i.e., things with exoskeletons that developed more internal structure).  Some sponges have pretty complex internal skeletons, like the beautiful <a href="https://assets.catawiki.nl/assets/2019/5/30/9/4/7/9473ee58-0b56-43b8-bfb8-74ce3e3890fa.jpg" target="_blank">Venus' flower basket</a>.  I guess you could maybe count some echinoderms like sea urchins too (they do have a hard internal structure called <a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/85/243103479_a5a15d314c_z.jpg" target="_blank">Aristotle's lantern</a>) but I think that would be a bit more of a stretch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A follow-up question because from a layman's perspective, turtles and tortoises seem to have both an endo &amp; exoskeleton, but I'm not sure if their shells count as an exoskeleton or as an external extension of their endoskeletons (or if that sort of difference is meaningful in the first place).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The defining characteristics of both endo and exo skeletons are a) support b) protection and c) anchor points for muscle attachments.  The turtle and tortoise shells provide all 3 of these things, so can be considered exoskeletons as well as endoskeletons.</p>
<p>The Armadillo and Pangolin have a hard external covering that provides protection, but I don't think they have any muscle attachment points and they provide very little support.  You can prove me wrong if you like, especially about muscle attachment points, which I'm not certain of.</p>
<p>One exception is that when swimming the armadillo's shell traps air, so in that case it is providing support (buoyancy).  But swimming isn't an everyday occurrence for armadillos, so I don't think that counts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I recently learned that spiders have endoskeletons as well as exoskeletons. The endoskeleton is made up of plates of cartilage-like material instead of chitin, and acts as an anchor point for various muscles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
