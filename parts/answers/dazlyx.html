		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To put it simply, western music typically falls into two categories, Major scale (happy) and Minor scale (sad or dark etc). The scale depends on what notes are used and vice versa. So &quot;villian&quot; music is typically written in minor. This combined with social norms and possibly some neurological or evolutionary reactions makes us think &quot;evil&quot;. This &quot;evil&quot; sense is really driven home when a piece incorporates the flattened 5th (The 5th note in the scale is a semi tone lower). This is predominately done in metal music to evoke that feeling of &quot;evil&quot;. If you listen to Black sabbath, by Black Sabbath, from the album Black sabbath, you will hear this flattened 5th used to great effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nobody seems to understand the question. He's not asking about what notes are sinister, he's asking why they're sinister. What in evolution/society has made these notes invoke these emotions. Does some ancient predator sound like minor notes?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's partially due to the key. Songs in the minor key sound far more sinister. Here's the Imperial March in the major key and its in no way sinister like the original  <a href="https://youtu.be/B9MShtCg4fk" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/B9MShtCg4fk</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what has been said, there are also some cultural clues. Rhythm for example (regular sounds more ordered, syncopated sounds more archaic) or instrument timbre.</p>
<p>Warcraft 2 music (and a lot of video game music in general) is actually a great example for that. Human soundtrack is full of marches, that sound orderly, military, with horns and other brass instruments, to the same effect. Orc music is very syncopated, with irregular beats recalling barbaric nature of orcs, as well as a lot of harpsichord, which is perceived as an archaic instrument.</p>
<p>These clues are cultural, we associate them with those meanings because that's what popular culture has gotten us used to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Outside of musical theory, a lot of those associations with villains are just happenstance that evolved into cultural norms. For instance, the sub-genre of Surrealist music, intended as a musical representation of Dali-esque moods, became popular in French and German cinema that was intentionally unnerving or abstract. It started to creep into American films for a while (<em>The Maltese Falcon</em>, fuckin' <em>Fantasia</em>) before fading in the McCarthy-era 50's, where villain themes were your standard John Ford grandstanders. It's been brought back several times since then, but generally, it's the music you hear when a character reveals that they're batshit crazy, often accompanied by breaking glass sounds.</p>
<p>So an utterly specific sub-genre intended to reproduce the feelings you get looking at a melted clock painting from 102 years ago is now the music you hear when Dennis Hopper starts talking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
