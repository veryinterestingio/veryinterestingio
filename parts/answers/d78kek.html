The government tried to build a lab and could not get the base numbers for background radiation. It caused a rift in the scientific community for a while. Many scientists didnâ€™t believe it. In the end, it was discovered that all steel since the 40s is slightly radioactive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>These days the electronics used are sophisticated enough that we can compensate for the background radiation in most cases as far as I know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Nuclear engineer here.</p>
<p>We can detect extremely small quantities of isotopes. For instance, Cs-137 has a half-life of 30 years or so. We measure the activity of a source in decays per second and this unit is called a becquerel. 1mol of Cs-137 has an activity of 440 TBq. We can detect activity down to single digits of Bq. So 1Bq of Cs-137 is 0.311 picograms of Cs.</p>
<p>This is only about 1.3 billion atoms, a tiny, tiny amount. (Normally, we talk about septillions of atoms or more.)</p>
<p>Let's say your part is about 10g of iron. If the only impurity is Cs-137 (and ignoring self-shielding effects) must be at least 99.9999999999987% pure to not contain 1Bq of activity. The highest purity I've seen advertised is 8N or 99.999999% pure. This would require essentially 14N. It would be prohibitively expensive and perhaps beyond our current technology to make this.</p>
<p>This is why we source iron (and lead!) from the pre-Trinity era for radiological uses. It's way cheaper, and you'd have to ask materials guy if it's even possible to purify. I'd naively say no.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have to say, this whole post has been pretty fascinating. I never would've thought that nuclear detonations on one side of the Earth could impact what we can do with science and measurement around the globe.</p>
<p>I start to wonder whether there are measurements that would actually benefit from these radioactively contaminated materials being used to make the instruments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
