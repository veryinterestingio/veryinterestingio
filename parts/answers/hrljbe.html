I completed my master of applied statistics last year and when I was searching for a job I found alot of overlap between statistician jobs and data scientist roles. I've been told it's all a matter of marketing. What is your take on statistics vs data science?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What is the most important concept in statistics you think the general public doesn't understand?  </p>
<p>Do you think statistics being manipulated in the media and politics to distort facts is a problem? How would you counter this by educating the public?</p>
<p>I feel I often come across claims by politicians and journalists which seem to be founded in statistics, however, if you look deeper into the data and look at it in context it almost seems the data is used in a manipulative manner*. Somehow a lot of people just get away with just saying numbers, which instantly makes people think they are informed.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>*(E.g. country A has a growth of GDP twice as big as country B, and this is of course because [insert political agenda]. Then you look a bit at the data and see country B has three times greater GDP and at the current growth rate the &quot;distance&quot; is more-less maintained between the two.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
