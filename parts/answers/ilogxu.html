		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the first case (both objects at 0.5 c), the outcome would be 0.8 c. In the second case (both objects at 0.6 c) the outcome would be 0.882 c.</p>
<p>The way we add up velocities for everyday objects (v = v1 + v2) is just an approximation. It is an incredibly good approximation when the velocities are very small compared to the speed of light, but the closer you get to c, the more it will deviate from what we call &quot;relativistic addition of velocities&quot;. A result that directly follows from the special theory of relativity is that two velocities, in the scenario you described, should be added up as follows:</p>
<p>v = (v1 + v2) / (1 + v1 * v2 / c^(2))</p>
<p>If v1 and v2 are extremely small compared to c (so in everyday conditions on Earth), the denominator of this expression is very close to 1 and can be effectively ignored, which reduces the expression to the one we're familiar with: v = v1 + v2.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>u = 0.5c
v = -0.5c (negative because opposite direction) </p>
<p>u' = (u-v) /(1-uv/c^2 )</p>
<p>u'  = (0.5c - (-0.5c)) / (1- 0.5c * (-0.5c)/c^2 )</p>
<p>u'  = (1.0c) / (1.25)</p>
<p>u'  = 0.8c</p>
<p>Basically, compared to a &quot;normal&quot; one velocity take another (opposite direction vectors), we're accounting for relativity by diving by 1-uv/c^2. This is to ensure speed of light is same from all reference frames (which is how Einstein derived the equations). </p>
<p>For u = 0.6c and V = - 0.6c, u'= 0.882c (3 decimal places).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The x value corresponds to the fraction of the speed of light each object is travelling. y value is the apparent speed as a fraction of the speed of light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>aka, they are traveling away from eachother from that point on at the speed light travels, so the image from where the pass is the last time they can see the photons?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that almost this exact question is what motivated Einstein to derive the theory of relativity. We had strong theoretical evidence that light appears to have the same speed no matter how fast you're going, and experimental evidence that confirmed it. So Einstein came up with the theory to explain how if I'm standing still and you're moving at 0.5c (from my perspective), we both see light as moving at exactly c.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
