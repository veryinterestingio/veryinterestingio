		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On an iPhone at least inside the A series CPUs is a coprocessor that is always running, ultra low power and basically runs a deep neural net looking for the &quot;Hey, Siri&quot; phrase along with a few other things (motion data is the other big one). This coprocessor is extremely specialized, extremely simple, and uses next to no power because of that. Once it thinks it has heard &quot;Hey, Siri&quot; it sends a message to fire up the main CPU and process the rest of the message.</p>
<p>There's <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/hey-siri" target="_blank">a really good paper</a> that Apple wrote about how the deep neural net distinguishes the sounds if you want to go deeper.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The biggest drain on your battery is the LED/OLED screen of your phone. It's like 80% of the power usage, if not more. The graphics processing of the processor ramps up when the screen is on and it has to generate picture. Plus it's a giant flashlight that lights up. When you aren't using your phone, one CPU core can just be running to maintain your connection to the 4G/5G and the network, keeping track of time, updating notifications, etc. It's not even using all 4/6/8 or whatever cores in the processor. That's why your battery drains much slower when you just leave it in your pocket all day and never look at it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Phones run with most (if not all) hardware functions constantly on, with varying degrees of power usage. Power management is built into the OS and dynamically reallocates power as needed at the time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
