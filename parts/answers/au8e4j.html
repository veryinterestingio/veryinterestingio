		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, the main differences between an amorphous solid and crystalline is long range vs. short range order. This is basically saying that the crystal has a &quot;perfect&quot; structure that continues &quot;forever&quot; while the glass does not. That perfect structure has more distinct modes that can do things like absorb or transmit very specific frequencies of light or heat. The glass, on the other hand, has less distinct bands meaning that I can see out a glass window as no specific frequency (in the visible spectrum) is being absorbed. That is a very short introduction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main difference is the order of the atoms that form the solid. Crystalline solids feature long-range order, which essentially means that the structure is perfectly repeating itself, to the point that if you move around the crystal you don't know where you are since there are no reference points. In amorphous materials like glass you do not have this long-range order, but rather short range order, meaning that wherever you are, the close distribution is predictable but things start to seem random the farther you look. You can imagine the difference being the same between a <a href="http://www.redwoodhikes.com/GOT/GOT3.jpg" target="_blank">normal forest</a> where the trees are roughly the same distance from one another due to them competing for root space but with no real ordering, and an <a href="https://media2.trover.com/T/5484618ad809d830a1001964/fixedw_large_4x.jpg" target="_blank">artificial forest</a> where the trees have been planted regularly.</p>
<p>There are many consequences to this. In general, in crystalline solids the periodic long-range order favors phenomena which are purely quantum, like electron band formation (due to the quantum wave behavior of electrons in a periodic system) or the quantum treatment of vibrations (called phonons). Another important difference is that in crystals, solid-liquid phase transitions are abrupt since you have to create and annihilate long range order instantly, while in amorphous materials <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_transition" target="_blank">transitions</a> are more gradual and over a range of temperature (rather than at a specific transition temperature), since you can gradually increase the randomness of the system as you go from an amorphous solid to a liquid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>there is a great book by Steve Brower about this topic, he argues that the state is towards a liquid, in the sense ,as was pointed out already , that the time it takes to arrange itself. Corning once did a study where they simulated a 'perfect annealing' curve to determine if, given enough tie, that the phase transition could come to an end, i think they came up with a number like 10,000 years ( the amount of time that the glass was able to cool slow enough to arrange itself in order) . the argument still is going as to whether it is a solid or a liquid...we just dont know yet but the consensus is that it is a liquid behaving on a different time scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One aspect to this may be that crystals like to grow in a certain way, and they may continue to grow that way as they push into other structures.  Amorphous solidification responds more to the pressure from the stuff around it, because it doesn't so much have a preferred way it wants to form, or may not have time to arrange in that way but rather gets frozen where it is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
