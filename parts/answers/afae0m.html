		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spicy plants tend to grow in warmer places. Like southern Asia and Africa. Not so much in Europe and northern Asia (though truth be told not much at all grows well in northern Asia). The same is true in the Americas, so when spicy plants like chilis were imported by European traders and colonizers, they couldn't cultivate new world peppers in Europe, but they thrived in eastern colonies and trading partners.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
