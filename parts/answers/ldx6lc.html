		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several vaccine manufacturers are currently enrolling trials for ages 12-17 (or 12-15). Of all goes well, vaccines for those age groups could be approved in the US in 2021. Trials for age &lt;12 will likely come after with approvals not expected until 2022.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before anyone can get a vaccine, it has to be approved by the appropriate regulatory agency (in the US, that’s the FDA). In general, the FDA approves vaccines that have safety and efficacy data, and that generally comes from Phase 3 clinical trials. The two vaccines that have been <del>approved</del> authorized so far (Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna) were tested in people 18 and up, and Pfizer added 16-18-year olds partway through their trial with the FDA’s approval. That’s why those vaccines are <del>approved</del> authorized for 18-plus (Moderna) and 16-plus (Pfizer).</p>
<p>So the vaccine will be available for kids under 16 when the FDA approves it, and that will be once the trials are reviewed.  Both Pfizer and Moderna have started trials for kids 12-16, but only recently (December/January), and Pfizer only just completed recruiting <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/22/pfizer-says-its-covid-vaccine-trial-for-kids-ages-12-to-15-is-fully-enrolled.html" target="_blank">at the end of January</a>. So we are probably several months away from even starting the approval process for them, and the others are further back (Johnson and Johnson, which just submitted its vaccine data for approval, only included 18-plus in that trial).</p>
<p>So if all goes well, we can probably expect FDA approval for vaccination of 12-plus in mid-summer, ish, for Pfizer, maybe a little later for Moderna, and even later for J&amp;J.</p>
<p>I don’t know much about the status of vaccines approved in other countries. AstraZeneca’s vaccine was approved in the UK for 18-plus; I believe they had a trial planned for younger children but haven’t started it. I don’t know about the Russian or Chinese vaccines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They still need to do trials for kids under 16 to make sure it’s not going to affect adolescents differently than adults. There’s no reason to believe that it will, but when it comes to science and medicine it’s never a good idea to make assumptions; everything needs to be thoroughly researched and tested.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is really a regulatory question. There's no particular reason to think the COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous to children or adolescents, so it's plausible some national regulators will permit children to get shots on their own time, without study data in children specifically. </p>
<p>However, some of the vaccine manufacturers are running studies with adolescents. Those will take roughly 3 months to report.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Answer: When studies are completed for minors. Initial studies for vaccines approved for EUA did not study people under 18 or those who had previous severe reactions to vaccines, so those groups will not be eligible until further studies on those groups are complete. We have not been told that timeline, so no one knows or can give a definitive timeline.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
