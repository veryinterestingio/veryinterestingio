		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing I haven't seen here is that wireless systems are designed to use the least amount of power thats needed.</p>
<p>When it is looking for a wireless network to connect to, your phone will turn its wifi antennas on at full, maximum power to find a known network. Once a network is found, your phone will connect to it and then lower its wifi power to what is reasonable and needed to pass data without having to repeat packets.</p>
<p>For the first few moments, you will probably see a stronger signal before the device adjusts its power usage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple reasons this can happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Your WiFi router might be set to choose its operating frequency on startup, based on interference with other wireless devices in its environment. So, it might’ve chosen a frequency that was not interfering then, but it does now (e.g. your neighbours started their WiFi router in the meantime). When you reset, it’ll choose a better frequency. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your WiFi router might have limited hardware / firmware capabilities, so after a while its memory / buffers become full and a restart erases them. This usually happens with cheaper ones. </p>
</li>
<li>Your WiFi router, especially if it’s in a public place like a café or a restaurant, might give out addresses to connected devices for a longer time than neccessary - the default is usually 48 hours. So, if its hardware / firmware supports only 1,000 addresses, it’ll give those out really fast and will run out of new addresses for new customers / devices, until one of them becomes free. The reserved address for a client remains for the 48 hours, regardless the fact that the customer maybe used it for 30-60 minutes and left. So, restarting the router will erase this assignment of addresses, and it’ll once again have 1,000 addresses to give out. </li>
</ol>
<p>There are other reasons as well, but these are the ones off the top of my head.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also when tech supports suggests to unplug and plug in your modem. It’s not a dumb step that is meant to waste time and annoy you, there is a reason behind it. Most newer modems have Automatic Channel Scan. When your modem boots up, it locks into the channel with the least congestion. </p>
<p>Over time, more and more devices in your area join the channel and bog it down. Rebooting your modem will now automatically connect to the NEW best channel. It’s recommended to reboot your modem once a month for this reason. That’s why unplugging it and plugging it in again is a legitimate troubleshooting step.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you take your finger and pluck a guitar string, or push a paino key that moves a hammer to hit a steel string, you make a beautiful sound.  We learned early on sound is a wave.  We know a workbench radio is the same idea with one complication: the radio wave can carry music but it is translated to a high frequency we can't hear but can go a long ways.  Then the machine picks up the signal with an antenna and modulates the frequency to a frequency humans can hear (AM, FM too but more details).</p>
<p>You ever use a radio while puttering around the shop then suddenly the signal gets bad?  Play with the bunny esrs, curse the truck that shook the earth, or thee UFO overhead.  Hit the dang thing.  Suddenly Sinatra is crystal clear as you know it ought to be.</p>
<p>This is interference.  Waves move at different speeds and distort in different materials.  </p>
<p>Multiply the problem by a million.  Wifi.  Wifi doesn't work because it's not possible to balance the billion little problems with humans, cats, whatever sitting between you and the source.</p>
<p>But what if fancy math, like the exact equations made for rocket science, could detect, modulate, predict, adjust, and make a strong connection?  </p>
<p>So you have this dynamic math equation doing 1 milllion calculations based on your real environment.  But it all comes from that initial judgement of where you are.  Wifi does this.  Reconnect and all those equations start fresh and its like:  you can't understand the big picture if you took a wrong turn in a cornmaze then can't find a way back for beans.  But get transported to the beginning with a map again?  Better odds since you aren't ALREADY  lost.  </p>
<p>The below factor of connecting to the closest place is one such factor.  But wifi technology is predicated on literal rocket science to make the normally unworkable, possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
