		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other poster’s response, it should be noted that eidetic memory as depicted in pop culture is not real. At least, no adult has ever been able to pass tests to prove they have this sort of perfect recall. Occasionally a young child will test highly but they always grow out of it. Occasionally an adult will pass but then be found to have been cheating.</p>
<p>There are mental conditions that persist to adulthood that can improve areas of your memory but to put it more accurately most of these disorders are believed to involve the person becoming obsessed with remembering hyperspecific things rather than natural recall. They would not be able to pass most general eidetic memory tests. Often such disorders harm the patient’s overall mental health more than they do good.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I was in high school, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">Kim Peek</a> came to speak to our class. His brain was the interest of multiple research studies and at the time they estimated it would take 120 years to max it out. I have no idea if that part was true or not, but he demonstrated counting change by the sound of (an audience volunteer) dropping a handful on a table. He could even differentiate Canadian currency. He read phone books for fun, I grew up in a different state and he new my previous neighbors name from the phone number. It was pretty incredible. Also, he passed around the Oscar from Rain Man. So yeah, all around a pretty cool guy. Sorry I got off topic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Photographic memory is a myth, eidetic memory exists. More common in children, rare in adults. It just simply means to have a slight longer afterimage. But the ability to recall things entirely because of a true photographic memory doesn’t exist or at least could never be verified.
Memory storage is a different chapter. Miller’s law says you can perceive 7+- 2 items in your short-term memory. Consolidation/rehearsal transfers this information to your long-term memory. The amount of things you can store depends on how many you perceived and how many of those you rehearse.</p>
