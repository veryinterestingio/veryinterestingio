		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually I do remember that there was a study on the more “digestive” version of COVID that did indeed theorize that where it enters the body is important foe the symptoms. Something like if it enters your eyes instead of your nose you could have more digestive then bronchial issues.</p>
<p>Edit: here’s one of those studies, I still can’t find the one about actual point of contact though: <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2020/04/stomach-complaints-common-in-covid-19-patients.html" target="_blank">https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2020/04/stomach-complaints-common-in-covid-19-patients.html</a></p>
<p>But as this one says there is a digestive to bronchial pathway so, eh, who knows</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think your question is about how two things are related to symptoms 1) Infectious dose, and 2) Infected cell types and tissues/upper vs. lower airways as primary site of infection.</p>
<p>There's been research on both (a few examples below), and reframing your question with the above points in mind might yield better results in literature searches. (i.e. it may help to convert &quot;surface contact&quot; to low infectious dose and lower airway infection to get more results.) </p>
<p>For aspects of your questions that are not really specific to SARS-CoV-2 but to how infected cell types/tissues are related to the primary source of the virus's spread, maybe you'll find more looking further back in the literature or at basic texts (vs. studies) using field-specific search terms (e.g. &quot;pharyngitis&quot; for sore throat, &quot;olfactory dysfunction&quot; for loss of smell)</p>
<p>Viral inocula influencing disease manifestations, mentions that in &quot;viral infections in which host immune responses play a predominant role in viral pathogenesis, such as SARS-CoV-2, high doses of viral inoculum can overwhelm and dysregulate innate immune defenses, increasing the severity of disease.&quot; <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2026913" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2026913" target="_blank">https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2026913</a></a></p>
<p>Hamsters with infected with higher dose of SARS-CoV-2 had worse outcomes <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/28/16587" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/28/16587" target="_blank">https://www.pnas.org/content/117/28/16587</a></a> and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/71/16/2139/5848814" target="_blank"><a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/71/16/2139/5848814" target="_blank">https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/71/16/2139/5848814</a></a></p>
<p>Evidence that cells in the nose are key entry point for SARS-CoV-2 also may explain COVID-19 associated olfactory dysfunction <a href="https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/56/3/2001948" target="_blank"><a href="https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/56/3/2001948" target="_blank">https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/56/3/2001948</a></a></p>
<p>Also recommend the r/COVID19 weekly questions thread for getting responses with cited studies and not personal hunches.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the more apropos question is this: &quot;What is the clinical presentation of COVID-19.&quot;  And perhaps a better question is: &quot;What is our understanding of the clinical presentation of COVID-19?&quot;</p>
<p>Those are two different questions.  I would invite you to look into our <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=COVID+infecton+clinical+presentation" target="_blank">PubMed database</a> for the nearly daily updates. </p>
<p>The short answer to your questions would not be satisfactory, as this is ongoing clinical research.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
