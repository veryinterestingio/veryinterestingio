		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One important consideration is the constant body position. Sitting around the house when you're relaxing, you'll be shifting positions periodically, leaning forward, leaning back, bearing more weight on your hipbones or your thighs, lifting or crossing or uncrossing your legs, etc.</p>
<p>A long car or plane ride doesn't give you nearly as much freedom to do that. The sitting position is pretty rigid, and you might be able to lean the seat further back or more upright, but that's typically about all the freedom you get. Add to this the fact that you're actively balancing even as you sit, if there is any wobbling, bumpiness or G-forces on the ride. You can't fully relax in a car because muscles in your back and abdomen are constantly responding to the little lateral forces produced by handling the car. Depending on the size of the plane and the air conditions, the same might be true on a flight.</p>
<p>Finally, the sensory input can be mentally exhausting. Highway driving is noisy, and can expose you to pretty fast-moving visual scenery which, even if you're not really paying attention to it, your brain might be noticing and spending some energy on. Planes in flight are also very loud places to be. That can wear you down and push you toward mental fatigue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While it is not necessary physically exhausting, it also isn't mentally relaxing. There is constant low level stimulation above a level that would allow you to relax. You have plans to keep in mind, other people to constantly be aware of, etc etc. The whole situation, while not necessarily <em>un</em>familiar, is hardly like being plonked down in your house. Your brain does a surprisingly large amount of extra subconscious work while &quot;out and about&quot; just keeping an eye on everything that could change. For 20 minutes this can be recovered from almost without noticing, for 7 hours though? Well that starts to wear you down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is constant stimuli that you are managing. Noise, vibration, motion, holding yourself in an uncomfortable position. These all take a toll. </p>
<p>When I was flying a lot, I started wearing earplugs and it made a huge difference on how I felt after a flight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pilot here.  Moisture and quiet are your friends.  Neither are plentiful in planes where the air is dry and the noise is constant.  We use noise cancelling headsets and they make a huge difference.  Investing in something like the Bose QC35 for consumers can be very smart.  Also, drink a bunch of water before you get on the plane, and then drink more throughout the flight.  And whatever you do, try to avoid alcohol. It dries you out.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Pro tip: bring an empty water bottle with you through security and then fill it up from a water fountain near the gate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
