		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I JUST went through a voyage of discovery on this exact question! We're like brain buddies!</p>
<p>Basically, the first spiders were venomous burrowing critters. They most likely had a mucus like secretion that helped form and hold the walls of their homes.</p>
<p>Over time this mucus ended up helping to incapacitate prey which placed a naturally selective pressure on those that used it offensively in addition to constructively.</p>
<p>Over even MORE time (millions of years, likely) those secretions became more refined and the spiders could use it as a soggy kind of net by dragging it around the top of low grass or plants.</p>
<p>Eventually it moved from there to the refined sticky silk we all know and love today.</p>
<p>Mind you, we don't have a fossil record of any of this, but many smart people have independently told me that this is the most likely evolutionary route taken.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can see perhaps how an animal which excreted some waste product (maybe) caught prey and then this was refined. Interesting that only spiders afaik do this. Why don't some birds for example make traps using their nesting ability? Maybe there are birds that do?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
