<p>There's no good way to control this research unfortunately. Your suggestion of using a &quot;random person&quot; would also lead to problems, because the subjects would probably realize halfway through whether their therapist was a professional or a layperson (which would lead to <a href="https://www.noclor.nhs.uk/active-research/unblinding" target="_blank">unblinding</a>).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't answer your exact question but I can let you in on another important factor affecting the vast majority of psych studies. About 10 years ago  they did a large meta study of published psychology papers and found that virtually every paper published suffers from the exact same bias. They almost all get the vast majority of their subjects from within the psychology field. How much of a problem this is will vary from paper to paper but it is a big problem, in general. It would be a problem in any field but for psychology it is extremely bad given the nature of the questions being asked. The entire field essentially needs a reboot but that'll never happen so we pretend it isn't the huge problem it is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is recent evidence to suggest that &quot;placebo psychotherapists&quot; can be effective in improving mood and reducing stress.</p>
<p>In one study (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-37945-1" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-37945-1</a>) placebo psychotherapists did not provide any real treatment but were effective in improving outcomes when they were trustworthy, friendly, and empathetic. These effects were present only when the placebo psychotherapists demonstrated those qualities.</p>
<p>So, to answer your question, it seems that people who are not experts but show friendly and empathetic qualities may be able to induce positive outcomes in clients. However, one could argue that this raises ethical issues!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you're asking the wrong question.</p>
<p>Psychotherapy simply means therapy for the mind.  It encompasses a lot of reason for why someone might need therapy.  Because of this, there are going to be a large number of methods for therapy.</p>
<p>So I think a question that makes more sense is asking about which methods are effective and which aren't.  There are certainly scientific experiments for used methods.</p>
<p>The success of a trained therapist compared to a random person would really be a question of who knows and executes the methods better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR: a random person would be able to conduct therapy to a certain extent but would struggle with factors such as credibility, and reliability with high risk clients. </p>
<p>There have been studies showing that in person therapy is better than watching movies, reading a book or even conducting teletherapy. The in-person aspect is very important. But what about a professional vs a random person?</p>
<p>The most important factor in psychotherapy is therapeutic alliance. One other poster in this thread points out that factors such as theoretical orientation, age, sex and experience have been found to have small effect sizes compared to alliance. This can be misleading however and does not mean any of these factors are insignificant. In fact many of them heavily factor into alliance. </p>
<p>As a quick example, let’s say you have a victim of sexual assault by a male perpetrator. This client will likely build rapport faster (at least initially) with a female therapist. Sex is now a very significant factor. Similarly, what if you went into your therapy office and met your therapist who happened to be a 18 year old vs meeting your therapist who introduces themselves as a doctor. This age difference may not matter to some and it’s possible the 18 year old is a far superior therapist, but it will likely affect early therapeutic alliance in some ways. </p>
<p>There are a number of goals for effective psychotherapy along with realistic timelines. Building hope and therapeutic alliance can be done within the first few sessions, which is vital for therapy retention and early progress (it takes a number of further sessions to decrease symptoms and increase well-being). Much of this early therapy is exploratory and focused on building rapport. These are things that anyone could do! Even your random stranger!</p>
<p>However, from experience, I can say that training clinics for new therapists struggle heavily with retention. The statistical mode for sessions attended in these clinics is 1. Why is this? One factor is that they frequently take clients with lower income and less time for therapy. However, it is also likely that therapeutic alliance is not being established as quickly. This could be due to low experience but there is another factor. Many clients are untrusting of “fledgling student therapists”. These clinics suggest the student therapists talk about the fact that they are young and new to the field quickly with their clients to address any misgivings (however clients are not always so open). </p>
<p>Now imagine we took someone off the street. We could find the kindest, most empathetic, charismatic person, but if you knew they were not a therapist, you should rightly have some misgiving about their therapy skills. This will slow the buildup of therapeutic alliance even if they could do a halfway decent job. There is also one reason why this experiment would never get past an ethics board and why a therapist off the street would be a liability. Many people could do fairly well helping a client with anxiety or depression. However, now imagine an actively suicidal client or any other of a slew of high risk clients that therapists see every day. Someone off the street could kill them! </p>
<p>In conclusion, a random person could do therapy to an extent. However, their lack of credentials are likely to reduce therapeutic alliance, they are at higher risk of making a critical mistake that could endanger or traumatize their client, and they will not be trained in boundaries like professional therapists. There is a reason you aren’t supposed to be friends with your therapist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
