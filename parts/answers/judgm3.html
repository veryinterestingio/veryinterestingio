		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Though this looks like karst terrain (which is a formation from the dissolution of soluble rocks such as limestone) this area is not limestone, it’s mostly quartz-sandstone, and is not thought to be the product of chemical erosion. It’s believed instead to be the product of many, many years of physical erosion mostly in the form of the expanding ice in the winter and from the plants that grow on the peaks. The material weathered by the ice and plants is then mostly carried away by streams.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://www.zjj4u.com/tips_242.htm" target="_blank">Here is a breakdown of the geologic history for you</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the formation being sandstone and not limestone, the formation process was actually quite similar, mainly being a result of fractures followed by weathering via water.</p>
<p>This far from the only place in the world with this sort of landscape, but almost all the others have the pillars scattered much further apart.  The US southwest, for example, has extensive areas of similar sandstone towers, but their spacing is greater and they don’t have the forests on them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have a mistaken assumption. There are other karst landscapes that look similar in other places. North Vietnam has some. Borneo has some. Doubtless there are others. Yes, it is spectacular, but no... It's not the only one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
