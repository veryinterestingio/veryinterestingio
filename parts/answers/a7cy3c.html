		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another reason is because when you look in the mirror, you are aware of your nonverbal behaviors/body language: facial expressions, gestures, etc.  You can see if you smile is crooked, you are squinting, slouching, your arm is bent oddly, or what not, and immediately change to a &quot;better&quot; looking face/pose.  When taking a photo or video, you don't have that immediate feedback, so don't change to a more flattering look. </p>
<p>This is why actors practice facial expressions in the mirror, so they can look on camera or stage how they want to. <a href="https://www.castittalent.com/blog/2011/10/mastering-your-facial-expressions/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.castittalent.com/blog/2011/10/mastering-your-facial-expressions/" target="_blank">https://www.castittalent.com/blog/2011/10/mastering-your-facial-expressions/</a></a> </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>That's just focal length, there are other issues with photographs - bad lighting, white balance, distortion in the lens, but the very simple answer is that a mirror is a relatively accurate reflection (albeit flipped, of course), but a photograph has many sources of inaccuracy.  A good photographer uses those sources of inaccuracy to make their subject look better, but most times it makes the subject look worse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Knowing your angles and finding your light are absolutely crucial things to transferring from 3d to 2d the way you are used to seeing yourself. Models (and all the people you may be envious of for being so photogenic) use this to their advantage, and you are subconciously  (and way, way unfairly) comparing their ability to your own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
