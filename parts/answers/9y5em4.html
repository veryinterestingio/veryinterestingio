		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nobody mentioned this, but the Voyager missions were created to take advantage of an unusual planetary alignment. They gravity whipped around several planets as they went outward, both saving on fuel, and getting great close-ups of them. </p>
<p>Normally a mission like that would only fly by one, maybe two, and never have enough fuel to break solar orbit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to offer one correction, Voyager does not use solar power. Had it been dependant on this it would long ago have shut down due to its distance from the Sun. </p>
<p>Voyager uses a unique nuclear power supply where the heat from slowly decaying radioactive material is converted to electricity. </p>
<p>In the 20+ years the Voyager probes have been in space the power generated has dropped by about a third. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also just to be clear, neither Voyager is &quot;some light years&quot; away.  It's about 14 billion miles away, but it'll take another 20,000 years at its current rate to get 1 light year away from us. Space is huge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The great thing about space travel is that there isn't anything to slow you down. This means that we can leave voyager doing its own thing and it will just keep going until it hits something. Voyager is one a one way ticket away from earth and one day it will stop sending us data, but it will still be out there. As for why we can't do it with people is simple. Humans generally want to come back home or would at least like to know where they are going. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of Voyager like an arrow. Once fired it doesn't need fuel to keep moving. We aimed it in a way that made it pass by large planets the craft would &quot;fall&quot; towards and using a little fuel can sling shot out from. The Earth appeared the size of 1 pixel while Voyager was 3.7 billion miles /6 billion km and was taken in 1990. Voyager is now 11.7 billion miles/18.8 billion km away moving at 38,000mph/61,000kph.</p>
<p>A light year is 5,879,000,000,000 miles/9.461x10^12 km so Voyager is only 0.2% of a light year away.</p>
<p>The amazing part is that we are able to pick up the signal it is sending. The transmitter uses less power than the light bulb in your microwave. By the time the signal reaches Earth it is only one-tenth of a billion-trillionth of a watt.</p>
<p>Human's can't leave Earth like that for a few major reasons.      </p>
<p>1 safety. There is no way to shield astronauts from radiation or avoid the side effects of weightlessness.         </p>
<p>2 weight. Humans and everything we need to stay alive weigh a lot.         </p>
<p>3 space is huge. The Moon is a 3 day trip, Mars when closest is months. From there you're talking years of travel. And when you get to these places you have to survive them, and they are as extreme as you can imagine.</p>
