		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>chocolate milk has emulsifiers to keep it mixed that prevents the oreo from soaking up the milk in the same way. If you use nesquick, it does not have emulsifiers, and should not have a similar milk absorbance to store-bought chocky milk</p>
<p>EDIT: I'm gonna add a few more notes after seeing the comments below.
note - I'm from the US so if milk is different in different countries than I apologize, but this is true for the US.</p>
<p><strong>1: Why doesn't regular milk need emulsified?</strong></p>
<p>when you buy milk from the store its pasteurized and homogenized.</p>
<p>The pasteurization kills bacteria to keep the milk safe to drink.</p>
<p>The homogenization takes the milk fat globules and reduces them in size and to be uniformly dispersed through the rest of the milk. Without this process, the milk would separate.</p>
<p><strong>2: Why and what are emulsifers</strong></p>
<p>Chocolate milk has emulsifiers. These are chemicals that keep the chocolate in the milk evenly mixed and prevent settling of be chocolate. This is why store bought chocolate milk taste better because emulsifiers are fatty and delicious but not healthy so people would rather mix healthier chocolate powder</p>
<p>The emulsifiers will combine with the milk particles to make bigger combinations of molecules. This is not a chemical reaction, but caused by the polarities of molecules bringing them together and keeping them mixed up well. This bigger molecules will not go into the oreo, as the milk is not easy to get away from its surrounded molecules, and the emulsifiers to do permeate the cookie. These emulsifiers will also raise surface tension which makes it harder for the milk to permeate the cookie.</p>
<p>The egg used when baking is an emulsifer to get everything to mix together when they normally wouldn't want to.</p>
<p>I don't know how to type it on reddit but this is where you would have like</p>
<p>Fe2S03 DOT 6H20, where the molecule has 6 water molecules around it, but they aren't chemically combined.</p>
<p><strong>3: Why is store bought chocolate milk emulsified when homemade chocolate milk is not</strong>
Premade chocolate milk needs to be emulsified because its shipped, kept in stores, and not drank all at once at your house.</p>
<p>Regular milk doesn't need emulsified because its homogenized which is a different chemical process that keeps the milk particles suspended.</p>
<p>Homemade chocolate milk will settle if it sits on your counter for a long time. This doesn't matter that much since you just make one cup at a time.</p>
<p><strong>4: Explain this to a five year old</strong>
Chocolate milk from the store is milk with chocolate. Chocolate and milk are different so if they sit in the same container for a long time, the chocolate will fall to the bottom. That's why homemade chocolate milk will separate into a layer of chocolate at the bottom and milk at the top if you let it sit out for a long time.  Store bought chocolate milk needs to stay mixed because people don't want to buy chocolate milk if its separated. Since storebought chocolate milk is manufactured, shipped to a store, held there, purchased, brought home, and drank later, it needs to stay mixed for days or weeks.  This can be done using chemicals that keep the chocolate mixed evenly in the milk. These chemicals are tasty, but not healthy, and called emulsifiers. These will keep the chocolate mixed up for a long time. Regular milk doesn't need this because homogenization is an action done to milk to keep it mixed evenly. Homogenization means making the whole gallon uniform.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
