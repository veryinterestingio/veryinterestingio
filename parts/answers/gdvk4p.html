<p>My first thought is that they are extracting some specific reaction product from solution. Crystallization is used in chemistry to purify substances all the time. Spent nuclear fuel is a witches brew of all sorts of interesting substances, and a huge amount of work is required to separate uranium and plutonium containing compounds from the assortment of other stuff produced.</p>
<p>Judging only from your summary, sounds like someone may have made an advance in separating out a common uranium compound (most reactors run predominantly on uranium and not plutonium) from the rest of the sludge by crystallizing it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pulling all the actinides together makes it more proliferation resistant.  The vast majority of actinide isotopes are unsuitable for weapons and must be purified out to make a warhead.</p>
<p>Reprocessing has traditionally involved separating out each actinide and thus inadvertently creating a process and a store of material from commercial sources that could be used for weapons.</p>
<p>This process, by not separating all the actinides out prevents that issue. It can't be used to create weapons nor does it create stores of weapons capable material. </p>
<p>But it still separates the fission byproducts.  And that is enough to create a product that is useable for commercial plants. It may not be as useful as new enriched uranium, it depends on the mixture.   But there are methods that make a full actinide reprocessing possible with light water reactors with enough wait time (50+ years) between use and each reprocessing.  (been awhile since I worked with this, will hunt for the paper if you are interested)  Something that might actually be feasible as our oldest fuel approaches that age.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Guessing this article.  <a href="https://phys.org/news/2020-05-reveals-single-step-strategy-recycling-nuclear.html" target="_blank">https://phys.org/news/2020-05-reveals-single-step-strategy-recycling-nuclear.html</a>  </p>
<p>When in a reactor, uranium is bombarded with neutrons.  The uranium both undergoes fission and absorbs neutrons to become heavier atoms (plutonium, neptunium and americium).  The fission products undergo further decay, creating more elements and radiation.  Some of the elements easily absorb neutrons, greatly decreasing the nuclear reactivity of the fuel.  </p>
<p>As a result, when the fuel gets to about 70% uranium, the spent fuel is no longer useful and is classified as waste.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>used fuel rods contain fission products, leftover uranium and small quantities of plutonium, neptunium and americium  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>To reduce the mass of nuclear waste, and recoup the unused fuel portion of the spent fuel, the spent fuel can be processed to separate out the components.  However the plutonium in the spent fuel can be used as a nuclear fuel for both reactors and nuclear bombs.  To reduce the spread of nuclear bomb material (non-proliferation), regulations are in place to not separate out or enrich plutonium.  </p>
<p>This new crystallization process claims to separate the uranium easily to greater than 90% purity without overly enriching plutonium.  Basically, the spent fuel is dissolved in nitric acid, and uranium rich crystals are formed and separated from the other elements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A little bit of background is that there has been a long push to develop &quot;Fast Reactors&quot; that are unmoderated (hence fast neutrons) because they solve the nuclear fuel dilemma by burning actinides (the stuff common in nuclear waste) and getting energy out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast-neutron_reactor" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast-neutron\_reactor" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast-neutron\_reactor</a></a> .<br />
However, fast reactors need more highly enriched fuel because fast neutrons have smaller cross-sections so reactions are less likely. <em>Technically it is more complicated than this, Im sure someone in the comments will explain in detail</em>.  <em>I would suggest this as a start</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYu7z3I8tdEnTQMXpP6gYN9DVm_DjXza9" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYu7z3I8tdEnTQMXpP6gYN9DVm\_DjXza9" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYu7z3I8tdEnTQMXpP6gYN9DVm\_DjXza9</a></a>.<br />
But enriched fuel is a problem if you are concerned about nuclear weapons proliferation. So what we want is a method of enriching fuel that doesn't lead to proliferation. Well, there is one way to do that. Turns out actinides are the worst for making nuclear weapons, they make the bomb fizzle or likely to go off in your own silo. So if you can enrich the fuel but enrich the actinides along with the plutonium and uranium then you are golden.<br />
And it seems like that is exactly what these Aggies have done. They precipitate the U, Pu, Np, &amp; Am all together so the actinides get included foiling any would-be Iranian or North Korean bomb builder.  </p>
<p>Now the problem is getting reactors that can use this stuff. And good luck with that one. Nuclear power is hated by the left-wing greenies and the right-wing coal nuts. And it's hated so much so that no new reactor tech has been OK since the 1970s.  Honestly, that scares me, a lot of safety developments have been made since then. Heck, I bet the reactor code is still in Cobol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The idea is that this process would separate the U and TRU (transuranics) together.  That's what makes it &quot;proliferation resistant&quot; compared to methods that extract nearly pure Pu and U separately.  This U+TRU fuel could be burned further in thermal or fast reactors.  It's unlikely that such recycled fuel would be cheaper to make than fresh enriched U.  The tiny amount of fuel needed to run nuclear power plants is well established.  How pro-nuclear folks ever let the strength of small amounts of waste with multiple solutions turn into a weakness from a PR standpoint is beyond me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
