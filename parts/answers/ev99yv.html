		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Teacher in my 7th year here! Lots of people hit the bigger points; you get the feedback too late. Kids also have a tendency to just toss out graded work once they glance at the grade. BUT, last year and this year, I've started something new, which is putting up the answer key and having my students grade themselves AND write a short paragraph on what they missed/how they can improve (I teach environmental science to juniors). The reflective piece is what gets graded; I don't care what you got wrong, I just care that you KNOW what you got wrong. </p>
<p>It took a WHILE to convince my students this wasn't a trick, &quot;I got everything wrong last night....is it a zero?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;.....are you sure?&quot; And had to elaborate over and over again that it is NOT in their best interest to just look at the answer key, since I pick difficult problems on purpose that even my high-fliers couldn't get full points on. </p>
<p>However, once they trusted me, grades on assessments have SHOT up (and I use similar assessments year to year, so my tests aren't easier). Class discussions are stronger, tension and anxiety during tests has gone down, and overall they are growing more comfortable in just trying AND learning from their mistakes.</p>
<p>Edit: WOW!! Thanks so much! To the teachers asking:
You definitely need to explicitly teach this. I do this in class the first time, show a good and bad model, and leave really REALLY detailed feedback the first few times. Big time commitment at first.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>So: how is it possible that homework is different than everything else people do?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember that homework is generally structurally different than every other sort of practice. Writing a paper takes quite a bit of time, then you turn it in all at once and a few days to a few weeks later you receive feedback. Hitting a ball takes an instant and provides instant feedback on your success by seeing the ball move. In the classroom when you make a mistake the teacher can be there to provide timely feedback and in sports a coach or the actual ball does the same. In homework there is little timely feedback. Even online homework when you enter in the answer and get feedback may be too slow because you made the mistake in the middle of the problem. Feedback is timing is incredibly important in any animal learning anything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Assigning homework can ensure that students receive practice but if it's assigned in lieu of proper instruction it will in fact just reinforce bad practices.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I could imagine one reason being the way most students approach homework. They don't see it as an opportunity to practice, they see it as something they have to do in order to avoid trouble, or to make the teacher happy at best. So what many produce is what I like to call &quot;Minimal Viable Work&quot; which is barely good enough to hand in. Often its copied from other students in the break, done in a hurry on the bus on the way to school or generally rushed and minimalistic. This way, little to no learning can take place.</p>
<p>And for those who really sit down and take it seriously and put some effort into it, the problem is delayed feedback, as others have mentioned in this thread. You make a mistake, and weeks later you are made aware of it and have a chance to correct it. Not very useful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
