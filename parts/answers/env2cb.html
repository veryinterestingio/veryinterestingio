		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many, many countries signed international agreements that define what is legal and what is not legal during a time of war. For instance, executing a prisoner of war who was not resisting or threatening his captor would be highly illegal. Targeting civilian buildings where a lot of civilians are is also illegal (like hospitals or schools). Killing civilians in general? Illegal. Wearing an enemy uniform or the symbols of an organization like the Red Cross, which is supposed to be a neutral symbol? Illegal. Attacking the Red Cross? Illegal.</p>
<p>It's pretty straightforward honestly. If you're attacking someone who's given up or who never even participated in the battle, you're probably doing something illegal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We've been fighting wars for a long time. In that time, countries have agreed that, even in a war, some things are Not Okay. Think of things like attacking medics, mistreating captives, using certain weapons like poisonous gases or white phosphorus that were invented, used and found to be too horrible. Deliberately targetting non-military stuff like hospitals or sites of historical importance. Deliberately going for noncombatants. You get the idea</p>
<p>Laws were written up and treaties signed to make these rules official. </p>
<p>If you break them somehow, that's a war crime. You can be put in front of the International Criminal Court and tried like you would for any other crime.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Years and years ago, All the leaders of the country got together and said &quot;we are civilized people, not cavemen.  If war were to break out, we should make a set of rules so that we stay civilized despite us trying to kill each other.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus we got what is called &quot;rules of war&quot; or &quot;international humanitarian law&quot;</p>
<p>For example, targeting civilians intentionally instead of the armed enemy.  Torturing of any kind ( to include rape or sexual violence).  Using a weapon outlawed by said rules such as napalm.  A chemical substance that sticks to the skin and burns relentlessly that has driven people mad even after being saved and treated because the pain was too much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
