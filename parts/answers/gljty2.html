		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Influenza (flu) and coronavirus are very different viruses. Vaccines against seasonal flu have now been used and tested for a long time and are produced the same way. Flu viruses vary every year and the swine flu outbreak in 2009 can be considered a &quot;variation of an existing virus&quot;, therefore production of a vaccine just needed switching the virus but maintaining the production method and the formulation, that were already safe and tested.</p>
<p>At the moment there are no commercially available vaccines against coronaviruses. Several trials were started in the early 2000s after SARS but were discontinued when the outbreak was contained. The fastest vaccine for the virus causing COVID-19 (which is strictly related to SARS) could come from one of those, but still requires extensive testing of safety and efficacy and optimization of every aspect of production and formulation, a process that requires a long time, but is necessary in the interest of patient's safety.</p>
<p>However, as many different technologies are now available for vaccine production, and some of them have seen extended testing in other areas, the development of a COVID-19 vaccine is proceeding at record pace, with many candidates already in phase I clinical trials, which promises a much faster delivery. Still probably longer than a year in my opinion...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7193619/" target="_blank">This publication</a> offers an overview of the speed of development for different vaccines, and why this is faster.</p>
<p>tl;dr Flu vaccine was just a variation of an existing vaccine. COVID-19 requires development of a (almost) completely new vaccine, and if this is rushed to market in less than a year it will not have enough testing of safety and efficacy. BUT development is still very fast thanks to many technological advancements and re-purposing of tested technologies. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because while one was an iteration of previous flu vaccines, more or less, a covid19 vaccine is against a SARS type.  We have failed to develop vaccines to any SARS viruses that have appeared in the last two decades.  There is a real risk of over priming the immune system, resulting in excessive imflammatory responses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Swine flu is from a type of influenza virus. We already had made lots of influenza vaccines. Even better, our existing flu vaccines need to be adapted every year to match that year's predicted strains, so the methods and infrastructure for &quot;modifying a flu vaccine then making a ton of it&quot; already existed when swine flu hit.</p>
<p>SARS CoV2 is a coronavirus, a completely different family of virus. We have never made a successful vaccine for any coronavirus, despite <a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/706717_1" target="_blank">trying to do so for things like SARS</a>.</p>
<p>That's why this COVID vaccine will take much longer to develop, and why the timeline is so indefinite. There's currently a TON of research being done, more than has ever been aimed at a single virus/vaccine development before. But we just don't know what will work and have to be careful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because said swine flu vaccine is quintessential example of what can go wrong. The vaccine caused hundreds of deaths, miscarriages and the like. </p>
<p>The main issues with vaccine is that you are vaccinating otherwise healthy population. Even one in 10,000 adverse effect - which is very hard to catch even with a lot of tests - would mean tens of thousands of occurrences in USA - often with children or otherwise healthy population.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
