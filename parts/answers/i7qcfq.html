		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water only exist in a liquid state at a narrow range if atmospheric conditions.  </p>
<p>Many planets have surface temps far too hot due to proximity to s star or lack of protective atmosphere.  On these planets beneath a protective layer of crust is the only place liquid water can exist. </p>
<p>Flip that logic and there are planets with icey surfaces due to extreme low surface temps and atmospheric pressure conditions.  Those planets with an active core such as ours may allow liquid water deeper under the surface where the temperature is above freezing point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you think about it water is liquid in a relatively narrow temperature range, planet  surfaces are likely to be either too hot (so it's gas or vapour) or too cold (so it's solid) it's liquid water specifically that we think is a requirement for life and its more likely to be found under the surface because the insulating layers (plus the pressure in aquifers) keep it at a temperature and pressure at which it can be liquid. So yes underground water is more common on different planets</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other comments touch on why surface water is rare. You'd need a very specific temperature and pressure range on the surface of the planet. In our solar system, Mercury and Venus are too hot for surface water and Mars is too cold, although there are some hints that water may have previously existed on the surface of Mars, when it had a different atmosphere. </p>
<p>But why is water more common beneath the surface? This is because of how planets tend be hottest at their core. If a planet is a little too cold to have surface water, it's very likely that at some point between the surface and the core it is the right temperature for water. </p>
<p>Of course, just being the right temperature doesn't mean they actually have water. But it makes it possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our oceans are also protected by the oxygen in our air. Sunlight breaks water apart into hydrogen and oxygen and the hydrogen can then escape since it's much lighter than oxygen. Over very long time spans this can cause large amounts of water to be broken down. </p>
<p>On our planet, however, that hydrogen has to get through a lot of free oxygen without turning back into water before it can escape. None of the other planets we can measure have any free oxygen in their air, since this requires life (or some other process we aren't aware of).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Back up. You've gotten lots of answers about liquid water being difficult and most likely to be found only in a specific Goldilocks zone the right distance from the star. But where are you getting</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I often hear about new planets being discovered with water beneath the surface</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I discover exoplanets for a living, and I don't recall hearing any of this. There's been some dubious claims of water in atmospheres of planets making headlines, but I don't remember anything about water under the surface.</p>
<p>That is impossible to detect with today's technology and anything you might have read is either a gross exaggeration or wild guess. Are you confusing moons in our Solar System with exoplanets?</p>
<p>We have no idea what's under the surface of any exoplanets and it'll be a very long time before we get there. We can measure the density of planets and make models about plausible compositions, and sometimes we might say that a planet is consistent with having a fair amount of water, but that's never the only explanation nor is it actual proof of oceans or anything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
