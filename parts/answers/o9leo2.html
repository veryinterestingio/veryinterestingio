They instead use relatively low power to move existing heat into an area it normally wouldn’t go.</p>
<p>Air conditioners, on the other hand, are seen as environmentally unfriendly compared to other (admittedly less effective) methods of staying cool like cold drinks, turning on a fan, or just sweating it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: It's about the history of air conditioning, US environmentalism, and &quot;heat pumps&quot;.</p>
<p>This is a question about culture that is related to architecture in the United States.</p>
<p>Before air conditioning in homes was common, the US had many residents in the northeast and midwest, and in much of that area winter requires some form of heating for life safety, while A/C is a comfort item, or a &quot;nice to have&quot;.  Pre-A/C traditional architecture in the American South, and in the sparsely populated non-coastal southwest, often had features to support air flow and shade for easier cooling and limited need for heating.</p>
<p>The 1940s-1960s were (a) the period when air conditioning for homes started to become popular (b) the period when the south/west started to see rapidly expanding population and (c) the period when aggressive construction of hydropower was making electricity incredibly cheap across the west.  So many many homes were built in hot-weather parts of the US with virtually no insulation or architectural cooling powers -- just an assumption that unlimited cheap electricity could be pumped in for A/C.</p>
<p>So in the 1960s-70s, when the American environmental movement was taking off, the northeast and midwest had most energy coming from either natural gas, propane, or fuel oil (for heating) or coal/nuclear for electricity.  So all energy use was seen as environmentally unfriendly, and electricity was expensive, so focusing on things like insulating your home were both the environmental and economical thing to do. Environmentalists from these areas looked at the south/west's blaring air conditioners slurping up electricity and ignoring insulation, and decided that was bad for the environment because of assumptions about energy source.  (Side note: there's a second, entirely distinct environmental criticism of A/C! Enviromentalists in the west <em>also</em> saw problems with A/C, because A/C enabled development and population growth that destroyed sensitive desert and mountain ecosystems that had previously been mostly out of reach, strained local surface and aquifer water, and justified damming mountain rivers.)</p>
<p>Fast forward to now.  Heat pumps for heating are still relatively niche, due to the expense of retrofit geothermal and the novelty of cold weather air-source heat pumps.  The kind of person whose house has a heat pump for heating is usually the kind of person who already has maxed out the efficiency of their home with insulation, all-LED lighting, etc; might have rooftop solar and/or a plug-in electric car; and raves about their induction range.  (Induction ranges are awesome, ps.)  So heat-pumps-for-heating tend to be installed on otherwise very efficient homes, and to replace either fossil fuel heating or much less effective electric resistance heating.  Meanwhile heat-pumps-for-cooling (air conditioning units) are at worst still linked to inefficient mid-century construction, and at best are neutral in connotation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heating a home is seen as a requirement, whereas cooling a home is not necessarily the same level of requirement.</p>
<p>The other reason is that when you have a heat pump set into a heating mode, the &quot;waste heat&quot; ends up in the house, so you are fully efficient. When you have it in reverse (like an A/C), the waste heat is exhausted outside.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi hvac guy here! It isn't that it is more or less impactful on the environment as all a heat pump really is is an ac reversed (there's a little more to it than that of course but basic premise.) The issue isn't ac versus heat. The issue is what is being used to heat/cool the space, the refrigerant. One molecule of r22 refrigerant has the ability to destroy 10,000 ozone molecules so we are transitioning to different refrigerants like r401a r404a r134a etc etc over the old ozone destroying refrigerant r22 r12 etc</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
