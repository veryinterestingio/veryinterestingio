		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I assume you are referring to the New York Times bestseller list. Those are for everywhere, not just New York.</p>
<p>The list goes out every week, so if a book is #1 for even a single week, it can call itself a #1 bestseller. So technically there could be 52 #1 bestsellers a year in each category (fiction, nonfiction, hardcover, paperback). Realistically there will not be that many, as books tend to stay on top for several weeks.</p>
<p>Another reason it might seem like every book is #1 is that the bestselling books are the ones you hear the most about... because they are bestsellers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The publishers know these lists exist and how many are roughly needed to be sold to get to the top of the list. When a book debuts, they might &quot;buy&quot; a few hundred or thousand copies for the book tour to get that moniker on the second run of books in a few weeks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact about the New York Times bestseller list: the reason there is a children's book list is because all the &quot;serious, adult&quot; authors got mad that the Harry Potter books were crowding out the top slots for weeks and weeks at a time (well, over a year, really!).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simple answer is that there are like two dozen lists with 15-20 books each (e.g., bestselling children's e-books for grades 6-8), meaning at any given time there might be 400 &quot;New York Times Bestsellers&quot;, with a significant number able to claim #1.</p>
<p>The more complicated answer involves the fact that people game the system to get their book on there for a week to earn that title, and the following fascinating quote from the Wikipedia article about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Times countered that the list was not mathematically objective but rather was editorial content and thus protected under the Constitution as free speech.</p>
