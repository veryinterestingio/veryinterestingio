		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As of even last week, before testing started ramping up, some ~85% of tests were still coming back negative. That is, even under the super restrictive testing regime where we were only testing people that we were super duper confident exhibited every single symptom of COVID 19 and we had tried to rule out every single other possible explanation, most of them actually didn't have the virus.</p>
<p>The problem with COVID 19 is the symptoms are so non-specific. There's so many other things that look exactly like it that aren't it. Most people will never have the worst flu of their lives in any given year, but that also means tens of millions of people will. Any other year, they would have just dismissed it as the worst flu of their lives and learnt something new about the flu. But now, you have millions of people who &quot;swore they got COVID 2, 3, 4 months ago&quot;. </p>
<p>If there's a lesson to be learnt from all of this, it's that the flu is bad, folks. It doesn't affect most people most years so many of us remain in blissful ignorance but the people it does affect seriously are still in the millions per year and deaths are in the 10s - 100s of thousands.</p>
<p>Get your yearly flu vaccine!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Influenza B was very prevalent just before SARS 2.0 took off in the US. I think that is why many are confused. There are a lot of respiratory diseases that we deal with on an annual basis, and they can't be distinguished based on clinical presentations. Diagnostic tests are needed. Most of the respiratory infections between Nov-Feb were influenza.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
