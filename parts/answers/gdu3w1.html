		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oxygen absorbers typically work through the oxidation of iron contained in the package. The oxygen in the air bonds with the iron to form iron-oxide (rust). Along with iron, the package typically also contains other substances, such as sodium-chloride (salt) which serves as a catalyst to greatly speed up the reaction.</p>
<p>The oxidation reaction is exothermic, which means that it produces heat. So when you take the packet out of the closed pizza box (which, by now, is low on oxygen) and expose it to regular air with regular oxygen levels, it will rapidly start the oxidation process and produce heat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I've eaten more frozen pizza than I'd like to disclose and I've not once EVER seen anything in/on/with a frozen pizza other than frozen pizza.</p>
<p>Is this some super high end frozen pizza we're talking about here?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oxygen absorber is essentially a slow fire. As it contacts oxygen in the closed container it burns a little tiny bit. Little heat is made. As soon as it is exposed to unlimited oxygen, it's fire burns faster, generating significant but not dangerous amounts of heat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most probably it's a powdered iron or other metal.</p>
<p>Iron oxidizes into rust in a reaction that's  Exothermic which means it's releasing heat.</p>
<p>Reason why it suddenly gets very hot when you take it out of the plastic is because it suddenly gets tons of oxygen flowing into it, while previously it was in (ideally) sealed environment with very little oxygen.</p>
<p>Interesingly there are feet/hand warmers working on the same idea, bunch of iron in a sealed pocket which you open to make it warm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At Costco there are these hot packs that you usually put in your jacket or your glove. You open a sealed package and shake the pouch inside to loosen up the powder. These packs are usually iron powder, in a really fine dust. Oxidation releases a TON of heat, and iron is no exception. O2 absorbers play on the property of oxygen in the air naturally wanting to bond with iron. The iron forms rust in its place, bonds with the oxygen and releases an immense amount of heat. When I’m a sealed pack like a frozen pizza wrapping, the o2 is limited, so the pack may heat up, but eventually loses its heat quickly after the reaction takes place. When put in the air, it hasn’t used up all the o2 and you tend to observe it before all the iron is turned to rust.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
