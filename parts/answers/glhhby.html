		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m an airline pilot in the US. There are several ways we can anticipate turbulence, but nothing is certain and unexpected turbulence happens all the time.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>PIREPs, or pilot reports. Pilots tell ATC when they encounter turbulence and ATC relays the information to aircraft behind them. They are also published online and we can see them on a map on our iPads</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SIGMETs, or significant meteorological information. These are charted areas where severe turbulence or other hazards are expected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Turbulence forecasts on the flight release paperwork</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Turbulence forecasts on various forecasting apps installed on our EFB (electronic flight bag - literally just an iPad)</p>
</li>
<li>Onboard weather radar</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, any of the following are clear indications that turbulence in that area is likely:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Towering cumulus clouds or thunderstorms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standing lenticular clouds </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rotor clouds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mountainous terrain </p>
</li>
<li>High winds </li>
</ul>
<p>However, on a clear weather day, we generally play it by ear. The seat belt sign will stay on after takeoff unless the air is smooth. If it does seem smooth, we will ask ATC how the rides are ahead. If they tell us it will be smooth, we will turn the seatbelt sign off until we hit turbulence again or if we encounter any signs of possible turbulence ahead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s generally from pilot reports “Pirep” from aircraft that have already transited the turbulence region. You can hear them on the appropriate ATC center frequency and ATC will also inform pilots as they are approaching turbulence. The FAA encourages pilots to give Pireps for anything of interest to other pilots - good or bad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Flying over any kind of storm, or weather front (change in pressure and or temperature) will probably result in rough air, and pilots are constantly checking weather. Almost all modern large aircraft have a weather radar under the nose cone (which is made of fiberglass versus carbon fiber or metal as anything conductive would interfere with radar)</p>
<p>I won't get into the PIREPs that the others mentioned, but I can tell you that modern avionics have the ability to pick up weather information in flight beyond their radar scope. XM (the satellite radio company) is the largest supplier of aviation weather info in the world. There are other services that also provide this information, some which are free (ADS-B weather in the U.S.) and can be bidirectional. In other words, for larger planes, they are often reporting data as they fly, to update other planes in transit.  This data can be in the form of text reports, or radar images. </p>
<p>The final way a pilot could learn would be by calling a ground station for a weather update, but this rarely done now, since that info is essentially available to a pilot all the time anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually just listening to “ride reports” from planes in front of us, seeing clouds ahead, or just memory from checking the weather earlier that day and knowing what weather causes turbulence. We also spend a lot more time in planes than the average person so we pick up on the very tiny bumps most people don’t notice that appear a few seconds before the plane enters the heavier stuff that everyone notices.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to PIREPs (PIlot REPorts), large aircraft have weather radar devices on board, some of which are capable of detecting turbulence. Similar to PIREPs, the National Weather Service issues AIRMETs and SIGMETs which are warnings about turbulence, icing, and other conditions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
