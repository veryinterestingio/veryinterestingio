		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Exponential growth. At first cancer is a single malformed cell dividing without restrictions. That 1 turns into 2, 2 becomes 4, 4 becomes 8, 8 turns into 16, etc. With each division the number of cancerous cells doubles. (More or less)</p>
<p>So for the first few months or so the cancer is only a minor disruption, but soon it rapidly becomes larger and larger and starts affecting the function of the entire organ and body. Taking up nutrients and putting stress on other organs causing cascading organ failures if left untreated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to the other answers, when a Doctor tells someone they have X amount of time, it's usually a highly educated guesstimate as there are so many unknowable factors based on the individual that affect survival rate.</p>
<p>So you hear stories of &quot;I knew someone that was told he had a week to live and he lasted two years&quot; - the Doctor would have been making their prediction based on their personal clinical experience combined with data from studies in journals, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
