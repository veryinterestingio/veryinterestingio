		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first reason is based on the strength of the material as the temperature increases. When microwaving things the maximum temperature is roughly the boiling point of water. If the plastic will deform under the stress of its own weight and the food at a temperature less than the boiling point it is not suitable for the microwave. Polystyrene (recycling number 6) is an example of something I would avoid microwaving for this reason.</p>
<p>The other possibility is the composition of the plastic may contain components that would leech into oil or water at elevated temperatures or when exposed to microwaves. The FDA focuses a lot on determining which components used in plastics can be considered food safe and the manufactures must consider this when designing their material.  Polypropylene (number 3) is commonly used in the microwave because it satisfies both of these requirements. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, look for labeling that specifically indicates the package is microwave safe. If in doubt transfer your food to a plate first, it’s what I do and I have many years working in polymer research and development.</p>
<p>As a side note, please recycle your plastics, use reusable bags and tell others to do the same.  I won’t lose my job because of you recycling and using less single use plastics, we share this world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure about what the actual standards are for safety, but speaking very generally, plastics must meet two successive criteria to be safe to microwave:</p>
<p>1) the plastic has low losses in the 2.4 GHz range that the microwave operates in. Most polymers meet this criteria but because heat generation is proportional to frequency, it doesn't have to be particularly lossy to get heated. </p>
<p>More importantly:
2) when heated excessively to the point of degradation, the plastic must not give off toxic vapors. This includes pretty much any plastic that contains plasticizers (phthalates are very common, though they're being used less in more recent years or at least being replaced by safer ones) or things like PVC that generate nasty stuff like chlorine gas when it degrades.</p>
<p>Most microwave safe containers are made from polypropylene and sometimes polyethylene. Sometimes PET is safe, but it depends on the molecular weight and what additives are present.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
