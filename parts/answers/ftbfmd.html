<p>If you accidentally bump or scrape something, the spikes can help offset any major damage (like the actual Rim and bolts). This way only a minor cosmetic thats cheap to replace is broken.</p>
<p>The biggest thing is they are more of a cool truck decoration. Their popularity is partly due to the price and ease of installation. They also really make a difference for the truck lovers out there.</p>
<p>Just a note, these spikes break off very easily. No worries about a Mad Max rig tearing into your car on the highway. Even if they might give that appearance.</p>

Initially they were plain, but truck drivers love customizing their trucks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are both decoration and practical.  Semi trucks have long lug nuts holding the wheels on the hubs.  The long lugs in the back are also installed in the front for practical reasons (less parts in inventory, less chances of installing short lugs on the rear, etc).  If you don't cover the extra threads that are exposed to the weather, they get filled with dirt, rust, etc. and the lugnuts jam due to the debris on the threads.</p>
<p>They used to have plain covers, but truckers want to make their vehicles custom to their personalities, so they buy spinners, chrome, extra lights, etc to make their vehicles unique.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it's mainly cosmetic.  a lot of big rig drivers practically live in their big rigs so it's like a home to them.  and some of them like to customize their homes, just like ppl like to customize their cars and stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Front tyres have single tyres, the other tyres are dual rims. The rims are fairly similar - a dual tyre has two of them back-to back, but the front wheels only have one of these rims. It is mounted 'backwards', much like an ordinary car tyre is, so that the wheel and its load is closer to the pivots and bearings, reducing the leverage you'd get by mounting the wheel the other way, holding the wheel away from the hub.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A lot of times you can look at somebody's truck and tell if the guy cares about the job or not too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
