<p>The medication will make you somewhat immunocompromised. however the immune system has multiple different ways to activate. All drugs that work on autoimmune disorders work this way, which is why the commercials always talk about asking your doctor about specific infections.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have pointed out, it does compromise the immune system. As others have also pointed out, the idea isn't to give it constantly. It's recently been reported (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6776880/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6776880/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6776880/</a></a>) that a single 14-day course can prevent the onset of T1D in high-risk individuals (relatives of those with T1D). They saw an initial drop in lymphocyte counts (not unexpected) that eventually rebounded, and did not observe any significant difference in infection rate between treatment and control (11 v 9%). </p>
<p>That initial window where you see a drop in lymphocyte counts is when you'd be most concerned about infection. They've continued following up with many of the participants in this study (disclaimer: I'm friendly with one of the authors) and have still not observed any notable defect in immune function. </p>
<p>The initial testing phase of these drugs will always, at least in part, aim to identify the dose that gives you the best effect without causing a significant increase in your risk of infection. In practice you would also be very closely monitored for signs of infection during the window where you are most at risk,</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It does compromise the immune response, which is the trade-off with basically any immunomodulatory drug. The innate immune response will be left intact, and B cells won't be directly affected (though they rely on T cell help for some functions), but the T cell response to anything, not just beta cells, will be shot while on the drug.</p>
<p>The idea may be to provide it short term, promote death or tolerance of the currently activated T cells (so ideally you aren't sick with an infection and this is primarily just your pancreas-specific T cells) and then to remove the drug and hopefully maintain the lack of self-specific T cell response. But certainly while the antibody is present and likely for some time thereafter any/all T cells will be affected, including those that would be protective against pathogens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is quite interesting, I'd like to know how long this course of medication was given for, cd3 is expressed on all t cell lymphocytes (white blood cells) I'd expect it would be severe if given at a high dose for a long time, I imagine the objective is not to remove every t cell premenantly because you would get a case much worse than AIDs (which only affect cd4 T-helper cells). There's about 4 other T cell white blood cells classes which are affected by this medication.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
