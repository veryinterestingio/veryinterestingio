		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What caused the end Cretaceous, i.e., the K-Pg (or K-T in older publications) extinction remains a point of argument. The two important things workers quibble over, both for the impact hypothesis or others, are (1) timing (i.e., did the supposed event that caused the extinction occur coincident with the extinction) and (2) mechanism (i.e., just because X event happened coincident with the extinction doesn't mean it caused the extinction if there is no mechanism by which the event could cause an extinction).</p>
<p>The impact hypothesis (e.g., <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/208/4448/1095.abstract" target="_blank">Alvarez et al., 1980</a>) has always been provocative, compelling, and well marketed (e.g., Alvarez's pop-sci book popularizing the idea). From the peer reviewed literature, dating of impact related material mostly suggests that the timing of this impact is consistent, i.e., it is coincident with the extinction (e.g., <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/327/5970/1214.full" target="_blank">Schulte et al., 2010</a>), but there has been other work to suggest it actually predates the extinction, i.e., the impact happened, some time passed and then the extinction happened (e.g., <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/101/11/3753.short" target="_blank">Keller et al., 2004</a>). The mechanism has also had some issues, with multiple suggestions of how the impact caused the extinction from shutdown of photosynthesis from dust injection to a &quot;thermal pulse&quot; of hot spherules (e.g., <a href="http://home.miracosta.edu/kmeldahl/articles/dinosNorthAm.pdf" target="_blank">Fastovksy &amp; Sheehan, 2005</a>), but some of these have been questioned, e.g., was there enough dust to actually shut down photosynthesis? (e.g., <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/30/2/99/192360/Impact-dust-not-the-cause-of-the-Cretaceous?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank">Pope, 2002</a>). </p>
<p>Now, in detail, since the early days of the impact hypothesis being suggested there has been push back on whether it works as the sole cause of the extinction (e.g., <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/EO068i014p00193" target="_blank">Courtillo &amp; Cisowski, 1987</a>). The alternative that is usually suggested, or at least pointed to, is the eruption of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Traps" target="_blank">Deccan Traps</a>, a massive continental flood basalt province in India, which also occurred at about the right time (e.g., <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/328/5981/973.1.full.pdf" target="_blank">multiple comments on the Schulte article from above</a>) and indeed has been suggested as the cause of the K-Pg for as almost long as the impact hypothesis has been around (e.g., <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0195667185900485" target="_blank">McLean, 1985</a>). The main eruptive pulse of the Deccan Traps appears to be nearly synchronous (though maybe just a little before) the K-Pg extinction (e.g., <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/339/6120/684.abstract" target="_blank">Renne et al., 2013</a>, <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6218/182.abstract" target="_blank">Schoene et al, 2015</a>), though this too has been questioned and suggested that most of the Deccan Traps erupted after the K-Pg (e.g., <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6429/866.abstract" target="_blank">Sprain et al, 2019</a>) with even a suggestion that the impact itself influenced this post K-Pg eruptive activity (e.g., <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6256/76.abstract" target="_blank">Renne et al., 2015</a>). For the Deccan Traps as the cause of the K-Pg extinction, the kill mechanism may have been global warming from pulses of greenhouse gases released by the volcanism (e.g., <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003101821200384" target="_blank">Tobin et al., 2012</a>) or a combination of this along with ocean acidification and ocean warming (e.g., <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818120302034" target="_blank">Keller et al., 2020</a>). </p>
<p>While some proponents of the Deccan Traps as the primary cause of the K-Pg extinction discount really any influence from the bolide impact, gradually a more middle of the road view has started to emerge in the literature. Specifically, there is a growing idea that it was the combination of prolonged rapid environmental change driven by Deccan Traps volcanism for 10s of 1000s of years preceding the K-Pg, punctuated by the bolide impact (kind of the straw that broke the camels, or I suppose dinosaurs in this case, back) that was the joint cause of the K-Pg (e.g., <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/339/6120/684.abstract" target="_blank">Renne et al., 2013</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12079" target="_blank">Petersen et al., 2016</a>, <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6429/862.abstract" target="_blank">Schoene et al., 2019</a>). In this view, it is arguable whether either event alone would have caused the K-Pg extinction as we know it.</p>
<p><strong>In short,</strong> there is still a lot of debate as to whether a bolide impact or a massive and prolonged eruption of continental flood basalts were the primary kill mechanism for the K-Pg extinction, but there's seems to be some amount of growing consensus that it was actually the combination of the two. In this view, that would explain why &quot;there are other, bigger, craters that are not associated with mass extinctions&quot;, i.e., the K-Pg impact alone probably would not have caused the extinction, but it was the final nail in the coffin after prolonged climate change and environmental disruption driven by the massive volcanic eruptions preceding the impact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While it's not an alternative, Radiolab did an episode in detail as to the specifics, interviewing different scientists, some who replicated the impact and who find it was most likely the debris from the asteroid itself kicked back up and out then re-entering causing a massive furnace. The podcast and video version is really entertaining and amazing.</p>

<p>Edit: The re-entry of trillions and trillions of small pieces of debris causes heat in the atmosphere, which turned earth into a furnace. This would explain why dinos half way around the world also died at the same time as ones near the explosion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
