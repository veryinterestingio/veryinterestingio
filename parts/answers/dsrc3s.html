		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't work a 9-5 (grad student) and I end up doing a decent amount of shopping during those hours (mostly grocery).  There's a decent amount of people.  Not everyone works a 9-5, stay at home parents are actually fairly common, and don't forget retired people.  It's nowhere near as crowded like when i'm there in the 5:30-6:30 range but there's a decent amount of people.  </p>
<p>There actually isn't a huge market for futons at 1:30 am.  A lot of stores are more crowded at 10:00 Am than Pm, even on the weekdays.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in a large warehouse retail type store. Over 70% of our revenue is from Business2Business sales, rather than Business2Customer. This is the main driver of being “open” between 7am and 5pm on weekdays. Many of these businesses will have an official “purchasing officer” who comes into the store to purchase the items they need. If we weren’t open they’d simply go to the next store that is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
