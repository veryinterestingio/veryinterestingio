		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When it comes to what's happening in our brain and our bodies during our inner speech, there are actually a lot of similarities between the words that we say out loud and the voice we hear in our head. </p>
<p>Muscles in your larynx move when you speak out loud. But researchers have also uncovered that tiny muscular movements happen in the larynx when you talk to yourself silently in your head, too. They are only detectable via sensitive measuring techniques like electromyography, however, which is probably why you're not even aware of them. </p>
<p>It gets even stranger though. The area of the brain that is active when we speak out loud — the left inferior frontal gyrus, also known as Broca's area — is also active when we 'speak' in our heads. What's more, scientists have shown that disrupting this region of the brain can interfere with our ability to engage in inner speech, much like it can interrupt our ability to speak audibly. This is probably because it's performing a similar function for our bodies, whether we're speaking out loud or just talking to ourselves silently. </p>
<p>According to Dr. Nathan E. Chrone, an associate professor of neurology at Johns Hopkins, &quot;We found that rather than carrying out the articulation of speech, Broca’s area is developing a plan for articulation, and then monitoring what is said to correct errors and make adjustments in the flow of speech.&quot;</p>
<p>Why our body's physical actions are so similar, regardless of whether we're speaking out loud or inaudibly in our heads, is still unclear, but we are gaining a better understanding of how we can tell what voices are our own — whether internal or spoken — versus the voices of other people. That process has to do with a brain signal called &quot;corollary discharge.&quot; </p>
<p>As researcher Mark Scott of the University of British Columbia explains, &quot;We spend a lot of time speaking and that can swamp our auditory system, making it difficult for us to hear other sounds when we are speaking. By attenuating the impact our own voice has on our hearing — using the ‘corollary discharge’ prediction — our hearing can remain sensitive to other sounds.&quot;</p>
<p>Corollary discharge is essentially a copy of a motor signal which allows us to predict our own movements, including vocalizations, and which tells us that we're the ones moving or speaking rather than someone else. </p>
<p>It's also thought that a malfunction in this process is part of what differentiates those that &quot;hear voices&quot; from everyone else who can distinguish their inner voice as &quot;theirs.&quot; </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This post and comment section are a gold mine. It got me thinking about intelligence in people and animals, reading a lot of what is being said, language may be have been the final push that made us fully self aware. Without language , you don't have an internal monologue..  Without an internal monologue... What are you?</p>
<p>How would you recognise yourself as being in a place and time if you did not have words for yourself, place, or time</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sam Harris has a great podcast on the umbrella topic of the mind in relation to temporal reality and how we reconcile that through speech. I highly recommend his podcast at large, but specifically for this thread, I suggest the one entitled, &quot;Episode #168: Mind, Space, and Motion&quot; with Dr. Barbara Tversky. </p>
<p>Topics like mirror neurons and the evolution of our spatial orientation and reconciliation are brought up too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
