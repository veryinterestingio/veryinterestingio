<p>Some stars change their brightness a lot frequently while keeping their fuel type. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mira" target="_blank">Mira</a> is an extreme example. It varies by a factor of more than 1000 with a period of a few months. Sometimes it is easily visible to the naked eye, sometimes it is way too dim. The next maximum will be October this year.</p>
<p>There is also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algol" target="_blank">Algol</a> which appears to get dimmer every few days - but this is a binary star where the brighter star is partially eclipsed by the dimmer star.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stars like our sun do an hours-long transition to helium burning called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium_flash" target="_blank">helium flash.</a></p>
<p>The helium flash is guaranteed to not destroy the Earth because there is almost no immediate outward change, and because Earth was already destroyed several billion years ago much earlier in the <a href="http://hosting.astro.cornell.edu/academics/courses/astro201/evol_sun.htm" target="_blank">red giant phase</a> before the sun fully ran out of hydrogen in its core. The huge release in energy from helium fusion switching on is quietly absorbed by a change in the density in the core.</p>
<p>The sun will continue to be a red giant for a while after helium fusion starts. Eventually the outer layers boil off, and the core that is left is a big dumb lump of carbon and oxygen made by fusing helium. The remnant core is called a white dwarf.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The size and color changes. When a star starts to fuse heavier elements at its core the star gets bigger and usually redder. A stars final stage is when it starts to fuse iron at its core, and that's when the star implodes. But if it's a smaller star like our sun it will just shrink into a dwarf star.</p>
<p>Tl;DR: they get bigger and redder as they get older</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
