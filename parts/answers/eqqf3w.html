		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The example with the vultures is evolutionary, they happen to have extremely acidic stomaches, the acid kills the bacteria that would kill humans.</p>
<p>As for the dirty stream example, there aren't many (if any) bacteria or pathogens in there that will outright kill a fox. Therefore, their immune system is able to get use to the bacteria and pathogens it consumes and gets better and better at beating it. If you started drinking dirty stream water you might have bad poops from giardia parasites (or maybe worse please don't try this I'm not an expert and this is just one example) but after years of it your immune system would be very good at battling the parasite before you had any side effects.</p>
<p>Edit: wrong they're :((</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You’re biased because you know and care about pathogens.</p>
<p>If you lacked the knowledge of pathogens or the ability to correlate illness with them, then you’d merrily drink from puddles or eat raw meat that you killed or came across.  Later when you were suffering from these choices, you’d just accept that you don’t feel well or would blame some unknowable outside agency.</p>
<p>Wild animals carry all kinds of pathogens.  Wild animals often suffer from them.  Without knowledge of “hook worm” or whatever, they just accept the itchiness, diarrhea or whatever effects manifest.</p>
<p>For examples, look at many “medical” procedures before the industrial age.  If you don’t know what caused you to get sick, you can end up doing many strange things to “avoid” or “cure” yourself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of animals still get quite sick quite often. Pet animals often live significantly longer than their wild brethren for that reason.</p>
<p>Beyond that, a lot of illnesses aren't fatal to us, but just make us unwell for a few days and similar to animals. They may not get sick from every drink at a stream but when they do they spend a few days unable to eat and feeling unwell and either they die or they avoid drinking there next time.</p>
<p>Similarly, you'll find that most of the time you CAN drink from streams and puddles and be relatively fine. There's huge groups of humanity that do exactly that to survive, many of them do end up with minor or major parasites and other conditions but for the longest time that was normal for humans, just as it is for wild animals.</p>
<p>So I guess the answer to your title question is: we're not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Animals suffer from this all the time. That's one of several reasons why animals in captivity tend to live longer than their wild counterparts, even if overall living quality isn't necessarily better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OP you are just saying that because you are a human who is hyper aware of your own problems. Animals are constantly suffering and dying but you simply don’t know about it. Humans have an incredible ability to eat things without getting sick. Whether or not other animals do it better is beyond your knowledge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
