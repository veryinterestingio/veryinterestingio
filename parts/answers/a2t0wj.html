		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming a density &gt;1 g/cc the volume of 50 megatons of TNT is on the order of 300x300x300 meters^3.
The initial conditions of the blast are quite different because the fusion event occurs in a much smaller volume and hence temperature and energy density are greater-initially. Thus the initial shockwave is faster and accompanied by UV, x-ray,  and gamma radiation. </p>
<p>In the case of a pile of TNT the detonation would propagate through the pile in several hundred ms and the initial fireball would be considerably cooler than the equivalent sized nuclear fireball.</p>
<p>That said, since a large fraction of the nuclear event is in the form of heat and radiation, the mechanical shockwave would be less powerful than that produced by a equivalent energy mass of TNT. In the latter case, the shock is the result of the sudden production of hot gas (Nitrogen, Carbon dioxide) at thousands of degrees in contrast to a smaller volume at tens to hundreds of thousands of degrees during a fusion event. So less energy is dissipated (initially)-as heat-in the chemical event, and more energy goes into the shockwave via gas expansion.</p>
<p>RAND has declassified documents that go into greater detail with graphs and tables. You can find some online.</p>
<p>Also, the US did tests with 1 kt (ish) piles of dynamite to simulate nuclear blasts. Videos can be found on the youtube.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would release the same amount of <em>energy</em> (that's what tonnage equivalent means) but the devil is in the details. Conventional explosives release mostly mechanical energy and some heat; a nuke releases a bigger share of heat and a lot of ionizing radiation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not an explosives expert, can't help you on the specifics of such a detonation. However your follow up is easy: </p>
<ul>
<li>TNT (Trinitrotoluene) has a density of 1,654 kg/m^(3)</li>
<li>50 x 10^6 tonnes is 5 x 10^10 kg</li>
<li>5 x 10^10 kg/ 1,654 kg/m^3 = 3.02 x 10^7 m3</li>
</ul>
<p>This would be the volume occupied by this TNT pile (ignoring air gaps between pieces or containers). This is about 10 times the volume of NASA's Vehicle Assembly Building, or slightly more than the volume of concrete that makes up the Three Gorges Dam. If this volume were a cube, each side would be 310m (1020 feet) long. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The unit is more in terms of &quot;energy released&quot; than the physical characteristics of the blast. A large megaton sized hydrogen bomb releases a lot of xrays and gamma rays and radiation but megaton of actual TNT would have a bigger shock wave and more firey stuff going on. But the kj released is more or less equivalent. This is why we use the ton-unit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The scientists at Los Alamos were mostly concerned with blast waves since that was the traditional method of action for a large bomb so they considered a 15kt nuke to be one that produced a blast wave as large as setting off 15kt of TNT.</p>
<p>Nuclear weapons, though, have more effects than just the blast wave.  They emit large amounts of thermal radiation that can cause burns or start fires.  They also emit ionizing radiation.  </p>
<p>All these effects have a radius-squared decrease in effect with distance but due to absorption ionizating radiation decreases faster than that.  Quadrupling the size of a nuke will nearly double the range at which the blast wave or heat are of a certain intensity.  But it will only increase the range at which you'd receive a lethal dose of radiation by much less.  For instance it will go from 1.34km to 1.68 going from 15kt to 60kt.  That means that for a small nuke much of the danger comes from the ionizing radiation.  But for a huge city-buster nuke everybody who dies will die from burns or the explosion.</p>
<p>You can play around with <a href="https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/" target="_blank">this site</a> to get a better sense of the various ranges and how the relate to the explosion size.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
