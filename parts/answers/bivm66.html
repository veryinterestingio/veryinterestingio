When they return, if the streamer is still intact, its safe to build a web there...if a bug is trapped in it, its a great spot to setup a web.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best thing about webs is that they can easily be torn down and rebuilt. So if a spider builds one in a bad place, it can just rebuild in another spot (though they can be energetically expensive to make, so they shouldn’t necessarily do so very frequently depending on how intricate their webs are). Also, some spiders are attracted to spaces that flying insects are attracted to as well, so they build their webs around these sources, like artificial light sources outside. It becomes an all night In-N-Out for them. ?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I always wondered how they span a gap to anchor their webs. Some are so wide that not even spider strengthed jump can help to reach the other side. Certainly they they don't drape down with a web line and crawl up the other side, no? Not to mention what goes in their tiny brains when they figured that branch out there seems like a good spot to attach to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think they look for certain cues, like gravity (how far up from ground to build) and darkness (means a protected place possibly, and also possibly a wetter and cooler place = flies). The cues that they look for are likely species dependent. Also, they just kind of get lucky,: spider moms have hundreds of babies... The lucky ones that pick good spots are the ones that survive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
