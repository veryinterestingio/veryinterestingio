		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Air is a poor thermal conductor, but a great insulator.  In other words, air is greedy.  Once gets heat it wants to hold onto it and doesnâ€™t like giving it away.</p>
<p>Metal on the other hand is a great thermal conductor. But a poor insulator.  Metal likes to share heat with anything that wants some, like your hand.  </p>
<p>Metal gets a gold star in kindergarten for sharing its heat, while air gets a time out for hogging the heat for itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>And this is why it's possible to walk on hot coals. The ash and coals are poor conductors, so you can have your foot in contact with them for a short while without getting burnt. But try removing the coals and walking on the metal tray they were heated in, and you'll become very aware of the difference!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thermal mass! Air has very low thermal mass, and as such cannot transfer heat as quickly as things with higher thermal mass, such as metal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Uhh, wait, if you stick your hand in a fire for a few seconds, you will get burned.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You can move it in and out very quickly(less than a second or so), but a few seconds will earn you a third degree burn.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not completely an answer to original question, but on a side note you can touch hot metal for a small amount of time, like a flame. I apparently thought it was cool to try and see how many times I could quickly tap my parents wood stove as a kid, and that sucker was hot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
