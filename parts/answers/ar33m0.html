		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not so much the water as the temperature. Basically, the long strands that make up chewing gum and give it its elastic consistency seize up when it gets cold; the water is cold enough to make the gum less elastic, which makes it much harder to chew. (A side note of this is that gum becomes much easier to get out of hair when it's cold. It's for that reason that it's often recommended to use cold water to get gum out in case of a chewing mishap, because warm or hot water will just make the gum runnier and let it spread further.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Itâ€™s the change in temperature. That is also the reason why people change tyres on the car in the winter period. The summer tyre rubber is made for higher temperatures giving them a better grip. The winter tyres are on the other hand made of a different mixture making the rubber less hard with low temperatures. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
