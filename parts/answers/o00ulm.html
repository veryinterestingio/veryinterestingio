This is due to the fact that females have to give birth through very narrow psuedo-penises. </p>
<p>They've been observed giving birth and it's been reported that they display high levels of distress and agitation, which implies feeling pain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not all of them. Humans evolved narrow hips (to walk upright) and large heads (to fit our big brains) and that combination makes childbirth incredibly traumatic compared to most other mammals. But there are others where it’s obviously rough on the mother. </p>
<p>Here’s an explainer article I found:

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Compared to most other mammals, human births are very hard, painful, and (before modern medicine) dangerous. This is an unfortunate side effect of two things: our large brains and upright, bipedal posture.</p>
<p>When we slowly evolved bipedalism, our hips had to become narrower in order to fit our new walking style. However, this coincided with our brains getting larger, which means that a larger head is trying to pass through a smaller hole, causing all sorts of possible injuries and trauma. Luckily, the benefit from bipedalism and increased brain size outweighed the drawbacks of difficult births, so we kept these two traits and their side effect. Now, we did in fact evolve to mitigate this. The human gestational period is shorter compared to similar mammals, and our newborns are much more immature compared to most mammals. You may know that, say, a baby deer or calf or horse can stand up and run within hours of being born, whereas it takes a baby human months or even years to do the same. Our babies are literally born premature, because if they spent any more time in the womb, they wouldn't be able to get out.</p>
<p>Basically, thank god for C-sections and modern medicine</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Most animals do not want to show others their pain, because having pain means they are easy prey. It's called the masking phenomenon, and it is especially high in wildlife.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
