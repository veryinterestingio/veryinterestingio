One butchered cow can provide a lot of meals, but we had to feed that cow its whole life. It takes 10-100 times the resources to produce the cow compared to how much it provides us as food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to be a vegan, this being one of the reasons.
But I think it's just one part of the problem.
Overconsumption is really what's bad for the environment. You might never eat meat, but you buy other things that take a lot of resources to package and transport to you, instead. And people definitely overeat meat, too. Everyone doesn't even have to just be vegan or vegetarian, but just consume so much less of it would help a lot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Raising meat takes resources. Water, land, food (which is grown specifically for them to eat). Growing plants for humans to eat takes considerably less resources. There's also the additional effect of cow poop/farts releasing a lot of methane, which is a strong greenhouse gas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eating meat is not inherently bad for the environment.  What IS bad is the industrialized way that we produce it.</p>
<p>Producing more beef requires more grass and grain to feed them.  So, we apply tons of chemical fertilizers to the ground in order to encourage the grasses and grains we need to feed the cows.  That chemical fertilizer also finds its way into ground water and causes massive algae blooms among other things.</p>
<p>Then there's all the diesel fuel that we burn to harvest and prepare the grains for feeding.  Then, of course, there's the feed lots themselves.  </p>
<p>Cows produce a lot of pee and poop and it all has to go somewhere.  When you have thousands of them all concentrated into a small area (a feed lot), you get tons of it and essentially no good way to clean it.  So, you take the group of cattle in this pen and slaughter them.  Then you run in a couple of people to hose the pen down really quick, and then you bring in the next group of cattle.  </p>
<p>Notionally, the muck produced at a feedlot could be used as fertilizer.  But it isn't organic because it contains all of the drugs and other chemicals that we inject the cattle with to encourage high growth.  So it can't be sold there.  As a fertilizer, it does not outperform the chemical fertilizers that are already in use and that farmers are already equipped to apply.  So it can't really be sold in THAT market either.  That leaves sewage processing.</p>
<p>In short, the entire industrialized meat production process is extremely messy.  At the small scale, none of this is a problem.  The cows are not under stress, the waste (pee and poop) are dealt with on site as compost and fertilizer for the pastures that the cattle graze.</p>
<p>So, really, it isn't eating meat that's the problem.  It's the industrialized production processes that are optimized for profit over product quality or environmental concerns that cause the issues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
