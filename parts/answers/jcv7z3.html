		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do get cold. Not freezing, but close. But the muscles that control their feet are higher up staying warm and their feet are made of really tough material so the cold doesn’t damage them.</p>
<p>More of an issue is the rest of their body getting cold from heat leaking out of the feet. To solve this, the blood vessels going into the feet and the blood vessels coming out of the feet are really close together so the warm blood going down heats up the cold blood coming up.</p>
