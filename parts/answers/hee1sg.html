		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your bank immediately puts the money into a giant holding account to be transferred during the giant end of day batch transaction. The other bank will have to process the incoming money and put it in the appropriate accounts accordingly. As a result, the retailer doesn't actually see the money from your sale for several days.</p>
<p>When you do a refund, the same is true in reverse. The retailer will see their money disappear instantly, but it will be in a banking buffer for a little while until it gets deposited into your account.</p>
<p>The reason for all of this is that banks want to manage as few inter-bank transactions as possible. Having every $5 transaction between banks have its own link just adds a lot of room for error, and doesn't really add any value on the banks side.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our monetary systems are decades of cobbled together band-aids over top of systems designed in the 1960's and 1970's. They work very poorly and have almost no security, resulting in insurance eating billions of dollars in fraud per week. Yet, they manage to fulfill the massive needs of the population. Switching to something that is securely designed, faster, and accomplishes the same needs would cause many banks, infrastructure providers, and middle-men to lose out on a lot of money made from frees and services.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Money is removed from your account immediately, but it doesn't reach the vendor immediately.  It first goes through a clearinghouse process where all bank transactions are bundled up into a few large transactions, the money is moved around, then the transactions are unbundled.  </p>
<p>This takes a few days in each direction, so the vendor has to wait until the process is complete, then issue a new transaction that in turn will take a few days to process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This explains why Pizza Hut took 10 days to refund me when they charged £XX,XXX from my bank account for 2 slices of Pizza from a takeaway window. I can't reveal the amount as the error occurred by entering my PIN twice which inflated the value entered by the vendor who asked me to enter my PIN again. I called my bank immediately who assured me a transaction of that size would never go through without a flag or authorisation. But it did. We only discovered this after trying to withdraw cash as it wiped out our bank account and we were massively overdrawn. Pizza Hut said a refund would take 10 days and I was appalled. It was all our money (ten years ago). Mercifully our bank credited our account the next day because they accepted responsibility for allowing such a large transaction to go through unchecked. Pizza Hut's acknowledgement? An our bad letter and a £10 gift voucher.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
