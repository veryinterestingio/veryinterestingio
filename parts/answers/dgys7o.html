		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have mentioned, it has to do with the sympathetic nervous system, also called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response" target="_blank">fight-or-flight response</a>, which can be triggered from strong emotions. In preparation for fighting or fleeing, your throat opens up to get as much air as possible.</p>
<p>Part of this opening up includes making your vocal cord opening (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottis" target="_blank">glottis</a>) as big as possible - which you feel as a lump in your throat. This makes it easier to get as much air in as possible, but makes it harder for your vocal cords to vibrate, changing the sounds of your voice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
