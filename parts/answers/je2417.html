		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Divers are going to watch their heads and are in a mostly open area with very little heavy falling debris, so putting the oxygen valve up near the head allows it to be safer in the case of cramped spaces, and limits the hoses required to get the oxygen to the facemask.</p>
<p>Firefighters have to worry a lot more about falling debris and dangling wires and pipes, and worry less about the pressures of being underwater, so they use a longer hose and put the tanks on valves down, so a falling beam is more likely to strike the sturdy bottom of the tank and not the relatively fragile valves that release oxygen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There <strong>isn't</strong> oxygen in the divers cylinders, it's nothing more than dried, filtered and very compressed air, exactly the same air you are breathing now (again except some technical and mixed gas diving). Pure Oxygen is poisonous and will kill you below 9 meters</p>
<p>The reason for the valve locations is very simple. The scuba diver has no need to ever touch their valves underwater (except in some technical situations, but then the diving configurations is different) While the fire fighters can need to turn it on and off as required</p>
<p>Also it makes it so much easier to be able to have your cylinder standing upright while you attach your bcd and regs to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are right the pressure mean that the air will exist out no matter the orientation. But firefigther have their oxygen tank upside down because if something fall on them (which is pretty frequent in their line of job) it won't break their exit valve.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, because fire fighters are prioritizing weight &amp; mobility in confined spaces, while SCUBA divers are prioritizing ease-of-handling over long periods (and generally don't care at all about confined spaces).</p>
<p>Valve on the bottom means you can easily reach back with your hand to turn it on/off when needed; divers &quot;never&quot; need to turn it off while wearing it.</p>
<p>Valve on the top means you can put a flat cap on the bottom so the tank will stand upright while you rig it; this adds some weight and bulk but that doesn't matter underwater.</p>
<p>Valve on the top shortens the hoses (typically four for a recreational diver: main regulator, backup regulator, pressure gauge, buoyancy-compensator). Firefighters just need one hose, so this isn't as big a factor.</p>
<p>But the biggie: valve on bottom shelters it behind your body so it's less likely to hit/hook-on/interfere with movement in confined spaces. SCUBA divers generally aren't in confined spaces.</p>
<p>Note: it's usually not an oxygen tank in either case, it's an air tank.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>More than one reason.</p>
<p>Mobility restrictions for one.  Don all that protective gear and you will find it easier to reach the air valve when it's lower on your back.</p>
<p>Buoyancy is another.  Luxfur tanks tanks tend to be more neutral but catalina tanks (manufacturers) tend to be more top buoyant below ~1500psi.  You really don't want a tank pulling your arse above your head the future in you dive.</p>
<p>We're also talking fibre (scba) vs Aluminim and Steel (scuba, weight) so you can bet divers drop their tanks on deck.  Tthink broken regs and bent din valves if they hit first.</p>
<p>Quoting another</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The scuba diver has no need to ever touch their valves underwater</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>BS.  If you can't reach that valve behind your head to open and close it then you're doing it wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
