A lot of the big crocs get out into the sea at least on occasion (as do things like hippos) and of course many will live in lakes (not sure if you're counting them...). But the gharial can easily top 4m for big animals and to my knowledge don't get into the sea (when Niles, muggers and slatwater crocs all do). Other than that, one of the bigger river dolphins might do it, I don't think they get into lakes (well the Amazon one might get stuck in a temporary lake from flooding but that would be a bit of an exception).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
