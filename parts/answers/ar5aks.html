The Nestle Tollhouse Break and Bake cookies for example, contain &quot;0g trans fats&quot; per serving of 1 cookie. The ingredient list is pretty upfront that it actually does contain hydrogenated oils in the form of margarine, so each cookie can contain up to 0.49 grams of trans fat. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if trans fat reduction is just fake news; i.e. by calling it something else that is not regulated.  For example, I wanted to know what my favorite Mexican food place was deep frying their tortilla chips in.  They did not know, but were nice enough to show me the 5 gallon bucket it came in. Shortening read the label, ingredients; soy beans.  Isn't shortening going to be a trans fat?    So I looked it up and I think this, can someone explain that it is not? </p>
<p><strong>Interesterified</strong> fat is a type of <strong>oil</strong> where the fatty acids have been moved from one triglyceride molecule to another. This is generally done to modify the melting point, slow rancidification and create an <strong>oil</strong> more suitable for deep frying or making margarine with good taste and low saturated fat content. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
