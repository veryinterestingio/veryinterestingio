		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is some truth to what the other comments claim. However, the most important limiting factor for your body's ability to use oxygen (VO2 max) is your heart and its ability to pump blood. This is true for everyone except those with lung conditions and elite athletes. On average, we only use 60% of our lungs' maximum capacity when our heart is maxed out. So, to increase our stamina, we exercise our heart.</p>
<p>When we exercise our heart, it can pump more blood per contraction. Your heart can pump more blood &gt; more oxygenated blood is pumped into the body &gt; your muscles have access to more oxygen &gt; your muscles can maintain a force over a longer time period before producing lactic acid.</p>
<p>It is true that the muscles also get better at using the oxygen (more blood vessels are created, more mitochondria, et cetera), but this is not as significant.</p>
<p>This is a heavily simplified explanation and also has to do with lactic acid and proton clearance by the liver, to name an example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another component of stamina is the amount of hemoglobin in our blood. Hemoglobin is on red blood cells and is what carries the oxygen from our lungs to our muscles. When you do endurance training, your body will respond by making more hemoglobin. The higher the amount of hemoglobin in your blood, the more oxygen you can get to your muscles with each heart beat. </p>
<p>Pro athletes take drugs to increase hemoglobin, or will sometimes do &quot;blood doping&quot;, where they remove a bunch of their own blood, concentrate the red blood cells, save it in a freezer, wait for their body to replace the missing red blood cells, then reinject the original blood cells into their veins giving them a higher concentration than when they started.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your vo2 max is a large part of it, that's the percentage of oxygen your body can process out of each breath of air.
If you have more type 1 muscle fibers that also helps, some people are born with more, and are thus more equipped to be endurance athletes. </p>
<p>You can train both of those and see improvements though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing I’m not seeing or maybe missed:</p>
<p>The sore/tired feeling in your muscles comes from a build up of lactic acid. Consistent cardio training not only reduces the rate of lactic acid buildup (through VO2 max gains - already mentioned), but hepatic efficiency at metabolizing lactic acid ALSO improves - this allowing more exertion with the same buildup or reducing buildup for a given exertion level. </p>
<p>There are also physical changes - runners will find more efficient strides: look at how an olympians legs move vs your own, watch how their upper body moves (it doesn’t much). </p>
<p>Intercostal muscles and the diaphragm can get stronger allowing for a larger chest cavity expansion and more aggressive exhale. </p>
<p>Some endurance athletes are even able to tap into some portions of the mammalian dive reflex - the spleen can contract and pump excess red blood cells into the bloodstream allowing for better gas transport.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several things happen when you train stamina.</p>
<ul>
<li>Muscles will grow some, and they'll grow some more blood vessels. Additionally, they'll hold more oxygen and nutrients. Most of this is hardly visible, but you'd certainly feel it.</li>
<li>Lung muscles (most importantly the diaphragm, which is basically a funny muscle, but there's other muscles that contribute to breathing) grow, and get accustomed to the demand.</li>
<li>The heart might grow some (depending on your age), and it will get accustomed to the demand - essentially,with practice, it'll learn how to pump more blood.</li>
<li>The liver is set to build up carbohydrates to release when they're needed.</li>
<li>You learn how to use your muscles more efficiently. This includes how to breathe efficiently while exercising.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm a lot more of a stamina person than a strength person. I already started with great stamina in my youth, and later extended it to the point where I could walk at a fast pace for a whole day, and the next day, too. Currently, I'm somewhat &quot;rusted&quot;. For example, I won't start a hundred kilometres hike today. Stamina builds slowly, but it stays a long time, too. Makes sense from an evolutionary perspective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
