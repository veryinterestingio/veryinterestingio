		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stretching does a few different things. First, it helps to align the tissues that connect your muscles to your bones. Second, whenever you move a muscle, the muscle will send signals communicating how long it has been extended. If it extends too far, it will receive a message telling it to contract â€“ the purpose being to prevent injury. This message can be overridden by stretching correctly, granting a higher range of motion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because if you don't use several muscles for example in your legs or something if you sit for extended periods of time then the muscles tighten, when you stretch you loosen up those muscles and help you keep your muscles strong and flexible. Also to add onto this the reason why stretches feel so good is because the nerves in your body send messages to your brain saying, &quot;bruh this shit <strong>GOOD</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Also I may be wrong but I'm almost certain this is right</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
