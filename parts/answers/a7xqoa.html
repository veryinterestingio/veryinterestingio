		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Being in debt is quite normal. You are also likely in debt as you might have a mortgage, student loan and a car loan. You may not be 21 trillion dollars in debt but then again you do not own as much land or have as much income as the US government. The government shutdown issues in the US is unique to US law. The way it works is that congress issues the laws and the government with the president in charge have to follow these laws. One of the laws that congress issues is the government budget. This tells how much money the government have to spend on various issues. Note that they have to spend this money, it is required by law. However a law which is unique to the US is the debt ceiling. This law which again is issued by congress sets a limit for how much debt the government can have. In most countries there is no direct law setting this limit. As the government can only spend the money allocated in the budget they can not spend more money then the congress wants them to anyway. Trump is not allowed to take up a government loan to build a boarder wall towards Mexico as the budget does not have any money allocated for such a project. So congress is regulating government spending through both the budget and the debt ceiling. The issue is that every year the congress issues a budget with a budget deficit. This means that they order the government to spend more money then they make. Again this is not a big issue as long as the deficit does not become too big. The government can easily pay the debt later on. However when congress issues a new budget they often fail to also issue a new debt ceiling to allow the government to loan the money they have ordered them to spend. This means that every time the government is about to run out of money congress can get angry at the president for so badly managing the government so that they have spent more money then they have (as ordered by congress). And now congress have to save the day by increasing the debt ceiling which puts the government in more debt. And on top of this they will attach some unrelated piece of legislation on the new debt ceiling bill. If the president vetos the bill it his his fault again.</p>

<p>This is like your mom handing you $5 to buy school lunch, even though she knows school lunch costs $6. If you come home hungry she is going to yell at you for not buying school lunch as she told you to. If you spend $6 she is going to yell at you for spending too much money on school lunch. Any way it is a problem that she created that only she can solve but you can be blamed for it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, not at all.</p>
<p>75% of the US government has fully signed appropriations bills for FY19, they're not shutting down.  This included DoD and other big chunks.</p>
<p>There are about 7 departments without funding, it's mostly DHS and Transportation.  However, most of the folks you see in those departments, like TSA and ATC, are &quot;essential&quot; which means they have to work even if their part of the government is shut down.</p>
<p>Having debt doesn't mean being bankrupt.  The US Government owns 28% of all the land in the US.  (most of it in 12 big western states)  They have debts, but they have assets also.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The government being in debt is different from a person being in debt.</p>
<p>The government can issue treasury bonds to investors, in order to raise cash to fund larger programmes. This is recorded as debt, which is different than a person owing money to the bank debt because they overspent.</p>
<p>Government debt does not exist in a vacuum, the government is spending it on something. If the government spending stimulates the economy to grow faster, the increase in tax revenue will offset the debt.</p>
<p>The government does not ever need to pay back the debt, they just need to service the debt (ie pay off interest). If the interest rate on debt is lower than the growth rate of GDP, there is no issue. Even if it exceeds the growth rate temporarily, there is no issue.</p>
<p>Government “shutting down” is a political weapon, not an economic reality. It is also very unique to the US, which for some reason has a manually-set debt ceiling at an arbitrary amount.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Debt can be a very valuable financial tool.</p>
<p>Suppose you work a crappy job. If you could drive half an hour to the next town, you could get a much better paying job but you don't have a car. You go into debt to get the car and then earn a lot more money. That's a productive debt.</p>
<p>Or if you're a property developer. You want to build an apartment building but don't have fifty million dollars lying around. You go to a bank and borrow the money to build the apartment building, then rent it out. The bank makes money on their loan, income from the apartment building pays for operations and pays back the loan. That's all good for everyone.</p>
<p>So just because the US federal government is in debt, does not mean it ran out of money. It can, and is, repaying the loans exactly on schedule and has never missed a debt payment. It also cannot default unless it chooses to, since it can issue new money (which has other consequences).</p>
<p>People disagree on whether the government is wasting taxpayers money which the government took under threat of violence, or if the government is investing in a productive population and bettering people's lives. Between inflation and GDP growth, the government seems to get a great return. It is super cheap for the US government to borrow money because people trust it, and GDP growth over the past many many decades suggests those were good investments. Also, normal inflation makes it cheaper and cheaper to repay the loans. Again, people disagree - some people say that the productive economy is tied to government spending (something like 20% of GDP, half of all healthcare, infrastructure, etc) and some people say that the economy would be even more robust if the government got out of the way. Or that local governments should be in charge and less centralization.</p>
<p>Your job as a citizen is to learn how these things work, what you think about them, what the trade-offs are, what's true vs who's scamming you for personal gain, and how you think your country should be run - then help make that happen. :-)</p>

<p>In the US there laws that state how much debt the government is allowed to have, and its increased manually every time to prevent shut down. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
