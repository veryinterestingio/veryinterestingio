		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This has a cultural base. The Japanese rulers were believed to be mandated emperors of heaven, and while many cultural differences existed between say, an Egyptian Pharaoh and a Japanese emperor, the deific elements of them being sacred and tied to divine will...those were strikingly similar.</p>
<p>Shoguns and perhaps Daimyos were king equivalents, I suppose, and many would vie for the title of emperor at certain points in earlier historical times.</p>
<p>Shogun by James Clavell is a fiction work that portrays it surprisingly well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, CK3 isn’t a one-to-one historical sim</p>
<p>The idea of an Emperor being a monarch with subservient Kings is mostly associated with the Holy Roman Empire, where the Empire had multiple kingdoms beneath it- in pretty much every western context, “emperor” 9/10 times is just a monarch who considers themselves an heir to Rome- the Russian Tsars, the German Kaisers, and the French Empires, all follow this line of thinking.</p>
<p>In Asia, Emperor as a translated title is just the best way to refer to the monarch of a large and diverse nation- and the Japanese monarchy very closely mirrors the Chinese one, and if China has an Emperor, than Japan shall too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The title of the Japanese monarch is &quot;天皇&quot;, which is a translation of the title that the Chinese monarchs used before being overthrown in the twentieth century: &quot;皇帝&quot;.  The question is how to translate this title into English.</p>
<p>The most direct translation would probably be &quot;Lord God&quot;: the rulers of China and Japan wanted to be treated not as peers of Cyrus or Caesar but rather as peers of Allah or Zeus.  [edit: u/runfromdusk rightly objects below that while this may have been the attitude of the Japanese monarchs, it wasn't really the attitude of the Chinese ones; there's a profound difference between a ruler <em>of</em> Heaven and a ruler <em>chosen by</em> Heaven.]  However, to Western ears a human demanding to be thought of as a God sounds (a) blasphemous and idolatrous and (b) ridiculously puffed up.  So that translation was unacceptable.</p>
<p>At the time the translation question was being decided, Japan wasn't really known to the West yet, so the question was what to call the ruler of China.  And China plausibly <em>was</em> an empire, ruling over many subject peoples with different cultures from one another.  It was more reasonable to think of China as a peer of Persia or Rome than to think of it as a peer of Andorra or Scotland.  So we decided to translate the title as &quot;Emperor&quot;.  When we later discovered that the Japanese monarchs used the same title, we went ahead and started calling them &quot;Emperor&quot;s too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding one thing:  At the end of WWII, Emperor Hirohito was basically forced to disavow himself of divine power. He was allowed to keep the title due to McArthur’s insistence in order to keep the Japanese people from fighting the surrender and to give them some sense of pride as they recovered from the destruction that had been wrought on their country. Many people wanted Hirohito to stand trial for war crimes as so many Nazi’s did and also many Japanese leaders.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Europeans translated the Chinese &quot;皇帝&quot; as Emperor because they ruled a vast land with control over multiple groups of people, held the highest diplomatic/political rank in the region, and was the military and cultural hedgemon of East Asia. </p>
<p>The Japanese title for their monarch is &quot;天皇,&quot; which is essentially a portmanteau of two Chinese Imperial titles, 皇帝 and 天子. The Japanese essentially just borrowed the title from China. They had some fights about it, but China never actually did anything to actually force the Japanese monarch  to give up the title, and Japan drifted a bit further out of China's sphere of influence, so the Chinese stopped pressing the issue in return for the Japanese Emperor's cooperation to cut down Japanese pirates.</p>
<p>When the Europeans came along, they translated both as Emperor for consistency.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
