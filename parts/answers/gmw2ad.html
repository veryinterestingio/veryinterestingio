		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh, an air curtain. The doors are opening all the time, and spending some electricity making a vertical column of air saves a lot of money over letting all that air conditioned air out. I believe some of those open-air coolers use the same effect so they can be open-air yet cool.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several reasons, which vary from site to site.</p>
<ol>
<li>By having a &quot;wall of air&quot; it prevents the indoor air from escaping the building from the door that keeps opening and closing. This keeps in the heated/cooled air.</li>
<li>It keeps bugs and other things that are floating in the air out, to a limited degree.</li>
<li>Some installations negatively charge the air with ions, and then as it blows over you it knocks off all of the dust and dirt that was gonna fall off anyway, and then those charged particles are captured by the HVAC filters.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is kind of ironic that the public has a &quot;neutral to negative&quot; image of these blowers, mainly because nobody really knows the reason why some stores have them and some stores do not... They question why their hair/hat gets messed up at some stores, and not at other stores. Those 'other' stores probably have what is known as a &quot;positive pressure&quot; system, in which filtered/cleaned air is pumped in to the building. And then, all doors become 'vents' which blow the indoor air out. Typically used on big buildings, but it sees some use in speciality stores where they need to keep the dust levels down. Any store where dust would be a huge negative on the product, probably has one. Jewelry and Camera stores are the ones that spring to mind. This is also how 'Clean Rooms' work, but with more cleaning of the air. I used to work at a place where they had one, and whenever the power went out for more than 40 minutes they had to tape all the doors/passthroughs closed. Since with the fans off, some dust will sneak in as the pressure equalizes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not so sure about with supermarkets, but industrial warehouses have them on pretty much all large external doors. They are air curtains, and they are intended to keep bugs and birds and other such flying pests out of the warehouse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Large buildings try to maintain a positive pressure (higher air pressure inside) so that air always blows <em>out</em> when the doors open.</p>
<p>This is done so that dirt and bugs and birds and leaves and snow and whatever else gets blown away instead of drawn in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
