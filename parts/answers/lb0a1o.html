		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The stock market is not <em>money</em>, it's <em>value</em>.</p>
<p>If you have a $1 bill, then you have money with a fixed value of $1.  Today it's worth $1; tomorrow it'll be worth $1.</p>
<p>If you have 1 share of stock that's currently trading at $1, then you do not have any money.  Instead, you have a stock with a variable value - if you sell it right now, then you'll gain $1.  That converts its theoretical value into actual money.</p>
<p>If you bought that stock when it was $1, then sold it when it was $1, you broke even.  You spent $1 of money to gain a stock with a value that can go up and down, then you sold it when the value was $1 and gained that much money back.</p>
<p>If you bought that stock when it was $1, then sold it when it was $100, then the value of your stock went way, way up - but you never had a $1 bill that magically transformed into a $100 bill.  You spent $1 to buy the stock, then you sold it for $100.  You gave your $1 bill to someone in exchange for the stock, then someone else gave you a $100 bill of theirs in exchange for your stock.  <em>Value</em> was created out of thin air here, but it was paid for in <em>money</em> that never changed its worth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From the tone of this question and current events, I assume you're talking about the stock market.</p>
<p>When people say they have X amount of money in the stock market, what they're really talking about is the *value* of their stocks.  And just as the price of physical goods (e.g. food, metal, electronics) fluctuates, the value of stocks (which represent ownership of a company) will also fluctuate.</p>
<p>For example, maybe my phone is currently worth $300.  But tomorrow, the manufacturer announces they're about to release the next model.  My phone's value plummets even though the phone itself is unchanged.</p>
<p>So did my $300 just disappear?  No, I never actually had $300 in the first place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tell me when you thought money was real.</p>
<p>Money is a token that represents a value that's not actually present in the material of the money itself.  A dollar note is not &quot;worth&quot; a dollar of materials, it's just a token that we all generally accept is worth a dollar (which is a purely imaginary concept).</p>
<p>You can talk about &quot;gold standard&quot; and having the value to back the currency, but the &quot;money&quot; you use isn't real, no more real than a number in a bank account.</p>
<p>(Over the pandemic, 34% of people report not being able to use cash to buy things because of shop policies - money is only valuable because we all agreed to use it as a token, that breaks down when we stop using it as such a token, like the Zimbabwean dollar).</p>
<p>But even in ancient times, money was an odd concept.  &quot;This token with a hole in it represents one dollar/lira/whatever, you just have to accept that as true&quot;.</p>
<p>No money is &quot;real&quot;.  They're just tokens of worth that people have agreed to accept.  And you can no more pay with your US$ in my country than with a Zimbabwean dollar.  Until you convert them to the thing that my country has agreed is &quot;a valid token&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
