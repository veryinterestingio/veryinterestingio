<p>The tldr is they used old tissue samples — either intentionally preserved at the time, or recovered from graves under permafrost — and extracted viral DNA from them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a really interesting story. At the time it wasn't known what was causing Spanish flu and the treatments were mainly targeted towards the secondary bacterial infections. Influenza wasn't isolated until 1933 and it was suspected that this caused Spanish flu. It was confirmed that it was an H1N1 strain by testing antibodies from people that had survived the Spanish flu pandemic, however this didn't give us the complete genome of Spanish flu. By using frozen tissue samples preserved mainly from soldiers that had died during the pandemic, a guy called Dr. Jeffrey Taubenberger was able to piece together fragments of the viral genome like a puzzle and he got partially sequenced the genome before he ran out of samples and couldn't complete any more of the genome. This was put on the back burner until Dr. Johan Hultin came in. He had the idea of excavating mass graves from the Spanish flu pandemic in the permafrost of Alaska. The idea was that the tissues would have been well preserved since they would have been frozen since the people were buried, however he had tried this previously and was unsuccessful in obtaining the virus RNA. Luckily, on this occasion, they excavated the remains of an obese woman they named Lucy. They found that the fat around her lungs had left them remarkably well-preserved and they were able to obtain (very very tiny) fragments of RNA and use this to complete the puzzle. This was then reverse engineered to produce Spanish flu in the lab and was finally completed in 2006.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
