		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It just feels that way. One of the purposes of sweat is to cool you down by evaporating, so as you are moving around and sweat is released and evaporates, it helps cool you down. Once you have stopped moving the evaporation stops and you notice the sweat. </p>
<p>How much you are sweating plays a factor as well. if you are sweating a lot, your sweat would overcome the evaporation factor and you might notice it even when you are moving.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of the air around your body as a bunch of tiny men with backpacks. </p>
<p>Each backpack holds water, those men pick up the water that you sweat and put it in the backpack.   We call this evaporation. </p>
<p>As they fill up the backpack it’s harder and harder to set it down, add water and pick it back up. Eventually, the the air men slow down or just can’t pick up anymore water. </p>
<p>If you’re making water faster than they can pick it up, what’s left on your body is sweat. </p>
<p>Now when you are moving through the air or air is passing by you, there’s always new/fresh men with empty backpacks getting blown by that can pick up the water faster, so you stay drier. </p>
<p>When you stop moving or don’t have air passing over you, those men are stuck next to your skin and their backpacks fill up real fast. it takes a lot longer for them to pick up the water so you seem much sweatier. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to the already good answers: people often go indoors after moving which might be warmer and without any wind/breeze, which only emphasizes the forementioned effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I definitely get this when I'm walking. Can feel fine with multiple layers on. Definitely not a case of sweat evaporating.. it's definitely not swearing at all. I stop moving and it all just comes at the same time. Same with feeling out of breath.. I can feel fine while moving then I stop and suddenly realise I'm a bit short of breath.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I hear a lot of explanations that are claiming that it is the moving air that allows the sweat to evaporate faster, but I'm not convinced.   For instance, if I exercise using the rowing machine, I am moving some, but I am hardly running through rapidly moving air.  However, if I suddenly stop rowing, the sweat begins to pour off of me.  </p>
<p>I do wonder if your body, during exercise, reaches some sort of elevated equilibrium resulting in more energy devoted to muscle motion, respiration, etc.  If you stop suddenly that elevated energy has got to go somewhere, and your body's sweat gland system picks up that elevated energy that is no longer being devoted to the muscle movements of the exercise, resulting in higher levels of perspiration.  Of course, I have only anecdotal evidence to back up this hypothesis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
