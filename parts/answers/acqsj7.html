		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably only in earnest from the 5th century on as people who had living memory of pagan practices died off.  You could make a reasonable argument that people who lived through Julian the Apostate's reinstitution of paganism in 361 &amp; 362 may have lived on to as late as \~450.  Within another generation or two, so perhaps by 500 or so, there were probably very few who actually experienced Roman &amp; Greek paganism firsthand.<br />
Edit: I'd also suggest that it didn't make that shift at the same time in all current/former parts of the Roman &amp; Greek world.  The shift to mythology probably took place much faster in places like Britain (which had been abandoned in the fourth century) and Dacia (abandoned in the third century) than it did in Hispania or Africa.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answers here seem to be missing the mark somewhat.</p>
<p>I understand what you mean by mythology vs religion, are these the guiding principles of the Kosmos or just interesting stories? When did the majority of people switch from thinking one way to thinking the other?</p>
<p>The unsatisfying answer is that there was no particular moment. However we have good evidence that upper class Greeks with leisure time already treated stories like the Illiad and Hesiod's Theogeny as half remember history, not necessarily to be taken literally. </p>
<p>As far back as the 6th century B.C. Thales was already looking for materialistic explanations for things. The classical era and afterwards (Plato and Aristotle's time) seems to have been a time when most upper class Greeks were at least agnostic about the Gods, it was probably best to observe the rituals and ceremonies but few aristocrats (that I have read) write about the Gods and the stories around them as though they were fact. Herodotus, Thucydides and others all mention a sort of passing belief in something more akin to Karma than direct divine intervention. Herodotus is willing to ascribe the misfortunes of armies to punishment from the Gods for their commanders' hubris, but he is also more than willing to question any and all of the specifics about the nature of the gods. I personally get the impression that he would have gladly accepted a materialistic explanation for the universe.</p>
<p>By the time the Romans adopted the Greek system it was already an archaic and somewhat (not entirely) foreign system. Aristocrats in Rome adopted Greek theology for the same reasons that they adopted Greek language, to take part in the majority culture of the wealthy Eastern Mediterranean. There is good reason to believe that Roman upper classes where very pious in the early republican period, however as the empire expanded and Rome conquered more Greek speaking and other peoples, they seem to have become more cynical. By the time of the empire new philosophical and spiritual beliefs had taken root and it was more likely to find a Stoic who believed in a sort of deistic &quot;prime mover&quot; type God in the Aristotelian model. </p>
<p>All of this needs to be tempered by the fact that we really don't know what the rest of non-aristocratic society thought about these sorts of things. It's obvious that there was piety, but what proportion of people took these things seriously and how many were just going through the motions is difficult to say. Mystery cults like the Eleusinian Mysteries attracted people from all walks of life, and were apparently absolutely earnest in their spiritual beliefs. However it is hard to say to what degree the Eleusinian mysteries actually shared a cosmology with more traditional Greek beliefs. While the Mysteries mention Orpheus, Persephone , Demeter and Hades, it seems likely that these characters where consciously used as metaphors for a more abstract idea of the universe and how it works. </p>
<p>Sorry if this was long-winded. I am very bad at speaking to 5 year olds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
