<p>If you walk or run with shoes on you go heel to toe, but you don’t do this barefoot since it hurts to slam your unprotected heel into the ground. </p>
<p>Behavior can change rapidly while anatomy must be influenced by evolution and its very slow, i think theres been some studies suggesting feet are getting smaller but any changes in the few thousands of years we’ve had shoes will be slight if any.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Full foot covering shoes are a relatively new thing, only being around for the last 1000 years or so, and before that any type of footwear was usually sandals or similar or just went barefoot. Once you go barefoot awhile your skin thickens to the point you can walk over stones without an issue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Any variation in physical form must confer a reproductive advantage in order for it to replace another physical form over time. Genetic variation happens, but a wholesale change across an entire species would only occur if the derived form conveyed differential reproductive success compared to the ancestral form. It’s very unlikely that variation in feet due to the constraints of wearing shoes would make one more successful than another in passing along that genetic variation to offspring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. No in the sense that feet are the same as they were since before shoes. Yes, in that the shape of the foot can change based on its development. Some aboriginal tribesmen who have never wear shoes, generally have wider feet and more spread out toes, since they would be used for gripping and balancing with your bare feet. </p>
<p>It’s the same concept as the Ancient Chinese tradition of foot wrapping a young woman’s feet to keep them small. Buts it’s more gradual and serves a purpose if you never wear shoes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You may not know (I was surprised when I first realized) but shoes haven't been around very long. Alexander the Great conquered much of the world barefoot! Hard-soled shoes were one of the reasons the Roman armies were so successful, it allowed them to march much farther per day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
