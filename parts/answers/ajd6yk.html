		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dyslexia isn't just about words and reading/writing. It's about how the brain uses working memory, for example dyslexic people may have issues organizing things and remembering certain details. I am dyslexic and I can read fine but have trouble forming sentences when writing / trying to explain something out loud.</p>
<p>Edit: I am 27 and only recently diagnosed (wish I'd done it as a child), if you believe that  many of the symptoms here apply to you contact your doctor. Only a trained physiologist can diagnose learning difficulties. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Does anyone with dyslexia have issues with disorientation and direction even beyond knowing north-south, east-west? I have a very difficult time knowing where I am in relation to other things outside of about a 1200 ft radius. Navigating around a city, even getting myself to a place I've already been multiple times is really difficult. I've heard this described as a form of dyslexia but haven't been able to find much research on the topic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People with dyslexia tend to find letters similar, like d and b, p and q, I and l. So, it doesn't matter which language is written, dyslexia will still kick in when reading a text.</p>
<p>Comic Sans, a universally hated font, proven to be easier to understand by dyslexic people, as their letters are fairly different from one another, therefore harder to confuse one letter with the other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My dyslexia can be worse due to stress and anxiety. On a good day its reading sentences mixed up or brushing my teeth before my first coffee or mixing up the order of my prescriptions. </p>
<p>On a high stress day I will literally have to write out each step for the work I do to make sure I stay on track, and cross them off as I go and talk out loud to myself when completed almost like in a tick like fashion. It can get out of hand if I dont actively work on it. </p>
<p>The worst was probably during a phone switch cut over when I worked for the phone company, took a shit pulled my pants up to hurry back into the colo until one of the other techs was like what's that smell.... On the other hand it's way more rewarding when I am able to do something without it being it being jumbled. Sorry for formatting on mobile.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dyslexia isn't just mixing up letter. </p>
<p>Dyslexia is caused by a different way of thinking. People with dyslexia think in a much more visual way than the average person. They also have a higher ability to be able to mental view objects from different perspectives, rotating them in their minds. </p>
<p>But because of this ease sometimes they do it when they don't mean to. So letter and words rotate or rearrange themselves in the person's mind making it difficult to read. This is much more common, or triggered by words that lack a clear visual meaning. The, a, an, that, this, those, and a lot of other words similar to those don't have an image that easily represents them. People with dyslexia get tripped up by those words causing them to disassociate. </p>
<p>So the answer to your second question is yes. If you are dyslexic and your first language is English, were you to learn another language you would have the same difficulties in that language because of your dyslexia.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
