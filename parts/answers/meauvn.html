		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a very good question! You've asked about a lot of objects- from the moon to stars to galaxies - but I'm going to tell about the very real thing that takes up most of the 'neverending nothingness' directions.</p>
<p>You've stumbled on a problem known as 'Olber's Paradox' - if the universe is infinitely big and old, then when I look at the night sky, every line of sight should eventually end at the surface of a star, so the night sky should be hilariously bright, and basically the entire sky should look like the surface of the sun! So what gives?</p>
<p>The answer is that most of the sky does not, in fact, end at stars. The majority of lines of sight into space, and I mean a <em>vast overwhelming majority</em>, end on the cosmic microwave background. This is the light that is 'left over' from the big bang, emitted when the universe has expanded and cooled enough that electrons and nuclei could finally combine to form atoms and release the photons rattling around between them. The universe became transparent, and this light was emitted. It fills the universe today, but <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/13/82/53/13825394ce4d536074de4b349b160fe7.jpg" target="_blank">appears to 'originate' from a shell surrounding the visible universe.</a> You can't go out and see this with your naked eye, the photons are at wavelengths much longer than you eye sees, with an appropriately designed antenna and equipment <a href="http://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2013/03/planck_cmb/12583930-4-eng-GB/Planck_CMB_pillars.jpg" target="_blank">you can make a beautiful map of it.</a></p>
<p>Oh and since you asked, about 0.00112% of the sky is covered in 'moon' (provided it's, you know, actually visible that night). Technically though, the 'night' sky is only half the total sky, so the total number of lines of sight that end on the moon is half as many, closer to 0.00056%</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the reasons already mentioned, the night sky also seems dark is because our eyes are too insensitive to collect enough light to see the vast majority of stars. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Drive 20 miles outside a city. You will see around 6,000 stars in the night sky. Drive back to town. You will now see only a few dozen stars looking up at the same night sky. Your eyes are receiving light from the same 6,000 stars, but your eyes are no longer sensitive enough to see them in city light pollution. </p>
</li>
<li>Your eyes aren't sensitive enough to see 76% of main sequence stars, i.e., small M-type red dwarfs, even Proxima Centauri only 4 2 light years away.</li>
