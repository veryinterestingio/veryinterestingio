<p>Incase you’re interested, the end of “in the flesh?” By Pink Floyd gives me a crazy feeling that is similar to getting a fright or being chased, so I would’ve guessed it was to do with adrenaline.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m pretty sure this feeling is called frisson.</p>
<p>Frisson- is a psychophysiological response to rewarding auditory and/or visual stimuli that often induces a pleasurable or otherwise positively-valenced affective state and transient paresthesia (skin tingling or chills), sometimes along with piloerection (goose bumps) and mydriasis (pupil dilation).The sensation commonly occurs as a mildly to moderately pleasurable emotional response to music with skin tingling.</p>
<p>I’ve been experiencing this since I was young age and I can it makes me feel good because I get all excited etc</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So someone already answered the neurological response in the hypothalamus, but physiologically this is referred to as frisson. Frisson is a psychophysiological reaction for an emotional response to auditory stimuli. We know it's connected to the reward system in our brains which releases &quot;feel good&quot; chemicals when we encounter something that may have been considered evolutionarily beneficial in the past. This anthropological theory has been cited to explain why some people experience frisson such as &quot;spine tingles&quot; and paresthesia like &quot;goosebumps&quot; in response to sounds such as rain and thunder - as these conditions may have meant our ancestors were safe from predators making the promotion of relaxation beneficial.</p>
<p>Not everyone experiences frisson and even fewer can trigger these sensations without stimuli. Somewhere along mankind's journey our big ol smarty brains crossed these responses with sensory stimulation that we found enjoyable (or perhaps the other way around), resulting in shivers when we experience a song or speech or image that we find particularly emotionally compelling.</p>
<p>Sources: I don't have them on me at the moment. I am a Bio major studying pre med and this very specific topic is something I dove down the rabbit hole for after finding my family had the ability to trigger frisson freely while a friend of mine could not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
