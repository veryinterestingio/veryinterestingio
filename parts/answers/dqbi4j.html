		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. Detail observed is inversely proportional to eye size. Essentially, larger eyes allow in more light and therefore can see smaller details. There are variations within the rule based on specific creatures' eye structures, i.e. amount of photoreceptors present, but it remains true on a macro scale.</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> shoutout to u/aberneth for a good counterpoint.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The resolving power of a lens is roughly proportional to the diameter of the lens divided by its focal length (numerical aperture). If you miniaturize a lens, keeping this ratio constant, the resolving power is unchanged until the lens starts to become very small (a few micrometers or tens of micrometers). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For clarification, a larger eye would have better angular resolution, but not necessarily better overall resolution. In other words, a bigger eye can see smaller details from further away, like a telescope. A microscope can still observe small details when up very close, but a proportionally large lens would be able to see those details from further away. So, bringing it back to the original question: if we can't see germs, then bugs can't see germs.</p>
<p><em>Edit 2:</em> for everyone discussing the anatomical structure of different animal eyes, there are plenty of additional factors beyond just lens size. Eye spacing, eye angles, amount of photoreceptors, structure of photoreceptors, the brain's ability to interpret signals from the optical nerve, etc., are all important but don't seem like the proper answer to the question, which is about mathematical proportions, not biology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Bugs do not have eyes like we do. They often have compound eyes, which don't really see detail as much as motion. They largely use their other senses to navigate and find food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ants are like 2mm and humans are like 2m so the ratio is .002:2 or 1:1000.  </p>
<p>Bacteria are like 2Âµm so the ant ratio is .000002:.002 or 1:1000.</p>
<p>However, the wavelength of light seen by ants and humans is the same.  Ant eyes don't have the same resolving power as human eyes, they are far too small.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While other comments focus on eye size and the amount of light it let's in.</p>
<p>I will ELI5 that insects have vastly less evolved eyes than we do. They are simpler organisms for several reasons, my personal favourite is energy. We consume and use energy in much larger quantities than an insect, it helps drive more complex system such as our brain to process images from our eyes. We evolved to primarily rely on our eyes, unlike some other animals, so we can afford to spend the energy resources on big expensive ones.</p>
<p>Edit: Try explaining to a 5yo that light is a wave..</p>
<p>&quot;a wave like the sea?&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people are talking about eye sizes, but the reality of the matter is that you need at least 1000x magnification to see individual bacterial cells. Bugs and people are much closer in size than bugs and bacteria are, so the answer is no. Bacteria are not 'bug sized' to bugs</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
