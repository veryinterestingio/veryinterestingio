<p>How long will it take before I truly understand how god awful electrons work. Do you truly understand it or are you bluffing? I feel like everybody just repeats the same textbook buzzwords without really understanding it properly!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Giulio, my question is if you applied your methods to study structures of organic components such ion channels on a cell membrane with similar qualities to x-ray crystallography using TEM. I'm not an expert in electron microscopy but I'm aware that SEM is preferred to study such structures instead of TEM.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

What is the most surprising thing you've found out about Electron microscopes? In terms of another use or something no one really realised you could do with them?  </p>
<p>Whats the coolest object you've had in the firing range? (Not tempreture wise! :P)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
