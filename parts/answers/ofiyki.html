		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plants get tumors, but it's debatable whether they qualify as cancer.  Examples of a tumor on a plant include a burl or crown gall. The tumors are uncontrolled and abnormal growth of cells, which is one definition of cancer. But tumors don't spread throughout the body (called metastasizing) in plants like they do in humans because plant cells have cell walls that make the structure rigid and lock cells in place. Some definitions of cancer include that it spreads, so in that sense the term wouldn't apply.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many cancers in people are not metastatic  but will kill you.  Many tumors that are “benign” (like gliomas or lipomas) can also kill you or make you lose function depending on where they are.</p>
<p>The solid tumors of plants are really the same as solid tumors in vertebrates, including that some are caused by viruses and some mechanistic similarities.  The moving of some of those cells elsewhere, or specific types of cancer in non solid tissue (like blood cells) is just a special case of the same basic problem</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
