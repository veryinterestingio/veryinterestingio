<p>with an easy infection vector.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's actually not a very easy infection vector.  Spread by respiratory droplets or through contaminated water is an easy infection vector, requiring one animal to have to actually get physically bitten by another is actually a pretty difficult infection vector, since most animals will go out of their way to not get bitten.  Furthermore, in any aggressive alteraction there's a significant chance that either the rabid animal or the bitten animal will die outright of other causes, which reduces further spread.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It makes more sense to approach this backwards: you know that rabies has a pretty stable prevalence since it still exists (i.e. it is in some kind of equilibrium), it takes between 2 and 10 days to kill its host, and it is effectively 100% fatal. Based on this knowledge, you could model the infection rate of rabies using a Kolmogorov equation. </p>
<p>The answer is that it is contained by being exactly as infectious as it needs to be in order to be contained. Overly-infectious strains theoretically kill all their hosts and die out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Saliva isn’t a great means of infection. Humans don’t get bit all that often by wild animals, and we’re far less aware and agile than most other wild animals. </p>
<p>Not sure if predators instinctually know what sick animals are safe to eat. Animals do have an odd tendency to isolate themselves when they’re dying, wonder if that might be an instinctual development from something like rabies? </p>
<p>There’s also a documentary on that girl who survived from an experimental induced coma, she regained full functionality as well. Only documented instance of survival I believe. It’s quite interesting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not all canines with rabies are aggressive.  Some will have paralysis, and be dragging a leg, for example.  Approaching any animal that appears hurt (domestic or wild) should be done cautiously.  Rabies is endemic in my county, so when you see a wild animal out during the day when it is nocturnal, that’s a behavior to watch for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
