		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your sinus cavities are connected to your nose and mouth by narrow channels. If those channels get blocked, pressure can build up in the sinuses causing pain. If you increase the pressure in your nose by &quot;blowing&quot; with it plugged, you can force a little air through the blockage, opening the channel, and allowing the pressure built up in the sinus to release. However, it can also make things worse if you manage to force even more air in there that also gets stuck and just adds to the pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

But it’s also obviously used in everyday application too, such as your case.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are inflating your sinus cavities and airways which allows any blockages to be released.  If you are in need of relief, other methods you can try are sinus washing, mewing, exercise, or chewing tough gum.  I created /r/sinus for for the community to share tips on these types of issues.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eustachian tube from the auditory canal connects to sinuses, closing off those and pushing pressure typically relieves clogged ears l, hence the pop. Or covering your ears and expelling pressure can help the sinuses I suppose as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
