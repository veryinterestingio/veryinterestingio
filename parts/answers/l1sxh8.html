		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually the subject of my research!</p>
<p>A healthy fart is &gt;95% composed of four gases: nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane. The proportions of these are highly variable between individuals and likely between different times as well. I'll go over each in turn.</p>
<p><strong>Nitrogen</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>20-90% of fart content</li>
<li>Only from &quot;you&quot;, comes from swallowed air and diffusion from blood</li>
<li>Not produced by any gut bacteria</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hydrogen</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>0-40% of fart content</li>
<li>Only from bacteria, comes from fermentation processes</li>
<li>Not produced by any human body process</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Carbon dioxide</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>0-25% of fart content</li>
<li>Produced by both bacterial and human metabolism, most in farts is probably from bacteria</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Methane</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>0-30% of fart content</li>
<li>Produced only by two specific species of archaea (like bacteria but actually very different) that live in the gut</li>
<li>Contrary to popular belief, it's odorless (EDIT: Fart smell comes from products of bacterial metabolism that are only present in trace concentrations in the fart. These include sulfur compounds like hydrogen sulfide, volatile fatty acids, and probably some other stuff too.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Like I said, the proportions vary greatly from individual to individual. In my estimation, you can have anywhere from \~20-90% from &quot;your body&quot; and from \~10-80% from gut microbes. We don't understand all the factors that control fart composition, but most important ones are likely diet, intestinal physiology, what gut bacteria you have, and how long ago you last ate.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> It depends-- could be mostly from bacteria, could be mostly from you, could be half and half.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Just so people know, the subject of my research is bowel gas composition and the effect that has on bacterial metabolism in the gut microbiome. So I read a lot about farts to find out what human bowel gas composition is, but I have unfortunately never worked with farts myself. So I can't answer questions about fart research on human subjects from personal experience unfortunately.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> My sources for this were:</p>

<p>Note that Kirk has a methodological flaw where atmosphere is not purged from the collection apparatus before collection, leading to erroneously high oxygen. But he is actually looking at farts and has a very large sample size. Levitt is the best technique I've ever seen, but the measurement is of total intestinal gas rather than farts specifically and the sample size is much less. It turns out that in terms of everything but oxygen, their results agree quite closely!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Almost all fart gas is from bacteria (hydrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide) and archaea (methane) or else swallowed air and diffusion out of the blood (nitrogen and oxygen). Some amount of carbon dioxide may come from neutralizing acids with bicarbonate in the small intestine, but that's the only really human source that seems possible. We just don't have enzymes that would produce any of the other components.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
