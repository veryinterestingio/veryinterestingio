		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several things that you train when you practice running. In no particular order:</p>
<p>Your muscles get better at extracting oxygen from your blood. If you measure arteriovenous oxygen difference (the amount of oxygen in your arteries minus the amount of oxygen in your veins) it's much higher for endurance athletes.</p>
<p>You train your brain to do the motions of running better. Running is a complex motion. There are a whole bunch of tiny muscles and when you practice running you train them to work together more efficiently.</p>
<p>There's also the more general effect of neuroadaptation, this enhances the nerves ability to get signals from your brain to your legs.</p>
<p>There are also changes in the chemistry of the muscles themselves. They'll get more mitochondria, myoglobin and other substances that they need to contract.</p>
<p>Then there's the effect of changing the body composition. If you run a lot you'll have a higher muscle to fat ratio (assuming you also keep a reasonable diet) so your muscles have less unproductive mass to move around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Angiogenesis. Angio - vessel. Genesis - formation. </p>
<p>A lot of these answers kind of poke around it, but when you make your body demand oxygen, additional vessels are made. This is so that if one large vessel is occluded or injured, there are little ones made during angiogenesis that help supply blood carrying oxygen/nutrients to the tissue that would otherwise be shafted of perfusion because of the blockage in the large vessel. </p>
<p>This makes muscles able to utilize energy and clear out waste (like lactic acidosis that builds up) more quickly as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a pro on this but I think this is correct </p>
<p>The ability for muscles to take oxygen from the blood gets better the more adapted to running u are (oxygen saturation levels).
This means more oxygen for aerobic respiration and more ATP in the same amount of time than if u were respiring anaerobically. So a higher force generated for movement (think it’s something like 32 units of ATP respiring aerobically vs 4 units anaerobically - these numbers may be off tho it’s been a while ahaha).
Also the fact there’s less of a dependency for anaerobic respiration means less lactate produced which makes it difficult to run and decrease movement speed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
