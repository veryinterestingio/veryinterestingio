		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We actually get to see almost the entire history of the universe. Light doesn't travel instantly, so when we look at very distant galaxies, we are seeing them as they were billions of years ago - not as they are now. And as we can see these galaxies, we can observe that the speed of light appears to be unchanged in these distant galaxies - i.e. we can see that the speed of light hasn't changed over time, at least not by much. The speed of light is an important constant that affects the chemistry of elements. But we can get a peek into the chemistry of distant galaxies, because specific atoms and molecules in specific states emit light at very specific frequencies. If the speed of light was radically different, then we'd be able to see radical changes in the emission of these specific elements, and we don't see that.</p>
<p>From our picture of the history of the universe, we see that the universe is <em>evolving</em> in an irreversible way. Gas gets turned into stars, and much of that gas stays in stars - so the star:gas ratio increases over time. Hydrogen and helium gets turned into heavier elements, so we see fewer and fewer heavier elements as we look at more and more distant galaxies. Galaxies merge with each other, and don't separate apart from each other again, and so on. We see lots of different pieces of evidence that all support the idea that the universe has been expanding and evolving since a fixed point in the distance past, rather than either being eternal and unchanging, or very young.</p>
<p>And of course, we can directly measure the expansion of the universe with redshifts, and see that the galaxies are indeed mostly moving apart from each other, and the more distant they are, the faster they are moving away, to the point where it utterly dominates the large-scale motion of galaxies in the universe. We also see, in the very distant universe, a nearly featureless opaque &quot;wall&quot; of material. This is the cosmic microwave background, and it's difficult to explain how such background emission could be so featureless, and such a perfect blackbody, unless it is the final emission from the very early universe, as it transitioned from being opaque and hot and dense into being transparent and cooler and less dense.</p>
<p>Now, there's plenty of wriggle room in debating what the origin of the universe was, and what happened <em>before</em> the big bang and so on. But the idea that the universe has expanded from a hot dense nearly-uniform state at some finite point in the past is very robust.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very certain. It is the only theory that explains all the observed facts and, crucially, it has been used to make predictions that have since been confirmed by new observations.  </p>
<p>The cosmic background radiation was predicted based on the big bang theory, and later confirmed by observation.   </p>
<p>The expansion of the universe is difficult to explain in a steady state model, meaning the universe must have had a beginning.</p>
<p>Of course, in science nothing is ever 100% certain - there might come a new observation tomorrow that casts doubt on everything we think we know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>We have been observing the expansion of the universe for only a very limited duration, given the assumed age of the universe and we are extrapolating this behavior until the start of time.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Others have commented in which sense we are observing the expansion of the universe for almost entirety of its history but I would like to correct another possible misconception. We are not observing the expansion of the universe in the sense that &quot;this star used to be 100000 ly away last year, now it is 101000ly.&quot; For that to work, our science is much too young, our measurements are much too imprecise.  All evidence of expansion is indirect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
