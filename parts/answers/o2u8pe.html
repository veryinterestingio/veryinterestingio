		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an expert on singing technically, however I do know the difference between the two.
They say 'sing from the gut' meaning to use the diaphragm. Which is a muscle that holds up your lungs.
When you use those muscles, you can get more than from using the throat as it sounds fuller and you can get more air out to sound better. Using the throat strains your vocal cords and can cause soreness and raspiness.
To sum it up, the diaphragm feels more natural, and doesn't hurt, the throat does.
I hope this clears it up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Opera singer here — if I want to make a LOT of sound, I need the effort to come from the larger muscles of my body and not the fragile folds of tissue (or, more usually, a bunch of other muscles surrounding those folds of tissue that like to jump in and “help”.... but that’s not helping).  I use my pelvic floor, my back, my belly, my ribs, a feeling of rooting my feet into the floor, to cue a more integrated and efficient movement that will allow for correct resonance.  It feels a bit like I’m a giant pufferfish trying to maintain that expansion against the exhale, but all in a way that feels really good, makes a LOT of sound, and doesn’t damage my voice over time. Singing is simple but it’s not easy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we speak we pretty much just use air like when we breathe. When we exhale, a lot of air comes out at first and then it diminishes until we inhale. If you do that when singing, the last bit of a note will be quieter and lower pitched than the beginning.  If you consciously expel air at a chosen rate by contracting your diaphragm, you have complete control of the sound's loudness. Keeping your throat muscles relaxed gives your vocal cords complete control of the pitch. And then your mouth shapes the sound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had a voice teacher that always stressed this, and it very literally just looks like using your belly a LOT for breath - as in you literally see your belly expanding when you inhale, and &quot;deflating&quot; as you exhale, because you're using the muscles in your abdomen to push the air out.</p>
<p>The example he always gave me was toddlers/babies - they can scream all day long without ever going hoarse, ever wonder why? Watch their belly when they're breathing heavily; they support their breath with their gut, but at some point as we grow up we start to use our chest instead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Melissa cross taught me the answer to this. Take your hands and place one on the middle of your chest, and wrap the other one under your breast/pec. Imagine you have a band wrapped around the area of that second hand and you want to break that band using just that bottom part of your chest. You do NOT want that top hand moving with your breath. It feels like you’re breathing with just the bottom of your lungs and is WEIRD the first time you do it. THAT is “gut”/diaphragm. </p>
<p>Singing from your “throat” is that “untrained” way of singing. It’s like when you go “lalala not listening, lalala”. That very casual voice is your throat voice. It’ll get the job done but it don’t be very powerful and can’t be done long term as it’ll damage your vocal chords. </p>
<p>Head voice is what you use when you’re making fun of someone and go “nya nya nya! I’m a stupid face and this is what my voice sounds like.”</p>
<p>It’s all basically where you’re pushing air from, where the power behind the voice is coming from.</p>
<p>I can’t sing for shit, but I least I know where to breath in order for my lacking talent to be heard lol! 😄😆😩😭</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
