		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are different &quot;layers&quot; to the air, so at 100 feet, the wind may be blowing to the west, but at 250 feet the wind may be blowing to the east. </p>
<p>So hot air balloons have to go up and down until they find a layer that is going the direction they want to go.   It's not an exact science by any means and sometimes they can't go where they want to go.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, they don't. They go where the wind is going, but the wind doensn't always blow in the same direction in different heights. They can select layers where the wind blows towards where they want to go if one can be found. If not, well, then they just have to land.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The wind direction <em>generally</em> rotates as you go up in altitude. So you can turn one way by climbing, the other by descending. Obviously it's tricky, and there is a competitive event called a &quot;hare and hounds&quot; in which one balloon flies for a while and then lands, and others compete to see who can land closest to it.</p>
<p>There are several ways to gauge wind shift. You commonly have a rope hanging from the envelope to basket level, with a piece of lightweight yarn on the end; any deflection of the yarn indicates a difference in wind between the top of the rope and the bottom. Flags and chimney smoke offer clues, too. At low altitudes, you can drop a handful of chalk dust and see where it hits the ground.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't. I saw a few flying over the airport while I was waiting for a flight, and I asked if they were allowed to be so close. According to the staff at the airport, balloons actually have right of way over other traffic because they can't navigate themselves as effectively.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It all starts with a flight plan.  Pilot must research weather and predict wind direction day before and certainty the of the flight.  Once pilot is confident in his information, a field for takeoff must be selected and its downwind from there.  Pilot needs knowledge of the lay of the land and a ground crew for support.</p>
<p>Mother was a balloon pilot, father and I would chase.  Miss the action to this day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
