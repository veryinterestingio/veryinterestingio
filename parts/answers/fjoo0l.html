		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is my area of expertise!</p>
<p>Let's first address the &quot;Most of the machinery of cells is universal,&quot; statement. While this is true in a sort of surface understanding, that eukaryotes share many basic fundamental processes, and these processes are carried out by related proteins, there are many details that differ at the smaller scales. </p>
<p>At the near atomic scale, we will find that organisms will have variations in amino acid sequence that lead to slightly different properties. The main changes I’ll address here are changes to amino acid residues (the building blocks of proteins) at the surface of a protein, and changes that are added to the protein that are not amino acids (which can happen during and after synthesis of the protein). </p>
<p>If an amino acid on the surface is required for a binding event, and we change that residue (residue is the term I use for amino acid once it has become part of a protein), we will change the characteristics of that binding interface. The molecular details there will be different - charge (positive, negative, or hydrophobic) may be altered, geometry may change, a bulkier residue could physically clash with the would-be binding partner. Even mutations away from the binding interface may change the properties of the interface, a phenomenon known as allostery.
What once was a high affinity interaction may now be inhibited. </p>
<p>Since changing a single amino acid can abolish binding interactions, this restricts a virus to a particular host with a particular interface. If one or a few residues can reduce binding, imagine insertions or deletions of large chunks of protein (accumulated over the course of evolution)!</p>
<p>Another source of variation in proteins are modifications that enzymes in the cell add to proteins. There are enzymes within cells responsible for trimming peptides (several residues), adding highly charged chemical groups, adding sugars, and even adding smaller regulatory or trafficking proteins to existing proteins.</p>
<p>Let's consider an enzyme that catalyzes the addition of sugar molecules (this is called glycosylation). The complement of enzymes that play a role in this process are slightly different species-to-species and even tissue-to-tissue. </p>
<p>The infamous bird flu or swine flu are an important example related to the process of glycosylation. The receptor for Influenza A Virus Hemagglutinin (HA, its surface protein) is a sugar - sialic acid – that is connected to some other sugars and a cell surface protein. </p>
<p>The sialic acid binding site for HA has different affinities for different configurations and linkages of these sugars. A flu virus that mainly interacts with birds will have a binding site optimized for bird receptors, a virus that mainly infects humans will have slightly different binding site that is optimized to bind human receptors.
For those that wish to know the specifics, avian influenza virus will 'prefer' the alpha-2,3 linked sialic acid.
When human cells glycosylate their surface proteins, they end up making alpha-2,6 linkages for sialic acid, so naturally human influenza viruses will have a binding site optimized for the shape of the a-2,6 link.
Unfortunately, pigs, turkeys, and pheasants have both of these types of sugars present. Influenza viruses that have accumulated mutations in their binding site may be at an advantage in those hosts, leading to more virus with higher affinity for alpha-2,6 bearing receptors.</p>
<p>At the next step up in scale, protein dynamics are another largely unexplored area in protein variation. The extent or rate of how quickly a protein is moving or 'breathing' may alter binding interactions. If an interface is hardly ever exposed in one protein due to a difference in how flexible (or inflexible) that protein is, then the affinity may be reduced. Again, this is unexplored territory for the most part. Most of the work in this area so far has been related to antibodies or therapeutic targets.  </p>
<p>Another scale to consider is the amount of a specific protein in a given cell (or cell type). Viruses replicate by hijacking their host's cellular machinery, using the host's energy, building blocks, organization, and architecture as a virus factory. </p>
<p>Every single protein in a virus is highly evolved and specialized to particular environment- meaning pH, temperature, available molecules, and host proteins- and concentrations of these host factors.
Many viral proteins carry out multiple functions, what I would call genetic economy, and so rely on the presence of multiple host proteins at certain levels at specific points in a virus replication cycle for optimal replication.</p>
<p>There is cell-to-cell variation in the amounts of specific proteins- this variation could be due to the tissue type (consider the complement of protein in a muscle cell vs a neuron) or different developmental stages of growth. Comparing one organism to another organism will show incredible variation in levels of most every protein.
This is mainly why viruses are limited to infecting only certain tissues or hosts. </p>
<p>Sure all cells in a human body share the same DNA code, but levels of RNA and protein are considerably different. HIV-1 is restricted to T cells because its Envelope surface protein binds to two proteins that are only expressed in helper T cells – it doesn’t go about infecting your airway epithelial cells. </p>
<p>There are also differences in immune systems! This is a huge field that I can’t possibly cover. But briefly, one example. In many cells, there are immune functions that can restrict a virus from replicating- eg by recognizing virus DNA, RNA, lipids, sugars, or proteins - which then activate responses that prevent the virus from replicating or spreading. Not all organisms have these functions. </p>
<p>So really, machinery of cells isn’t all that universal. And viruses are very compact and have only one highly specialized purpose – to replicate itself. Viruses only carry a few of their own proteins, typically a dozen or so, and heavily rely on their viral proteins forming contacts with specific cellular components, and these interactions are largely dependent on very small (sub-nanometer to 10s of nanometer) binding interfaces. </p>
<p>Change in either the virus or the host may have potential to lead to increasing the binding affinity , paving the way for this jumping from one species to another. But it has to be a perfect storm of accumulated mutations.</p>
<p>Edit- a coronavirus specific example. The coronavirus spike protein is synthesized as a precursor that requires proteolytic processing (chopping of one protein segment into two) at a certain amino acid sequence before it becomes ‘activated’. Without the specific host proteases that recognize that sequence in the right place at the right time, the virus spike protein can not become fusion-competent, trigger, and allow entry into the cell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because a lot of the machinery is NOT universal, especially the parts the virus use to get into cells, then into the nucleus, and then to use the DNA there to make more virus. Those parts are generally very specific to each species, and even to types of cells within a species.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
