		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your question requires some untangling of taxonomy. Modern taxonomy relies on what’s called <em>monophyly</em>. A monophyletic taxon is a group that consists of a common ancestor and all of that ancestor’s descendants. </p>
<p>Taxonomy is also nested. For example, all primates are mammals. Primates are a taxon within Mammalia, another taxon. </p>
<p>For these reasons, birds are dinosaurs. Otherwise dinosaurs wouldn’t be considered monophyletic. Likewise, dinosaurs are reptiles, and so are birds. Folks say birds “are descended from” or “evolved from” dinosaurs, but it’s sort of misleading. I mean, yeah, they did, but they never stopped being dinosaurs.  </p>
<p>We refer to a “crown group” as the common ancestor of all the extant (not extinct) members of a taxon and all of that common ancestor’s descendants. Crown group birds are called Aves. They do share a common ancestor, and that ancestor was a dinosaur – like all birds are. However, we generally can’t track literal common ancestors in the fossil record. In fact, we almost never can, because you can’t really capture the moment of speciation (there’s a rare exception called anagenesis). Therefore, those common ancestors are regarded as hypothetical. That means I can’t point you to a bird and say it’s the common ancestor of all birds. </p>
<p>But wait, there’s more! If you think about it, crown groups are kind of arbitrary, right? They’re an artifact of what survived. If you’re looking at the fossil record, you’ll see a lot more creatures that look a whole lot like birds. There’s a wider group called Avialae, and most paleontologists would call anything in that group a bird. Avialae includes Aves (monophyly!) but it isn’t restricted to the crown.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a National Geographic magazine which was all about bird lineages, I learned that there were likely three lineages of birds which survived the Cretaceous extinction event, and they are: </p>
<p>Ratites: large flightless birds, including the ostrich, emu, and (not very large) kiwi.<br />
Galliformes: various types of fowl, such as chickens, turkeys, and ducks and geese.<br />
Neoaves: all other birds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

This thread is the most riveting thread I've read in a long time.
It makes my general knowledge so minuscule in comparison.
Thanks guys (in a good way).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer to this question is kind of.</p>
<p>Birds can all trace a single lineage back through the dinosaurs. This lineage is the same for all birds and taxinomically we'd say that all modern birds are part of the parent species which is some protobird dinosaur. But this lineage would include multiple different species of dinosaur that went from being quite reptilian to quite birdlike and eventually became the species aves which diversified into the modern order aves.</p>
<p>It's easier to think of this from the level of a modern bird back through time rather than dinosaur forward. As you go back you start with modern aves, then you have the other orders of birds (typically toothed as a main difference from modern aves), then bird like dinosaurs, then non bird like theropods, then ancestral dinosaurs even less like birds. Each of these steps would contain multiple species that are direct ancestors to each other. There's one lineage, but that lineage contains many species.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
