		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Evolution just sticks with whatever it finds that works. The reason why we stopped at the double blink is twofold:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Most situations where you need to close your eyes for protection, you need to close both of them. So the instinct to close both eyes at once in response to a blast of sand in the face of something exists, and it’s what our body uses for lubrication too.  </li>
<li>So far the genes for a single blink reflex either haven’t appeared by mutation, or they haven’t provided enough reproductive advantage to propagate</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm by no means an expert, but I listened to a BBC science podcast once, where the scientist said that laughing, yawning scratching and blinking are all learned and social behaviour. A baby for instance, only blinks when it needs to, which is quite rarely, while adults tend to blink when someone else is blinking. That way, adults blink way more than they really need to.</p>
<p>And for blinking with only one eye, my best (and completely uneducated, do don't go around quoting me on this) guess would be the extra coordination required to blink with one eye. As you know, not everybody can wink, and it requires practise to learn it. So it's harder to wink than it is to blink, hence we rather blink than wink.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From an evolutionary standpoint - blinking with each eye wouldn't benefit an individual any more than blinking with both eyes at once, since blinking takes such a small increment of time, therefore the individual who blinks with both eyes survives and passes on it's genes at the same rate as the one who blinks with one eye, then the other.</p>
<p>From a nervous system point of view - blinking is &quot;automatic&quot; - you don't really do it consciously (most of the time). Also, both of your eyes work in a similar manner - look at the same position, focus on the same object, get exposed to the air for the same amount of time, therefore they get lubricated/moistened at the same time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
