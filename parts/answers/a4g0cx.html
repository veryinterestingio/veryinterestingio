		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends entirely on how much <em>compression</em> the sender is using to save on data capacity. Your cable TV provider is probably compressing the picture transmission so they can carry more channels on the same wires.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone has given various answers relating to &quot;compression&quot;, which is accurate, but is only one part of the story.</p>
<p>An equally important part is the use of <em>one-pass</em> versus <em>two-pass</em> encoding. When compressing a video using two-pass encoding, the compression software will first conduct an <em>analysis</em> pass, scanning the video and checking for various ways to compress it more efficiently than normal. Then, it will go back and do the actual <em>compression</em> pass. This results in <em>much</em> better video quality at the same compression level than you can get with one-pass encoding.</p>
<p>Cable TV is encoded &quot;live&quot;, so there is no possible way for them to do an analysis pass. They have to encode on-the-fly. By contrast, Netflix can encode their content in advance, so they use two-pass encoding for everything.</p>
<p>You can see this phenomenon for yourself with on-demand content: record a show broadcast live with your DVR. Wait two weeks, then look for the same show via on-demand on your cable service. The recording, using one-pass encoding, will look significantly worse than the on-demand version, which they used two-pass encoding on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The resolution of a video stream says nothing about its quality. What matters is compression algorithm and bitrate.</p>
<p>Broadcast TV uses a pretty basic and generic constant bitrate compression algorithm because broadcast TV works that way.</p>
<p>Netflix uses a highly specific variable bitrate compression. </p>
<p>Disclaimer, the information about TV being constant bitrate is a few years old and things might have changed, but I don't think so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
