<p>It's the newer analogues of insulin, which provide much better control of blood sugar levels and are easier to use, which are far more expensive, mainly as many of them are still under patent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would taken tens of millions of dollars to get a drug manufacturing line up and running. Specialty equipment, highly trained engineers, regulatory specialists, plus general costs of doing business. Getting a medicine to market, even one already off-patent, can take years. </p>
