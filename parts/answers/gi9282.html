		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a few questions:  </p>
<ol>
<li>is terraforming a realistical goal?</li>
<li>If yes what would be the main issue? The magnetic field?</li>
<li>how do you feel about the impact of economy and economical decisions on the progress of space research?</li>
<li>I've wondered (and written) on how to terraformâ€¦ i want to know: practically what would be the steps? (for me they were first robots and mines to terraform, then basic life, then complex life, then colonization)</li>
<li>If terraforming is not an option then the best thing to do is find already ready planets or adapt to what there is trough habitats?</li>
