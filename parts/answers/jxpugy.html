		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>HDDs work by rearranging some particles using a magnet. You can do that more or less infinite times (at least reasonably more than what it takes for the mechanical parts to wear down to nothing).</p>
<p>SSDs work by forcibly injecting and sucking out electrons into a tiny, otherwise insulating box where they stay, their presence or absence representing the state of that memory cell. The level of excess electrons in the box controls the ability of current to flow through an associated wire.
The sucking out part is not 100% effective and a few electrons stay in. Constant rewrite cycles also gradually damage the insulator that electrons get smushed through, so it can't quite hold onto the charge when it's filled. This combines to make the difference between empty and full states harder and harder to discern as time goes by.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The failure mechanism for HDD was more of a wearout of the motor or bearings and less of a wear out of the platter itself because it was just changing the magnetic field of particles.</p>
<p>SSDs use flash with a &quot;floating gate transistor&quot; and we store values by injecting charge onto that floating gate.  But how do you get charge onto a floating gate?  You use enough voltage to punch the electrons through the insulators that keep it floating</p>
<p>Each write cycle damages the insulator a little bit causing it to break down over time until the electrons on the gate are free to escape so you can't reliably store bits on it.</p>
<p>For most SSDs though lifetime isn't a huge concern, you can write about 1 PB of data onto a modern 1 TB SSD before it starts wearing out.  SSDs are also built with spare blocks that it doesn't show you, so your 1 TB SSD may come with 1.2 TB of flash and it'll rotate that extra 0.2 TB in as existing blocks get too many writes on them to extend the life of the drive as a whole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do have moving parts. Just on a microscopic scale. When you store data on an SSD a current is passed through a semiconductor layer, causing electrons to move. Shifting around these electrons into different positions is essentially what allows you to store data. Now in pretty much every SSD on the market multiple states are stored in every memory cell, which greatly increases the capacity/volume. Generally a modern SSD will have TLC (that is triple layer cells) and store 3 bits for every single memory cell. The problem is that every time you write to a cell on an SSD the semiconductor layer wears out slightly, causing electrons to essentially become stuck. To remedy this, you can just apply a higher voltage, but at some point the additional voltage required to store a certain state in a cell becomes so high, it will start overlapping into the voltage required to store the next state up. This means the two states would no longer be differentiable and the cell is effectively dead.</p>
<p>Because the more layers you store per cell, the narrower these margins are, the higher layer cells you use the less write endurance you get.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
