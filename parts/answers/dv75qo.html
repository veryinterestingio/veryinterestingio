<p>The answer will vary from person to person but broadly it's likely to be that when you're on your sofa you're in your relaxation frame of mind so you can go to sleep but when you start your bed routine you start thinking about plans for the next day so you a/ get your brain working and b/ start worrying about how much sleep you need so can't relax. </p>
<p>It's basically a 'sleep hygiene' issue, meaning your bed routine isn't helpful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>combination of a few things:</p>
<p>1) exercise, even exercise as low-level as walking from A to B, will make you more wakeful for a little bit.</p>
<p>2) if you've already had a little bit of a nap, that can also leave you more awake than when you started.</p>
<p>3) you were probably already lying on your couch getting comfortable for a while, possibly for a couple hours, before actually falling asleep; getting comfortable in bed takes at least some additional time once you're there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First confirmation bias.  </p>
<p>Couch is made for watching tv so you remember that one time you couldn't keep awake , bed is for sleep so you remember only when you couldn't sleep.  I'm sure there were LOTS of times when you didn't fall asleep on the couch but did so when you went to bed.</p>
<p>Second sleep is very fickle especially in modern times when we aren't really tired but go to sleep to keep a schedule.<br />
Do a 10 km run that day and i promise you you will sleep even on a door mat like a baby.  But if you aren't really tired even small things can impact the ability to sleep like the act of getting up from the couch and changing into something else before going to bed</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
