		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>23 hours and 56 minutes is how long it takes the Earth to make one rotation relative to the rest of the universe. However, while it is doing that, it also makes 1/365 of a revolution around the Sun. In order to face the Sun in the same direction as it did the previous day, it has to rotate for 1/365 of a rotation, which takes 4 minutes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By the time the Earth has completed one rotation it has moved a little bit on its orbit around the Sun (about 1/365th of the full circle). So the Sun is now at a slightly different angle and the Earth needs to turn a bit more to face it exactly the same way as one rotation ago. It takes about four extra minutes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has nothing to do with a leap day.</p>
<p>The earth takes about 23 hours and 56 minutes to turn around once on its axis in respect to the stars around us, but in that time the earth also moves forward in its orbit around the sun by about one degree.</p>
<p>Basically after the Earth turns once around its axis, the sun is no longer where it was before and the Earth has to turn a tiny bit (about 4 minutes) more to be in the same position it was in respect to the Sun.</p>
<p>Over the course of a year those 4 minutes add up to about one day.</p>
<p>Basically the earth turns around its axis 366 times a year but thanks to the fact that we also obit around the sun once we only get 365 days per year.</p>
<p>If you count days by the rising and setting of a star you will get one more day than if you counted days by the rising and setting of the sun.</p>
<p>The whole leap year thing is a completely different thing.</p>
<p>It comes from the fact that an orbit around the sun does not take exactly 365 days (as i pretended above) but more like 365 and a quarter days.</p>
<p>The length of the year is not a whole number of days. We take the quarter days that are left over each year and then when we have enough for a whole day we add a February 29th. This is sort of every 4th year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Damn.   I thought I knew the answer until I re-read your question.  The leap year keeps the seasons from progressing but you raise a good point.  After a month noon should be 2 hours earlier.  Iâ€™m gonna sit down and wait for an answer with you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
