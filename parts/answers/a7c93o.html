<p>Thanks for the AMA! </p>
<p>What height range is considered normal for a growing child? Do you use their height on their growth charts to determine if a child is short of stature? Or is your focus primarily on obvious cases (in utero findings) and follow up after birth? </p>
<p>Edit: Do you have a favorite gene mutation discovery? Or one with an exciting story?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
