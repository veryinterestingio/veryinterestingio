		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Nuremberg Defense refers to a legal strategy employed by many of the defendants at the Nuremberg war crimes trials seeking to convict Nazi perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the Second World War. Many of those defendants claimed that they were not guilty of the charges against them as they were &quot;only following orders.&quot;</p>
<p>Principle IV</p>
<p>This principle, one of many drawn up in the run up to the Nuremberg trials, states:</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that a person acted pursuant to order of his Government or of a superior does not relieve him from responsibility under international law, provided a moral choice was in fact possible to him.&quot;</p>
<p>Germans were not forced to be killers. Those who refused to participate were given other assignments or transferred. To this day no one has found an example of a German who was executed for refusing to take part in the killing of Jews or other civilians.</p>

<p>There is no documented case of a soldier of the Wehrmacht or Waffen-SS or any other formation of the Nazi state being executed for refusing to participate in war crimes, summarily or otherwise. Not a single one.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because if you allow 'only following orders', something like this happens\~</p>
<p>Privates: I was following my captain's orders.  <em>Goes free</em></p>
<p>Captains: I was following my colonel's orders.  <em>Goes free</em></p>
<p>Colonels: I was following my general's orders.  <em>Goes free</em></p>
<p>Generals: I was following the Fuhrer's orders.  <em>Goes free</em></p>
<p>The Fuhrer: Ah, right.  Dead.  </p>
<p>Basically someone woud have to be proven as the ultimate source of the orders in question to be held accountable and this wasn't considererd acceptable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>pretty much everyone on trial at nuremberg is a high ranking Nazi officer. They didn't bother trialling the rank and file party member. It's hard to argue you're just following orders when you are the one giving the orders.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because then a hundred people can all commit atrocities together under the legal protection of a single scapegoat at the top. If you get threatened under penalty of pain, death or other severity, however, it may constitute a defense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
