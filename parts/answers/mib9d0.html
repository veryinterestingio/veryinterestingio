		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Back in the days of CRT monitors we had a problem called burn-in where if you left the screen on the same image for too long it could get burned into the screen permanently as a shadow.</p>
<p>From then on you would always see the outline of that image or text burned into the screen.</p>
<p>Screen savers as the name implies prevented this by making most of the screen black and have pictures or moving lines to constantly have something changing on the screen.</p>
<p>Nowadays with LCDs this can still happen but to a much lesser extent. Instead Monitors will typically turn themselves off automatically after a certain period of inactivity to prevent burn in from happening.</p>
<p>So why do we still have screen savers? It's mostly out of habit, people expect to have a screen saver on a computer because it's one of those things we expect.</p>
<p>In the enterprise it doubles as the locking mechanism to automatically lock machines if users step away from them for too long.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Older computer monitors were susceptible to getting 'burn in' when displaying the same image for too long, so without one for example you would wind up seeing a the bottom menu of your screen always there even with the screen turned off. <del>It's not really much of any issue any more.</del></p>
<p>Edit: I stand corrected about that last bit!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Originally it was designed to prevent damage to old monitors. If old monitors sat on one image unchanging for extended periods of time, it would result in phosphor burn-in (basically discoloration) on the display.</p>
<p>Newer monitors fixed that issue, and now it basically works as a privacy measure for when you’re away from your computer so other people can’t just walk by and read everything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
