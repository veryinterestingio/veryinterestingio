		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The generally accepted reason is the diffusion of (and the resulting collapse of) gaseous bubbles in the fluids between your bones/cartilage. </p>
<p>The debate is still out on whether it’s the bubble forming that makes the sound or the bubble collapsing that makes the sound. </p>
<p>However you’ll notice you can only crack joints that you haven’t moved in a while, which allows the gasses to diffuse. Then you can pull the joint apart creating a void which is promptly filled by the gasses diffused in the fluids surrounding the joint as the pressure drops in that area. Eventually pressure returns to normal and the bubble collapses. </p>
<p>Again, generally it’s accepted that the collapse of the bubble is the cause of the sound but the debate is still out on that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two types of cracking or popping. The one we do with fingers backs etc that’s cavitation of solute gasses in the synovial fluid.   </p>
<p>The other one is tendons that have some sort of scaring on the sliding inside their fascia causing a snapping sound.</p>
<p>Sorry eli5s</p>
<p>Your fingers pop like by little bubbles of air bursting. </p>
<p>Your knees crack because tendons and ligaments snap like guitar strings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the answers here are correct, but not for your specific question. The air bubbles coming out of solution is true for most of the joint &quot;cracking&quot;, but the noise some people's knees make during a squat or going up stairs is caused by &quot;knee plica&quot;. It's a band if tissue that forms in some people that slides over the bone and causes a snap noise as the knee is straightened under a load. Where joint &quot;cracking&quot; is not immediately repeatable, knee plica snapping can occur continuously.</p>
<p>It doesn't cause pain because the tissue is not being irritated. In some people it does get irritated and painful, which we call synovial plica syndrome.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
