		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is hypothesized that dreams are a way of preparing you for dangerous and/or scary situations. Frequency and intensity of nightmares correlates with levels of stress. We all dream each night, but you will be more likely to remember them if you wake up during the dream.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Personally and after having raised some children, I find that we have nightmares when we over heat. When you have a fever, or simply use too many covers or sleep in a too hot room... Maybe not the only reason, but a contributing factor for sure...

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe they’re related to overall mental health, both situational (ie in response to a stressful job or abusive living situation) and biological. I have nightmares not infrequently and my psychiatrist has said they’re a common symptom of depression. It’s horrible, because they make me feel worse for the whole day afterwards!
