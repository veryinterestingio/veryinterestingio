		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They typically build a &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cofferdam" target="_blank">cofferdam</a>&quot; to temporarily divert water around the dam site. Then they build the dam, and once that's built, they remove or destroy the coffer dam.</p>
<p>The coffer dam does not need to be particularly big or strong to divert a river. The actual dam needs to be big and strong to hold back the reservoir that's created by the dam</p>
<p>Fun dam fact: Glen Canyon Dam in <del>Utah</del> Arizona is one of the largest in the US, and is under threat by all the sediment that the dam has trapped from moving downstream. The millions of tons of sediment are pushing on the dam and may eventually cause its collapse. So just dredge the sediment right? The problem: Some of it is highly radioactive from all of the uranium mining that took place in Utah and Colorado in the middle of the 20th century</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Hoover Dam documentaries are pretty cool, in that case they actually made a tunnel beside the proposed dam and diverted the river(the Colorado) through it during construction, I think they still use the tunnel as overflow. This was from memory(what's left of it) so I could be wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don’t.
If you think about a dam you normally picture a big lake, but the lake is only there because they built the dam. </p>
<p>Let’s take the Hoover dam, as this is famous and there is a lot of documented history. Here they chewed some tunnels through the rock beside the existing river, this allowed them to divert the water from the main channel and construct a giant wall. </p>
<p>Once complete, they blocked up the tunnels and let the water very slowly back up and create Lake Mead on the other side.</p>
