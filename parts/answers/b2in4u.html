		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other animals definitely have laterality/handedness. I think for apes, one of the big researchers is William Hopkins - search laterality and his name and chimp and you’ll find a rabbit hole of scientific literature on handedness in non-human animals and its possible relation to hemispheric specialization in the brain.</p>

Also look up tree frogs that preferentially jump in one direction, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Biophysicist here, specifically studying handedness and other internal biases in Drosophila. Most animals, even those as simple as Drosophila (fruit flies), have some form of individual internal bias such as handedness! In the case of Drosophila larvae, was right vs left isn’t as unbalanced as humans (more of a 50/50 split between left/right instead of 10/90 in humans), but preferences are strong, and we’re actually seeing that it overpowers even stimulus/environmental cues in decision making! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, in fact most creatures have a &quot;side preference&quot;! This is something that we have to account for in behavioral experiments from mice all the way up to non-human primates. Mice with a right-side preference, may take much longer to push the left lever in a cage and vice versa. So we  set up controls. Either by having a large n, where half have to push the right lever and half have to push the left or by figuring out what a given animal's side preference is and using that data in the experimental design. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
