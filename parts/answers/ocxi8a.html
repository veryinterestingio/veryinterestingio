<p>Pepper was said to have been paired to salt by Louis the 14th who was a big fan of the spice, in addition to its worth as a status symbol as it was quite expensive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Salt has always been vital for life. If you look at early hunter gatherer societies, they often spent time where salt is, presumably because a diet that lacks it is deadly. Salt remained absolutely crucial to human civisation, which is presumably the reason why it's associated with value ('salary', being 'worth your salt') later on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know about pepper, that might be more of a cultural thing, but we literally evolved to crave salt. Because our bodies need salt to function, tastebuds evolved to identify salty foods and give off a ”great taste”-response to reward you for eating it. Many cultures use different vehicles to make food salty (soy sauce, fish sauce, cheese etc) but the point of all of those is to make other food more salty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>pepper probably because it can cover off flavors. but salt drove the worlds economies going for a long time as it was needed for preservation. it’s the only mineral our bodies crave and we’re not alone animals need salt, too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
