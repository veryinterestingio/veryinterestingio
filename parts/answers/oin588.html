		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gout is actually caused by precipitation of sodium urate, rather than uric acid. It's not about the acidity, because you're right, it does get neutralized. Rather, it's about the accumulation of ionic solid that is pro-inflammatory, and the inflammation caused by your immune cells attacking the crystals is what causes the joint pain and swelling. It is thought by some that colchicine, which is a microtubule poison, acts by lowering neutrophil motility, which prevents them from initiating an inflammatory cascade in response to the crystals.</p>
<p>Edit: I thought I was in a different subreddit. Urate, including sodium urate, is the result of your body's buffering system neutralizing uric acid.</p>
<p>Edit 2: I have read a lot about the etiology and mechanisms of gout, but I'm a scientist, not a medical professional. I cannot speak to the medical management of gout. But I can answer questions about acids and bases, pH buffering in the body, microtubule poisons, and things of that nature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to give a bit different answer; the key thing you need to understand is that uric acid causes gout by crystallizing from the negative ion urate, by combining with positive sodium ions into insoluble monosodium urate in areas of your body that promote crystal formation like the joints and kidney. </p>
<p>We don't really understand why these places are more likely to cause crystal formation; the theory 30+ years ago was that they are areas of very low oxygen tension; nowadays they talk about nucleation by exposed collagen fibers and some unknown &quot;secondary nucleation&quot; factor. </p>
<p>This has little to do with uric acid's organic acid character - the &quot;acid&quot; part (proton) has already been buffered away; 98-99% of the uric acid in your body at pH 7.4 is in the form of urate ions rather than uric acid. Your bicarbonate/protein buffer system has done it's job maintaining homeostasis - the problem is that your body is producing too much urate for your body to handle, and for whatever reason (genetics, medications, concurrent illness, etc) you're prone to forming crystals in the wrong places.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sodium Urate/uric acid equilibrium that would be created by the buffer system is fairly soluble physiologically for most people. Unfortunately some people have kidneys that do not pass enough uric out of the system through the urine and it accumulates. However its not causing an attack unless the crystals form.</p>
<p>Circulating Iron from the diet is known to cause the precipitation of urate (formation of urate crystals) that lead to a gout attack. Urate chelates iron causing accumulation of the crystals and then an attack of gout. That is why gout is uncommon in women of childbearing age because they shed iron during the monthly menstruation.<br />
For most people, a low iron diet (so cutting out red meat etc) and staying well hydrated is probably the basic advice for preventing an attack. Also, if you are healthy enough to do so, donating blood will help deplete iron.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Drinking a ton of water every day is what helped me (mostly) get rid of gout attacks. Sometimes it's hard to hydrate enough in the summer (here in Texas) so I do use allopurinol as well.  Also, one time I got a bone spur removed at the Dr got rid of some gout in there too, so I have some pics of them haha.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
