		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simplest answer is: trains have already been hugely automated, with not much noise and publicity. They still have humans for oversight, since you can only have a fully automatic train on a track that never intersects with other roads, is inaccessible to pedestrians, and where all the trains are on the same automated system. (Such as airport shuttle trains and some subways.)</p>
<p>Not all traffic can be changed from cars and trucks to trains, though. That's the next step.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You only need one operator (or one small team) for a huge train carrying tons of people or cargo. And unlike a car, a human is pretty capable of operating it safely except in very rare situations. In contrast humans crash cars and trucks all the time. </p>
<p>The cost of <em>not</em> automating trains is low, and the benefits of automating are low.</p>
<p>There are also big risks to developing the automation and laws requiring human operators, these are the same challenges as trucks, but due to how few humans you need to operate a train it’s just not as worthwhile to fight against these obstacles.</p>
<p>Like cars and airplanes, there is modern tech that helps humans drive trains safely though like electronic warnings and communication.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since a single train can carry hundreds of passengers, automation doesn't bring as much improvement in efficiency. Trains are efficient by nature, and cars are inefficient by nature.A train with 100 passengers has already reduced the cost of driving by 99% compared to a car with one passenger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What’s stopping trains being 100% automated?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns" target="_blank">Rumsfeld’s Unknown Unknowns</a> </p>
<p>There are things we know might happen, and we can plan the automated response.   There are also things that we don’t yet know but we can plan an automated response all the same.  A little bit of logic and the automation can make a measured response.</p>
<p>But the real world is always ready to surprise us, and something entirely unknown can happen, and at this point the automation needs to refer back to a human to make a new decision.</p>
<p>Trains on tracks, especially if fenced from the real world run a very fixed and predictable path, so automation rules are relatively simple.   You control much of the environment, so limit the unknowns.</p>
<p>Roads have so many more variables that need rules and so the number of unknown unknowns is significantly higher.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>It’s been driverless since it’s opening in 1985. Why there aren’t more completely driverless systems is a bit of an open question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
