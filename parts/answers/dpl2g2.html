		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light is a form of energy, like thermal energy etc. Laser light can be a very concentrated (focused) form of energy. Energy is conserved (it cannot be created or destroyed) so when high energy laser hits an object, that energy must be transformed to another form of energy, usually thermal. This raises the temperature of the object and, if the laser is strong and focused enough, it will melt or boil or burn at the point of contact. Move the laser and it will resemble a cut.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did some experiments years ago when we were trying to vapourize metal with a laser to record its spectrum.  We found that little of the metal from the laser cut was actually boiled away. What happened was that the beam melted what it hit and boiled a little of it. The vapour produced expanded and  threw the rest of the molten material out of the hole as microscopic droplets. That works to cut or drill materials but not for what we wanted!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With heat. Touch a lightbulb, it's probably going to be warm/hot. Now imagine the heat pinched in and focused on an area the size of a pin.</p>
<p>This is my understanding, honestly I'm only commenting on hopes of learning something new about lasers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
