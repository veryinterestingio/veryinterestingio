		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before answering your question, I'd just like to point out that there is no permanently dark side of the moon. There is a far side of the moon, which never faces the earth, <a href="https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/review/dr-marc-earth/Moon_phases_drawing.gif" target="_blank">but it experiences a normal cycle of sunlight as the moon goes around.</a> During a full moon (as observed by humans), the far side of the moon is unlit. During a new moon, when the moon is between the earth and the sun, the far side is fully lit but unobservable from the earth.</p>
<p>As for your question, the moon's orbital period and rotational period are the same because tidal forces between orbiting bodies tend to make these numbers the same. Tidal forces slightly deform the earth and moon in their orbits, which produce small torques on each other, which act to bring these periods together.</p>
<p>Smaller objects become tidally locked more easily, such as moons (like the earth's), or planets like Mercury which are locked in a 3/2 resonance around the sun. </p>
<p>The moon is also acting to slow the earth's rotation, moving farther out in its orbit in the process. Eventually, many many billions of years from now (longer than the lifetime of the sun), the earth's rotation will become fixed as well, as the same side of the earth will always face the moon, as they all orbit and rotate at the same rate. Because the earth is so massive compared to the moon this will take a long time, but there are examples of this in the solar system- the Pluto-Charon system is 'doubly' tidally locked. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As has been answered, it's not a coincidence. What is a coincidence is the fact that the sun is 400x the size of the moon, but also 400x as far away from the Earth as the moon, making the sun and moon appear to be approximately the same size in the sky.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This happens everywhere.</p>
<p>Its what happens in gravitational systems over a long period of time. </p>
<p>As well as tidal locking you have the interaction of many moon systems like Jupiter which have orbital resonances:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bodies can &quot;lock&quot; (sync) their movements with another body. It's called Tidal Locking.
It happens with satellites – both celestial body and human made machines – in general.</p>
<p>In a broader context, you can witness that same sync with metronomes put on a (wooden) table, and flickered one by one. Eventually, they will sync on the vibrations of the table. Same with the glimmers of fireflies.</p>
