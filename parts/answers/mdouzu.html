		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi and thanks for joining us today!</p>
<p>So it's been a couple years since I've heard anything but carbon neutral fuel production via algae is basically a dead end these days, no?</p>
<p>Is EEMPA being considered for use in submarine CO2 scrubbing? Does it smell as bad as MEA?</p>
<p>Is it better to capture CO2 near the production source (e.g. city centers, factories) or can we build vast capture plants where land is cheaper and more available? I'm thinking of massive geothermal facilities in say Iceland capturing CO2 for the whole planet</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can you speak for a bit about what the U.S. government/DOE are doing to incentivize carbon capture research? Is it a law or regulation? Is there anything normal people can do to encourage more funding for CC?</p>
<p>Without a carbon tax, it seems to be impossible for CC to be commercially viable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm currently a mechanical engineer who's intensely interested in carbon capture technology and is wondering the best way to get into this field. I've been considering getting a PhD, but I'm not sure what good programs are out there. I've seen that ASU has a center for negative carbon emissions.</p>
<p>Anyways, I just really want to help make a positive impact on our world and am looking for advice on how to accomplish this. </p>
<p>Thank you!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
