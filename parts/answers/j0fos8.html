		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s a huge amount of research on treatments as well as vaccines. There are thousands of things being tested, ranging from drugs repurposed from other conditions (remdesvir, hydroxychloroquine) to traditional approaches (convalescent serum) to new drugs to completely experimental approaches. <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=Covid&amp;term=Treatment+Or+therapeutic&amp;cntry=&amp;state=&amp;city=&amp;dist=" target="_blank">Clinicaltrials.gov</a> shows over 1500 ongoing treatment trials, including </p>
<ul>
<li>Sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir and Nitazoxanide</li>
<li>photodynamic therapy</li>
<li>isotretinoin </li>
<li>Ivermectin and Doxycycine</li>
<li>Bemiparin</li>
<li>Carrimycin</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on and so on.  And there are thousands of novel treatments in pre-clinical trial phases.  </p>
<p>But in general, it’s much better to prevent than to treat. Vaccines can eliminate the virus from whole regions, they have much lower risks than most treatments, and they’re much better understood in terms of how to get from an unknown pathogen to a functional, effective vaccine, whereas treatments for viruses are hard to make, typically have lots of side effects, are often thousands of time more expensive, and don’t get used until the disease has started - so there’s more disease risk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is much harder to treat somebody who is sick than to prevent infection. Imagine saying that instead of speed limits, safe road design, seat belts, air bags, and stop signs we would just find better ways to treat people injured in car accidents. Once your body has sustained enough damage it is hard to bring it back to normal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A vaccine would protect those most at risk: immunocompromised, respiratory and cardiac history, elderly, etc. If we can keep people from getting sick in the first place, why wouldn't we? Especially with a virus that we don't know a ton about, we don't know how long some effects last (many people continue to have respiratory struggles). It would also help the economy a LOT. People wouldn't be missing work, insurance wouldnt be raising premiums to pay for hospital visits, everyone can get back to their normal lives. A big point is keeping people out of hospitals, which in some areas are not easily available, equipped, or affordable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Prevention is much more cost-effective, and it also better preserves the quality of life for the patient.</p>
<p>Consider the following scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>Effective treatment and no vaccine</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>You get infected on day 0.</li>
<li>You show no symptoms for 2 days. In the meanwhile, you spread the disease to 3 other people.</li>
<li>You start showing symptoms on day 3, and you dismiss it as a common cold. You walk around without a mask because it is the ultimate expression of freedom. You spread the disease to 30 other people.</li>
<li>You become really ill, and breathing gets difficult. You waited in line for hours at the crowded testing center. You infect 2 other people. You go home, and now you are bedridden for 7 days. This test costed your government or insurance company $200.</li>
<li>Your symptoms worsen. You need hospitalization. Your test result finally comes back positive. You are too fatigued to roll your eyes.</li>
<li>You are one of the lucky ones, and you recover in a month without having to be intubated. So, you conquered COVID-19. You pound your chest, and quickly regretted this gesture. Over the next few months, you have moderate breathing discomfort. Your treatment costed your government or insurance company <a href="https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/hospitalized-care-covid-19-averages-34662-45683-varying-age#:~:text=Nationally%2C%20the%20median%20charge%20amount,according%20to%20a%20new%20study." target="_blank">at least $30,000</a>. You paid $5,000 out of pocket.</li>
<li>In the meanwhile, there are now 35 other infected individuals, they go on to infect other people, and the cycle continues. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101623" target="_blank">About 20% of infected individuals will be hospitalized</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Total cost to you:<br />
With 20% probability, you are hospitalized, and you suffer $5,000 and a month of lost wages (say, $4,000), totaling $9,000.<br />
With 80% probability, you not hospitalized, so you suffer $0 (roughly speaking).</p>
<p>Total expected cost to you:<br />
$9,000 x 0.20  +  $0 x 0.80  =  $1,800</p>
<p>Total expected cost to society per infected individual:<br />
$34,000 x 35 x 0.20  +  $0 x 0.80  +  $200 x 35  = $245,000<br />
(20% require hospitalization. 80% don't require hospitalization. Everyone does testing.)</p>
<p>Death toll: With new effective treatments, 0.8% of patients die. (See below for case fatality rate under current treatments.)</p>
<p><strong>Effective vaccine and no effective treatment</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>You get vaccinated. This costed your government $20. You pay nothing.</li>
<li>In the next 6 months to a year, your chance of getting infected is reduced by (at least) 50%.</li>
<li>If you are infected, you go through the same process as in the above scenario.</li>
</ol>
<p>Total expected cost to you:<br />
$0 x 0.50   +  $1,800 x 0.50  =  $900<br />
(As in the scenario above, you came too close to an infected anti-masker. You have 50% protection because you were vaccinated.)</p>
<p>Total expected cost to society per infected/protected individual:<br />
$0 x 0.50  +  $217,000 x 0.50 x 0.50   +  $20  =  $61,270<br />
(We multiply by 0.5 twice, because we assume 50% protection for the people you meet; effectively, you would infect half as many people.)</p>
<p>Death toll: With no new effective treatment, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30243-7" target="_blank">1% of patients die</a> (current case fatality rate when hospitals are not overwhelmed), but infection rate is reduced by 50%, so the adjusted death rate is 0.5%. (This is a very conservative adjustment, as the pandemic would also end sooner, which would reduce the death toll further.)</p>
<p>Of course, with half of the population immune to the virus (at least temporarily), the pandemic also subsides. (Yes, there are anti-vaxxers out there, but let's hope most come to their senses at some point.)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Bottom line</strong></p>
<p>With an effective vaccine, it costs you less, it costs society less, you suffer less, fewer people die, the pandemic ends earlier, and we return to normalcy earlier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
