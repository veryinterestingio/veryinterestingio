<p>How do fitness trackers know that you actually sleeping</p>

<p>They don't. They just estimate based on heart rate and movement. It can be pretty far off sometimes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chronobiologist who studies sleep in a military population here: </p>
<p>Most consumer sleep trackers use proprietary algorithms to determine sleep/wake using heart rate variability, activity (typically a piezoelectric accelerometer), user input (sleep marker), and a light sensor.</p>
<p>We do not know if their algorithms are similar to what is used in medical/clinical sleep devices. For example Fitbit uses heart rate variability and activity recorded in epochs of 30 seconds. Raw unscored data is unavailable to consumers.</p>
<p>For consumer purposes they are accurate enough, but I would advise against putting too much trust in &quot;sleep stages&quot;, they typically do not hold up against PSG which is the gold standard.</p>
<p>Clinically speaking, we do not use them. Our devices cost between $600-2,000, and the software requires training to score sleep (we score by hand after running through our algorithm).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
