		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hives (the technical term is Urticaria) have a number of causes but are mostly caused when something that your body doesn't like meats a special white blood cell called mast cell. This thing could be a protein from a peanut or a bit of medicine which your body should be ok with but for some reason isnt. We call this an 'allergen'.</p>
<p>When the allergen meets the mast cell it 'activates' it and the cell bursts causing a substance called histamine to pour into your blood stream.</p>
<p>Histamine is large quantities is very bad for your body. It causes the walls of the blood vessels to open up and allows fluid to move from the blood into the space around your cells.</p>
<p>In the skin all this leaky fluid can cause swelling, itching and redness (called inflammation) - which is what yoy see as hives. If there is enough histamine this can also cause swelling around the throat and vocal cords so the person cant't breathe and a lot of leaking can leave too little blood where the blood is supposed to be. This causes life threateningly low blood pressure.</p>
<p>Thats allergic hives but some people can have a hives when only the skin reacts and releases histamine. This can be caused by plants - poisen ivy is a good example - or insect bites and stings or by normal things like sweating, hot or cold temperatures and stress but essentially it's all the body interpreting something harmless and something harmfull.  So essentially hives are your body overreacting to something.</p>
<p>In terms of how they keep your body safe, they do make you remove yourself from something your body thinks is a harmful - eg plants, insect bites, but in the modern day they are mostly an unhelpful nuisence. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had hives at a certain point in my life. I researched them and discovered that the causes are not fully known and you can see a doctor about them but chances are they’ll be gone by the time you get into the doctors office. And that was the case for me, I couldn’t ever get to a doctor before they’d go away. I had them so bad that my face would literally look like Homer Simpson when they’d show up around my mouth. Luckily it was at a time where I could miss work so it was honestly quite funny, at least according to my wife.</p>
<p>They went away for good (9 years now) once I separated myself from a very bad and stressful work situation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hives is usually seen on the skin as itchy, red, raised patches on the skin. This is caused by the chemical histamine which is produced by our basophils(blood cells) and mast cells(tissue cells) when they meet things like gluten, nuts, eggs, latex etc. When the human body is exposed to huge amounts of these foreign things, massive amounts of histamines is formed, causing this visible skin patches. Unfortunately some people are more sensitive to these kinds of allergic reactions that is why they need anti-histamine medications. They help the keep our body safe by warning us that we are eating foods that is not openly accepted by our immune system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
