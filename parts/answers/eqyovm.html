		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>“When you spray Febreze, the water in the product partially dissolves the odor, allowing it to form a complex inside the &quot;hole&quot; of the cyclodextrin doughnut shape. The stink molecule is still there, but it can't bind to your odor receptors, so you can't smell it. Depending on the type of Febreze you're using, the odor might simply be deactivated or it might be replaced with something nice-smelling, such as a fruity or floral fragrance.” - More <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/how-febreze-works-facts-and-chemistry-606149" target="_blank">here</a> .</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On top of what everyone else is saying about the large ring particles encapsulating the odour particles;</p>
<p>I can’t remember where, but I once read that it’s wise to hoover up after spraying Febreeze in the air because a lot of those encapsulated particles fall to the floor so it’s convenient to remove them completely from your home at this point, to avoid the possibility of them becoming free of the ring particle again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ring shaped molecule binds to molecules we detect as odor. They are then too large to be detected by us. Basically. Also, never spray that shit anywhere near birds. Chokes them to death sort of like CO does to us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
