		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not really. Clouds have mass, but their density isn't significantly greater than the surrounding air - otherwise they'd fall to the ground.   </p>
<p>That said, planes often avoid flying through clouds for prolonged periods of time. Three are two reasons for this; clouds make it difficult to see, so the pilot has to rely entirely on instruments. Also, clouds increase the risk of icing, which can be very dangerous on a plane.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Only if there's a possibility of icing. In that case, the pilot is going to try to get out of the clouds, so he/she would take action to turn or slow, but the clouds themselves won't physically impede the aircraft to any meaningful extent. They're just patches of water vapor with enough particulate matter to condense sufficiently to diffract light.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A couple things to note: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Air has mass, too. This is why air is thicker near the ground and gets thinner as you climb. </p>
</li>
<li>Most airliners fly at altitudes where most types of cloud don't form. The decision is almost entirely for efficiency and safety (at that altitude, you can fall for a few MINUTES before you're crashing into the ground).  The types of clouds that form that high most often usually contain thunderstorms which pilots avoid (lots of turbulence there). </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes it can but not because of the reason you would think. Clouds usually mean updrafts, or vertical movement in the air, as a result to maintain altitude for these short periods of time, the aircraft pitches down in an updraft which results in an increase of airspeed. Same and opposite effect for downdrafts in cloud. Horizontal movement of air in convection (clouds) is negligible. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
