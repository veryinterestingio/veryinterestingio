		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As soon as the first sperm burrows through the egg’s protective coating and enters the cytoplasm it releases an enzyme that increases the level of calcium inside the cell. This rapidly triggers various changes on the plasma membrane to stop the entry of more sperm like downregulation of the receptor that sperm need to enter, and changes to the composition of the plasma membrane which makes it less likely for a sperm to cross by chance.
