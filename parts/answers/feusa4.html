		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several reasons!</p>
<p>-If you’re using your horn to fight with (say, in competition with another male), that means you’re going to be smacking your head against the thing you’re fighting. Two horns gives better coverage and makes it less likely you’ll miss and hit with your actual head.</p>
<p>-Two horns means you have a spare if one gets broken or grows in deformed.</p>
<p>-Animals tend towards symmetry, and two horns is easier for that than one.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You might notice that one-horned animals generally either use their horn for something other than fighting (narwhals use their ‘horn’ -really a very long tooth- as a sensory tool!) or have thick enough horns that you can’t really fit two of them side by side (rhinos).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there is a book which is not ELIF but its called the the price of altruism good read, will do a better job then any other place.<br />
1) Its  allows animals to compete without injury, which is a great thing when reproduction is on the line each year this gets selected for pretty heavily. Meaning if you are injured after a fight you probably don't reproduce.<br />
2) it allows for adolescences to lose honestly and learn the game.  Meaning that with two horns the force is easily dispersed, with one horn it is not so easily dispersed. </p>
<p>3) Female sexual selection, opposite sex typically only select males with two intact horns.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
