		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The immune system responds to a foreign protein in the context of self. It doesn't just respond to free floating stuff. It has to be internalized by a cell and presented on the surface of the cell to be recognized by the immune system. Manufacturing mRNA is much easier and cheaper than manufacturing a complex protein. Also, some proteins require post-translational modification such as the addition of sugar molecules or changes in the three dimensional conformation of the molecule. Letting the cell do this naturally is more accurate than trying to do it in a bioreactor. Further, there's a much smaller contaminant profile that has to be cleaned up if you're not having to remove partial protein fragments, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several companies are taking the traditional vaccine approach that you are referring to - namely GSK/Sanofi and Novavax and others.</p>
<p>This approach uses animal cells (at least one company is attempting to use plants) to produce the &quot;spike&quot; protein, which is then collected and purified.  This must be used in conjunction with an adjuvant, which is usually an oil based substance that allows the material to remain in the body for an extended period, thus activating an immune response.</p>
<p>The protein-based vaccines are more expensive to manufacture and their immunogenicity depends on an adjuvant that works.  There are also changes that proteins undergo that can make them less immunogenic when transferred.</p>
<p>The mRNA vaccines are easier to manufacture and also have some theoretical benefits, some of which have been born out in the trials thus far.</p>
<p>They much more closely replicate natural immunity by exposing a person to parts of the actual viral genome.  After that, the immune response is completely natural.  The cell produces viral protein fragments, expresses them naturally on the cell surface, and so on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>“They” didn’t. There are viral protein vaccines in the pipeline. </p>
<p>The big advantage of mRNA vaccines is that they’re very quick to design and make in small to moderate quantities - perfect for rapid clinical trials against new, fast-moving viruses. It shouldn’t be surprising that the first vaccines we see are the ones designed to be fast and responsive. </p>
<p>In the next few months we will see many more vaccines passing through clinical trials and (hopefully) being approved. Those will have different advantages and disadvantages - they’ll probably be easier to deliver, but less responsive and slower to develop, for example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So what you are describing are peptide vaccines, which are the older and more established technology. While the RNA/DNA vaccines are generating a lot of buzz, there are also coronavirus peptide vaccines in development by companies like Axon and Covaxx. Pre-clinical data suggests that they are also highly effective in generating immune responses, which shouldn't be surprising since many of our prior vaccines rely on similar principles. Practically speaking, peptide, RNA, DNA, attenuated virus, or live virus vaccines should also work for coronavirus (in principle, anyway). </p>
<p>The reason why American and European pharmaceutical companies have opted for the RNA/DNA approach is mainly administrative and logistical. Pharmaceutical companies were moving away from vaccine development for infectious diseases (prior to COVID) since it's just not very profitable. So when COVID struck, pharmaceutical companies were caught a bit flat-footed. It so happens that a massive amount of research by companies like Moderna and BioNTech has been invested into RNA/DNA vaccines for cancer (as a therapeutic, not prophylactic), so companies used this existing infrastructure to begin developing a COVID vaccine. Other countries like China and India that have existing infrastructure to mass produce peptide, attenuated virus or live virus vaccines are already pursuing those directions.  </p>
<p>I should also note that RNA/DNA vaccines have already been proven at the pre-clinical level for many years, there just wasn't much of a reason to use them since peptide vaccines have been so effective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are vaccines that do entirely this - that's what the Novavax candidate is - a spike protein, made by moth cells, paired with an adjuvant. In theory, getting the spike from your cells and having it be presented by dendritic cells is closer to natural in compelling to cause t cell responses... but the novavax product looks good so far too!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
