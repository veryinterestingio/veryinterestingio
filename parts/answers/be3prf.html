		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We assume that we can produce  as much photons as we want in a given state, when following the same particular protocol.For instance, we know that every <strong>measured</strong> photon going through a polarizer, then through a quarter-wave-plate that has the same axes, is in a superposition (specifically, the polarization is circular, superposition of two different linear polarizations  ).</p>
<p>We assume the superposition does not come from an afterward measurement, so that we have here a sure way to produce a quantum superposition of states for a photon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can't check for superposition without taking a measurement (because you can't check for <em>anything</em> without taking a measurement (though <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_measurement" target="_blank">weak measurements</a> exist)), but that's not what Wigner would be interested in.</p>
<p>Wigner could tell his friend to use one of the two parallel electron guns to shoot a single electron at a target plate, depending on the result of the friend's measurement. And repeat the whole experiment a lot of times, recording the positions where the electrons hit the screen.</p>
<p>If the friend's measurements do involve a wavefunction collapse, then Wigner would see two overlapping blobs. If the friend was in a superposition for real, then each electron would be in a superposition exactly the same as in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment" target="_blank">double-slit experiment</a>, and Wigner would see an interference pattern.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The photon starts in a superposition of horizontal and vertical polarization, which I will denote as |h&gt; and |v&gt;. When Wigner's friend who is locked in the room with the photon measures the it, she obtains either |h&gt; or |v&gt; with some probability as prescribed by quantum mechanics, i.e. she measures the photon and sees that it has horizontal polarization with probability p and vertical polarization with probability (1-p). She is free then to write down her observation or store it in memory or what have you - it is an objective fact to her. So this memory record has some state |&quot;photon was h&quot;&gt; or |&quot;photon was v&quot;&gt;. </p>
<p>Wigner, however, is outside and oblivious to all of this and has no information regarding the outcome of his friend's measurement. For him, the state of the entire system (photon + friend) has become entangled ('correlated'). If he measures the photon to be |h&gt;, then he will also measure his friend to say |&quot;photon was h&quot;&gt;. Likewise, if he measures |v&gt;, he will measure |&quot;photon was v&quot;&gt;. The entire system is in a superposition of &quot;(|h&gt; and |&quot;photon was h&quot;&gt;) and (|v&gt; and |&quot;photon was v&quot;&gt;)&quot;. If he wants, he can load the entire sealed system, the photon plus friend, into a cannon and fire it at a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment" target="_blank">double slit</a> where the system goes through one slit if it was in the first state and the second slit if it was in the second. He will see an interference pattern in the splatter on the wall behind the slit that arises due to the superposition. This is only a bit tongue in cheek - to check for super position, one can perform an experiment analogous to the famous double slit experiment. This is usually what is meant by an &quot;interference experiment&quot;. The double slit experiment shows that the light existed in a superposition as it passed through to the screen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think this is answered pretty well already, but this is very much related to the Elitzur–Vaidman bomb tester thought experiment. </p>

<p>It is an example of an interference experiment where certain outcomes can tell you if there was or wasn't a superposition going on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
