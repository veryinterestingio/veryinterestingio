		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you breathe in, you may notice your heart beat start to go faster. This is what we call respiratory arrhythmia and is a physiological phenomenon. The reason is that when we exhale, there's higher intrathoracic pressure i.e. Compression of ghe lungs forces air out. This increased pressure stimulates the Vagus, a nerve, that - among others - causes the heart to beat slower. So exspiration ==&gt; pressure go brrrrr ==&gt; Vagus stimulated ==&gt; Vagus make heart go less brrrrr</p>
<p>When we inhale, it's basically just the opposite effect, the expansion of your ribcage increases the volume of your thorax, so the pressure drops. Thus, the vagus is stimulated less, and so your heart starts to beat slower.
To sum this up: Inspiration ==&gt; pressure go less brrrrr ==&gt; Vagus less stimulated ==&gt; Vagus not make heart go less brrrrr as much as before ==&gt; heart go more brrrrr</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of good answers here. But I still haven’t seen the actual term mentioned, it’s called “Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia”, or “RSA”. Having a large RSA means that your body’s heart rate changes a lot with your breathing, and low RSA means it doesn’t change a lot. </p>
<p>Research has shown having a large RSA is actually indicative of better heart and lung health. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you breathe shallow the carbon dioxide in your blood doesn't get removed as much compared to deep breathing.  The heart and other organs can detect the levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the blood.  If the carbon dioxide starts to build up and increase, the heart then pumps faster to get it to the lungs.  If you breathe slowly and deeply then the heart can slow down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The heart is responsible for making sure the body has enough oxygen to function (among other things). It needs to get that oxygen from the lungs. So if you breathe poorly and don't take in a lot of oxygen, the heart will try to compensate. Every time you breathe out, you're not exhaling pure carbon dioxide, there's still some oxygen in there since it's hard to use up all the oxygen in one breath. But in a case like where the person is holding their breath, the heart starts running as much blood by the lungs as possible to try and scrape up as much of the remaining oxygen as it can.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
