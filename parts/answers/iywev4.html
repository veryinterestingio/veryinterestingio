		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>More information isn't always good, the vast majority of users are not technically inclined</p>
<p>Most cars have a method to read out the OBD codes without a reader. Old Dodges would print them out on the odometer if you did a little trick with the key. Users who are capable of fixing issues are generally capable of getting the codes, users who are incapable of getting the codes are likely going to just go to a mechanic</p>
<p>Its more useful for most people to have a &quot;please service soon&quot; light and an &quot;oh crap, service now!&quot; light, any more granularity leads to confusion.</p>
<p>Is it okay to drive with a misfire on cylinder 6? You have 5 others</p>
<p>O2 sensor 3 error? Well clearly there are two spares that are working!</p>
<p>The average driver just needs to know they should visit a mechanic</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The dealer and the manufacturer both benefit when you associate the light turning on with “I need to go to the dealership”</p>
<p>If they helped you understand when the light means low air pressure versus “your engine is about to explode” then fewer people would have the urgency to go spend money at the dealership.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many people are talking about the legacy of why we still have a Check Engine and require an ODBII port to access it.  However it shouldn't always have to be this way.</p>
<p>In the past automotive computers were very expensive for functionality (think about it as cost per feature) so things were distilled down to the single most basic descriptor to reduce costs.  Now computing and displays are so cheap that its possible to replace diagnostic codes with clear descriptors or at the least expose the data logged (yes all modern cars log data, just depends on volume and fidelity) for the customer.</p>
<p><a href="https://repair.org/stand-up" target="_blank"><a href="https://repair.org/stand-up" target="_blank">https://repair.org/stand-up</a></a></p>
<p>Right now there are laws being passed in various states to require manufacturers to allow customers simplified access to this data so they can effect repairs themselves.  Otherwise we may end up in a world like just happened with Tesla:Telsa had a network outtage.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/tesla-experienced-an-hour-long-network-outage-early-wednesday/" target="_blank"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/tesla-experienced-an-hour-long-network-outage-early-wednesday/" target="_blank">https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/tesla-experienced-an-hour-long-network-outage-early-wednesday/</a></a></p>
<p>This caused many features to misbehave and some owners couldn't access their cars (They had been dependent on network features).  Imagine that Tesla for whatever reason doesn't want to support the older cars. They could lock owners out of features or the cars themselves.</p>
<p>John Deere is already doing this with their tractors.  Requiring escalating costs to patch or update their farm equipment for much more than a third party could provide.  This isn't about warranties, this is about locking customers to have to pay the Original Equipment Manufacturer in order to keep their vehicles functional.</p>
<p>So the simple answer is: &quot;It was originally done that way because it helped keep costs low. But continues to be this way because it is part of their business plan.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a &quot;barrier to entry&quot;.</p>
<p>The average person isn't tech savvy. Even if they were told what the error was, they wouldn't know what it means, or how to fix it. </p>
<p>P0455? WTF is that? *googles it* Evaporative Emission Control System Leak Detected? My car is leaking!?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, someone who knows would just wonder &quot;did I tighten the gas cap?&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people don't know jack about cars, and I'd venture to say even more people lack the ability to accurately diagnose the root cause of the problem. Take your example of &quot;faulty O2 sensor&quot;. Car throws a p0131 code, first result on google says:</p>
<ul>
<li>Failed Oxygen sensor</li>
<li>Damage or unplugged wiring</li>
<li>Open or short</li>
<li>Improperly reading coolant temp sensor</li>
<li>Failed heater circuit for oxygen sensor</li>
<li>Most commonly the sensor has simply failed due to age and wear</li>
</ul>
<p>The average person would say, &quot;replace the O2 sensor, easy peasy&quot;. The code may imply that the O2 sensor has failed but really what it means is that the sensor is reporting a lean condition that may be caused by other things such as a vacuum leak, clogged injector, exhaust leak, etc.. </p>
<p>On top of this when an O2 sensor reads lean and throws this code its also increasing the injector pulsewidth and adding more fuel to try to compensate for a perceived lean condition. This translates into higher hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions and potentially can damage the catalytic converter long term (not good). </p>
<p>Then there's the cost factor, Ford sold almost 2.5 million cars last year. If it cost $2/vehicle (Idk how much it would cost to implement, just a random number), then they've shaved $5 million off their net profit. Shareholders wouldn't be happy, Ford execs wouldn't be happy, and if they started raising car prices to offset then the consumer wouldn't be happy.</p>
<p>Basically, it comes down to is for most people seeing a bunch of numbers and sensor data on the dash would be the same thing as seeing a glowing yellow light. Some people would try to DIY a repair and end up negatively reviewing the vehicle because they don't posses the knowledge. It would end up negatively impacting emissions and it would lower their net profit by implementing it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
