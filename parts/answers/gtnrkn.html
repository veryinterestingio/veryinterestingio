		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kuru is a prion disease, which is characterized by misfolding of a specific protein called PRP.  By mechanisms that are not well known, these proteins are “contagious” in that once introduced into the body, they gradually cause all of the person’s PRP proteins to convert to the diseased conformation.  This phenomenon only seems to occur if the prion that was ingested has a similar amino acid sequence to sequence of the host’s native PRP.  This is why transmission of prion diseases is usually only caused by eating contaminated tissues from the same species, as there is usually variation from species to species.  However, sometimes they can be similar enough (like with mad cow disease) to be able to spread.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Diseases are generally defined in a way that references the origin or mechanism of the disease.  Kuru is <em>defined</em> as a neurodegenerative disease with certain symptoms resulting from consumption of human neural tissue.  You can get other forms of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease by ingesting contaminated beef or from spontaneous misfolding, but they aren't Kuru because the origin is different, even though the same protein (PrP) is being misfolded.  </p>
<p>On short, you can definitely contract CJD from eating other animal brains, specifically cow brains. That's what the whole &quot;mad cow&quot; issue was about.  It's just not <em>called</em> Kuru.</p>
<p>But not all species have PrP proteins which are similar enough to start a chain reaction misfolding in human proteins.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
