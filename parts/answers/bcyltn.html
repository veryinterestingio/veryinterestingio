Essentially, it sinks to the ocean floor, where it becomes a beacon of life in an otherwise barren desert of lightless sand. Sharks are the first to feast, ripping off chunks of the carcass, while scavengers like crabs move in for the remainder. Many different types of life will feast on the remains for over a year, eventually leaving a completely clean skeleton on the ocean floor to eventually be ground to dust.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whale bones do not necessary disappear. It depends on the water oxygen levels at the seafloor. The coastal cliffs in southern California (Santa Barbara) are locally full of fossilized whale bones that are encased in very dense (and thus hard and weathering-resistant) dolomite concretions. They form when the whale carcass sinks to the ocean floor where oxygen levels are low (suboxic). While macro-organisms that otherwise consume the dead whale are not very happy under these conditions, some microbes presumably feast on the dead whale. They are doing this while the dead whale gets covered with marine sediment. A bi-product of the microbial activities is dissolved carbonate that, with calcium and magnesium ions from the seawater, leads to the precipitation of the magnesium-calcium carbonate mineral dolomite. The bones thus become entombed in a shell of dolomite and ultimately fossilized. This process can be expected to be very slow, taking thousands and perhaps ten-thousands of years (based on known rates of sediment accumulation). For the bones now exhumed and exposed in the coastal cliffs, this happened about 5-25 million years ago, but it can be expected that similar processes occur present-day under similar conditions. Please note: In case you plan on vising these cliffs, collection of these fossils is prohibited and not feasible anyways because what you'll find are only large boulders.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
