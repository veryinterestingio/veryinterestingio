		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>16:9 is the aspect ratio that can most easily handle all of the other historical aspect ratios (like 4:3 for broadcast TV, 2.2:1 for Panavision (movies), 2.39:1 for Cinemascope) with a minimum of picture loss and a maximum of the screen used. When they were developing the HD standard and needed to come up with an aspect ratio, a committee member actually cut out rectangles of equal area in the various historical and candidate aspect ratios. when they were laid over one another with the centerpoints matching, the smallest rectangle that would contain all of the other rectangles had a ratio that was very close to 16:9.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Laptops are getting 16:10 ratio screens on smaller laptops to utilize the depth that the keyboard and track-pad use anyway. This provides a better format for productivity, where word documents can be fully viewed at 100%. Alternatively, 1440p 16:9 screens accomplish the same, but with smaller text for the same monitor width.  </p>
<p>The reason it was chosen has already been answered.   </p>
<p>I have a 21:9 monitor for gaming. It's got it's benefits, and watching 21:9 movies on it is great.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
