		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Female lobsters are typically the ones on the prowl, scuttling around ocean avenues, searching for and visiting multiple dens occupied by male prospects. When she wants to engage, usually with a dominant male, she urinates out of her face to present her pheromones, and when the male gets the signal, he lets her into his den. The female then gets naked—no really—she moults to make relevant parts available. Then the male climbs onto her back, flips her over and internally deposits a capsule of sperm. Interestingly, the sperm capsule or spermatophore hardens into a plug to deter insemination from other males—although this does not stop the female from mating again. As a gentleman wouldn’t kick a naked lady out of his house, the male protects the female for a few days as her new exoskeleton hardens.  They part ways just in time for another female to pee at him. Females can keep sperm for over a year from multiple males. Then, although sperm is deposited internally, actual fertilization occurs externally when the eggs are laid. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a related fact about creatures that run into each other super rarely. Desert tortoises are a similarly very low density population. Females can store sperm from a mating event for several years before choosing to fertilize their eggs and produce offspring. This means that they can meet a mate when conditions aren't good for having babies, then have babies at a much later date when environmental factors are better (e.g. it actually rains).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It really varies.   Someone mentioned angler fish already.  Some squid just give sperm packets to every other squid they meet, like a weird handshake.   It means the males get sperm packets too.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question is unfortunately super wide and we can pick any creature and  use it as an example. Female Angler fish that have males fused onto them as tiny parasitic tumors that inject sperm I to the females bloodstream.</p>
<p>Invertebrates that eject sperm and eggs into the water based on various cycles like moon phase, day length, etc.</p>
<p>All meet at a certain breeding site like many fish do.</p>
<p>Carry the sperm from a previous encounter and use it to fertilize an egg when conditions favor it.</p>
<p>Asexual reproduction.</p>
<p>Some fish change gender from female to male when the male ratio is low. Dominant female turns male like many wrasse. Like this</p>

<p>In clown fish the male in some turns into the female.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ocean is indeed vast, so oceanic and deep sea creatures have evolved traits and adaptations to find mates in the void, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>they can release (and detect) chemical signals (pheromones)</li>
<li>use bioluminescence or other visual signals to detect the same species (and keen eye sight for this)</li>
<li>release eggs/sperm and larvae adapted to persist for extended periods of time; some time the release of eggs/sperm based on various environmental indicators (tide/lunar cycles, temp, etc.)</li>
<li>Many have both male and female sex organs, so if they encounter another of the same species, they can mate</li>
<li>Some aggregate in schools for mass spawning &amp; use behavioral signals to trigger spawning</li>
<li>Other unique features, such as male parasitism in angler fish, gender changing based on life stage or environmental characteristics, etc. </li>
</ul>
<p>Life is pretty cool. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
