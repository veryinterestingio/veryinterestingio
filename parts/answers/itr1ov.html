		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fear causes your fight or flight response, and anxiety causes a similar response except its a fear of something that isn’t real.
If it gets really bad, you become terrified of something that isn’t there or even real.
Hormones including the stress hormone cortisol and adrenaline are released at these times, which are meant for short term escape/survival situations.
Adrenaline increases heart rate, blood pressure and use of energy reserves. Cortisol alters immune response, digestion, reproduction and growth processes. Almost all of your body is affected in a way which isn’t sustainable long term.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5 analogy.</p>
<p>Go turn on your car, sit in it, and while it's running (but still in park, with parking brake on), floor the gas pedal.  Turn on radio full volume.  Turn on your windshield wipers full blast.  keep squirting fluid on your windshield.  Flip on headlights and your brights on and off.  Tur on every function in your car you can.  With the foot firmly on the brake, and the parking brake engaged, shift in out of different gears non stop.</p>
<p>Keep doing this until you run out of gas.  Refill the tank, repeat the next day.  And the next.  And the next.</p>
<p>Take it to a mechanic and watch as he says &quot;how the fuck does this wear and tear happen on a car with so few miles??&quot;</p>
<p>That's what anxiety does to your body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Speaking from personal experience, anxiety fucks up my digestion, makes me lose my appetite, causes vomiting, hot flashes, dizziness, breathing problems, changes in heart rate among other things. There are also reproductive issues, for women you can miss periods or it can exacerbate your PMS symptoms. Over a period of time these things can cause many health issues. Stomach ulcers are a common side effect of anxiety. Losing or gaining significant amounts of weight is also common.</p>
<p>Having you body constantly on high alert is not good for you. </p>
<p>Apart from that it also increases the chances of developing dependencies or addictions like alcoholism, smoking, drug abuse among others. People with anxiety disorders are also more susceptible to depression and suicidal ideation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some people try to go against their fears with drugs.
Drugs cause multible other problems and if they get addict, they have one mental problem more.</p>
<p>Other ppl isolate themselve bc fear. The isolation and lonelyness causes often other mental problems.</p>
<p>Beeing together with ppl is very.. the english words.. People can be exhausting. Even for healthy people.
When you are alone for a very long time, contact with people becomes very, very difficult.
You know the words, but the emphasis of the words is difficult, sometimes they come at the wrong time. A little too early or too late.</p>
<p>Hope this help to understand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
