		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the heat. If the heat is very high like 500 degrees, you'd probably suffer severe burns and your lungs will burn from the inside leading to suffocation as you can no longer exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide (dead cells, bleeding, fluid filling your lungs). If the heat is lower, you'll probably die from your proteins getting denatured and cell membranes losing integrity. Death will likely occur at the level of the brain. It's hard to know exactly what happens so I am giving educated guesses, I'm a physiologist, it's best a forensic expert answers this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, your body has a fixed temperature range it can operate in before stuff starts to go wrong. As your body temperature goes up, cellular processes and organs start to malfunction because they're outside of their normal operating range. Your brain is especially sensitive to heat, and starts to take damage pretty quickly as temperature increases. This is why fevers of 104Â°F and higher are considered an emergency. Eventually, if you get hot enough, cells start to die and organs will shut down. You'll sweat profusely at first, but eventually your body gives up on trying to cool itself, you rapidly enter the territory of heat stroke, then go into shock and die.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically your body requires lots of chemicals to operate in your body many of these are proteins or amino acids, the bonds holding these chemicals together tend to break apart (denature) at 40 degrees centigrade. Without these key proteins your body ceases to function cells die and then life processes like heart beating also stops.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heat will transfer to you if you are in an oven. Firstly the air in the oven will heat up and that will burn you the same way as if you were touching the walls. Secondly the walls themselves will radiate a lot of infrared radiation which will heat you up even if the air was not heated. But I guess your question was rather what happens to you when you die of heat during a hot summer day or something. Not when it is hot enough to physically burn you but still hot enough for you to die.</p>
<p>The problem is that your body will not be able to get rid of its excess heat. You are generating a lot of heat by just making your body work. You depend on being able to get rid of this heat through your environment in order to keep a steady temperature in your core. But when temperatures get so high that you are not able to regulate the temperature, even through sweat, your core temperature will rise. And you know how an egg will change from a liquid to a solid when you boil it. That is because the proteins will break down when you heat it. Different protein break down at different temperatures. When your core temperature gets to about 42 degrees Celsius some of the vital proteins in your nerves will start breaking down. So your nerves and brain will spasm out and stop working. It does not help to cool down because the proteins are already destroyed and have damaged the cells.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've read some very detailed descriptions of what happens to victims who perish in a fire due to the heat rather than smoke inhalation while researching the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartford_circus_fire" target="_blank">Hartford Circus Fire</a> years ago. The super-heated air causes the lungs to fill with fluid as an automatic protective response, so many fire victims &quot;drown&quot;. In addition, the layer of fat just below the epidermis will literally &quot;cook&quot;. The bones turn black. The skull splits open. The muscles contract so that the victim assumes almost a fetal position. The arms contract so that they appear to be protecting the face, which is called the &quot;pugilist position&quot; - as if the victim was a boxer warding off blows. Interestingly enough, in some homicide cases where the perpetrator set the dwelling on fire when the victim was still alive, a first-glance examination of the scene often appears that the victim suffered a blow to the skull and was fending off the attacker. But once the medical examiner gets involved, it is discovered that those &quot;clues&quot; were actually the results of the heat from the fire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
