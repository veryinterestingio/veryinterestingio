		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot to unpack, but let's try.     </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does Mars have Caves?      </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost certainly it does, but there multiple types of caves and the type of cave you're thinking of probably doesn't exist.<br />
Cave Types:<br />
1)Limestone caves carved by co2 disolved in water (carbonic acide) trickling through them eroding chambers in the limestone.<br />
2) Lava tubes - lava flowing down a slope forms a hard outer crust and continues to flow on its interior, finally draining out, leaving a hollow tube<br />
3) Ice Caves - water flowing under a glacier erodes the ice, leaving chambers in the ice in a sort of combination of 1 &amp; 2 above   </p>
<p>I think you're probably thinking of type 1 above since by their nature, types 2 &amp; 3 are limited depth beneath the surface and are not going to increase in temperature with depth.     </p>
<p>More to the point though, it is doubtful Mars has the kind of deep limestone deposits that formed on earth as a consequence of life. The presence of limestone on mars would in fact be an almost smoking gun for life having existed; and to be deep enough to form caves, there would have to have been a both a lot of life and it would have had to exist for a long time (long enough for thick deposits of carbonate  to have accumulated into thick sedimentay layers). Most theories of a warm wet mars have a limited lifetime of conducive environment for life: 100-200 million years. Consider that life existed on earth for billions of years before it became prolific enough to create limesone, it seems unlikely there are significant deposits of limestone on mars    </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't really know for sure.  We can construct underground temperature models for Mars but we don't have the data to verify or refute them, so mostly Mars geologists talk a lot about ranges of possible values.</p>
<p>In terms of survivability, it may turn out that you don't actually need to drill down until it's warm, by the way.  Mars is funny in that respect.  But I will get to that in a moment.</p>
<p>For now let's look at Earth for a moment.  On Earth, roughly speaking, temperature increases by 25C per km of depth.  Starting at a pleasant outdoor temperature of 15C on the surface, it's easy to see how you'd get to 1km and it would be barely tolerable .. you wouldn't want to go beyond that.</p>
<p>Now let's compare Mars.  Mars has lower gravity (hence less subsurface pressure) and is much, much less geologically active.  Even though we don't actually know what the correct temperature per depth value is, but we do know it will be lower than Earth's.  How much lower?  We can make some guesses and see how much it makes a difference.</p>
<p>Lets's say we're starting at -60C on the Martian surface.  Let's pick a high value for Martian temperature gradient.  Let's say it's about half that of Earth, we'll round to 10C per km depth.  So then at 6km down it's icy cold but livable, and by 8km you're comfortably warm.  You wouldn't want to go below 10km if you even could dig that far.  In any case, that's a major drilling effort -- about as far as we have ever drilled on Earth.</p>
<p>Now let's say it's 1/10 that of Earth.  Let's just say 3C / km for convenience.  At that gradient, your habitable range will be somewhere between 20km and 30km depth.  Needless to say that's a huge geoengineering project just to drill down that far, let alone stabilize and build safely.</p>
<p>Okay so those are the likely range of depths if you want to achieve warmth through drilling.  Is the Martian thermal gradient more than half Earth's?  Or less than 1/10?  Maybe!  It certainly could be.  But I am picking values that seem like reasonable bounds for the sake of comparison.  Within those bounds, no matter how you slice it, you're talking about depths that would challenge the limits of what we know how to do today.</p>
<p>However, like I said before, that might not be the only way.  The simple answer to heat on Mars is that in practice what we are really going to have to worry about is getting rid of heat, not retaining it.  The reason is that the Martian atmosphere is really actually very close to vacuum -- much more than we appreciate when we contemplate it from afar.</p>
<p>Someone estimated once that if you were out unprotected on the Martian surface, assuming you had plenty of air and well-insulated shoes, you would die of cold exposure after several hours.</p>
<p>Several <em>hours</em>.</p>
<p>That's because even though it's so cold that carbon dioxide freezes, there's so little air to convey heat away from you that you wouldn't really feel it.</p>
<p>This person went on to estimate that if you simply put on a sweater, you would be fine.  In fact you'd be more likely to overheat.</p>
<p>TL; DR  The real answer appears to be 0km -- you'll be fine on the surface, as long as you wear boots and a sweater.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For a Mars habitat we're not too worried about temperature. We can build habitats to deal with that. The bigger danger is hard radiation which on Earth mostly gets blocked by the magnetosphere and atmosphere. But Mars has no magnetosphere and only a very thin atmosphere which is okay for a few days or weeks but if you're staying for months or maybe years you want some protection. A couple meters of dirt can provide that protection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
