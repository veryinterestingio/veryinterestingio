Not only does that damage the organ, but it fills it with your immune cells. Moving it to another person not only exposes them to the foreign cells from the organ, but also any lingering cells from your body, making it more likely to trigger their immune system and cause another rejection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi so I use to work at a transplantation ward as a reg. Nurse in Sweden. It is possible to re-transplant a kidney if the patient dies soon after the transplant of another reason. But it is highly unlikely and have never happen in sweden as far as I know. </p>
<p>The thing is that if your body is rejecting your new kidney, that means your immune system is trying to kill it and the function of your kidney decreases and is not a good kidney to give to someone else.</p>
<p>There is a liver disease called  Familjär Amyloidos with polyneuropati  (in swedish) and that means your liver is harmful for yourself but not so much for others so you can transplant that liver to someone else while you get a new liver. Its called domino transplantation.  </p>
<p>Hope I gave you something useful </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nurse here who has cared for patients post transplant. </p>
<p>There are usually drugs we can give to counteract the rejection (essentially changing up their anti rejection regimens), it’s not often that we see them completely fail (though we don’t get a whole lot of transplant cases where I live for me to give a true representation of the general public).  After the transplant people start on anti rejection drugs and continue on them for life.  But if it does fail then it’s unfortunately no longer usable. On average transplanted organs that don’t fail last for about 10-15 years before they fail for other reasons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
