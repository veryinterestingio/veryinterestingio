		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is because high frequency sound travels faster in a medium like ice than the lower frequencies. The overall effect is that you hear the highest frequencies first and the lowest last. That ends up being a sweep from high to low making the pew-pew sound we all associate with lasers guns now!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way something sounds is determined by the way it vibrates.  and when you have big chunks of ice like that, they don't have much room to vibrate so they vibrate in high frequencies that sound a little bit like stereotypical laser sounds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because we decided that in sci-fi movies, shooting lasers sounds like that.</p>
<p>Not the other way around. A laser beam does not make any noise, most certainly not the pew-pew kind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well the reason the ice cracks is to relieve the pressure under the ice. The laser sounds come from the long cracks in the ice causing a certain vibration to continue carrying on through the un-cracked ice around it. If the ice doesnâ€™t do these small cracks throughout the day, the pressure builds up and eventually causes an ice heave which is a massive crack that can cause like 7 foot mountains of ice across the lake</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
