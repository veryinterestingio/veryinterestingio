<p>There is a mesh barrier between the lower and upper levels that the queen is too big to fit through, so she can’t lay eggs in them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They use them for both but the larva brood tend to be in a semi circle in the middle, and they store nectar/honey for the babies in the corners. </p>
<p>If there’s lots of space, they’ll use entire comb frames for honey only. </p>
<p>Hives constantly rearrange their combs depending on whether they want more space for food or babies. </p>
<p>When beekeepers extract honey, they leave the frames with larva brood alone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bees kept by a beekeeper use a Queen Excluder, a wire mesh with holes small enough that the queen can't pass through but big enough for a worker to pass through so that the Queen stays in her brood box and can't lay eggs in the upper tiers. With no eggs, there's plenty of space for just honey in the upper boxes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
