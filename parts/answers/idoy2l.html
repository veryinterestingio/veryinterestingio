		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Salting the earth was more of a symbolic/ritual thing, rather than something to make a place literally unable to grow stuff. To do that would take more salt than the people back then could get. Even now it's going to be really expensive, plus it would wash away quickly anyway.  </p>
<p>Rather they were saying that they were laying down a curse, and that the salt symbolized how much they really hated that place.  </p>
<p>Genghis Khan also didn't really do that. He just burned the place down, killed everyone in it, and would send some guys back a few days later to kill anyone he might have missed.<br />
He didn't care about salting the earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve been fascinated by this for a long time. From everything I’ve been able to find and read, it doesn’t seem this was ever really done. It seems it was a symbolic thing, given how hard the logistics would have been, versus how little time it takes for it to wear off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Carthage" target="_blank">Wikipedia page of ancient Carthage </a>, Rome’s salting of Carthage would have occurred in 146 BC. And then about 100 years later, none other than Julius Caesar would rebuild Carthage on the same site. Then in another 100 years, Carthage grew to became the 2nd largest city in the empire. </p>
<p>So this means if salting the fields did happen, in 100 years, it was no longer a deal breaker. And in 200 years, it no longer mattered at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ghengis khan may not have salted the earth, but the Il Khanate may have have set Islamic scholarship back 500 years in the destruction of the library in Baghdad.</p>
<p>It was one of the world capitals of learning in the 1200’s and the mongols sacked the city and tossed all the books into the river, which “ran black with ink”</p>
<p>Erasing centuries of scholarship and wiping out the political economic and cultural capital of the Islamic world</p>
<p>The knowledge lost in that one day is equivalent if not more damaging to our understanding of the past in the eastern Mediterranean and Middle East to the burning of library of Alexandria. </p>
<p>Also, there are many historians that argue that the technological gap between the “east” and “west” began that day. But that “gap” is debatable.</p>
