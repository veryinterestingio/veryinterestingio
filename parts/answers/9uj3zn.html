		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The University of Wales's Centre for Explosion Studies, in research commissioned by the Institute of Physics, &quot;estimate that severe structural damage would have been sustained by buildings up to half a kilometre away,&quot; razing everything within 40 metres, and destroying Westminster Abbey.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4338-gunpowder-plot-would-have-devastated-london/" target="_blank">Here's a New Scientist article.</a></p>
<p>The author notes amongst other things that they assumed for this calculation an equal amount of TNT, a more powerful but better studied explosive. They justify this increase in explosive yield with Fawkes' expertise as someone well versed in the use of explosives for military purposes, though it's not clear how much of a difference it would make. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_equivalent" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> lists the relative effectiveness of black powder as half that of TNT.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m honestly <del>surprised</del> blown away this hasn’t been posted yet but they attempted to recreate this scenario on an English program in <del>2017</del>. <a href="https://youtu.be/XTwbkYYdZBw" target="_blank">check it out here, it’s a HUGE explosion.</a> Cant answer any questions about physics, but I hope the video gives you what you are looking for. </p>
<p>*edit: skip to ~49 min in to see the explosion. Also Richard Hammond from Top Gear is in it. </p>
<p>Not 2017, made in 2005 apparently. You all are right, Hammond looks way too young for this to be last year. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would have easily destroyed parliament.</p>
<p>The BBC reproduced it on a show a few years back in show called &quot;The Gunpowder Plot - Exploding the Legend&quot;</p>
<p>The short video link...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rEvCf0dH9I" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rEvCf0dH9I</a></p>
<p>The full show...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTwbkYYdZBw" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTwbkYYdZBw</a></p>
<p>Basically it would have leveled a 40/50 metre area around parliament and send debris up to a few kilometers away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
