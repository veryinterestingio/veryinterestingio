		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Security - driver code and hardware may stay static but attacks against it evolve all the time.  The minute someone finds a hole in it, you can be sure that it will start to be exploited by every virus around for the rest of eternity, to gain broader access to your machine.  Your primary reason for updating ANYTHING (firmware, software, driver, etc.) is to close those holes before someone can take advantage of them.</p>
<p>Bugfixes and updates - sometimes you don't realise that when you do certain things, the hardware only carried on working through luck, because nobody had tried that before, nobody had had that much RAM in the test machines, nobody tried to create 7 million AND ONE triangles on the screen, etc. etc. etc.  New hardware that was made after its creation may have a bad interaction, new versions of Windows might demand a different way of talking to old hardware (often for security, but sometimes just to make things neat), etc. etc.</p>
<p>Performance - A lot of things like graphics drivers, especially, play tricks with the game.  The game has the code and just says &quot;draw this&quot; and the graphics driver does what it can, but there are always ways for nVidia etc. to say &quot;Hey, just in this one instance, on this particular card, this hurts performance, which makes our card look bad, so let's override it just for this one game and do something that looks just as good but runs far nicer on that particular card&quot;.  They call them &quot;game-ready&quot; drivers and will often tell you in the release notes that they've improved performance with games X, Y and Z running on this particular card, and so on.</p>
<p>Simplicity - often drivers, like the nVidia etc. ones, support dozens of models of cards, so they might be updating things that don't actually affect you.  You'd only know if you bothered to read all the notes and nobody (but me!) ever does.  Because of the above, however, it makes sense to just update anyway.  </p>
<p>It rarely hurts, often helps, and sometimes could save your butt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most drivers don't need updating for hardware components to interface with each other, they need updating to cope with programs they come in to contact with, for instance a graphics card which is processing newer games which use newer technologies will require a driver update, whereas your mouse which needs a driver to work with your machine needs updating rarely, if at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a GPU perspective:</p>
<p>Game developers have a long wish-list of things they whish they could do with the GPU. &quot;I really wish DirectX had a way to do X&quot;. Sometimes things on this list would require new hardware (e.g. you would have to buy a new graphics card), but a lot of features are actually quite possible on existing hardware, as long as the drivers are updated to understand and execute these new ideas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
