		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a zero-sum game one participant can't gain something unless another participant loses something. </p>
<p>In a non zero-sum game a participant can gain something without another participant losing something. </p>
<p>Let's say that the winner of a game we're playing is the person who ends up with the most marbles from a bag full of a set number of marbles. We each start out with the same number, so I can't gain marbles without you losing some. That's a zero-sum game. </p>
<p>Now let's say that we're playing a game where the object is to pick up the most marbles in a field full of marbles. No matter how many I pick up, doing so doesn't require that you lose any. That's a non zero-sum game.</p>
<p><strong>Edit for a few replies:</strong> I guess I could have been more explicit. The assumption is that you are only capable of picking up a limited number of marbles before you become incapable of carrying any more and that a field full of marbles would be enough to ensure that a marble taken by one player isn't a marble denied to another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the context of Arrival, it means that the relationship is mutually beneficial. No one walks away a loser.</p>
<p>In the context of life, it's the best way to negotiate. Sometimes people trick themselves into thinking &quot;if I get a good deal, they're getting a bad deal&quot; or the reverse. So they behave very selfishly. In reality, deals where both sides have their respective wins are both non zero sum, and lead to long healthy relationships.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A good real life example of a non zero sum game is trade between two countries. </p>
<p>Let's say country A has a climate that makes it easy to grow food but has very little metal to mine. Country B has the opposite problem, ample metal but poor crops. Each country could survive on their own but would have to spend 90% of their effort on the thing they are bad at just to get by (country A spending 90% of it's effort mining and country B spending 90% on farming).</p>
<p>If the two countries agree to trade though, they can each focus on the thing they are good at. If country A spends 20% of their time farming they can make enough food for both themselves and country B. Country B can do the same mining for metals. Now both countries have 80% of their time and effort available for whatever other ventures they want to pursue and a huge amount of wealth was created out of no where.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
