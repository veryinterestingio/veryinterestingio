		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have three different mechanisms with which we move our eyes. The first is a hunt and seek mechanism, which is where your eyes dart around quickly from point to point. The purpose of this is to provide quick identification of things, such as prey or a predator.</p>
<p>The second mechanism is the tracking mechanism. Once your brain has locked onto something it wants to follow it then switches to making sure you can track that thing very carefully. This is useful for things like throwing spears, catching a ball, or anything else which requires you to intercept a moving target.</p>
<p>The third mechanism is a stabilization mechanism. Lock your eyes on a specific place and then move your head around. Whether you move your head up and down or left to right you can keep your eyes locked on that specific spot.</p>
<p>Edit: Apparently I need to be more specific. Only one mechanism can be active at a time. So if you aren't tracking you aren't going to get smooth movement. Those are just the mechanisms our eyes have developed with. </p>
<p>If you want something a lot more indepth than that, you're gonna need to talk to a specialist and it's sure not going to be ELI5. Might as well ask why there are two different primary muscle types (slow vs quick) and why we can't selectively turn them off and on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For what it’s worth I read that birds bob their heads back and forward when they walk because their eyes are fixed.  As their body moves the head (and eyes) remain fixed on whatever they are looking at until the head moves and refocuses their vision.  It’s essentially the same mechanism with their head when humans do it with their eyeballs.</p>
<p>Useless piece of information but there it is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can, it is just very difficult and constrained by the context (continuing to smoothly track a target that travels behind an object). It most likely is due to the way in which eye-movements are programmed in relation to target selection. Making any eye-movement without an external target is difficult, as even with saccades we typically get a preview of where we would move our eyes to through peripheral vision and can programme saccades accordingly. The oculomotor system struggles without a target, but it is not impossible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
