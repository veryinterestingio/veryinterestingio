		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So when bikes were first created, they used “direct drive” which is basically just the pedals were attached straight to the big wheel with no gearing involved. The big wheel design was actually reasonably comfortable and allowed for faster speeds since the large wheel had a large travel distance per rotation.</p>
<p>Modern bikes are chain driven which means the pedals turn a sprocket which turns a chain which turns another sprocket of differing size. This gives you better speeds or power as you can change the gear ratio.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>One turn of the pedal means one turn of the wheel.</p>
<p>So if you want to go faster... you needed bigger wheels.</p>
<p>The design was clearly impractical and was only very briefly popular in the late 1800s before it was replaced by more modern chain-and-gear designs.</p>
<p>It did find an enduring audience among lamp-lighters though, they could reach the elevated gas lamps from way up there very easily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These early bicycle were called Penny-farthings and the front wheel was so big because that was the one with the pedals connected to it and these cycles didn't have any gears or chains.</p>
<p>The speed at which you turned the pedals was the speed at which the wheel turned. Without any gears or similar you would either have to paddle really fast to get the wheel to rotate faster or you took a really big wheel to make a slow rotating wheel translate into a faster moving vehicle.</p>
<p>Predecessors and proto-bikes like the draisine and velicopede, which didn't yet have any pedals, had two equal sized wheels.</p>
<p>The big front wheel was simply born out of making the pedaling more comfortable.</p>
<p>Once people figured out that you could use a chain and gears to make the back wheel turn at a higher speed while pedaling slowly, the big wheel was no longer needed and people went back to the previous design with equal sized wheels.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those huge-front-wheel bicycles did not have any mechanical transmission (chains, gears etc.). The rider just pedaled the front wheel directly. Its large size allowed for a more efficient pedaling speed (modern bicycles rely on transmission for the same purpose with smaller wheels). So fewer moving parts, fewer breakdowns, easier to manufacture etc., all at the expense of comfort and safety.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
