		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a pretty complex ELI5 topic but if we were to distill it down to the essence, it would likely come down to the fact that highly emotional/highly traumatic events are dealt with by the more primitive part of our brains. Horror movies have the power to scare someone sitting in a secure home with a locked door and all the lights on because the part of the brain the horror movie interacts with is more primitive than the higher-order thinking that says &quot;I'm safe, obviously, there is literally nothing that can hurt me right now and especially nothing in the movie I'm watching.&quot; Yet people still jump and their heart still races. You <em>know</em> going into the movie that will happen, but it happens anyway. </p>
<p>So something traumatic happens to you when you're a kid. Let's say a dog races across a park off-leash and bites your face when you're a toddler. </p>
<p>As an adult, you can understand that event, obviously. There's nothing mysterious about a dog with behavioral problems biting a child. Happens all the time. But you didn't process that event logically when it happened and it was traumatic and made a big impression. You don't flinch 20 years later when a dog jumps up at you when you're at a BBQ because you're irrational. You flinch because the experience in your childhood created almost like a boot-code-level entry in your brain that simply tells you &quot;Dog = danger.&quot; </p>
<p>Now, don't get me wrong. You can, in a way, use &quot;logic&quot; to overcome it. You can do something like cognitive behavioral therapy to harness the power of your brain to retrain the pathways and decrease the power of the stimulus... eventually, potentially, completely extinguishing it. But that's a lot more than just saying &quot;I'm an adult. Dogs aren't scary. Don't be stupid, it's fine.&quot; because you didn't end up with the fear of dogs through logical thought and the fear is now essentially imprinted into the lizard part of your brain and has to be pushed out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the parts of your brain dedicated to keeping you alive (and safe, fed, healthy, etc.) are not great at nuance.</p>
<p>Trauma exists to keep you alive. If something is harmful to your mental or physical health, your brain hangs onto it. The thing is, your brain doesn't care how many false positives it gives you, so long as it never gives a false negative.</p>
<p>This is a simpler trauma example, but I have a phobia of needles that started after I passed out from low blood sugar immediately following a blood test. I know what happened, and I know how to avoid it in the future (I don't fast before blood tests anymore). In the decade since that incident, I've had dozens of blood tests and vaccinations that have gone perfectly normally. But still, when I have to interact with a needle in any way, my breathing gets shallow, I get lightheaded, and I start to cry. It's getting better, but slowly. One bad experience was all it took to imprint a negative association, but each positive experience only overwrites that a little bit, because my lizard brain's job isn't to keep me <em>comfortable,</em> it's to keep me <em>alive.</em> I had a traumatic experience, and since then whenever I try to repeat the experience, my brain is sure I'm going to die. And it doesn't matter how often it sends a false alarm when I'm <em>not</em> going to die, so long as it sends a real alarm when I am.</p>
<p>Rational thought <em>can</em> help people overcome trauma. Understanding what happened and the associations that were formed is how you start building healthier thought patterns. But it takes a long time, and usually the goal is moving forward rather than getting over it, because that early part of your brain isn't interested in nuance or details, it's just interested in keeping you alive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The brain is like a system of roads and highways. The roads that get used most often become freeways and highways that can accommodate lots of traffic, and they get used all the time - little backroads and dirt tracks are slow, and hard to use. This is why practice works - you can reinforce pathways until they're so strong as to become nigh-automatic.</p>
<p>Now, in a well-planned large city, if a major road goes down it's no big deal - couple weeks of repairs, traffic gets temporarily diverted. Bigger disruptions can cause lasting damage - say a bridge collapses, etc - but basically, everything's fine so long as there's not a total catastrophe.</p>
<p>What happens if the damage happens before that city was large, though? Maybe a natural disaster carves a path through the town in its infancy. What happens? Well, a small city lacks the resources and expertise to repair - instead, it must adapt. The <em>entire city</em> builds and grows around the consequences of that disaster. Roads and paths all turn and route in order to account for the damaged areas. By the time the city has become a large metropolis, the effects of the disaster early on are firmly embedded in the architecture as a whole.</p>
<p>Can the roads be fixed and changed? Of course they can, but it's really <em>really</em> hard because of how fundamental the issue has become to the system as a whole. In some cases, it'd be very hard to fix without demolishing the city, and it's rather easier to simply account for the problem and build some infrastructure that gets you 90% of the way in a few years, rather than tearing the whole place down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our capacity for rationality is incredibly weak compared to the emotions and unconscious adaptations that influence us. Childhood trauma happens, by definition, when you're really young. Your brain adopts survival tactics that become fundamental to how it operates from a young age. After living like that for years, simply knowing that those adaptations are no longer optimal doesn't stop your brain from trying to protect itself from pain and hurt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a child’s developing brain is like building a house. The foundation and walls and so forth come first, with the electrical and WiFi and paint coming after. If trauma is like a heavy storm, your brain (house) is constantly being flooded and pounded by heavy winds. So you spend most of your time and resources on a sturdy foundation, thick insulation and walls. Less is spent on the fancy stuff because it’s less of a priority than just surviving each day. This is important when you need to get through the storm but serves you less well later on when you need reliable lighting and internet and comfortable interiors. It’s harder to work or learn from home, to navigate the house at night, to want to invite people over. Maybe theres just light rain outside but you board windows up because it reminds you of the storms, but then you can’t see out too well, or maybe even leave at all. </p>
<p>This is kind of how the constant activation of the body’s stress response (trauma) shapes the architecture of the developing brain. Instead of focusing on building executive function (pay attention at school, make friends, manage strong feelings) being in constant survival mode concentrates development in the limbic system (fight/flight/freeze reactions, emotions, memories). This works for getting through say, DV at home but less for doing well in school. And because it’s affecting your brain development it sticks with you—like trying to “unlearn” reading or walking. So there’s a reason we don’t just “get over it.”</p>
<p>However all is not lost! even though it’s hard, with support, careful builders (positive adults and friends) weather forecasters (therapists) and some new supplies (resources) you can renovate the house. Likewise, our brains are malleable so you can also “rewire” your brain, with time and support, to learn new things, and healthier ways of coping and relating to yourself, others, and the world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
