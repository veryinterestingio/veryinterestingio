		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our current time standards are ultimately realized in terms of TAI, the <em>International Atomic Time</em>. TAI is determined by a collection of extremely accurate atomic clocks scattered across the world, kept synchronized to give a collective time that ticks at almost exactly one second per second on the surface of Earth's geoid.</p>
<p>If TAI were to shut down we could restore it based on astronomical observations. Perhaps not to the same accuracy,^(1) but fairly close. This could be one way to do it. I'm sure there are other, better ones.</p>
<p>Universal time (UT)^(2) is another time standard based on the rotation of the Earth with respect to the sun. It is defined in terms of a hypothetical point in space called the &quot;mean sun&quot;, which is a point on the equator that moves at a constant rate around the Earth. The actual sun, when you project its position down to the equator, doesn't do this for various reasons,^(3) so it's useful to use the mean sun instead. The mean sun tracks the location of the true sun with zero mean offset. UT is then defined as the angle^(4) between the prime meridian and the mean sun, offset by 12 hours (so that when the angle is zero, it's noon UT).</p>
<p>UT doesn't tick forward at one second per second because of irregularities in Earth's rotation. UTC is a time standard designed to (a) closely align with UT and (b) tick at one second per second. This is achieved by periodically adding or subtracting one second to or from UTC when it's too far away from UT. These are called leap seconds (when subtracting... we haven't needed to make UTC go in the other direction so far), and you can look up online when they happened.</p>
<p>Other than that, UTC ticks forward for every second that TAI does. UTC was exactly 10 seconds behind TAI when it was first defined, and there have been 27 leap seconds since, so right now UTC is 37 seconds behind.</p>
<p>As for the difference between <del>UT and UT1</del> UTC and UT, it's a quantity that is kept under close surveillance. IERS publishes daily numbers for this difference, and predictions a year into the future, with millisecond to microsecond accuracy depending on date. Right now, UT is behind UTC by about 0.22 seconds.</p>
<p>So if you can determine UT (by observation) then UTC (by looking up the difference as published by IERS) then you can determine TAI (by subtracting 37 seconds). Your only sources of error are UT-UTC and whatever observational error you make when determining UT.</p>
<p>^(1) That is to say, the same internal accuracy that TAI achieves<br />
^(2) More precise is UT1, but I'll use UT here to mean the same thing<br />
^(3) Because Earth's orbit is slightly noncircular, and because of the inclination of Earth's rotation - see <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Equation_of_time" target="_blank">equation of time</a><br />
^(4) Angles can be expressed in terms of time units: 360 degrees = 86400 seconds - this is not the same thing as arcminutes and arcseconds</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Astronomer here! One I haven’t seen mentioned yet are <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar" target="_blank">pulsars</a>, which are rapidly spinning neutron stars that give off a regular radio pulse. They are <em>so</em> regular that we can model the pulses to within one second in a million years, and every pulsar is different in its pulsar profile. So I’ve heard it said that in the far future we could use them for interstellar GPS of sorts. </p>
<p>So yeah you could definitely use pulsars for this reference assuming you lost all the clocks on Earth but kept all the info about pulsars and radio astronomy. Some pulsars are even millisecond pulsars, meaning they spin every few milliseconds, so you could even cover that part of the time scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I don't think it matters if it is precise. An event stopping all clocks in the world is catastrophic enough and the damage will have been done already.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Time is relative, so probably not in a way we could measure. I've always considered the positions of the celestial bodies to be the ultimate timepiece. The placement of things in space will never be what they are again. Then again, our ability to observe the locations of these things is warped by our position and how long the light takes to reach us, so even those measurements would be subject to relativity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the caesium frequency ∆<em>ν</em>Cs, the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesium-133" target="_blank">caesium-133</a> atom, to be 9192631770 when expressed in the unit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hz" target="_blank">Hz</a>, which is equal to s−1.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second#cite_note-BIPM9-1" target="_blank">[1]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second#cite_note-2" target="_blank">[2]</a> Because the Earth's rotation varies and is also slowing ever so slightly, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second" target="_blank">leap second</a> is periodically added to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_time" target="_blank">clock time</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second#cite_note-3" target="_blank">[nb 1]</a> to keep clocks in sync with Earth's rotation.  </p>

<p>So basically they measure the swinging frequency of the most stable atom they could find and measure time by extrapolating from this natural measurement.</p>
