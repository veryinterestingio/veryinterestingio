		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Veritasium recently did a video on this, but basically, it occurs through a couple steps.</p>
<p>1) top of the water freezes, except for a small hole that forms as the water doesn't freeze evenly. (Edited cause of hole as I misremembered) </p>
<p>2) water expands as it freezes, so the inside of the water Rises a little as it is pushed out of the hole.</p>
<p>3) the water on the outside of the water pushed out freezes first, allowing the inside water to rise further</p>
<p>Steps 3 and 4 can repeat for a long while, until finally </p>
<p>4) the inside of the water freezes entirely or the tip of the spike closes, ending the column's rise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is an &quot;Ice spike&quot;. Although scientists believed they knew the mechanism, it is only recently that serious study with lab conditions and camera monitoring has happened.</p>
<p>Here is a paper from CalTech about them from 2003: <a href="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~atomic/snowcrystals/icespikes/icespikes.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.its.caltech.edu/~atomic/snowcrystals/icespikes/icespikes.pdf</a></p>
<p>You'll see ice spikes form when there aren't any dissolved solids to inhibit their growth. Try putting distilled water in your ice cube tray next time and see what you get.</p>
<p>Wiki entry for Ice Spikes: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_spike" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_spike</a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can I piggy-back on this one since my ice question never got answered? </p>
<p>A stack of two ice cube trays. Why does the top one crack easily and perfectly and the bottom one shatter the cubes and is more difficult to crack? I've tried filling the bottom one with less water, but that doesn't make a difference, it's still shards and cubes while the top one is perfect cubes regardless how full. 'Splain it?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This has been answered on other comments already, but while this has happened to me, it ocurrs VERY rarely. What is my freezer missing? </p>
<p>I also use plastic ice racks and set my freezer at -20. I usually set multiple racks together, stacking them on top of each other, and they may not even be of the same brand/shape, so the topmost one might be tilted a bit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
