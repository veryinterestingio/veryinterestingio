<p>My current understanding is that the failure to detect them has put an upper bound on their weak interaction cross-section, is that correct?  </p>

<p>Sort of; the experiments tend to report &quot;excluded parameter space.&quot; The actual mass of WIMP dark matter is not known, only hypothesized to be in some range (\~10-100 GeV), so the limits are on the scattering cross-section as a function of possible mass. Future experiments are improving sensitivity (for liquid xenon experiments, you can do this by just having more xenon to collide with the dark matter), but some are also exploring other mass ranges (SENSEI for example can look for sub-GeV dark matter).</p>
<p>The neutrino background is what it sounds like: a background signal coming from neutrinos creating an event in your detector that looks like a dark matter event. Since you can't really shield the detector from either of them independently, you end up losing sensitivity in some mass ranges to the neutrino floor. This can be mitigated if the detection is directionally sensitive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a plot that shows a lot of the most relevant experiments and their current best constraints on dark matter cross-section and mass <a href="https://imgur.com/CbnEAOB" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/CbnEAOB</a> ^1. Also shown is where the so called &quot;neutrino floor&quot; exists in parameter space. If the WIMP has a mass/cross-section in the neutrino floor then it will be extremely hard to detect b/c neutrino interactions will be much more common then WIMP interactions.</p>
<p>I'm not an expert in the matter but I think the one of the most anticipated experiments in the field is the LZ experiment. Here's the same plot for LZ's anticipated sensitivity <a href="https://uwmadisondarkmatter.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/lzsensitivity.jpg" target="_blank">https://uwmadisondarkmatter.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/lzsensitivity.jpg</a></p>
