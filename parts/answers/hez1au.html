		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Research is sometimes portrayed as useless, purposeless or a waste of public money. Similarly, you mention how your study for now seems to result in (just) this documentary. (Still pretty rad imo)</p>
<p>What research in your field did you rely on, of which the purpose was initially not at all clear. Or perhaps the original purpose was not what you used it for. </p>
<p>Do you see ways in which your research could be a missing piece to someone else? Perhaps you know what other research could be done to supplement your research?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
