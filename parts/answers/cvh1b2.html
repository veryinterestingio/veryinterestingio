It's more of associated with emotional processing than it is with language. There are literally people with certain types of brain damage who are unable to speak but they can swear, and vice versa.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious how this works too.</p>
<p>I have a friend with Tourette's syndrome and when he gets really stressed out, every third word turns into &quot;fuck&quot;.</p>
<p>If I had to guess, it has to do with a defensive reaction to a negative situation. The aggressive behavior is like a deterrent for whatever is stressing the person out. Swear words are the most aggressive words.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
