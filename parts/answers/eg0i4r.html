		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As to where Helium is actually gathered from, it can often be found trapped in natural gas deposits - the decay processes that u/iorgfeflkd mentioned often occur deep within earth's crust, and allow Helium to be trapped in the same rock formations as natural gas. See the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium_production_in_the_United_States" target="_blank">wiki article</a> for details.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While this isnâ€™t a scientific answer, planet money by NPR did a really cool podcast on the helium market, the trouble with storing and extracting helium, the helium reserve (and the end of it), and new developments. It is pretty informative. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A substance floats up because it's surrounded by some denser medium. Helium is less dense than air, so up it goes. But eventually it reaches the top of the atmosphere, and runs out of air molecules to displace it.</p>
<p>It can be knocked loose by the solar wind (charged particles from the sun), but this is a very slow process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add on to what others are saying about where helium comes from, you are right to suggest that helium released from the earth will eventually leave the atmosphere. This occurs via a process called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_escape" target="_blank">atmospheric escape</a>. According to Wikipedia, which is citing <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/dcatling/Catling2009_SciAm.pdf" target="_blank">this article</a> in Scientific American, &quot;The Earth additionally loses approximately 50 g/s of helium primarily through polar wind escape.&quot;</p>
<p>Helium is essentially a non-renewable resource. As this <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/why-the-world-is-running-out-of-helium-2059357.html" target="_blank">article describes</a>, given the current rate of depletion, experts believe we could run out of accessible helium in 25 years or so. This would actually be very problematic for some technologies that rely on helium, such as MRI scanners.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
