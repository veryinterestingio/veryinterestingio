		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tidally locked objects in space are quite common. Our moon is tidally locked with Earth, Mercury is *almost* tidally locked with the Sun, in fact there are several moons in our solar system that are tidally locked with their planet. If I remember right the closer the bodies are to each other the more likely they are to be tidally locked.  There's not much information on this outside of our solar system due to the difficulty to measure this phenomenon, however there is a concept known as an &quot;Eyeball Planet&quot; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyeball_planet" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyeball\_planet" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyeball\_planet</a></a>) which I believe would provide you with more insight as to what you're looking for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>They are definitely a consideration for habitability. The argument being, with the vast temperature swing from one side to the other, a “habitable” zone would likely exist somewhere in the middle. </p>
<p>It is all theoretical. Everyone is “guessing” we just don’t have enough data to make statements with great certainty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
