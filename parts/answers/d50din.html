		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's quite simple, the mirage is where light is refracted through air at different temperatures (Cold to Hot).</p>
<p>Cold air is denser than warm air, and the bigger the difference the greater the refractive index. As light passes down from cool to hot air, it gets refracted (bent) upwards towards the denser air and away from the ground. </p>
<p>Your eyes will see distorted rays coming from the ground and you essentially see a refracted image of the sky.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A mirage is an image that is distorted by the atmosphere so that its form and location can look very different from the actual object. It is caused by the way light bends as it passes through layers of air of different temperatures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light changes speed when it passes through different materials, hot air lets light go faster than cold air</p>
<p>If you get a layer where light goes fast follows by a layer where light goes slow, you can get light beams coming at a shallow enough angle from the slow side to reflect like a mirror.</p>
<p>Air close the the ground gets really hot and the air around stays relatively cold, and this can creat this situation.</p>
<p>When you get closer they disappear, because the angle isn’t shallow enough anymore</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like most answers here are incomplete. While everyone has accurately explained that the hot layer will reflect the image, nobody has pointed out the elementary, yet essential, fact that with the summer sun beating down, the ground will often be three or four times (or more) hotter than the air. The &quot;film&quot; of air hanging just above it will be so hot, and so much hotter than the next layer above, that it literally acts like a different fluid, that's how different the density will be.   </p>
<p>And the reason why the mirage looks like it's shimmering is because the hot air immediately neighboring the hot surface will drop in density and therefore rise up, where it compresses. That allows replacement cooler air to drop in contact with the surface and rapidly heat up. The cycle of convection then continues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
