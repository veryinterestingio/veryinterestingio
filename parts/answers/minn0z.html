<p>IANAL but I would guess you could find there documents that could be easily introduced as evidence for the safety and efficacy of any vaccine available.  You don't need to prove that the vaccine has a 0% chance of having an adverse reaction.  You just need to prove that having the vaccine is much less likely to be adverse than the disease it prevents.  Pain at the injection site &lt; dying from measles.</p>
<p>I don't know how likely you are to get an FDA representative to testify but here is the contact page for the relevant department</p>

<p>Edit: There's also no evidence that being vaccinated weakens the immune system overall.  The immune system doesn't function like a muscle and doesn't get stronger overall by fighting one particular disease.  In fact, in a very broad sense, the vaccination gives you the immune response you would have if you had suffered from the disease without all the messy side effects like vomiting, diarrhea, and death. Here's one meta study that speaks to this.  There are others.  <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2673970" target="_blank">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2673970</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
