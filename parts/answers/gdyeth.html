		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several things going on with this:
Expectations of homes were very different pre-1970s so they were built a fair bit smaller.</p>
<p>In a lot of regions brick was the material of choice pre-1970s, but it’s quite expensive, so smaller homes were more financially viable.</p>
<p>In the late 70’ and early 80’s the timber industry really took off in home construction, enabled in part by development of new systems for construction such as more economical sheathing systems and mass produced metal connection systems like <a href="https://www.decksdirect.com/media/catalog/product/cache/b8d45b4f9d6eeb8cac81a950e24c1a61/5/6/56640-joist-hangers-tab-2_1.jpg" target="_blank">Joist Hangers</a> that enabled rapid and economical framing as carpenters didn’t have to go cutting individual connections for every member on a job. This reduced the cost per square foot of timber construction significantly, and a lot of people wanted to put those savings into more living space.</p>
<p>One controlling factor is how far floor joists can span. Smaller joists are more economical but can span over smaller rooms. The big rooms you see in modern houses are often made possible by manufactured products - for example <a href="https://andersontrussnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/headerfloortrusses-1000x600.jpg" target="_blank">truss joists</a>. These enable much deeper joists that can span significantly further than readily available joists cut direct from a tree.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Check out <a href="https://www.citylab.com/design/2018/08/the-case-for-rooms/563216/" target="_blank">this history of closed rooms</a> from Kate Wagner (of <a href="https://mcmansionhell.com/" target="_blank">McMansion Hell</a>). Some snippets:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Structural reasons in general were why, in common houses, open spaces would not become more widespread until changes in construction made them more affordable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today’s style of framing, platform framing,  enabled more flexible room shapes and sizes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even as plans in elite houses continued to open up throughout the 1920s, the common house retained its interior walls. Why? In many respects, closed rooms existed to maintain a semblance of privacy. ...  </p>
<p>Work areas, such as the kitchen, and private spaces, like bedrooms and bathrooms, were always closed off to avoid guests seeing the mess of meal-making or, heaven forbid, the “unmentionable room” (the bathroom).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kitchens began to open up and become public spaces in the home because of cultural shifts regarding consumption.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If closed floor plans are considered such a nuisance these days, why did they prevail for almost 100 years in single-family working- and middle-class suburban housing? The answer: closed floor plans make a lot of sense, from both an environmental and a living perspective.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It also depends on how old a home is.  I live in a home in northern new england that was built in 1901.  The rooms are smaller than modern homes.  I cannot imagine the nightmare that would come with trying to heat an open floor plan home 120 years ago.  Even now, we heat rooms at different temperatures depending on usage.  It saves us a lot of $$.
Also, queen or king beds weren't a thing back then.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The basic concepts of home design have changed from function to fashion. Older kitchens are smaller and more isolated because they were akin to utility rooms. You didn't want the heat, noise, and odor of cooking to get into the rest of the house, so food was prepared in the kitchen and then brought into the dining room for consumption. Now, kitchens are viewed as fancy hubs of entertaining and socializing, which has resulted in modern &quot;open floorplans&quot; where everyone is milling about in one large space. Older houses have more bedrooms because people had more children during the periods in which they were designed, and families were more likely to have multiple generations living under one roof.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
