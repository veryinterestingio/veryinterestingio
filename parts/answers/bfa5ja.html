		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An important thing to take note of is not to put too much weight in to the words &quot;Masculine&quot;, &quot;Feminine&quot;, and &quot;Neuter&quot;. these conventions are less trying to apply gender to objects and more trying to group similar words together in to word classes. it would be no different if we'd call these words &quot;Black, White, Gray&quot; words, or &quot;class-1, class-2, class-3&quot; nouns. This is the difference between natural gender and grammatical gender. Natural gender is what gender you are, grammatical gender is the class the word describing you falls in to. </p>
<p>Words that are in the same class share certain properties. for instance masculine words in icelandic tend to have the definite artice &quot;-inn&quot;, often take on the suffix &quot;arnir&quot; when in plural, and all use the masculine declinitions of adjectives (i.e all blue masculine objects are &quot;blár&quot;, whereas feminine words are &quot;blá&quot;, and neuter &quot;blátt&quot;).  knowing the gender of a word helps you knowing how to use that word, and what other words in the language it behaves like. </p>
<p>it also is suspected to aid with sentence processing. If you mishear or miss a part of what someone is saying to you the other words in the sentence can help you deduce what you just missed, and gender helps narrow down the possibilities. </p>
<p>Finally it helps with language clarity and usage a bit. In english you always use &quot;it&quot; for things without a natural gender (unless you personify things like your boat). So, when talking about a mug on a table you say &quot;It was placed on it&quot;. While this is easy to deduce from context it isn't instantly clear if the mug is on the table or the table on the mug. However in icelandic you would say &quot;Hann er á því&quot; (He is on it). The mug is masculine, and the table is neuter. Even if you're unsure of how tables work you instantly know which object is being referred to, because the table can't be a &quot;he&quot; and the mug can't be an &quot;it&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The title isn't relevant to most of the video, it's mainly about grammatical gender.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Indo-European languages inherited grammatical gender from PIE. This is one specific example of the general phenomenon of noun classes. Some languages have different bases for noun classes (see the person upthread who mentioned Ojibwe) and some have lots more than 3 (Swahili, for example).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
