		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It varies. Much of the Sahara is not sand at all, but either hard or loose rock. Many areas were igneous (volcanic) in origin. And a large part of the desert have scrub plants growing. If there is a fresh water source nearby, there can be grasses and fruit trees growing.</p>
<p>The large sand dune parts are called <em>Ergs</em>. They are places downwind of sources of loose and fine sand, like dry riverbeds or deltas. The wind can move the dunes kilometers per year. And in many cases the underlying rough rock will be visible between the dunes, which can often be more than 50 meters thick.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can see a map! Check out SoilGrids, which maps different soil properties all over the world. You can look in your browser here: <a href="https://soilgrids.org" target="_blank">https://soilgrids.org</a></p>
<p>You can set the map to “sand” from the physical tab, and adjust the depth slider to see how the map changes. Try playing around with all the other maps! I use these in research all the time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whatever the depth of the sand, its on the move and can't stay there long. Whatever the prevailing wind, it can't be a stable situation.</p>
<p>So, if its okay, there's the subsidiary question of how old and how long-lived such a desert would be. Here in France, when the wind is from the South, we often see our car windshields yellow with sand that has crossed the Mediterranean! Much more sand will presumably have been deposited in the sea. On a geological timescale, any land not stabilized should rapidly wear down  and vanish underwater. </p>
<p>Are the Sahara and other deserts just ephemeral before becoming future sea beds, and how long from now?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have already answered your question, but if you want an accurate picture of what living in and crossing the Sahara is like, I highly recommend the book Touareg, by Alberto Vasquez Figueroa. It really shows the different aspects and landscapes within the desert, and how they affect being there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
