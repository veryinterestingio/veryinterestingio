		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most viruses only mutate in ways that have no effect on how they interact with immune systems. The mutations are really useful for tracking how they spread but don't affect disease burden or treatment, including vaccines. </p>
<p>Influenza is pretty unique among vaccine-treatable viruses in that it frequently mutates the protein that our immune system uses to identify it. I believe all other vaccines have stable immune-stimulating portions over time.</p>
<p>HIV is another virus that mutates in a way that affects immune response - actually much faster than influenza - but no vaccine has been successful against it yet. </p>
<p>The vaccine formula may change the non-active portion, for example preservatives, as supply chains evolve. Or in the case of polio, which originally was a trivalent vaccine targeting all three varieties, it has now been cut to a two-variety formula because one of them went extinct (vaccination campaign success!)</p>
<p>The covid19 vaccine or vaccines, when they are proven out, may be the first ones that require yearly booster shots - the same vaccine formula to remind our immune system about a threat it is forgetting. While booster shots are common among vaccines (tetanus every 10 years, for example), our immune systems seem particularly prone to forgetting viruses in the coronavirus family.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Influenza vaccine is the only vaccine that needs to be updated regularly. All others - virus, bacterial, toxin; human, veterinary - are very stable. </p>
<p>Some vaccines have been updated to improve their safety profile, like the rabies vaccine switch to human diploid cell production in the 1970s, or their immunogenicity and safety like the switch to the Edmonston-Enders strain of measles in 1968. </p>
<p>But as far as vaccines matching their targets, influenza is unique.  Measles has been antigenically stable for at least 60 years. Yellow fever vaccine hasn’t had to change since 1938. The mumps vaccine used today is the same as in 1967. Rubella, 1969.  The polio vaccine invented in 1955 is still effective today. </p>
<p>Influenza is unique. People think it represents normal virus behavior, but that’s only because all the normal viruses have been virtually eliminated by vaccines, so people don’t think about them. </p>
<p>And because someone will ask: SARS-CoV-2 is a normal virus. Virologists don’t expect it to behave like influenza.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A number of them have been reformulated.  Originally, a lot of them used animal cells and they were reformulated to use human cells.  The were issues with whole cell pertussis and small pox vaccine and that led to their reformulation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in vaccine manufacturing and you’d be surprised how often the processes “change.”</p>
<p>However, the antigenic portions do <em>not</em> change - so, a HepB vaccine made 30 years ago will still protect against the natural HepB virus found in society. M
What <em>does</em> change are the components and technologies used to make the final product! Raw material sourcing changes happen very frequently for supply chain reasons, or different chemicals that are equivalent are pursued for risk reduction purposes (example, some materials are exposed to animal origin components, or are derived from animals, and therefore carry risks of adventitious agents and require a LOT more technical work to be used; if there’s an equivalent material that’s not animal origin/exposure, the work will likely be put in to use that material instead.) They’ll also add things like automated inspection machines, automated sealing equipment, etc. to better optimize the process using newer technologies. </p>
<p>However, as I said, the antigen will be the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
