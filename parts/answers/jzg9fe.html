		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your ear interiors need to match pressure with the outside world in order to work properly; the membrane that vibrates with external sound can be pushed too far out or in by a difference in pressure and not vibrate properly, meaning that you need to adjust pressure inside your ear using <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VlH7m.jpg" target="_blank">connections</a> to your throat to regulate that. When the ear drum moves suddenly to get back to a more neutral position, we hear that, just we hear other movements caused by external sounds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's like when you open a 2L soda bottle the air escapes and the walls become less hard. Your ears need to act like a drum and a drum doesn't work if it is too tight. That's why they call it an ear drum. They're very similar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your middle ear (other side of your eardrum) is like a box with a wimpy tube that is supposed to release air. You have bacteria all over the walls of the box and they give off carbon dioxide. Sometimes the wimpy tube doesn’t stay wide enough to let the carbon dioxide out, or sometimes the tube gets clogged with wax. </p>
<p>There’s a muscle in the back upper part of your mouth that, when stretched, can open up that wimpy tube. This allows the air to rush out super fast, like a pop. You can stretch this muscle sometimes when you yawn super big. You can also sometimes stretch it by yanking on the bottom of your ear in a certain direction. If you see a chiropractor, many of them can do this for you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
