		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Methane is wayyyy better at trapping heat than CO2 so 1 ton of methane has a significantly higher warming potential than 1 ton of CO2, but it gets hard when you make people try to do the equivalency math on the fly so things are generally reported in terms of the number of tons of CO2 that would create an equivalent warming</p>
<p>Since methane's warming effect is 34x as potent as CO2, that means the 3.1 gigaton CO2 equivalent came from 91 million tons of methane being burped out</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>CO2 holds heat in the atmosphere, just like the glass of a greenhouse- hence, the greenhouse effect.  It absorbs infrared, and radiates some of it back to the ground.  Methane does the same thing, but much more strongly.  Fortunately, methane combines with oxygen to form CO2.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://phys.org/tags/methane/" target="_blank">Methane is a relatively potent greenhouse gas with a high global warming potential</a> of 72 (averaged over 20 years) or 25 (averaged over 100 years). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>What that means is that in the short term, each ton of methane is as damaging as 72 tons of CO2.  But in the medium term of 100 years, it is &quot;only&quot; 25 times as bad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It means the amount of methane burped is the same as 3.1 gigatonnes of CO2, in terms of 'greenhouse effect'.</p>
<p>A 'greenhouse gas' is any gas that produces the greenhouse effect in the atmosphere. Some greenhouse gasses have a stronger effect than others, this is why they are all compared to CO2 for simplicity.</p>
<p>It's important to understand that these gasses have differences, Methane for example produces a stronger greenhouse effect but also decays faster - although it decays into CO2.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One methane molecule is like a big down comforter on your bed. One carbon dioxide molecule is like the sheets. It would take a lot more sheets to warm up the bed as much as one comforter does. That means Methane is actually much more dangerous when it comes to the heating of the planet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
