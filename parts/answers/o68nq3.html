		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's instinctual. </p>
<p>Birds reared in plastic containers build their own nests just fine. They need not ever see a nest to build one. </p>
<p>Further, the nests they build don't necessarily model the nests their parents built. If a researcher provides a bird with only pink building materials, the chicks reared in that pink nest will choose brown materials over pink for their own nests, if they have a choice.</p>
<p>There is an instinctual template, thank god. Imagine being compelled to build something but having no idea of what or how. Torture!</p>
<p>That's not to say that birds are slaves to their instinctual templates. They gain experience over successive builds and make minor changes to the design and location.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I saw a documentary that the birds have an instinct to do it and each year their nest building gets better. I also read some researchers cut a hole in the bottom of a nest to see what would happen and the bird just kept laying eggs and they would fall through, it didn't comprehend.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It varies by species. I can bring an example of a species that is genetic (I can't remember the exact name of the species unfortunately). This is a spider that weaves a spider web container to protect its eggs. The motions to complete this are quite complex, and they never see an other spider do this (they always do this hiding in their nest), so it can't be learned. Furthermore, if you interrupt it, and take away the half complete container, it just continues to make it. It can't detect errors, it's all &quot;pre-programmed&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Birds can learn from their own nest-building experience, while other studies suggest birds may learn by example from their parents or other familiar birds. So they either use trial and error for the materials to use or they watch their parents and or similar birds’ nesting habits and mimic their nests. It’s actually pretty cool to think about how smart some animals really are!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to bring up the topic of Sperm Whales here because AFAIK their complex behaviours (mainly their social coda communication) is entirely behavioural. </p>
<p>Sperm whale mothers and calves have codas, which are a series of clicks that they use to communicate with one another, as well as other individuals. Studies have shown that coda dialects exist, and that individuals that use the same dialect preferentially choose to be with one another to form social units, much like how humans may find it easier to make social groups with people who speak the same language. </p>
<p>What's interesting with Sperm Whales is that there is evidence that these coda dialects are entirely learned, as there is a period of time in which Sperm Whale calves have trouble mimicing, or using other coda dialects know as &quot;babbling&quot;. Calves can learn from their mothers, or learn a different coda via horizontal learning. Whats more is that these dialects have even shaped the genetics of the Sperm Whale dialect groups, as opposed to the genetics affecting the coda dialects.</p>
<p>Sorry for the long reply, but its a neat example and just wanted to throw my hat into the ring</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
