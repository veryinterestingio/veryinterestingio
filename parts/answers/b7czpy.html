		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>William Shockley, one of the men who invented the transistor spent time there as a child. He founded his company, Shockley Semiconductor and headquartered it there. </p>
<p>He hired 8 engineers for his new company, and was such a bad manager they abandoned him and founded their own company under the Fairchild business (they made camera and plane parts). This became Fairchild semiconductor. They're called the &quot;Traitorous 8&quot; and this is considered the birth of startup culture. </p>
<p>One of the unique parts of Fairchild's culture was that the engineers would leave the company to found their own businesses, called the &quot;Fairchildren.&quot; One of the most famous Fairchildren is Intel, which was founded by two of the Traitorous 8 themselves - Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce . </p>
<p>It turns out Fairchild and the Fairchildren did some exceptional things with technology, and made a lot of money. The venture capital culture began to grow, which provides the financial backbone for startups. </p>
<p>TL;DR blame Shockley and Fairchild and all the great ideas spawned from them and the money that followed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m not a Silicon Valley expert, but from what i do know, it was the culmination of a number of things that basically helped to create a snowball effect of “right place, right time” that made it what it is today.</p>
<p>Most notably being that US military spent a lot of money on R&amp;D in the early 20th century in the Bay Area, which when combined with Stanford University, helped to create a hub of STEM research in the area that created a fertile breeding ground of highly educated scientists/engineers who would go on to invent the technologies (silicon transistors - for instance) that would lay the foundation for the tech revolution. </p>
<p>Edit: So while it technically COULD have happened anywhere, you’d need to go back almost 100 years and adjust a long series of events/conditions along the way in order for that critical mass that created modern Silicon Valley to happen anywhere else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you want to open a lemonade stand. Where would you put your stand if the goal of your store is to make the best lemonade in the world? Well you’re in luck because in your neighborhood, there are two houses across the street from each other that produce the best lemons in the world. Not only that, but the government gives tons of money to these two houses to develop better and better lemons. The technology the houses develop are revolutionary and the people who work there are the leading lemon experts of the world. </p>
<p>As you open a lemonade stand, the whole block begins to fill with lemon-based food stands: lemon drop cookies, lemon flavored cupcakes, lemon pie, etc. If anyone in town wants lemon treats, they go to this block, nicknamed “Lemon Alley”. </p>
<p>Stanford University and the University of a California, Berkeley (which is 4 times larger than Stanford by number of students) are arguably the greatest engineering and computer science schools in the country (if not the world) and have amassed massive funding from the federal government for cutting edge research in math and science. This attracts the greatest academics in the field of engineering who in turn go on to teach students that supply the leading companies of the world with a steady stream of top engineering talent. These schools are 50 miles apart. In these 50 miles and its surroundings is Silicon Valley. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Steve Blank has the best and most comprehensive explanation that I've seen...</p>

<p>The first 1/2 of the video is just background explaining the problems in WW-II that resulted in the Department of Defense starting their collaboration with universities.</p>
<p>2nd half of the video gets to the meat of the answer for you.</p>
<p>Short answer: Frederick Terman saw the success of the WW-II collaboration between Universities and Department of Defense and built out the model and culture at Stanford, expertly weaving government, university and private enterprise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
