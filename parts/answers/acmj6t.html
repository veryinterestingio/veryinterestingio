		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cold things reduce inflammation and have a numbing effect. No surprises why that's a relief on your throat - it dulls the discomfort and lowers swelling in your nodes/tonsils/esophagus. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Warm things help with areas that are overexerted, sore, and stiff/ knotty by dilating capillaries and increasing blood flow to the area. I think the relief part is somewhat due to dilation aiding the healing process... and somewhat because heat is reassuring and that comfort is by definition analgesic (relieving of pain)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your pain nerves are small and transmitt quickly, the nerves that transmit heat/cold signals are big and slow so when heat or cold is applied, these signals overwhelm the pain signals.  </p>
<p>That is why your mum put a hot water bottle on your tummy!  </p>
<p>You can test the speed by having someone put a drop of hot or cold water on your toe, you will feel it land instantly but it will take a second to discover if it is hot or cold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
