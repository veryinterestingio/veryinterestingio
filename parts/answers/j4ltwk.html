<p>The former determines how much an object will accelerate for a given force. And the other is like a &quot;gravitational charge&quot;, it's how strongly something couples to the gravitational field.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that there's no known reason why those two quantities have to be the same thing, but as far as we know, they are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Astrophysics PhD student reporting in - I see many people wondering about the fact that gravitational mass and inertial mass appear to be equal, and whether that should be surprising.</p>
<p>From a Newtonian perspective, this is indeed a startling coincidence. Mass and electric charge are completely different, which means that if you put a charged object in an electric field, the acceleration it feels is different depending on the charge. A big charge will accelerate faster than a small one. Yet with gravity, if inertial mass and gravitational mass (the analog of charge) are always equal, then the acceleration you feel in the presence of gravity is always the same: <em>all things fall at the same rate!</em></p>
<p>When two things seem totally unrelated, but &quot;coincidentally&quot; are measured to always be the same, it's a clue that something deeper is going on. It was this clue in fact, among other things, that led Einstein to his theory of gravity (known as &quot;General Relativity&quot;), which is one of the pillars of modern physics today. Einstein realized that if <strong><em>everything</em></strong> in a gravitational field falls (accelerates) at the same rate, no matter what it is, then gravity isn't really about <em>what's</em> falling, but <em>the falling motion itself</em>, which would be the same for any object. And what is motion but a trajectory through space and time. So in the framework of General Relativity, objects (and light too btw) in a gravitational field fall not because of a 'force' between them, but because space and time themselves are warped in the presence of matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
