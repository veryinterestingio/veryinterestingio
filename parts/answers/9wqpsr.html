		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing that isn't getting brought up is how populated California is. A fire in some states can get to 100k acres and still be miles from any towns or cities. </p>
<p>Where in California a much smaller fire can be right up against a town or a city very quickly. It makes them much more serious when peoples property and lives are in danger. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The surrounding states do have bad fires. But they get less press coverage because they are usually in more rural areas with less population density than the LA foothills.</p>
<p>Look up Arizona Rodeo-Chedeski fire, Wallow Fire, Willow Fire, Cave Creek Complex fire, Warm fire. All devastating and huge (some absolutely enormous).  But little national press because it's just not as big of a news story when a few hundred thousand acres of national forest burns vs literal suburbs burning.</p>
<p>Edit: and can't forget the Yarnell Hill fire, many young men died tragically fighting that fire. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you not noticed that Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and British Columbia have all been on fire for all the last three summers? And I mean on fire - bad air quality across most of those states, resources to fight fires are maxed out, and all are close in proximity to California. The west coast in general is tinder box due to drought. States like Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada are maybe just as close to California or closer but they have a lot of desert that doesn't burn...and what fuel they do have that can burn, does burn.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A large part of it is the santa ana winds which are specific to the california coastal mountains.  Very dry and very fast downhill winds which are perfect for making massive fires.  The fires wouldn't have been a big issue without the heavy winds whipping them up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fire is natural in California forests. California forests evolved with fire to remove dead and diseased trees, clean up litter, and control tree density. Early explorers said the Sierra Nevada is always on fire (Fremont). Native California people set fires if the forest was too thick to travel through, and to control dense patches of poison oak. </p>
<p>In the late 19th century, European forest managers were brought in. European forests are small, heavily managed, and resemble tree farms. In the mind of these foresters, fire was verboten. All fires were put out immediately. However California forests are usually on super steep slopes, as California is a fairly young tectonically active terrain. So all the litter cleanup that happens in European forests did not happen in California.</p>
<p>Fast forward 150 years and you have California forests vastly overgrown, dead and diseased trees abound. Wildlife is increasingly limited as the dense tree canopy shades the forest floor, little grows on the ground, and there is little for the grazing animals hence they are in decline.</p>
<p>Frequent fires kill the smaller trees keeping the taller pines dominant. A dense cover favors fir trees which according to one biologist's lecture I attended last year consume more water (pines go dormant when they can't reach water), and actually raise the temperature of the forest about 1.5C by reducing stream flow.</p>
<p>Then when you do have an accidental fire, the heavy fuel load of litter, and the dead branches of the diseased and younger trees take the fire to the canopy, and you can't fight that kind of fire.</p>
<p>So the real problem is forest mismanagement. But it doesn't stop there. The forest managers set as many prescribed fires as they can. However air quality managers and cultural factors provide more control over forest managers. So it comes down to bad politics.</p>
<p>There was a devastating fire in a residential neighborhood in South Lake Tahoe a few years back. The resulting investigations revealed there were seventy some odd nature preserving NGOs (Non Government Organizations) that could level fines on home owners for removing pine needle litter, removing trees, or other reasonable fire safety measures ... not one of these NGOs were responsible for the devastating fire caused by the mismanagement of their rule.</p>
<p>EDIT: Somehow formatting duplicated a paragraph.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Here's a paper on the subject <a href="https://www.csus.edu/envs/Documents/Theses/Spring%202015/852.2015.Spring.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.csus.edu/envs/Documents/Theses/Spring%202015/852.2015.Spring.pdf</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
