		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don't need to acclimatise to higher pressures in the way you need to do for lower pressures.</p>
<p>An extreme example is diving.  Divers can go down at the rate they like without many issues (gas mixes may need to change) but need to be careful coming up so they don't reduce pressure to quickly and get the bends.</p>
<p>If you went down a deep enough hole you would need to be careful coming up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A quick guide to humans and atmospheric pressure:</p>
<p>Low pressure: not enough oxygen, altitude sickness</p>
<p>High pressure: nitrogen becomes narcotic</p>
<p>Rapid decrease in pressure: decompression sickness (bubbles in blood, &quot;the bends&quot;)</p>
<p>Rapid increase in pressure: no serious effects</p>
<p>High altitude acclimation is mostly about biochemical changes to manage the lack of oxygen.  To my knowledge people don't really adapt to nitrogen narcosis.</p>
<p>Nitrogen narcosis is not a problem underground.  It typically sets in beyond about 4 bars of atmospheric pressure, which is equivalent to diving about 30 meters underwater.  But in an ordinary mine shaft connected to the atmosphere, you won't hit that pressure until a depth of about 11 km, which is 4 times deeper than the deepest mine ever built.</p>
<p>Decompression sickness is also not usually a problem, due to the small pressure changes and slow rate of ascent.  As mentioned, the deepest mine in the world is about 4 km depth and has a bottom air pressure of about 1.6 bars, which is what a scuba diver would experience at a depth of 6 meters.  A diver can go from here to the surface by swimming up for a few seconds, but for a miner it would take many minutes in an elevator or hours and hours of walking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don't need to acclimate for the pressure difference as much as divers when goind down a cave or a mine just like the previous posts explain. However acclimating to the darkness and possible temperature difference is usually needed. It is a good idea to spend few minutes inside the cave/mine entrance before starting the descend and let your eyes get used to reduced light (and maybe check your lamp and spare lamp the last time).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don't get much more effects from higher pressures because oxygen saturation in our blood is already close to 100% at sea level. If you increase it by 30-50% your blood still carries as much oxygen as it did before, and it would feel very similar. You need to go to pressures 3-4 times the sea level pressure to feel other effects (nitrogen narcosis, etc.) </p>
<p>When you go up, even a 30% decrease in pressure causes the oxygen saturation to drop by 30-40%. Your body is not getting enough oxygen, and will react by increasing the breathing rate, making more red blood cells, etc. </p>
<p>When you're coming back from living at altitude, the sea level may feel different for a day or two because your body as adjusted to functioning with low oxygen saturation. After a month at 3000M, I feel more dizzy for a couple days, and notice how slow by breathing is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably not. Acclimatizing to high altitude involves adapting to the low partial pressure of oxygen and the metabolic acidosis that occurs with increased ventilation. This should not be an issue descending into the earth. I have not heard of people getting the bends the way divers do from going deep in the ground. The pressure differences are just not as great because air is so much less dense than water. At most, you would need a controlled ascent if the pressure differences were great enough to pose a risk of causing the bends.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
