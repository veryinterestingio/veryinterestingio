		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When subject to tensile stresses in excess of their yield strength, amorphous and semi-crystalline polymers form crazes, which are microscopic planar voids normal to the stress direction bridged by a network of highly aligned fibrils connecting both faces of the craze. Craze planes reflect light due to the difference in refractive indices between uncrazed and crazed material; if a high density of fine crazes is present, crazed regions will appear white.</p>
<p>Despite their visual similarities, crazes are emphatically <em>not</em> cracks: being partially filled with polymer, they are not true voids, and moreover can support tensile loads. That said, crazes will eventually transition into cracks if loading is continued.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is the same process as when you grind up materials into powders they start to appear white. All the newly formed surfaces allow for essentially reflection (diffraction) of light. light that is being relfected in all directions appears white. All directions and basically all wavelengths of the light.  You see this same effect happening with the Crest of an ocean wave when it turns white. Many surfaces to scatter light. Also same concept on dried out river rocks look white due to the rough porous surfaces.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
