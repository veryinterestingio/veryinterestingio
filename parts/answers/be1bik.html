		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Standard paternity DNA testing cannot differentiate between identical twins. Similarly in criminal cases it has been enough to establish doubt as to which twin committed an offense. There is a new test which sequences each twin's entire genome and looks for sequence mutations that are unique to every individual.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was actually a court case in Brazil reported on a couple of weeks ago that is this situation exactly. Here’s an excerpt of the news item:  </p>
<p>Identical twin brothers in Brazil have both been ordered to pay child support for a baby after allegedly impersonating each other to trick as many women as possible into sex.</p>
<p>The twins, identified only as Fernando and Fabricio, tried to shirk responsibility for the newborn as DNA tests came back inconclusive, reports The Sun.</p>
<p>The mystifying results are said to have failed to provide a solid answer because the men are so genetically similar.</p>
<p>Each brother tried to blame the other, Brazilian news outlet Globo reports.</p>
<p>But a judge ruled they were denying the innocent child a right to know her biological dad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This has actually been <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1872497313002275" target="_blank">researched</a> and answered!</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> (because I forgot I wasn't on /r/askscience):  Identical twins don't have exactly identical DNA, there are very small and random differences called SNPs.  Some of these SNPs happen after the twins separate in the mother's womb and those ones will show up in any children that the twin has.</p>
<p>If you do a super in-depth genetic test, you can tell the difference between the twins and if you get matching SNPs in the child then you can be sure that that twin fathered the child.</p>
<p><strong>In-depth explanation:</strong></p>
<p>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can vary between identical twins and the paper suggests that there would be low single digit (they found 5, others have suggest ~1.3) numbers of such differences between otherwise identical twins.  Depending on when the SNPs occurred during the development of the embryo, some of those would be heritable and be passed on to the offspring of the paternal twin.</p>
<p>The discussion section of the paper is very interesting as it goes into detail on when (and when they will not) be heritable based upon when exactly the SNPs occurred.  In short, they identify key candidates for tissue types which may be better used to detect such differences.  This has relevance in paternity cases as well as potential forensic tests.</p>
<p>I can't comment on the legal aspects of the case but, if the above diagnostic test was accepted by the court, the paternal twin would be on the hook for child support one would think.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are you Brazilian? A case exactly like that happened less than one month ago.</p>
<p>They had to pay the child support together. Like a law fiction, so the most important thing (the child’s well being) is taken care of.</p>
<p>Discovering the real father, as absurd as the decision sounded, is secondary face the child’s well being - and someone shouldn’t cowardly abuse the lack of a method to determine the actual paternity to avoid their responsabilities.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It turns out that identical twins aren't, strictly speaking, perfectly identical. While they both start from the same egg with one single set of DNA, every time a cell divides, it has to copy its DNA, and copying errors can happen. During early fetal development, identical twins undergo more than 300 genetic mutations, or copy errors, on average. As human cells divide trillions of times during their lifespan, a few hundred genetic mutations could lead to millions or trillions of genetic differences in the DNA of identical twins over the years. So if you sequence the <em>entire</em> genomes of both twins, the mother, and the child, you can tell which twin is the father because of these unique mutations. Sequencing a full genome is a much more comprehensive test that the standard paternity test. Standard paternity tests rely on checking only a handful of markers and comparing them. This works great for people who are unrelated or distantly related, but not for identical twins. A full genomic sequencing is more costly and time consuming, but it can be done.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
