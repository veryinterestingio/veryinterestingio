		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because mph is the wrong unit. The earth is rotating at 0.0007 rpm, so the stars appear to rotate at the same rate. The minute hand of a clock has an angular velocity 24 times faster than the stars (0.017 rpm), but it still isn't fast enough to be able to see the movement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you go to a formula1 race and stand by the track, the cars fly by at 100s of MPH and you hardly see them, now, if you go stand on a hill and watch that same race, those cars are much easier to track. </p>
<p>With that way of thinking, think about how far those stars are away from us. Thatâ€™s how I think if it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the earth is so big. Even though we are rotating at a high speed, it still takes a decent amount of time to spin a few degrees. It takes 24 hours to spin 360 degrees, so 15 per hour, .25 per minute. Imagine spinning a basketball at a rate of once per day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's 24&#8239;000 miles around the earth, so 1&#8239;000&#8239;mph is not that fast by comparison. The stars only have to move slowly across the sky to do one lap in just under a day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
