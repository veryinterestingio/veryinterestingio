		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kind of accurate - this is the &quot;square/cube law&quot;.</p>
<p>The strength of a muscle is proportional to its cross-sectional area, but the mass of anything is proportional to its volume.</p>
<p>So if you take a person or animal and make it (for example) 10 times bigger in every direction, its muscles get 10^2 as much area but its mass gets 10^3 greater.  So it's 100 times as strong, trying to move 1000 times as much body.  It'd be lucky if it could breathe, never mind walk around.  (It would also have a 100x-as-strong heart, trying to pump 1000x-as-much blood.  Brutal.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of a skateboard wheel. Imagine a red stripe on the side of it, how much time and energy does it take to move the board far enough to make that red stripe go in a full circle and back to it’s start point? Now imagine with a bicycle wheel, a 6’ diameter tractor tire. As things get larger, the time required to make them move goes up. You can compensate for this by adding more energy, but but energy sources get less efficient as they increase in size.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
