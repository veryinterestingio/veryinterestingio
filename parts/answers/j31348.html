Allergies are your immune system mistaking something harmless for something dangerous. Your body can then massively overreact to the percieved threat, and do you harm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What youâ€™re talking about is a type 1 hypsersensitivty reaction.. in situations like life threatening bee stings or peanut allergies.. the allergen is picked up by immune cells that are over sensitive to the foreign antigen, take it to the hive (lymph nodes) where it shows it off to a bunch of your lymphocytes and mast cells that release a shit ton of chemicals that make your blood vessels leaky and wake up even more immune cells.. if this happens in your throat/lungs.. just imagine all the fluid leaking into your lungs and swelling everything up. Not supposed to happen this way, but some peopleâ€™s bodies just overreact.. we all overreact sometimes, but in this case you get a shot of epinephrine for overreacting ðŸ™‚</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Evolutionarily, allergic reactions don't kill very often at all.</p>
<p>It just seems like it because 1) we hear about the worst, rare reactions and 2) the death rate for people &lt; 60 is very low because of modern medicine.</p>
<p>Before civilization, allergic reactions likely saved more lives than were lost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can just spontaneously become allergic too. An aunt of mine was visiting many years ago and we had prawns. She had eaten prawns and other shellfish for 50 years prior to that day, and she nearly died to a sudden and extreme allergic reaction.  She can't even touch one now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing to bear in mind is that some of these immune responses have been with us for aeons. </p>
<p>Like the throat closing up. Made a lot sense when we were fish and the gullet was only for food, we had gills we breathed through at the time. But then we decided to grow lungs and instead of also evolving a second tube to breath through we repurposed the one we already had.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
