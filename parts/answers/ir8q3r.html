		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Clotting doesnâ€™t actually require drying out. There are cells in blood whose job is to gather at wounds and stop the blood from flowing out, from the inside. Even human wounds can close underwater, so you can be sure that fish are even better at it.</p>
<p>The only complicating factor is if the water is flowing past the wound fast enough to physically wash it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fish are unlikely to survive extreme or large wounds - few animals are (besides humans, and that's usually down to our own intelligent efforts). In nature, most significant injury problems become fatal problems quite quickly - evolution rarely ends up developing mechanisms to survive major traumas because the investment of energy is not 'worth it' - particularly for animals that rely on 'bulk' approaches to survival i.e. breed fast, frequently and in large numbers, and you can afford to lose a few.</p>
<p>But they can and do survive small and medium wounds, with clotting agents that work underwater, as proteins can bind together in all sorts of conditions and don't need to dry out to do that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Clotting doesn't involve moisture or air. </p>
<p>At a breach some cells see that there's a opening so they start the making of a chemical. This chemical starts forming tiny noodly strands in the blood, which mesh together to form a net. The bigger blood cells can't go through this net so they get stuck and block up the breach. </p>
<p>Sometimes the cells which start clotting just do it randomly, which is a problem. Sometimes they don't know when to start and blood keeps leaking out. Clots can also occur inside your body, if there's something which triggers those cells. </p>
<p>If the wound is too big, the net can't do enough to hold all the blood in, so they try to close the wound with stitches to reduce the area from which blood goes out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
