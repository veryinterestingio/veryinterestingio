		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's mostly made from water.</p>
<p>Water as H2O can be split and create 2H2 + O2. That hydrogen is then actually combined with waste CO2 from breathing, creating CH4 (methane) and H2O (more water, fed back into the system).</p>
<p>There's loss everywhere in the process no matter how efficient the reclamation systems are. We send constant supplies of water up to the station.</p>
<p>Similar systems already existed on submarines. Of course, they could provide their own water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a few different ways, but the primary source of oxygen comes from electrolysis, passing electrical current through water breaks the water molecules apart into hydrogen and oxygen.</p>
<p>Water is brought to the space station when a rocket goes there.  Electrical current is provided by the solar panels.</p>
<p>Edit: The other methods are oxygen tanks replenished from earth and they also have a backup system called a solid fuel oxygen generator.  These are canisters that contain a mixture of sodium chlorate and iron powder.  When ignited it burns like a candle / torch and releases oxygen (and salt and rust)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>NASA Engineer here</strong>, I have worked with the life support system on ISS. </p>
<p>Tl;Dr: We regularly fly up nitrogen, air, and oxygen. We also produce oxygen on ISS by splitting water into O2 and H2. We also scrub the air on board with a machine that cleans the Co2 from the air, and we have cabin air filters that catch the particulates (hair, fodder, etc). Trace chemicals are scrubbed by yet another machine. </p>
<p>Supply: We bring Air (a mixture on
of Nitrogen and Oxygen) up to ISS often, along with seperate tanks of pure Nitrogen and Oxygen. On Earth, your air is around 78% N2 and 21% O2, so we try to maintain that balance on ISS at a pressure of 14.0 - 14.9 PSI. Crew members also sweat, and produce humidity through their breath. Our air conditioners collect this moisture, and we use cleanse this and the crews urine to produce water, which we then can take and split into H2 and O2, O2 goes back to the cabin. </p>
<p>Cleaning the Atmosphere: CO2 scrubbers scrub out the CO2, a Trace Contaminatant scrubber cleanses hundreds of other trace chemicals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
