		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a really complex topic, but to start, electrons act basically as tiny little magnets. They have a North Pole and a South Pole, and put out a tiny magnetic field. </p>
<p>In a lot of elements, electrons pair up, pointing in opposite directions, and mostly cancel out the magnetism, but some elements have unpaired electrons, which lets the magnetism add up, instead of cancelling. </p>
<p>Even this isn’t enough though. Some atoms like to line up facing opposite directions, cancelling the magnetism. Only certain elements like lining up all in the same direction, creating an even stronger magnetic field. </p>
<p>These atoms are called “ferromagnetic”, and that’s the type of magnetism you’re talking about. Because all their atoms like lining up in the same direction, and they have unpaired electrons, they can create a magnetic field, and respond strongly to outside magnetic fields. </p>
<p>As for why certain metals like lining up one way vs the other, that’s some quantum stuff that’s way outside the scope of an ELI5. </p>
<p>By the way, I skipped over a bunch, cause again, this is a really complex topic, but that should be enough to give you an idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If enough atoms are pointed the same way, the effects of those electrons sum up to macro-level effects like magnetism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To Eli5, while this doesn’t cover all of it, metals form in crystalline structures, and there are a few different types.  Some types arrange the electrons so that they are magnetic and others don’t (they are all magnetic, just to greatly different degrees).  Also, most metals and metal alloys can be forced into different crystal structures by cooling slowly or rapidly.</p>
<p>Take steel for example.  Based on its heating and cooling method, and its atomic mixture, it can form various crystal structures.  This site has a good explanation and pictures.  <a href="https://www.outokumpu.com/expertise/2020/the-stainless-steel-family#:~:text=All%20steels%20are%20an%20alloy%20of%20iron%20and,a%20gamma-iron%20face-centered-cubic%20%28fcc%29%20lattice%20–%20forming%20austenite" target="_blank">https://www.outokumpu.com/expertise/2020/the-stainless-steel-family#:~:text=All%20steels%20are%20an%20alloy%20of%20iron%20and,a%20gamma-iron%20face-centered-cubic%20%28fcc%29%20lattice%20–%20forming%20austenite</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add on to everyone saying the atoms are pointing in the same direction, they're not really pointing, we just use arrows to indicate the direction of a magnetic field. In reality, magnetic fields are circular.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
