		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you take a sword and begin htting a rock you'll barely scratch it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>if you put a dripping faucet over a rock, given enough time, <a href="https://www.panorama.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Villa_Gregoriana_-_erosione_nel_calcare_1020860.jpg" target="_blank">it will go through the whole rock.</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Given enough time, even very small changes can build up.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The benefits of having your tartar removed overweight the few scratches you get from the metal since you do it once a year.</p>
<p>Using every day, 3 times a day, a toothpast with brushing granulates can erode your enamel in the long run. A toothpaste that degrade your teeth even if it takes 10 years is not a safe bet as a toothpaste.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a hardness scale known as Mohs hardness scale.  Things with a higher hardness will scratch things with a lower hardness.    </p>
<p>Tooth enamel has a hardness of 5, the same as glass.</p>
<p>Steel has a hardness of 4.5 so it won't scratch enamel, and pure calcium carbonate (the main abrasive in most toothpastes) has a hardness of about 4.  Unfortunately, small amounts of feldspar (hardness 6) and quartz (7) are also often present in mined calcium carbonate. This &quot;grit&quot; scratches your tooth enamel and can scuff it away. </p>
<p>Edit: A cloth won't rub the paint off your car.  But put a few grains of sand on that cloth, scrub away, and you will notice that the finish is scratched pretty quickly.    </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
