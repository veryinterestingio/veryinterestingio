		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a subject that has been researched in many different capacities, but has not resulted in a concrete answer. However, a culmination of these tests has lead to some theories.</p>
<p>A couple of commonly held beliefs that have lost a lot of support are that the laughter due to tickling is a learned response, and that laughter is a coping mechanism for distress. A study conducted all the way back in the 1940s by a psychologist named Clarence Leuba disproved the theory that laughter from tickling is a conditioned response by refraining from any laughter or tickling from him or his wife until his two babies were 6 months old. He then wore a mask so they would be unable to copy his facial expression, and tickled them without any outward signs of enjoyment. And, remarkably, both of the infants burst into laughter as we all do today. This study has been copied by other researchers and has widely garnered the same response.</p>
<p>The other common notion that the laughter is from a sign of distress hasn’t really held up in the world of psychological research for a lot of reasons, but to summarize it is essentially that enjoyment due to tickling is a behavior seen across many mammals, including primates and even cats. Without getting into all of the psychological specifics, the gist of the rationale is that different mammals have distinct reactions to distress, but a commonality they share is that they elicit an enjoyment from tickling. Therefore, it’s just unlikely that all mammals who show enjoyment from tickling are actually distressed, and all just so happen to elicit an enjoyment response rather than a typical distress response.</p>
<p>So, where does that bring us? Well, the theory that psychologist have seemed to land on is that it’s a sort of combination of enjoyment and defensive conditioning that we have evolved. Meaning, tickling causes us to “train” eachother to strengthen those protective reflexes we experience when someone attempts to tickle us. But the smiling and laughter as a response has evolved because it tells the person doing it, “I’m smiling, therefore I enjoy this, so keep doing it”. If humans and primates had a reflexive displeasurable reaction to tickling, it’s unlikely that people would continue to tickle them, which takes away the ability for them to “train” those protective reflexes. This theory seems fairly plausible, as it explains not only why we laugh at the often unpleasant feeling of being tickled, but also why we have a natural urge to want to tickle eachother.</p>
<p>Edit: I said the word “basically” like 5 times so I took a few out lol</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s no clear answer!</p>
<p>One of the theories is that tickling is a form of training to teach children their vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>It can be seen as a form of play that teaches humans where they are most vulnerable. If you notice the most common areas people are ticklish are the armpits, bottom of feet, stomach, ribs.</p>
<p>It causes laughter to encourage the behavior with pleasure as it activates both the somatosensory cortex (touch) and the anterior cingulate cortex (pleasure).</p>
<p>But it also activates the hypothalamus which is the center for fight or flight response, the same response for an enemy. This is part of the reason that tickling activity can be seen as “training”, to know your body’s limits and be hyper aware when attacked in those areas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Child feel pain and learn to protect themselves. And laugh.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was very ticklish as a child and probably still am. I say “probably” because as an adult, instead of laughter it elicits instant rage in me to the point of violence, which is saying something because I’m a pretty mild-mannered guy. I suspect I was scarred by childhood tickling sessions that bordered on abuse, rendering me helpless and under someone else’s control. Although I’m a professional writer, I cannot express how deeply and viscerally I hate to be tickled.
I probably ought to mention this to my therapist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
