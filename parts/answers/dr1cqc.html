		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A large amount of heat is quickly removed from the combustion chamber walls to prevent it from reaching a temperature that causes is to melt. At steady state conditions, the heat added to the walls is the same as the heat removed from the walls thus keeping it at a constant (safe!) temperature picked during design. As long as you can contuine to remove the energy added to the walls, you can sustain long duration burns without damage to the material.</p>
<p>The way this is done today is by using the (relatively) super cold propellant on its way to the combustion chamber to remove that heat, as others have mentioned. But there are other methods such as using a seperate coolant in a closed system (like a fridge) or film cooling which is like using a small cushion of &quot;cold&quot; air around the walls to protect it from the hot combustion products. Neither of these are as effective in space application because of the additional weight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, propulsion system designer here.</p>
<p>Ablative cooling
Regenerative cooling
Film cooling
Radiation cooling
Etc etc etc</p>
<p>Those are some good terms to start with.
Ablative uses a solid liner to release heat in vapours. </p>
<p>In regenerative cooling propellants are used to cool the chamber and heat the propellant. Thus increasing combustion efficiency and staying cool.</p>
<p>Film is like ablative and regenerative but using a liquid layer that is squeezed onto the walls of the chamber. They then evaporate taking latent heat energy with them.</p>
<p>Radiation is another method wherein heat is lost due to the emmisivity of the material. Some hard to find alloys are really good at this job and bearing the heat required. Entirely radiation cooled engines do exist such as in maneuvering thrusters.</p>
<p>For more information read rocket propulsion elements. Another good book is Huzal and Huang. Also space propulsion analysis and design</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So as others have said, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_cooling_(rocket)" target="_blank">regenerative cooling</a> is the main answer.</p>
<p>A great example of this is the Space Shuttle main engines, the incredible RS-25. If you look at a <a href="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-64a02dbf7ad04ea7e67c4040e83fada4.webp" target="_blank">close up photo</a> of the outside of an RS-25 it's made of hundreds of connected tubes that take the cryogenic oxygen and hydrogen and use the exhaust to heat them up (this acts then cools the engine bell making sure it doesn't melt. This has the added advantage of heating your propellant above cryogenic temperatures and ensuring they combine better within the combustion chamber)</p>
<p>However, there are also 3 other methods of cooling that are occasionally used, these are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation" target="_blank">ablative cooling</a>, film/curtain cooling and radiative (passive) cooling.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Ablative cooling, is the process of lining the inside of the exhaust chamber and engine bell with a material that sublimates when exposed to the high temperatures of a rocket exhaust. This is the same principle used in ablative heat shields, where the material that ablates away takes heat with it. This makes it much simpler and cheaper to build, however this can come at a cost to performance/efficiency. An excellent example of this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-68" target="_blank">RS-68</a> which is used on the Delta-IV and is a direct successor to the RS-25.</p>
<p>Film cooling is the process of having cooler exhaust products around the outside of the engine. This can be done by tweaking the fuel/oxidiser ratio around the outside of your <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/eande-plate-huge-exhibit.jpg" target="_blank">injector plate</a> usually to make it more fuel rich. This creates a boundary layer of <em>cooler</em> (relatively speaking) exhaust product that protects the engine from the hotter exhaust products in the middle.</p>
<p>Finally I've lumped radiative and passive cooling together (although I probably shouldn't have). For most radiative cooling it's about picking a material that can withstand very high temperatures and letting it get to those temperatures and radiate the heat as light. I put passive under this as it's similar, however, it's really just a matter of having the engine be a big enough heat sink that it won't melt before the engine is finished running. These are super simple and are primarily just used when testing rockets or for smaller scale hobby rockets.</p>
