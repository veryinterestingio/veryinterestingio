<p>That is the only difference and when cooking it doesn't matter which side is shiny.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>QI, the gameshow about smart stuff, did a bit about this. Turns out the different sides are a product of the manufacturing process, and is not functional. The shininess of the foil has no relation to the amount of heat/steam it traps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pretty good article here:</p>
<p><a href="https://culinarylore.com/food-science:aluminum-foil-shiny-side-up-or-down/" target="_blank"><a href="https://culinarylore.com/food-science:aluminum-foil-shiny-side-up-or-down/" target="_blank">https://culinarylore.com/food-science:aluminum-foil-shiny-side-up-or-down/</a></a></p>
<p>The tl/dr is that yes, the shiny side does technically reflect heat, but that only affects heat from radiation.  The VAST majority of heat when cooking in an oven is through convection (heat transferred through the air).  The energy difference that shiny versus non shiny is so negligible that it makes no real difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is one type of foil where there is a noticeable difference: <strong>Nonstick Aluminum Foil</strong>.</p>
<p>For this one type of foil, the dull side is the nonstick side. That is the side you want against the food. Note that the dull side of regular foil is NOT nonstick.</p>
<p>To make foil nonstick, a polymer coating made of a silicone resin, a silicone  release agent, a silicone curing agent, a hindered phenol antioxidant  and a solvent is sprayed on the dull side. It is partially cured to allow handling and future processing of the  coated aluminum foil. The foil is heated to fully cure the coating. This silicone coating can safely handle much higher temps than teflon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
