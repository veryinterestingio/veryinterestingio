		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I play a video game, no one tells me I have to. No one is expecting any results. There are no real life consequences when I fail or just decide not to.</p>
<p>When I work, it can be fun sometimes, but sometimes it isn't. I can't just say &quot;Nah fuck it, I don't like this level.&quot; and leave it. At work I have to perform, otherwise there might be bad consequences.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>games are like pure sugar for our reward centers. Real life accomplishments are always going to take more work and pay off slower. I'm wary of any system to &quot;gamify&quot; work, since I think quality work shouldn't be about immediate reward, it should be about dignified pay and the nom-rapid, long-term satisfaction of doing valued work within your community. When a job sucks, adding video game elements to work only distracts from these deficiencies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you read Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, he explains it well. Basically, it is finding the zone where something is difficult enough that you find it challenging, but not so difficult that you give up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>I never think about work as work. I think about the tasks I need to do, and look forward to accomplishing them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
