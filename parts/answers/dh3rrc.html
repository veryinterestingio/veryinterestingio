		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Large-scale design measures are needed to prevent flooding in big areas.  Sometimes natural disasters overwhelm the design measures — Houston floods on a pretty regular basis, and Louisiana has issues, despite major engineered systems that are supposed to help. </p>
<p>Tokyo has invested a lot in planning for typhoons — likely major pumping systems, drainage planning, and planning of land use. </p>
<p>Major engineering for things like that aren’t done as much in rural areas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Parts of New York City flood often when there is a  monthly high tide, or basically any storm,   so I would say they don't always avoid it well.</p>
<p><a href="https://ny.curbed.com/2017/10/12/16462790/queens-climate-change-jamaica-bay-flooding-photos" target="_blank"><a href="https://ny.curbed.com/2017/10/12/16462790/queens-climate-change-jamaica-bay-flooding-photos" target="_blank">https://ny.curbed.com/2017/10/12/16462790/queens-climate-change-jamaica-bay-flooding-photos</a></a> </p>
<p>It all comes down to infrastructure.  Most cities have some sort of drainage infrastructure in place for regular storm water,  and if a region habitually floods,  that structure is more likely to be built to accommodate large amounts of water.  Most non-city areas don't have the resources to build that infrastructure,  and can't always rely on natural water outlets to accommodate excess water in a way that doesn't cause issues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many don't. But those that do avoid it do so by having anti-flood systems. That is massive drainage systems feeding into tunnels or canals that move water away from street and housing areas and into places that can better handle the water. These systems also often involve pumps to move water from low lying areas into the channels or holding tanks for it. Tokyo has invested a lot into such a system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
