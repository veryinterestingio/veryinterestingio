		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Muscle cells (myocytes) have multiple nuclei. This is a unique adaptation of muscle cells, and each myonuclei has an area of the cell it controls, called a myonuclear domain. These domains are limited in size; if a muscle cell is to grow, it needs more myonuclei.</p>
<p>So imagine a muscle fibre with 10 nuclei. You work out, and using donated nuclei from satellite cells (a kind of stem cell) the fibre adds 3 more nuclei. Good job bro! You got 30% bigger!</p>
<p>Then you stop working out (we've all been there) and lose your muscle development. <em>However</em> those nuclei remain, so that muscle fibre already has the myonuclear apparatus it needs to regain dem gainz.</p>
<p>In order to grow beyond that requires more satellite cells to create more myonuclei, and is therefore a more biologically complex and demanding process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have effectively answered your question, but I'd like to add that once you get back to where you were when you stopped training, don't just stop. When it gets to the point where you're having trouble again, that's when you really have to push. You'll find yourself plateau off, and won't be able to get any more, and that's because you've regained what you lost. That was the easy part. Now you have to dig your heels in and start the hard work again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, when you work out you’re pushing your muscles until the cells are a little damaged. During your recovery, other cells will come in to repair this damage. They’ll make it bigger than it was before though, and therefor stronger. </p>
<p>Cells need something to control them though, so they have what’s called a nucleus that’s like a tiny cell brain. One nucleus can only control so much cell though. So as muscle cells continue to grow, they’ll eventually need more than one nucleus. So the cells responsible for repairing your muscles will often donate their own nucleus to the muscle cell. </p>
<p>Eventually if you stop working out the muscle cells will begin to shrink again, but they won’t lose the extra nuclei they’ve accumulated. Or at least not any time soon, they might go away eventually but not for a very long time. If you start working out again after that, your cells are already good to go. They’ve already got enough nuclei to support growing up to their previous size. So they’ll jump back with less work than it took the first time around. But after that, you’re building it back up the old fashioned way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body is like a high school and students are your muscles. During COVID when you stop your routine your students leave the campus gradually but their seats are still there. Once you get back in your routine it’s just a matter of a few hours of phone calls to get all the student back in.</p>
<p>But to get more student on top of the existing ones you need way more effort than calling them back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you develop muscles you develop specific parts (the name I can't recall at the moment) that help strengthen the muscle tissue. When you take a break from working out the muscle tissue is what goes away while those specific muscle parts stay. When coming back your body doesn't need to build that specific muscle part just strengthen the muscle tissue.</p>
<p>An example could be a plant that gives several harvest without actually dying off. When you grow a grape vine you have to wait for the entire thing to grow and then you can harvest it. Now that it's grown it just needs to produce the grape and not all the vines roots and leaves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
