		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe a bit late to answer, but I wanted to chime in with a different perspective: there is also a reason why <em>fruit</em> are rarely blue. It is because most fruit are acidic. I don’t know the exact biochemical link, but acidic things are more often redder and alkaline things are more often bluer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edited, because hoo boy did I get this wrong/backwards and wow I am so sorry folks. Don't answer science posts drunk, my friends!</p>
<p>For people who want the answer quick:</p>
<p><em>Red</em> was a later color to evolve in eyesight for a lot of animals, because most plants are green and brown, and dirt/dead stuff is also often brown. Because of that, when animals were camoflaging themselves, especially on land, they evolved to be brown, yellow, or red. Because the animals couldn't see red, that red looked brown. However, they could tell the difference between blue and green because it helped them pick apart their surroundings (ex. A tasty plant is a lot easier to find when it's not the same color as the rest of the ocean). So, an animal that looked too blue in green or brown surroundings would stick out and be eaten. </p>
<p>The late appearance of seeing red is likely because colors other than green aren't super common in plants. This is thanks to the most efficient kind of chlorophyll, green chlorophyll. Even though our sun makes more green light than other colors, the light that chlorophyll gets energy from are red and blue wavelengths! That's why plants are usually green, is because it's the wavelength they reflect. Lots of animals <em>can</em> see blue, like dogs and cats (and us!). Even cooler, lots of animals can see light that <em>we can't</em> and have colors on their bodies for that. For instance, butterflies can have UV markings on their wings!</p>
<p>Of course, there are some animals that are still blue. Usually this is because it was helpful for them to find mates. For reasons still puzzling, blue pigments didn't generally arise in animals, and possibly because of this, <em>green</em> pigments are also very rare. Many of the green animals you see are actually yellow pigmented, with special blue structures built in!</p>
<p>This is because (for some reason) it was easier to make blue by making the light shining on them reflect blue with these special structures on feathers, scales, or even in skin like with the poison dart frog, instead of with a pigment. Any time a new trait arises, evolution can find some really cool ways to build those DNA blueprints that you wouldn't expect. This is a very good example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I suppose it might be hard to manufacture the pigment for blue, many of the blues we see in nature are more due to their structure such as in bird feathers. Birds have lots of blues and there are a number of species which have blue feathers. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I believe it's not exactly rare in nature, but it is rare in mammals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a really interesting podcast about colour that I listened to a few years back. It talks about the colour blue, and how even in literature it doesn’t come up until a lot later than you’d imagine because maybe we just couldn’t see it before.</p>
