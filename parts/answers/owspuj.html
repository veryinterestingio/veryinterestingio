		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of tumours ARE surgically removed. But there's several big issues with that. </p>
<p>Surgery may leave small, microscopic pieces behind that could grow back.</p>
<p>Cancers spread, so a tumour may have already sent out metastatic cells to other parts of the body.</p>
<p>Most of your organs are necessary for you to live and there may be no way to remove a tumour without removing all or most of the organ.</p>
<p>Tumours may be in a surgically inaccessible area, ie the deep interior of the brain or on the brain stem, or inside the bone marrow (leukemia)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can, and it is done way more than you think. The most recent story I heard was from a new coworker who had 18 inches of his lower colon removed due to extensive prostate cancer. He's fine now. A lot of skin melanomas are just cut, frozen, or lasered off. Breast cancers are often cut out. The problem is they often return, or spread to other parts of your body, including your lymphatic system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can, but cancer cells can break off the tumor and spread throughout the body. Even if you cut out the main tumor, there may be cancer elsewhere and a new tumor will grow. This is why early detection is so important. You want to cut out the tumor before it spreads.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can. It's just often not the only form of treatment (was step 2/3 for me) </p>
<p>If you're lucky, they get all of it (negative margins). A positive margin indicates they couldn't get all of the cancer cells. </p>
<p>And they're getting better and better at it. My surgery was in 2019, surgeon said 30 years ago, they would have just taken my leg. So I'm thankful for the improvement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cutting out a tumor is something doctors can try to do but in only works in specific circumstances. Many types of tumors can communicate with the body and request blood vessels be built to them and consume resources meant for other organs. In addition, they grow virulently and can grow around critical blood vessels and organs making it essentially impossible to cut out the entire tumor without risking killing the patient. Sometimes the tumors can grow and kill off the cells that form the walls of organs complicating the removal process. If even a single cancerous cell is left behind and not destroyed by the body - it can grow back into another tumor, so it can carry many risks.</p>
<p>Lastly, the most dangerous types of cancer are tumors that actively spread freely throughout the body. Cells can break off and float throughout the body and embed themselves elsewhere growing new masses simultaneously everywhere in the body. At this stage the tumors are likely inoperable - the only way to fight them is chemically or via other means.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
