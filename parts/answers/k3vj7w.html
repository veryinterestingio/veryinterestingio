		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you ever see someone with one or both legs that look much larger than what you'd expect, often times discolored (red splotches or bruising), that's from blood pooling in their leg(s).  Wearing compression socks/stockings pulls everything in tighter which forces the areas that blood travels through to be smaller and therefor raise it's pressure and helps it return to the heart. </p>
<p>Said another way, if you compress your legs really tightly, blood can't pool down there. Think of it like filing a water balloon. If you try to fill a water balloon while squeezing it, eventually the water is going to come back out the top.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it this way, your heart does not <em>pull</em> blood up from your legs, it's only built to <em>push</em> blood into your arteries. Veins are passive returns to the heart, it relies on higher pressure in the atereies to push blood back through the veins to the heart. Muscle action and one-way valves in the veins are also important, but not super relevant here.</p>
<p>The idea of compression is that when the extremities are compressed, there's less volume for blood to hang around. Positive pressure from the arteries is enough to push blood back up the veins because there simply isn't anywhere else for the blood to go.</p>
<p>Without compression, blood can hang around. Especially if you're mostly sedentary, there just is not much happening to move the blood back up the veins, so it just pools.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Had surgery on my left foot last year, and infection set in and it was ugly and painful but finally healed. After that my foot ached for hours and nurse suggested a compression stocking. WOW, what a difference it made, and assume it prevents blood from settling there. They must work for others too, since easily found now in drug stores.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blood is pushed through your arteries by your heart. But because blood vessels are flexible that pressure dissipates over long distances. So your heart isnâ€™t pushing the blood as much in your veins. To help the venous blood get back to the heart they have one way valves that force the blood in the right direction when your muscles squeeze the veins during physical activity.</p>
<p>Compression limits the flexibility (expansion) of veins and increases how much they are squeezed to take advantage of the valves that force blood to move in the right direction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your veins need external pressure to make the blood flow, usually the muscles do the trick by tensing up and squeezing the veins, so compression wear adds more pressure to the veins making the blood flow. Blood can only flow in one direction inside the veins because of numerous valves inside them that only allow the blood to flow in the right way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
