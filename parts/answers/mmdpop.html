		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have to be careful when saying things like &quot;speed = energy&quot; and &quot;energy = heat&quot;; those aren't really true in general.</p>
<p>But anyway, if you assume a steady, adiabatic flow of ideal gas around the wings of the plane, we can say that c<em><em>p</em></em>T + v^(2)/2 is constant along any streamline.</p>
<p>c<em><em>p</em></em> is just the specific heat capacity of the air at constant pressure; you can just think of it as some constant that depends on the type of gas.</p>
<p>This says that the temperature along any streamline is maximized at points where the flow velocity is as small as possible. Particularly, somewhere on the leading edge of the wing, there will be a point where the flow is stationary. This is called the stagnation point. And the temperature at that point is maximal.</p>
<p>Taking realistic values for the heat capacity of air, the speed of a cruising airplane, and an ambient temperature of -40 degrees C, the stagnation temperature is just</p>
<p>T<em><em>0</em></em> = T + v^(2)/(2c<em><em>p</em></em>).</p>
<p>Or rearranged, T<em><em>0</em></em> - T is about 33 degrees C. The temperature at the stagnation point is 33 degrees C higher than the temperature of the ambient air.</p>
<p>So does being slammed into the wing cause the air in its vicinity to warm up pretty substantially? Yes. Can it still be very cold compared to everyday temperatures? Yes (in this case, it's -40 + 33 = -7 degrees C, still below freezing).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aerodynamic heating. In a nutshell, the air hitting blunt surfaces (leading edges) heats up in proportion to the true air speed. Essentially, anything below 400kts is not raising the leading edge temps enough to battle ice formation (above zero). Interesting fact, this is why icing isn’t typically a problem at high altitudes, because at those altitudes everything is generally going over 400kts tas. The reason for this all has to do with the shape of the wing. A thicker wing has more frontal area, which means more aerodynamic heating. A thicker wing also presents a larger bubble in front at speed, and ice droplets are led away from that leading edge. Sleeker, thinner wings allow all but a small frontal edge to remain at colder temps, so the icing potential is actually higher on thin wings. At least I think that’s right. There’s a great write up of it on the web somewhere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good question! The skin on a commercial jet at 30K feet is cold; the temperature is nominally -53˚C and the indicated airspeed is only in the range of 200-300 kts or so. IAS is the physical measure of the air molecules hitting the pitot tube, and relates to the same dynamic pressure as at sea level at the indicated airspeed. So, the heating effect isthe same as 250 kts at sea level - insignificant.</p>
<p>If the airplane is designed to cruise higher than 40K feet, and hence supersonic, the air temperature actually starts going back up and keeping the aircraft skin cool starts to become a real concern.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
