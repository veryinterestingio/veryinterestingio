<p>Instead, they say stuff like .. within the range of energies studied, we have seen no statistically significant evidence</p>
<p>Many theories have failed the test, but the most significant one is Supersymmetry, a theory that predicts that all known particles have a supersymmetric partner. The electron would have a partner called a selectron, the proton a partner called a sproton, etc. Supersymmetry is a key part of many theories beyond the Standard Model, including String Theory</p>
<p>So far, no evidence for Supersymmetric particles has been found, leading some theorists to believe that none exist</p>
<p>Others believe that a more powerful accelerator would find them</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To actually answer the question (ignoring the semantics): LHC was hoped to find some evidence of supersymmetry. and was pretty much designed to solve the hierarchy problem (along with one or two other things)<br />
Supersymmetry (or SUSY for short), is a theory that extends the standard model, by positing that each particle in the standard model has a partner particle, a superpartner (which all have ridiculous sounding names like photino and squarks, and gluinos). These partners would interact with the same 3 forces in the same ways, but would have higher mass than their standard (boring) partners. This was in an effort to explain why the Higgs is so light, since standard model interactions should make it very heavy. These partners should counteract the Higgs mass contributions, allowing for a light-Higgs to exist.   </p>
<p>The existence of these particles would also mean that at high energies the three (non-gravity) forces would have the same strength at high energies... a Grand Unified Theory, the dream.   </p>
<p>On top of that, SUSY would also unify Fermions and Bosons, as each particle with spin would have a partner particle with spin that differs by 1/2, so each boson would be accompanied by a fermion and vice versa.  </p>
<p>And if all that wasn't enough, predictions were that the lightest particle in SUSY would be stable and electrically neutral, and would interact weakly with the standard particles, which are the characteristics of Dark Matter.  </p>
<p>BUT the big damper on all this, is these particles should exist in the electroweak range, meaning that LHC should have been able to detect and measure them... and big surprise... it hasn't. The smallest superparticles should have been seen at the energies they have been measuring. This basically rules out almost all forms of SUSY and actually introduces a new problem (if we hold on to SUSY), which is to explain why the superpartners are so massive while the standard lads are so light.  </p>
<p>SUSY was elegant, and beautiful, it solved so many of our biggest problems in one fell swoop. All those hopes are now dashed against the calorimeters... annihilated. SUSY is pretty much dead for now, and the hierarchy problem is back in the world, terrorising children and being a general nuisance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It found many new particles. It even found new types of particles.</p>
<p>It found only one new <em>fundamental</em> particle: The Higgs boson is the only new particle that is not made out of other particles.</p>
<p>Protons and neutrons, the particles that make up all the atomic nuclei, are formed by three quarks each. There are many other particles made out of quarks. Before the LHC we only knew combinations of three quarks or three antiquarks (called baryons and antibaryons, respectively) and combinations of one quark and one antiquark (called mesons). It was expected that there are also combinations of two quarks and two antiquarks (tetraquarks), and combinations of four quarks and one antiquark (pentaquarks. Can also be four antiquarks and one quark), but nothing conclusive was found back then. The LHC experiments changed that. They (well, one of them: LHCb) found clear evidence of tetraquarks and pentaquarks. Studying them tells us much more about the strong interaction that forms all these things.</p>
<hr />
<p>The non-discovery of something can be interesting as well. Various physicists hoped to find supersymmetric particles early with the LHC. Didn't happen. Either supersymmetric particles must be heavier (quite possible) or they don't exist. Similar for many other ideas - a lot of theories have been ruled out, or at least ruled out in some range of their possible parameters. That helps theorists - they can stop working on something that has been ruled out and focus on something different.</p>
<hr />
<p>Particle physics is not just collecting particles. It is also studying the properties of these particles as good as possible. So far nearly everything is in great agreement with the predictions of the Standard Model. That rules out more alternative theories (see above).</p>
<p>There is a curious set of several related measurements that all show some disagreement from predictions. Taken on its own each measurement could easily be a statistical fluctuation, but all these measurements show deviations in the same direction and statistical fluctuations in all of them together are very unlikely. We'll need more precise measurements to figure out if this is real (that would be amazing) or just a weird random occurrence that doesn't repeat with more data.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
