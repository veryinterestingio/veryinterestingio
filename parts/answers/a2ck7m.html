<p>up to 90% of our serotonin is produced by gut bacteria, so the state of our microbiome obviously plays an integral role in our general state of being and our behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our gut produces serotonin naturally (enterochromaffin cells), even without bacteria. The function of this serotonin is only to stimulate peristalsis (smooth muscle contraction) to move bolus along the digestive tract. It does not affect our behavior. Serotonin cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, therefore it cannot affect our brain.</p>

<p>I recalled that microevolution is observable, people deny macroevolution for lack of contemporary observability,</p>

<p>My understanding from reading <a href="https://www.icr.org/" target="_blank">The Institute for Creation Research</a> is that creationists fall into two camps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Those who acknowledge microevolution, but consider it &quot;devolution&quot;. In other words, genetic mutations can only reduce the fitness of an organism, or produce disease. It cannot functionally improve an organism.</p>
</li>
<li>Those who deny microevolution. They claim that antibiotic-resistant bacteria have always existed (which is probably <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/presspacs/2013/acs-presspac-march-6-2013/resurrection-of-3-billion-year-old-antibiotic-resistance-proteins.html" target="_blank">true</a>), and is only becoming more common lately because we are killing the non-resistant bacteria, thus opening up the habitat for resistant bacteria to proliferate.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The term microevolution come from creationist thinking in order to explain the variance we see while keeping the genesis story intact.  Most scientists will just use the term evolution because there is no difference in mechanism between &quot;micro&quot; and &quot;macro&quot; evolution.  Only scale. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have observed microevolution in a variety of contexts, including in the gut of various animals (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2664199/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2664199/</a>). This depends on a lot of different factors but diet, availability, etc. are partial driving influences. But this may be a difficult argument to use with people that don't believe in evolution because there is no &quot;large&quot; change. That is, that a bacteria permanently adapts it's enzymatic processes for the type of resources that are available is a bit of an abstract idea that some people might not understand or think is relevant.</p>
<p>I like using Darwin's finches as an observable example. They are very similar birds that have very different beaks. Some to break shells and nuts, some to dig and burrow, some for insects. It's easy to see and to interpret.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
