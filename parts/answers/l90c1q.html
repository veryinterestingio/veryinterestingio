		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oxygen for both industrial and medical purposes is usually made in a cryogenic plant - literally by freezing it out of the air, and then separating it from the nitrogen. (Air is approximately 21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen, and 1% argon, with a few traces of other things).</p>
<p>The difference between medical oxygen and industrial oxygen only comes down to handling procedures. Medical oxygen cylinders are traced with extensive paperwork to prove the gas analysis, and when filled, are usually pulled to vacuum, flushed with oxygen at low pressure, pulled to vacuum again and then filled to service pressure. Industrial cylinders may have only one or no vacuum steps before filling, and are not monitored as closely for traces of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, etc. They are both filled from the same bulk (liquid) oxygen storage at the gas supplier though.</p>
<p>As far as water content, bottled gases are extremely dry by design. Medical oxygen will have a maximum permissible moisture content, which is extremely low, and so-called aviators grade oxygen is even drier still. This is so that it doesn't cause valve freeze up under extremely cold high altitude conditions. In medical delivery systems, the gas is usually humidified prior to being breathed, so that it doesn't dry out mucous membranes and cause irritation. The humidification equipment probably explains the water demand in your anecdote, but of course this is accomplished after the dry gas leaves the bottle through its valve and pressure reducing regulator.</p>
<p>There are also oxygen generator systems which do not rely on stored oxygen at high pressure, but rather which filter air at low pressure through a semi-permeable membrane in order to increase the oxygen fraction of the inhaled air. Same idea though. The supplemental oxygen should be humidified for extended use.</p>
<p>Separating water into hydrogen and oxygen is called electrolysis, and is a very energy intensive process. I am unaware of any medical oxygen delivery devices which use this process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Portable oxygen concentrators typically used at home use nitrogen adsorption. There are certain materials that nitrogen sticks better to than oxygen, such as zeolite 13X. Air inside a sealed box with zeolite would lose much of its nitrogen content. Since air is 70% nitrogen and 20% oxygen, removing nitrogen effectively increases the oxygen concentration. The high oxygen air is then pumped out of the box and compressed. The box is now at low vacuum, causing the nitrogen to unstick from the zeolite. The waste nitrogen is flushed away with fresh air and the cycle starts again.</p>
<p>Small scale oxygen &quot;generators&quot; work in the opposite way, with an oxygen adsorber in place of a nitrogen adsorber. In this case the desorbed oxygen is the product and the high nitrogen air is the waste. Higher oxygen concentrations can be achieved this way.</p>
<p>Larger scale/high purity oxygen generation uses the cryogenic method mentioned elsewhere in this thread.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nope. That separation, while possible, is fairly energy-consuming. So we don't do it that way (although we could if we wanted to).</p>
<p>Instead, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_separation" target="_blank">we get it from the air</a>. We cool down air steadily until the gases that make it up start to turn into liquids, and we collect those liquids as they condense out. They condense at different temperatures, so this gets you very close to pure nitrogen and oxygen if you collect them one by one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oxygen is made by Air Separation.<br />
To separate air, you compress it a ton, cool it off a ton, and put it through a distillation column where nitrogen, argon, and oxygen separates at different heights in the column because of the difference in boiling points.<br />
It takes a LOT of power to run these plants, but they produce liquid nitrogen, oxygen, and argon.  All of which are very important for industry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
