		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cause of teeth not being straight is very often an issue of <em>crowding</em>.  Baby teeth don't have this problem largely because the body is growing and those teeth are getting proportionally smaller.  The adult teeth fit tight and into a space that is full sized, never gonna get bigger and youre gonna have more of them..  So...as they crowd, they hit teeth next to them and they've got to go <em>somewhere</em>, and that somewhere is all wonky.</p>

The baby teeth had lots of room to come in, but look how crowded that mouth would be when the adult teeth started pushing their way in.</p>
<p>It was like that for my daughter. They actually pulled a number of her teeth when she was pretty young, and moved the others around, to make room for others so they'd come in straight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have to imagine it's because our teeth were &quot;designed&quot; for a jaw of a certain width.</p>
<p>There's been research done saying that your jaw gets wider if you eat harder food in your young years. Basically, the food you eat while very young shapes your face. Wider jaw = no teeth crowding. Baby teeth come in before any of that can happen and evolution says they better come in straight or you die. By the time your permanent teeth come in, chewing harder foods should have allowed your jaw to widen sufficiently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So when we're born, all our bones have these creases or lines in them called growth plates. We make bone at these growth plates as we grow. When we're fully grown, the plates 'fuse' closed.</p>
<p>In the jaw, the growth plates run right through the middle of each bone. Our jaws don't just grow to the right size. They react to us chewing, and use that to know how much to grow. Back before agriculture, we were eating harsher, more fibre-ey plants that required more chewing. Ever tried wild rice compared to basmati? 'Wild rice' is still domesticated. Rewind even further, and there was rice that was even <em>tougher</em> to chew.</p>
<p>So, if we chew tough things as kids, our jaws get pushed apart a little, and they grow wider. Now that we chew less tough things, our jaws are growing less wide. At birth, our Jaws are the same sort of size that our genetics expects them to be. But as adults, they're often smaller.</p>
<p>A secondary effect is that in today's world, people are having kids with people from increasingly different genetic backgrounds. This is really great for our immune systems actually. But for our jaws, it means you can have teeth inherited from a parent with a wide jaw, but an actual jawbone inherited from a parent with a small jaw. (it's not quite as simple as that, but that's kinda the gist).</p>
<p>But the chewing thing is the main reason.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dentist who only sees pediatric patients here. First of all, there are plenty of kids with crooked/crowded baby teeth. You are correct that there are more crooked adult teeth. The baby teeth are ideally spaced out (at least the anterior or front teeth) because they are smaller teeth than adult ones. The extra space allows for the wider adult teeth to eventually erupt into the mouth.
If the front baby teeth have no spacing between them (not necessarily crooked) that will almost certainly result in crooked/overlapped adult teeth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
