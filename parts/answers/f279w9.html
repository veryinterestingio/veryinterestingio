The air trapped between the glass and the film adds a layer of insulation between the cold glass and the interior of the home. It's the reason we use double and triple pane glass with a layer of air (usually filled with an inert gas though) between the panes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You've already had some good answers about air being a good insulator and it's the layer of air not the plastic that provides the insulation.  However, there's another reason why it keeps the room warmer.</p>
<p>As well as providing insulation, the wrap also seals the window.  You tape it around the outside of the frame, so any draughts through e.g. the edges of the opening parts of the window that would normally jet cold air into the room are stopped.</p>
<p>I live in a house with old leadlight windows (small panes of glass a couple of inches across all held together with strips of lead).  My windows let in wind and rain not only around the frames but actually through the glass at the numerous damaged spots in the lead.  Every window I wrap the windows and when the wind blows you can see (and hear) the wrap &quot;breathing&quot; as it bulges in an out with each gust of wind.</p>
<p>In my extreme case the main benefit is the sealing effect.  Normally it's the insulation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Insulation usually works but trapping air between the two things you are insulating against each other. Air doesn’t transfer heat very well compared to more solid things. </p>
<p>So, the plastic wrap works because it traps a layer of air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every answer I've seen so far says something along the lines of 'there is air and it is a good insulator'. While this is correct, it's more about the small gap between the film and the glass than the choice of air.  Whilst the use of air effectively prevents conductive heat transfer, the small enclosed gap is important as it greatly reduces the effects of convection, which is the dominant mode of heat transfer through air. Air can hardly be called a good insulator on it's own, ideally we would put a vacuum in the small gap so that convection and conduction are zero.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s not really the wrap that is insulating. The plastic holds a pocket of air between your window and the outside. If your house is slightly positive pressure this pocket of air is a similar temperature to the inside conditions and prevents the cold air from infiltrating. Essentially the plastic holds a pocket of air that acts as a buffer and that is what prevents the cold/hot from getting in the house.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
