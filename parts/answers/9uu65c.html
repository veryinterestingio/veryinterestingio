		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few ways.  The easiest way is if the race is never in question.  If every poll shows one candidate leads 80% to 20%, and that is the same result from the last three elections, just call it.  It's over.</p>
<p>In closer races, they know who votes for which candidates and historically when people vote.  Some districts may go R early, then D late, or vice versa.  If one candidate falls behind when their voters are supposed to be showing up, you can call it for the other candidate as soon as their voters look like they are showing up.</p>
<p>They also do exit polls, just hanging around outside polling places and ask people who they voted for.</p>
<p>None of these are perfect, and there have been some embarrassing early calls through the years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5 why is it even necessary to call it before all the votes are counted?  Is it just news outlets racing to the headline?  Would the world be so drastically different if we just counted all the votes and said who won tomorrow?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In very specific cases, like one candidate with an overwhelming majority in early polls, news networks are more able to lean on exit polling.  Sanders was projected to win around 2/3's of the vote, which is a very big win for a three-way race.  So as long as exit polls are coming within a few percent of that number, it's very safe to call that particular race early, because as long as a good sampling of exit polls are conducted, it's incredibly unlikely that the forecast would be wrong by that huge an amount.</p>
<p>For a closer district, where polls were putting candidates, say, 55-45 or less, news outlets are going to be far more conservative, and wait until they see a handful of vote totals come in and confirm that they match with their expectations and polls.  This will especially be the case when waiting for results from more volatile districts that have flipped in recent years, or when polls don't match their historical trends.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
