		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked at a refinery. And we did use hot exhaust from the refining process to fire a steam plant that powered a <del>10KW</del> 10MW co-generation plant that mostly powered the refinery with a small amount of sell-back to the power company.<br />
But that hot exhaust was a continuous part of the ongoing process, not temporary like a flare would be.<br />
As you may know, refineries are just big giant chemistry sets.<br />
One process feeds another process feeds another process and so on.<br />
If some part of the process fails, bad stuff can happen, vessels get over filled, or over pressurized, or under filled and under pressurized, or flammable and poisonous product gets spilled. The hard part about this is : a refinery + co-generation can't just start up and shut down with the push of a button. It takes days, sometimes weeks to do a proper start-up and days to do a shut down.<br />
So, what you have, for safety and efficiency, are those emergency flare stacks at various points in the process so that in the event of an &quot;upset&quot; in the process, the production flow has somewhere to go wile the process is either being fixed or shut down.<br />
The burn-off is so the material does not collect anywhere and form an explosive air/gas mixture.<br />
You can tell if a plant process is &quot;upset&quot; if you see flares when you drive by.<br />
It means something aint right up in there.<br />
Flares are supposed to be temporary in nature so there is no economic benefit to build co-generation for them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s difficult to capture that heat and often the cost of the process equipment to recapture the heat exceeds the value of the benefit. Waste products being flared are generally not very clean and the heat exchangers to capture the waste heat don’t last very long without fouling or becoming a maintenance hog. Additionally, open flares are frequently used as a way to remove off spec product from a continuous process where the upstream process has a lot of inertia and can’t simply be turned off or safely stopped on a whim. An enclosed flare that can recapture heat is a different type of equipment that requires additional complexity (and risk) for combustion air control. This tends to make them unsuitable for use as a process relief. Too much or too little air can result in horribly poor combustion, equipment damage or explosion. An open flare can be ignited immediately and burned continuously where an enclosed flare that could recapture heat needs time to prove a safe combustion environment or has to shut down if any of the additional air control equipment fails. That can take several minutes to start up and is prone to shutdown unexpectedly. Often the upstream process doesn’t have several minutes to wait during an off-spec event or can’t safely tolerate a sudden shutdown of an enclosed flare. In reality these types of plants do already have a number of other points where they do recapture process heat (economizers) that you don’t see from the outside. Sadly the most visible part of the process is also necessary but most wasteful.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most modern refineries already use flare gas compressors to win back their base load flaring. This way, you don't have a flame in a normal operating scenario. The compressed gas will then be reused. Only in case of an emergency, you depressurize to the flare, and then you can see a flame. Because of this intermittancy, and the fact that you only use the flare in emergencies, it won't be useful to win back that heat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These dates, all modern heat producing factories/refineries utilize a heat recovery system. It can be used for district heating, electric generation or whatever else needs is there. However it requires certain factors to be feasible for install and combustion system have flares for emergency/maintenance situations. </p>
