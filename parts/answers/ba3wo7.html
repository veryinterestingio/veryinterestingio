		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So i actually do this for a living, and the other comments have partially correct info but not the whole story. Firstly, nerve agents are not the only threat, they do however have alot of notoriety. There are other things to also consider such as blister, blood, and choking agents and biological agents (like anthrax) to consider as well.</p>
<p>A gask mask is meant to stop these from entering your body via inhalation, however there are many different agents that can seep through your skin or light clothing, and thats where other methods of protection come in such as JSLIST suits or level A/B suits that you often see in movies but since your question was about the masks, we will start with those. </p>
<p>What they do in most cases is filter your air through filters (sometimes only one) while providing an air tight seal around your face to prevent chem/bio agents from being inhaled. They cannot however filter our Volitile Organic Compounds (VOCs) such as carbon monoxide as these particles are often similar in size to oxygen and are therefore still deadly. In such conpromised environments, what is usually then used is a level A/B suit with an oxygen supply to prevent you from being exposed to the hazardous agents/VOCs.</p>
<p>As to your question about modifications, gas mask technology evolves to meet new threats, and usually the only &quot;improvements&quot; revolve around filter technology, materials used in the mask itself, or the shape/usage of the mask as it affects combat readiness.</p>
<p>Edit: also, nerve agents hadnt been invented yet so naturally they would not have been used in testing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>CBRN trained.  There is no difference between any gas mask used by armed forces.  There are filters that differ in effectiveness, but The Armed Forces use only a filter that will filter all known agents.  There would not be a situation where a lesser filter would be used as it would not be mission effective.  Gas masks do not supply oxygen, so if an agent is used that is heavier than air, to say it pushes the air, oxygen, out of the area, the troops would have to evacuate or die...No oxygen to breathe.  As stated previously, nerve gas is not a gas.  It is droplets/mist and would either be inhaled through mouth or nose or absorbed through an individual's eyes, skin or mucus membranes.<br />
The CBRN mask and suit work together to protect an individual as a system, along with Decon agents and anti agents.<br />
These systems and procedures are always evolving.  The best scenario is where you do not have to use the mask or suit, or at the very least have it on before contamination occurs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well nerve gases are not actually gases, they are liquids with boiling point over 150Â°C so they hardly become gas. The point of gasmask isthat it covers your face so you dont come into contact with the compound.
It CAN be dissolved in suitable solvent but even then its delivered as an aerosol not gas. </p>
<p>Iirc from class, gas mask mostly have common activated charcoal or zeolite type filters with high surface area that traps the gas. There CAN be some additives to improve selectivity towards some specific gases but they are likely quite specific. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As it turned out, both the Germans and (after the war) the Allies found that the standard gas masks that were designed to protect against WWI gases also worked against the nerve gases, so no modifications to the masks were necessary. If Germany had used nerve gas during the war, the big problem would have been that the existing Allied gas detection tests would not find it and it does not have a strong smell, so it could surprise soldiers before they could put on masks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On May 15, 194, to chemists at the CWS Development Laboratory, Captain Robert D. Coombs III and First Lieutenant Charles W. Sauer, began a study of Tabun, which was completed three and a half month later. The two men puridied and analyzed the German nerve agent and found that standard Allied respirators provided complete protection against it. They also assessed the ability of existing U.S., British, and German indicator papers and detector tubes to recognize the new agent. Although mustard gas detectors worked for liquid Tabun, they could not reliable detect the cloud of fine droplets and vapor released by the explosion of a chemical shell. Thus, until an automatic vapor detector could be developed, U.S. troops would have to don gas masks at the beginning of a heavy artillery bombardment and wear them for long periods, impairing their fighting ability.</p>
