		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people are born with the capacity for empathy and some natural inclination to be empathetic. After all, it’s evolutionarily advantageous for a community to care about one another’s survival</p>
<p>Fun fact: Some historians credit the printing press during the French Revolution with spreading empathy in a new, more visceral way</p>
<p>For the first time, novels could be mass printed and read by more people, offering intimate accounts from perspectives they would’ve otherwise never considered</p>
<p>Specifically, there was a book written from the perspective of a servant girl. Wealthy men wrote that they were reading it and sobbing and couldn’t BELIEVE the plight this servant girl went through. It was the first time they’d been able to step inside someone else’s shoes in such a vivid and visceral way</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>”Empathy” is a complex phenomenon of perception, cognition, emotional and cultural response etc. I think there is a general consensus that while children are born with capacity for complex emotional states, environment affects how/whether these are experienced, developed and expressed. Like language, social behaviours, etc, children develop full emotional capacity through interaction with their surroundings, micro and macro social systems etc, so yes, it can be developed, if you’re not suffering from some other forms of pathology...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Becoming empathetic is a normal stage of development, normally at around three years old. Children can be tested using a story with dolls and props to see if they can understand things from another's point of view.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
