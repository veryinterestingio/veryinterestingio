If a tardigrade, or mad space bacteria, can survive a ship going from the vacuum of space to re-entering earth's atmosphere at enormous heat and then being barracked by the thick earth asmosphere ,then there's nothing that can reasonably be done. It's considered sufficiently unlikely to not be a realistic concern.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spacecraft reentry is significantly harder to survive than just &quot;living in space.&quot;</p>
<p>Organisms are usually good at surviving one type of environment very well. Going from the &quot;very cold vacuum of space&quot; to the &quot;very hot and very high pressure entry&quot; is extremely difficult for any organism. Impossible for most. </p>
<p>For things that aren't exposed to reentry conditions, they are autoclaved (high pressure, high temperature, for lots of time.) Nothing we know can survive that. </p>
<p>In case you haven't noticed, we ONLY know of life that exists on earth, and if we can kill everything we KNOW of, then that's generally considered &quot;good enough.&quot;</p>
<p>Furthermore, the organisms that we do know of that can survive conditions like that (for shorter periods of time) aren't dangerous to humans so we don't care.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to what others have said,  Even if &quot;something&quot; survives the odds of it being able to live and thrive here on Earth are pretty small.  Most living creatures we know of require a lot of additional amino acids, proteins and other various biological compounds to be available to them, and tolerate many others that they don't need.</p>
<p>An organism from another planet would likely require different ones that don't exist here, and possibly be poisoned by much of what IS here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
