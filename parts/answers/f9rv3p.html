		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sound waves get bent and/or reflected when they hit a boundary between materials of different densities. The ultrasound wand and the human body are of a similar density, both much higher than air, so the ultrasound struggles to get through the air gap between the wand and your body. The gel fills the air gap and is the same density as the body, so the ultrasound can pass through without getting bounced around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Try putting a straw in a glass of water.  It looks funny, doesn't it?  Like the straw is broken at the surface of the water.  That's because light travels differently through water than through air.  When it goes from one to the other, it gets bent.</p>
<p>Sound works sort of the same way, and if the sound had to go through the air, then through the tummy, the picture would get all messed up, like if you took a picture of the straw in the glass.</p>
<p>The gel is similar to your body, so by using the gel the sound doesn't go probe-&gt;air-&gt;body, it just goes probe-&gt;body, and you get a pretty picture!  Try filling the glass all the way with water, so the straw is completely underwater.  It doesn't look broken anymore.  It's kinda the same thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know when you are in a swimming pool with your friend and he makes noise underwater you hear him super loud if you are underwater too? It's because water transmit sound really well. So well that whales use it to sing to each other and it will work even at hundreds of kilometers apart.</p>
<p>You know also it's hard to see him when he is underwater but you watch from above, because the surface is hard to see through, it moves and reflect the sun. But if you go underwater with a mask it's super easy.</p>
<p>Ultrasound is sound that is so high pitch it is really precise (you can see with echolocation) but also really fragile (a piece of paper stop it).</p>
<p>Ultrasound had the problem that if there is air between the device and the skin then the sound will enter the air, get cushioned a little bit (so you lose some of the power), then bump into the skin and reflect (like at the surface of The water). So you get a really good image of the skin... But not great of what is below.</p>
<p>If you add gel you avoid the cushioning (gel transmit sound as good as water) and the device is &quot;under water&quot; and does not see the reflection.</p>
<p>The gel has to be the same indice of refraction (for ultrasound) as human flesh. Then it's as if the device was &quot;inside&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
