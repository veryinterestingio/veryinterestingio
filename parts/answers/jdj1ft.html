		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Frankly a lot of times salt is the answer. Use it liberally if you want your food to taste good. Also, just because you're using their bottled dressing doesn't mean it's actually the same thing they use in house. They might, for instance, be making essentially the same dressing fresh everyday or every week. There are also often preparation techniques that can take a dish to the next level. Like with a salad, we used to mix the croutons in the dressing to get them drenched before mixing the rest of the salad, which would give the croutons a muuuch better texture.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simple answer:  Our produce is probably fresher.  In my area, the produce I get for my restaurant will last weeks in my walk in.  Produce I have to purchase between delivery last days at most.  </p>
<p>We get a 3 lb. bag of baby spinach at our local warehouse store every three to four weeks to use at home.  Produce from grocery stores might last a week.  </p>
<p>Commerical produce is significantly fresher!</p>
<p>And get your lettuce as dry as possible. </p>
<p>If you tell me exactly what your salad is missing,  I might be able to give you a suggestion or two.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone with ~15 years in the restaurant industry, I'm going to disagree with all of these answers. In most cases, our produce is <em>not</em> better than what you could find at a Whole Foods or even a regular grocery store, and the techniques we use to make salads are no different than what you would use at home. Using a fancy commercial gizmo to annihilate heads of iceberg lettuce does not make that lettuce taste better.</p>
<p>The best answer I've heard for this question that (in my opinion) seems reasonable is that our sense of smell ruins our homemade meals to a certain extent. Essentially, as we prepare a meal, we become familiar with and desensitized to the odors of the component items, and by extension, the final product. We just get used to it, and it removes some of the magic. When you drive by a barbecue place, the smell is amazing, right? It smells SO good - it might make you salivate. I promise you that someone who has been working at that same barbecue joint for awhile does not have the same reaction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the lettuce. Restaurants pre-prep lettuce they wash some or get pre-washed. And then they chop it. They send a whole heads of iceberg through a manual device that just chops it into squares. Then they put them in large trays and they put them in the fridge again. The lettuce is then chilled awaiting a salad order. The refrigerator also dries any excess moisture from the lettuce washing. The salad is made very quickly and brought to you equally as quickly. Oftentimes on a chilled plate. There is no wilting from heat or the dressing so you have crisp crunchy lettuce and fresh toppings.</p>
<p>next time you make a salad at home think about how long that lettuce is sitting on your counter how dry you get the leaves after washing and how long it sits with the dressing on it before everyone sits down to eat.</p>
<p>Or try this experiment go to your fridge and take a bite out of your lettuce. Right out of your fridge it's crisp and refreshing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
