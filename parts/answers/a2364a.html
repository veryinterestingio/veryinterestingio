		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rabies causes, amongst other things &quot;hydrophobia&quot; which counter to what its name suggests isn't a literal fear of water but more an inability to swallow effectively.  Many patients when afflicted by rabies experience laryngospasm, pharyngeal or diaphramatic spasms.  The end result is the inability to effectively swallow even your own saliva leading to drooling, spitting, and as it progresses and you become increasingly dehydrated and decreasingly lucid, foam starts to form in your now thick saliva as you attempt to spit.</p>

<p>Some people can foam at the mouth during a generalized tonic clonic (aka grand mal or convulsive) seizure because their mouth closes during the seizure which stimulates the salivary glands to produce additional saliva. When the mouth opens again, that extra saliva mixes with air coming in and produces foam. The convulsive component of this seizure can contribute to the production. </p>
<p>It should be noted that many people do not foam at the mouth during GTC seizures, and there are many seizure types that are not tonic clonic (such as absence), and do not have the potential to cause foaming at the mouth. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>
<p>People with rabies can't swallow because the nerves responsible for swallowing are paralized.</p>
</li>
<li>Rabies causes hypersalivation. This evolved so the virus is more easily spread to a new host by biting or salivating onto a wound etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>More saliva in the mouth / pharynx and breathing generates foam. Also the patients will spit the saliva out as they cannot swallow it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
