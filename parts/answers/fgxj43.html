<p>As a rule of thumb, the camera should not be fixed with regard to the vehicle, else it feel &quot;stuck&quot;.</p>
<p>Something what works well is to point the camera towards the point the car will be in a second. When on the road you assume the player will follow the road, but when outside the road it's harder. You assume the car will continue turning and moving at the speed it is moving. That's why the camera is more annoying when the car just stopped, it does not know in which direction you are going to go next.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most chase cameras actually work as if they were attached to a spring. Imagine a camera that can rotate a little (always keeping the area in from if the car in view) that’s attached to a moderately stiff spring that’s attached to the car. </p>
<p>You can change various properties to change how the chase cam looks:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>the angle of the spring (how high above the car the camera sits)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the stiffness of the spring (too stiff looks jerky, too loose looks too floppy)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the length of the spring (how far from the car the camera is)</p>
</li>
<li>the angle, focal point, and rotation speed of the camera (slow camera rotation with floppy spring means you will likely lose vision of the area in front of the car during a sharper turns)</li>
</ol>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>lots of trial and error. bad camera angles make some games nearly unplayable. say the camera adjusts to quickly, making it jump in a disorienting fashion during sequential turns. other games take that as an example of what not to do, and limit how quickly the camera can turn. then it turns out that makes it impossible to see where you're going after a hard u-turn, so they have to adjust it again. until they find a good balance</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually you use the vehicle's velocity vector to derive the follow position and look-at rotation from. Add to that an offset depending on longitudinal speed, and G-force effects to make jumps and bumps look impactful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am developing racing game.</p>
<p>To add what other guys have said. It's complex, but here is start solution. First you need to choose relative target point and rotation of camera. For example: you want camera to be 10m behind car, 3m above ground (or car to be more precise) and to point toward car and road ahead (that's camera rotation). As car moves, target point moves. Camera itself has max acceleration and max speed, when trying to reach target. So camera is chasing target point, and since it has max acceleration, which acts as inertia, you get smoothing effect, no  shaking.
