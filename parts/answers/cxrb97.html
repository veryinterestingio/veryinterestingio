		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's actually little evidence to support the ergot poisoning theory, or if it was involved, it only played a part. The more likely answer has to do with psychological or religious contagion; the dancing plagues broke out during times of economic and social stress, and there seems to always have been a prior plague that provided a precedent for the next one. If you're starving and on the verge of a psychotic break anyway, when it finally happens, you act out in a way that you've heard of other people acting out before. It's not a conscious choice or feigned behavior, it's just that even distressed actions are the result of societal and religious conditioning steeped into your subconscious mind. </p>
<p>We don't have dancing plagues anymore because they fell out of &quot;fashion,&quot; as crude as that sounds; shifting religious and cultural trends meant that the idea of dancing manias became less prevalent in people's minds. So, even when the same social and economic stresses happened that spurred dancing plagues in the past, people instead coped with it in different ways. If it was just ergot poisoning, we'd see dancing plagues happen spontaneously even today, or in areas without any history of dancing plagues; we don't, because it takes that precedent in a community's collective memory for an entire group to act out in that specific way.</p>
<p>My main source is John Waller's A Time to Dance, A Time to Die. It's an excellent book, covering the psychological and historical side more than any chemical or medical explanation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mass hysteria seems to be the best explanation we have so far, and we do see cases of mass hysteria but often to a less ‘sensational’ scale than the dancing or meowing nuns. Thats likely due to societal changes, and certain behaviours (like dancing) becoming much more socially acceptable. Religious rule is one way of enforcing a social contract and conformity. Similarly, if the people in that group are so used to conforming and one engages in a salient behaviour it can influence others to do so, hence the dancing nuns. </p>
<p>There was a recent-ish case of mass hysteria (2006) in Portugal, the ‘Strawberries with Sugar Virus’, in which hundreds of school children developed ‘symptoms’ of a virus seen on a TV show. A few seemed to have legitimate allergies, but there was no concrete explanation for the others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The podcast called 'the dollop' has an episode on what was called the mad Gasser. This episode briefly covers earlier dancing like plagues such as nuns who all meowed, and nuns who would bite people and it spread throughout the country side. They cover a type of mass hysteria where people would smell gas and get sick. </p>
<p>In the 1940s a family reported smelling gas and getting physically sick. This was the start of a modern 'dancing' sickness. </p>
<p>Throughout the United states, people began to report gas attacks. They all had similar reports. A sweet smelling odor, feelings of discomfort, nausea, dizziness, etc.
Many of the &quot;victims&quot; reported seeing someone running.away or finding women's high heel prints outside of their homes. </p>
<p>This led to people creating vigilante mobs and police to be on the look out for a person shooting gas into people's homes. </p>
<p>The cases escalated and people were calling in doctors and medical professionals to examine them as they started to report cases of paralysis, vomiting, numbness. However everyone recovered very quickly and seemed to have no long lasting effects. </p>
<p>Upon police investigation, there was zero evidence found of any Intruders, assailants, etc. </p>
<p>It was more or less all chalked up to mass hysteria with a couple exceptions, one of which had a faulty coal stove in their home.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have any research for the first question, but there was a recent study which showed that mass shootings appear to occur in clusters and are contagious. There's a window during which at-risk individuals seem to be triggered by exposure to media coverage of a mass shooting and pick up on the meme to do it themselves. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0117259" target="_blank">Here's the article</a></p>
<p>I can't find the citation at the moment, but I also heard on NPR a few years ago about an outbreak of teen suicides in New Zealand where at-risk individuals would rest their heads in a loop tied around their doorknobs as a signal of distress, much like cutting. Because it's low to the ground it doesn't appear lethal but many people died from this. The lethality led to additional attention for the practice and the study I can't find suggested that it was also contagious.</p>
<p>So, there are likely memes that spread today like the Dancing Plagues, which can lead to serious negative consequences when at-risk individuals are looking for a solution to distress.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
