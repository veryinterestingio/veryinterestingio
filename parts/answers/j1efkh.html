		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The speed gets very close to the speed of light quickly, so what we usually talk about is the energy. The rest energy of a proton is 0.94 GeV.</p>
<p>Protons start in a linear accelerator. The old one gave them an energy of 0.05 GeV, the new one (starting 2021) will give them an energy of 0.15 GeV. From there they go to the first circular accelerator.</p>
<p>Circular accelerators use magnetic fields to keep the particles going in a circle. The higher the energy the stronger the magnetic field must be. The maximal strength of the magnets limits the energy - that's why we need larger accelerators to reach higher energies. Larger rings means smaller curvature, which means you can have a higher energy with the same magnet strength.</p>
<p>The first circular accelerator is the small Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB). It accepts protons at an energy of 0.05-0.15 GeV in a state where its magnets are weak, then accelerates them to 1.4 GeV and ramps up its magnets in parallel. The acceleration is done with electric fields. This must always stay synchronized. If the magnets are too weak the protons hit the outer wall, if they are too strong the protons hit the inner wall. As the energy is quite low the magnets don't need to be strong and can be ramped up/down quickly, this step takes less than a second. After it reaches its maximal energy a small &quot;kicker&quot; magnet changes the proton trajectory to direct them to the next larger accelerator, the Proton Synchrotron (PS), where the same thing is done just on a larger scale. The Proton Synchrotron accelerates the protons to an energy of 25 GeV. Its magnets are stronger, they take a bit over a second to ramp up. Same thing again for the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS): 450 GeV, acceleration takes a few seconds because of the magnets. From there they are sent to the LHC (I'll come to that later).</p>
<p>If you look up the cycle times of these accelerators you'll get different values. The LHC uses packets (&quot;bunches&quot;) of protons separated by about 8 meters each. That means the LHC with its 27 km circumference can hold nearly 3000 of them per direction - but the much smaller preaccelerators cannot. The PSB needs to be filled twice to fill the PS, the PS needs to be filled 3-4 times to fill the SPS, and the SPS needs to be filled 24 times to fill the LHC. In addition the SPS is a key accelerator for other purposes, too - it's delivering protons to many experiments, not just the LHC. While each step just takes seconds at most there are many of these steps, so the LHC &quot;waits&quot; at its lowest magnet strength (for 450 GeV) for about 20-30 minutes while it gets filled. Similarly, the SPS &quot;waits&quot; at its lowest magnet strength for many seconds while it gets filled, and so on.</p>
<p>Once both LHC rings are filled, its magnets ramp up. The LHC is by far the largest accelerator and it has by far the strongest magnetic fields. To make the power consumption acceptable it uses superconducting magnets. To keep their magnetic field you only need to cool them. As downside it takes longer to ramp up their magnetic field strength, about 20 minutes. Again the limit is purely coming from the magnets. It would be possible to accelerate the protons in less than a second, but there is no way the magnets could keep up.</p>
<p>Once the protons reached their maximum energy, the operators prepare them for collisions (another 20 minutes or so), and then the experiments get collisions for many hours before the beams are dumped, the magnets are ramped down and the LHC prepares for the next fill. The length is variable - often something goes wrong eventually and the beams are dumped for safety. If nothing goes wrong the beams are dumped manually after ~10-20 hours because the collision rate got too low and it's more efficient to refill.</p>
<hr />
<p>There are a couple of reasons why the LHC needs preaccelerators, and I'm sure an accelerator expert can give a full lecture about this, but here are some points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Magnet precision. The beam pipe has a diameter of the order of a centimeter but a radius of kilometers. If the magnets are just 0.001% too strong or too weak (relative to their expected strength) your beam gets lost. The LHC magnets ramp up from ~6% to 100%. The SPS magnets ramp up from ~6% to 100. And so on. This is a range you can control nicely. If you would try to inject to the LHC directly the LHC magnets would need to start at 0.0007% - with a relative deviation of less than 1 part in 100,000.</li>
<li>Beam optics. Particles don't fly at exactly the design path, they always deviate a bit from that. You need to make sure these deviations don't grow over time or you will lose your beam quickly. Generally this is only possible in some reasonable energy range. A factor 20 in energy is possible, a factor 100,000 doesn't work.</li>
<li>Bunch shaping. The preaccelerators actually do more than just accelerating. They also take the bunches from the linear accelerator, first merge some and then split them to make bunches for the LHC with the right number of protons per bunch, the right length of the bunches and the right distance between the bunches. This is called Batch Compression Merging and Splitting (BCMS).</li>
<li>And last but not least: Reuse. With the current setup the linear accelerators and the smaller accelerators can be used for all CERN experiments. You don't need to build a dedicated linear accelerator for each experiment.</li>
</ul>
