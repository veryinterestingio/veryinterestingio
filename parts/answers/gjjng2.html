		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://mbio.asm.org/content/5/1/e00898-13.full" target="_blank">tobacco ringspot virus</a>—an RNA virus infecting many different kinds of plants—has <a href="https://mbio.asm.org/content/5/1/e00898-13.full" target="_blank">jumped from the plant kingdom to the animal kingdom</a>, infecting the European honeybee. <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-27485-5_1" target="_blank">Various genera of rhabdoviruses are able to infect vertebrates, invertebrates, or plants</a>, implying that both cross-kingdom and cross-phylum jumps have occurred within this virus family. Both groups are RNA viruses that—in their plant-infecting forms—use animals to spread from one plant to another...I imagine (but have no evidence) that this combination helped facilitate the jump between kingdoms.</p>
<p>Edit: I just remembered...there was also one documented case of <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/46/12267" target="_blank">plant-to-fungus virus transmission</a>, where the cucumber ringspot virus was found to infect <em>Rhizoctonia solani</em>, a fungus that causes cucumber belly rot. The linked paper shows that the virus can actually  move back and forth from plant to fungus to plant, making it a single multi-Kingdom virus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bunyaviridae group can infect Arthropoda, vertebrates and plants.</p>
<p>Coronaviruses can infect both birds and mammals</p>
<p>Bird flu between birds and at least humans</p>
<p>It’s thought some rhinoviruses (common cold) jumped from birds to humans</p>
<p>While close, HIV came from a mutant strain of SIV (monkey aids) and became highly specialised in Human biology</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This was covered fairly recently in David Quammen’s book <em>The Tangled Tree</em> which follows scientists Carl Woese and Lynn Margulis among others in their discovery of Horizontal Gene Transfer, or HGT. Basically what Woese discovered is that there’s actually three domains, not two. And viruses have moved between them, throughout history. Many of our ancient ancestors caught viruses that not only remained in their bodies throughout their lives, but were also passed on to their offspring. And when I say ancestors I mean way, <em>way</em> back, millions or even billions of years. And those viruses have jumped between species and our ancestors so much over the years that roughly 8% of our DNA is viral in origin.</p>
<p>I’ll find some links when I’m not on mobile.</p>

<p>Now, this is not a universally accepted theory, and there <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5422933/" target="_blank">have been papers</a> that apparently disprove certain claims.</p>
<p>Edit #2: Yes it's Carl Woese, sorry...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, routinely!</p>
<p>The Orthomyxoviridae (of which influenzavirus is a member) infects salmonids, ticks, mosquitos, mammals, amphibians, etc.</p>
<p>Influenza-B to give one simple example, infects humans, seals and mustelids.</p>
<p>Single strand RNA (ssRNA) viruses tend to be specific to just a few species, but they do not care how closely related those species are. As far as a virus is concerned, all eukaryotes are the same family!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yeah tons of them. The big type is arboviruses, meaning viruses that infect insects. The whole class of flaviviruses, which includes yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, Zika, west nile, etc, are all (almost all? not 100% sure) arboviruses. For example the reservoir for West Nile is birds, it infects mosquitos that feed on infected birds, and can be transmitted to humans, other mammals, reptiles, and amphibians.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
