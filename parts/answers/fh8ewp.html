		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You've described exactly what we refer to as the &quot;Hubble constant&quot;, H_0.  Typically instead of your &quot;one meter reference separation&quot;, we are talking about the distance to a (distant) galaxy.  And instead of saying &quot;how much further per hour&quot; we ask &quot;how fast does it appear to move away from us&quot;.  That's just like putting your eyeball at one end of your &quot;meter&quot; and asking how fast the other end appears to be moving away.</p>
<p>The current value of the Hubble constant is about 70km/s/MPc.  That is, if a galaxy is 1 Megaparsec away, it appears to be moving about 70km/sec away from us.  What's really happening is that space is expanding so that 70 km is added to the distance between us every second.</p>
<p>I have to say, the Hubble constant in those units is useful for astronomers (because galaxies are MPc to GPc away, and you can measure their apparent velocities in km/s), but it's a horrible unit otherwise.</p>
<p>To answer your &quot;1 meter&quot; question, we just need to convert&quot;(km/s)/MPc&quot; to &quot;(meters/s)/meter&quot;.  1 Megaparsec is 3 x 10^(22) meters, so we find</p>
<p>H_0 = 70 (km/s)/MPc= 70 x 10^(3) m/s / (3 x 10^(22) m) = 2.3 x 10^(-18) (m/s)/m</p>
<p>You asked how much it expands in an hour, which is 3600 seconds, so we have</p>
<p>delta_L = L * time * H_0 = 1meter * 3600 s * 2.3 x 10^(-18) = 8 x 10^(-15) m</p>
<p>For reference, a proton has a diameter of about 10^(-15) meters.</p>
<p>Space is vast, the universe is old, and those little bits add up.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>**** Note:  objects, such as meter-sticks, bound by atomic forces, do not expand as the universe does so.  Neither do gravitationally bound objects such as the Sun, the Earth, the Solar System, or the Milky Way.  Only in the vast empty reaches of space can we think about this &quot;one meter reference separation&quot; posited by OP.</p>
<p>Edit:  Wow, many thanks to those of you who gave so much positive feedback, and so much bling!  I'm happy so many of you found this interesting and helpful.  This is a great community, and thanks to the mods for making work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everything not bound by a force is growing about ~7% per Gy per unit length. AKA, for any given length, the measured distance in 1 billion years would be about 7% longer.</p>
<p>So in 1 hour it would change the length of a meter ~ 3.1963 x 10^-15 meters.  This is about the charge diameter of a proton.</p>
<p>For a 1000 kilometer distance, it changes about 1 nanometer per hour because of inflation.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reciprocal of H0 is known as the Hubble time. The Hubble constant can also be interpreted as the relative rate of expansion. In this form H0 = 7%/Gyr, meaning that at the current rate of expansion it takes a billion years for an unbound structure to grow by 7%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edit to add the practical affect of this.</p>
<p>Lets say we left earth right now to a 10 billion light year distant galaxy at 99.999999... of the speed of light. By the time we reached where that star would have been... the star would be about 9.67 billion MORE lightyears then where it was when you started your journey(because the 7% is compounding with time traveled). It would take an additional 9.67 billion years to reach it, in which time it will have moved another 9ish billion light years... and the cycle repeats.  You would eventually reach it at some insanely distant point in the future.</p>
<p>For anything beyond 13.6 billion light years(or more) distant, you could never even hope to catch up with it because its already moving faster then light away from us, which is our hubble horizon.   Because the universe is already about 90 billion light years in diameter... the overwhelming vast majority of the universe is already out of reach to us and that accessible volume is shrinking every hour.</p>
<p>The Hubble horizon is about 4.1 giga parsecs, compared to the universe at ~ 30 giga parsecs. Doing the math for the volumes, We can see that only about 0.25% of the universe is possible to interact with. (288.7 Gp3 / 113000 Gp3 )</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The universe is estimated to be  8.8Ã—10\^26 metres across, that's (880,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 metres). That means one meter is 0.00000000000000000000000088 percent of the diameter of the universe. It means it will expand at that percentage of the universe. The universe expands at  72 kilometers per second per megaparsec and there are 28.5 gigaparsecs in the universe, total universal expansion is thus 202,500 kilometers per second.  202,500*0.00000000000000000000000088%=1.8057*10\^-21 expansion. Thus one meter expands in total length as a measure of universal diameter (rather than as a fixed measure) at 0.0000000000000000000018057 meters per second. This is approximately 100,000,000,000,000 Planck lengths per second or roughly 1.6*10\^-9 picometers/second. To reach one  picometer of expansion would take 50 years, and it'd take 50,000,000,000,000 years to expand to one meter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was pondering a similar question myself the other day. So from the comments ive read so far im trying to wrap my head around the nature of this expansion, first question is does the total area or &quot;volume&quot; of the actual space that makes up the universe expand? Or is it more like the universe is growing greater in size but the actual sum total content remains the same? In my mind im thinking like how  a weather balloon going up into space or a balloon underwater will be small but as it rises to the surface the balloon gets larger as pressure decreases even tho the total sum of whats inside the balloon remains the same? Or should i be thinking of the universes expansion in a different context? And second, from what i read in the comments matter and  physical objects do not increase in size or volume despite the space they occupy becoming greater, is this correct? What effect does this have on forces like gravity and radiation do they remain uneffected. And last question, being that time is interwoven with space, is time changing along with the universes expansion, do effects like time dilation near large gravitational bodies that condense the fabric of space/time change or like jow time slows when accelerating closer towards the speed of light? (Sorry if this is a bit much maybe i should have posted a brand new thread?) This stuff is really fascinating to me but its just hard to kinda integrate all of these abstract ideas together so tangible examples of things to compare the phenomenon to are quite helpful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
