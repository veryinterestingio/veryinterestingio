		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An imperfect match will still elicit imperfect antibodies.  Imperfect antibodies simply bind and neutralize the virus less effectively than perfect ones, but they still do it.  Thus the intensity and duration of your flu will be less, since your body will still have a head start on fighting it off compared to having no anti-flu antibodies.  A perfect match is no guarantee of total protection either by the way.  It still gives your body the best head start possible, but if you happen to get a particularly huge dose of virus at initial infection, the virus could still outrun your immune response.</p>
<p>This is why it is important to get your flu shot every single year, even if it isnâ€™t perfectly effective every year.  Each year you get a flu shot acts like a booster for every year in the future in which you may be exposed to flu.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's actually a very cool effect where either getting infected with flu or getting vaccinated boosts your antibody response to all previous strains of flu you've encountered (by getting flu or by being vaccinated). In recent years WHO have begun to shift towards using antigenically advanced vaccines, whereby they predict how currently circulating strains of flu will evolve and artificially create vaccines for the flu strain they think will be circulating in 6 months time, as even if the virus doesn't mutate to a new strain, the antibody backboost means you still get protection against most circulating strains. Check out this paper (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4246172/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4246172/</a>) if you want a more detailed explanation, but basically the vaccine can boost your antibody response to a fairly wide range of influenza virus strains  (this is at least true for type A H3N2 influenza, there are 4 different types of influenza in the annual vaccine)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simplifying for the sake of summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>your immune system works by recognising proteins that are illness-causing and marshalling defences against them.</li>
<li>For germs, this mostly means recognising the outer layer of proteins forming the cell wall it presents to the outside world (and its array of interfacing items mounted on that cell wall that let the germ interact with things).</li>
<li>Most germs mutate their outer layer slowly, so once your immune system recognises it you have a good immune response until your body stops making those detector cells (a process that is out of scope for the current question)</li>
<li>Flu viruses mutate their outer layer a LOT, which is why the vaccine each year is new. However, it takes months of concentrated effort to make the vaccine, and the flu MUTATES IN THAT TIME.</li>
<li>The vaccine makers therefore need to forecast what the makeup of the main flu strains this year will be.  If they are perfect, then we get a very good vaccine.  If they are wrong, it is not by a huge amount; the vaccine is still targeting something similar enough to this year's actual flu strain that your body will fight the infection faster and more effectively than it otherwise would have done</li>
<li>Because the imperfectly vaccinated body responds faster to the initial infection, the peak viral load and severity of infection will be lower, ie. &quot;if you do get the flu it won't be as bad&quot;.  It just isn't quite as good as a perfect vaccine where your immune response is so good you don't even notice the [tiny] infection you get.  </li>
</ul>
<p>PS. Clarification:-- vaccination &amp; disease is not binary:  without a vaccine some people people will successfully fight off the flu (ie. no symptoms of infection after exposure) ; with an imperfect vaccine more people will fight off the flu  (and if they do get ill, have milder infections than they would have done), and with a perfect vaccine we maximise the fraction of people who successfully fight it &amp; minimise the symptoms of those who don't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The flu mutates, but for type A influenza mostly what mutates are two proteins on the surface.  We call those H and N, and are designated by numbers, so H1N1 has type 1 of H and type 1 of N.  H5N1 has the same N protein, but a different H.  So if you get the H1N1 vaccine, but then contract H5N1, the antibodies will still react somewhat to the N protein and at least give you a partial reaction.  Even if you get a completely different strain, like H2N3 (just random numbers, I don't know if that's an active strain), the proteins may be similar enough that you could get some protection anyway.  Not complete coverage, but it may offer enough to blunt the impact until your own immune system can produce the exact antibodies.</p>
<p>Flu shots every year cover about 4 different strains (2 type A, and 2 type B, which are a separate species with different proteins).  This is due to logistics, the vaccines must be cultivated over time and there's only enough time in a year to get about 4 done in time for flu season.  So they have to make an educated guess on which 4 will be the most prevalent.  If they wind up mutating past that, or if a different strains comes from an unexpected geographic location, they won't be as effective but still can provide some immunity if they have similar proteins</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As stated above, an imperfect antibody is better than none.</p>
<p>I will add that your immune system is is own evolutionary function, in which antibody-producing cells will introduce mutations in the recognition sequence of the gene as they replicate. Those variants that are, inadvertantly, a better match will be stimulated to proliferate more than those with a less perfect match, evolving better antibodies was the infection proceeds.</p>
<p>So with the headstart brought by an immunization, your body will have a chance to develop a better defense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
