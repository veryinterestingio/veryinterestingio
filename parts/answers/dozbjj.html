		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What I think you are asking is, “How many molecules do you need to tell whether the particles are locked together, attracted to one another but able to move/rotate/swing around each other, or zipping past each other with hardly any attraction?” If you are defining state in these terms, then you’d have a good idea how other molecules might interact even if you only had 2 molecules to observe. In the real world, even in lab conditions, you are probably never going to work with so few molecules of anything. </p>
<p>There’s a lot more to consider in your question. Temperature and pressure (which together determine state) are only emergent phenomena - measures of average kinetic energy and momentum (sort of) - that make no sense when describing individual particles. There are also a slew of forces to consider (Electrostatic, gravity (insanely weak), London dispersion, dipole-dipole, hydrogen bonding, etc.), molecular shape (especially for long chains), and other factors that impact observed state.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can answer this for solids: the answer is that it depends on your material. The bulk properties of most materials are very dependent on defects. If I take a copper atom or a unit cell of copper, I have no defects. No dislocations, interstitials, grains or anything. The mechanical and electrical properties of copper are very dependent on these defects, with lots of effort put into processing the material to control them. I won't experimentally see the same value for any sort of mechanical property with a unit cell and I'll have much higher conductivity on the small scale. </p>
<p>This is actually one of the main points of nanoscience. I can take little pieces of a material and due to the fact that the nature of the defects is very different (and some later discovered quantum/optical properties of the material) I get different properties and can use the same atoms or molecules for different things. Often times you find a size where the properties will resemble the bulk material,  and that's when you can really define it as a piece of said material. For example, graphene is a 2D material that's essentially single layers of graphite, its Carbon atoms in a &quot;honeycomb&quot; lattice (array) and it's a huge subject in modern research. There are different ways to fabricate graphene but complete perfection is very difficult. Thus, you commonly get multiple layers on a surface. It has been experimentally determined that at approximately 4 atomic layers, the properties of graphene will pretty much resemble graphite again. Now the reasoning for all of it has to do with complicated molecular vibrations, but you really just observe that the property you're looking for shifts back to normal at a given size and go from there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to play devils advocate here, with something like water, is a certain number of molecules here even necessary?  Can’t you evaluate temperature and pressure and know what state it is in based on that? Or does that not work because of properties like latent heat of fusion and latent heat of vaporization?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
