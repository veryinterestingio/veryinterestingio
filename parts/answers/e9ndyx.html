If you wash away all the oil and water in/on your skin, it will be dry.  Your body will re-cover the area with oils, but oil doesn’t replenish the water (just protects from evap).</p>
<p>Use moisturizer immediately after washing and stay hydrated to combat dry skin.  </p>
<p>Personal opinion: you don’t have to use intense soaps/scrubs every day unless you have a specific medical condition you’re dealing with.  Washing face with your usual body wash (usually much less harsh than soaps or deep cleansing face washes) is enough for daily routine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I used to have a pretty wicked case of the issue you are describing.</p>
<p>I found that a sensitive face wash without any type of salicylic acid to be best (burt’s bees foaming cleanser works great for me)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simple answer is that oil is not water.  </p>
<p>Oil can help hold water in your skin but if you use too strong of a cleanser on your face you can strip away the protective oils, allowing water deeper in your skin to evaporate away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
