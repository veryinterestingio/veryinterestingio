		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because &quot;live&quot; albums are not always recorded live. </p>
<p>Take the album &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot;. Talking Heads assembled a touring band, rearranged their songs for that band, and performed in front of live audiences with that band. Then, they went into a studio and recorded the touring arrangements, adding just a little audio from the live performances. You get the feel of a live performance, but the quality of a studio recording.</p>
<p>As a counter example, take the album &quot;Joe Jackson Live 1980/86&quot;. This album was actually recorded at live shows, and frankly it shows - the sound quality is much worse than Joe Jackson's studio albums from the same period. It's not bad - he knew he was recording and made an effort - but not as good as his studio efforts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of it is survivorship bias. Live albums &quot;in the past&quot; often sound better because you're only listening to the good live albums, the shitty ones falling to the wayside. Meanwhile contemporary live albums don't have enough history yet to separate the &quot;classics&quot; from the crap. For every &quot;Frampton Comes Alive&quot; and &quot;Get Yer Ya Ya's Out&quot; there's a dozen &quot;The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl&quot; and &quot;Got Live If You Want It&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have touched on important factors, like obviously you'll have better quality on a planned live production where each instrument is captured individually and then mixed in a studio vs a single microphone in the back of the room, but it's also noticeable in 3rd party recordings (known as bootlegs back in the day, but ubiquitous now).</p>
<p>All the way through the 90s recording a concert to listen to or distribute later took a bit more planning (Though as tape recorders got smaller it became easier). Due to this many of the bootleg recorders actually had a background in doing it and lots of sly techniques like splicing lines leading to the soundboard or an idea of how to best possition microphones to get the best sound. If it still exists in nearly as much popularity I'm not aware, but the bootleging culture used to be fairly large to the point they developed their own albumn covers for the recording which were sold. (Most of the current popularity of this practice still revolves around trading/collecting older music as far as I'm aware). These were dedicated people who understood and appreciated audio. </p>
<p>These days most live recording not commercially produced are simply done with a cell phone, the practice of smuggling in professional recording equipment is not nearly as popular. These recordings first have to worry about compression from being recorded digitally, the relatively low quality microphones, and bad positioning (How many videos of live songs have you seen where they were recorded near an obnoxiously loud fan for example). This isn't to say there are no modern high quality fan recordings, just it's a lot less common. </p>
<p>A guy I work with has been big into bootleg recordings since the 70s and has created some of his own. Some of the stories he has involved a lot more effort than bringing in a cell phone.</p>
<p>Tldr; fan recordings used to be harder to create so those willing to go through the trouble put more effort into ensuring they captured the sound as well as possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>3 years of live sound engineering experience here.</p>
<p>There’s lots of different variables that go into “recording” a live album. To answer the best I can, I would need to hear two specific examples, one from 60/70/80s, one from now. </p>
<p>What I can say is that, the louder a show is live the worse a true live recording is. This is because of two reasons: 1, mic bleed: imagine your kids screaming in the background of a conference call you’re on at work. Same concept. Drums are looouudd! You can typically hear them through every mic on stage. Guessing here; With the better mics of today those bleeding sounds could be clearer. 2, the louder the show is the worse it will sound at lower volumes or different venues/spaces. This is thanks to the mixing the sound guy has to do to keep these blaring sounds in check. I’m pretty young, so I’ve never been to a concert from the 60/70/80s, but I can assume the technology didn’t allow people to take it to crazy high volumes  without hurting. If you’re talking about live shows posted without any remixing, a show that was originally quieter will sound significantly better at “home volume”</p>
<p>The band I work with doesn’t do any live recordings, and we have a different studio guy, so I’m definitely not 100% here. Making a series of educated guesses. </p>
<p>Taking a comment the top redditor said, it is half-true. Anything re-recorded after the show WILL end up sounding better than the original; that doesn’t contribute to the poorness of a poor-sounding modern live recording. Especially vocals, it is very easy to get it “live sounding”.  </p>
