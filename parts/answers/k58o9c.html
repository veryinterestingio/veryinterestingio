		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>you get an adrenaline rush, adrenaline makes your body go into fight or flight mode.
it pulls blood to more important places. you become cold in your hands and feet where it narrows arteries. your glucose processing goes into overdrive to create more energy for the muscles. adrenaline also makes your sweat glands go into overdrive. makes your face become red from the extra blood, makes it very hard to sleep and makes it very hard to eat because blood has been pulled away from your digestion.
afterwards you get to have a nice low blood sugar crash.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget that sweating is the body's way of cooling itself down. Water is pushed onto the skin's surface where it can evaporate, taking some of the body's heat as it moves from the skin to the air. Your body can sometimes tell the skin to produce sweat even if it's already at a good temperature. If too much sweat is produced, you will feel cold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
