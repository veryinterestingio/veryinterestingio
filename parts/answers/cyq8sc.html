		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone#/media/File:Hurricane-en.svg" target="_blank">What goes up must come down</a>. Anything in weather is about a balance, and so as the cyclone produces violent upward motion in the form of thunderstorms, sinking motion has to happen somewhere else. Some air is dissipated outwardly at the highest altitudes but some of this sinking air approaches the center of the storm and through compression warms which usually means drying; this produces the clear and usually calm conditions it's so well known for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>No matter how fast the air is swirling around, there must be a point somewhere where it is stationary, and it is in the middle.</p>
<p>It's a little more complicated than that, since the storm is actually 3D, so in the eye the air may be moving up and down as well, for a more simplified view, just look at the horizontal wind vectors, and you can see that no matter what, there's going to be a place in the middle where the air is not going anywhere, as long as we're talking about a circular airflow like a hurricane or tornado.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it spins.  I was actually in the eye of a hurricane once.  For about 20 minutes the day went from dark and non-stop rain and wind, to a bright sunny day.  After 20 minutes or so it was back to a shit storm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I thought this question was more along the lines of why do we call it an eye... Upon review I have learned I am wrong. Also to ELI5 it is the middle part that the rest of the storm is spinning around, like the axel on a car.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This is obviously an over simplification, but on a two dimensional scale, it's about that simple.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
