		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because of cities.</p>
<p>If a population is large enough, the influx of new susceptible individuals can keep up with the epidemic loss of susceptible to immunity and death. (In the case of measles, it's mainly immunity, which is close to life-long following infection. However, in the first half of the 20th century and earlier measles mortality was far higher than it is today, for reasons not well understood, so death contributed as well.)</p>
<p>Give the rate of transmission of a disease, you can calculate the size of a connected population needed to sustain the disease. In the case of measles, it works out to around 250,000 to 500,000 people in contact with each other (<a href="https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2307/2342553" target="_blank">Measles Periodicity and Community Size</a>). </p>
<p>Communities of that size are only a few thousand years old, but then measles is probably not much more than a thousand or so years old -- it jumped into humans, probably from cattle, somewhere around 1000-2000 years ago (<a href="https://virologyj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1743-422X-7-52" target="_blank">Origin of measles virus: divergence from rinderpest virus between the 11th and 12th centuries</a>). </p>
<p>Obviously, the &quot;connected&quot; part of the equation is important, and when measles was prevalent (pre-vaccination) what happened was intermittent enormous very fast epidemics, every few years, with intervals in between of very low infection. During those periods the virus shouldered in cities (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4938089/" target="_blank">Periodicity, synchronization and persistence in pre-vaccination measles</a>), and then once the number of susceptible victims built up enough, the disease spread out like waves from the cities (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/414716a" target="_blank">Travelling waves and spatial hierarchies in measles epidemics</a>).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If (1-immunity rate) * r0 &lt; 1, a disease will die out. So if r0 = 5, a greater than 80% immunity rate is required; r0 = 10, 90%. </p>
<p>But r0 is not some fixed constant of nature; it's an average that can vary according to behaviors, like hygiene and mask-wearing, and conditions, like outdoors in the sun vs indoors in a hospital or a crowd. </p>
<p>If a virus is more deadly, it tends to isolate those affected, thereby reducing its r0; hence there is selection pressure to decrease the severity of symptoms. That can be negated if there's social pressure to crowd or discard PPE despite symptoms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>R0 means how many people one individual will spread &quot;on average&quot;. That average is actually not the same for all environments and all populations. For smaller population densities or cultures who dont share food or interact as much the R0 can be significantly lower.</p>
<p>Some places see less travel and a highly infectious disease wont necessarily reach those places if a plane comes only once a month for example.</p>
<p>So measles can jump from local populatuon to local population for enternity. </p>
<p>Also how antibodies work. You will produce large amounts of antibodies for recent infections but overtime that diminishes and you can be reinfected maybe a few years later. Or the antibodies can be out of date and newer variants require different antibodies. So measles can jump from population A to B and in the next few years jump back to A for a second round. This can go on for eternity as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>I've seen speculation floating around the internet that we will get to herd immunity faster with delta variant</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would need more context. The internet is a poor source of information, so maybe there's some truth to what the person meant, but we are not going to reach herd immunity thanks to delta simply because that would mean too many people dieing. We will reach herd immunity thanks to vaccines.</p>
<p>One important point to remember, the higher the R0, the higher the percentage of immune people needed to reach herd immunity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>why didn't we develop enough herd immunity naturally for measles to simply burn itself out</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But to answer your question, in pure theory, absent of human intervention, a contagious disease in a large enough pool won't &quot;burn itself out&quot;, it will reach a &quot;steady state&quot; (a large pool here means people who are constantly in contact with each other, so obviously small pool sizes were possible before modern cities and travel). To eradicate the disease the herd immunity threshold needs to be exceeded but the disease on its own will not do that. So the number of people getting infected neither grows nor shrinks but remains endemic over time. That's what happened with measles.</p>
<p>Measles was always there since ~1000, but not like 'Spanish flu' because people with immunities were always there too. But when indigenous populations first came into contact with measles perhaps 70% of them died from it. Those outbreaks &quot;burned themselves out&quot; too in the way I think you mean (a large outbreak followed by seemingly nothing), but only because the remaining small local population now had herd immunity, but globally the disease was still present. The number of deaths per year of a novel outbreak might go down after that initial spike, but will remain constant over time. This is what happened with plague and the black death.</p>
<p>It requires active intervention of humans to actually eradicate a contagious disease, passive herd immunity doesn't do it of its own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A pathogen's ability to reproduce (measured by its reproductive number) doesn't necessarily have anything to do with how lethal it is, how long it takes symptoms to develop, or if the human immune system can fight it effectively. All of these are factors in whether or not a pathogen will &quot;burn out&quot; in a population, but reproductive number by itself is not enough to tell us whether something will &quot;burn out&quot; in a population.</p>
<p>If the pathogen is not lethal for most of the population, there is no (read: limited) selection pressure for less lethal strains. However, if a pathogen is extremely lethal, there will be selection pressure for less lethal strains that can circulate (read: survive and reproduce) for longer.</p>
<p>If a pathogen is not easily &quot;learned&quot; by the human immune system, then an individual may never achieve &quot;immunity&quot; from that pathogen. In this circumstance, herd immunity could never happen, and the pathogen will continue to circulate amongst hosts.</p>
<p>Measles doesn't burn out in human populations because it isn't really that lethal to adults. So it can circulate from adult to adult, and then kill a random infant who catches the disease.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
