<p>There isn't any clear &quot;surface&quot; to the Sun, either. We often define the surface to be the photosphere, the place at which the optical depth Ï„=2/3, because this results in roughly one-half of the light we see coming from layers below the photosphere and one-half coming from layers above the photosphere. But there's no actual physical boundary at the photosphere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
