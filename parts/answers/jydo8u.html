It’s an added security measure because many times trains are not very loud and can « sneak up » on you. The whistling makes it very clear they are coming.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're wondering &quot;why a whistle&quot; and not something more pleasing like a nice guitar riff or hurdy-gurdy: early trains ran on steam. It's very simple (a valve, some string, a piece of pipe, and a hacksaw) to add a driver-controlled whistle to a steam engine. You just plumb the whistle into a steam line with a small valve, and stick on a pipe with a cut-out, and you get a whistle. They are simple and cheap, robust, loud, and require pretty much no maintenance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
