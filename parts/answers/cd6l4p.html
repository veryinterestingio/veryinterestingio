		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They can track them by touch and by smell.</p>
<p>Basically how it works is each of your B lymphocytes (the white blood cells that chase down bacteria) gets randomly assigned one specific antigen (a cell part visible from the outside of the cell) to look out for for and then gets released into your blood to float aimlessly around gloming onto cells and seeing if they match that antigen. (This is also how they know which things are invaders and which aren't: the cells are 'trained' in your bone marrow by basically exposing them to your own cells and killing any of the ones that exhibit an immune response - these ones are defective and would attack your own body, so they get weeded out before they're released into the bloodstream.)</p>
<p>If they ever find a match, that B lymphocyte starts releasing a variety of chemicals into your blood: antibodies (which latch onto the antigens it found and makes the bacteria sticky and visible), and cytokine (which are signalling chemicals which your other white blood cells can 'smell' and follow to the site of the infection, based on the concentration gradient of that particular cytokine). It also starts rapidly dividing and reproducing into a host of B lymphocytes that all match that one antigen, many of which undergo a different developmental pathway (which is based on the presence of those cytokines) to specialize them for different roles in the immunological response.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The steak gives off a lot of nice smell and it also drips a bit of juice on the floor. The dog smells this and runs after it eats it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Say you get bacteria in a cut in your skin. You have white cells constantly monitoring your body via your blood stream. These cells have proteins on their surface that make them “sticky” so instead of flowing through the blood like a red blood cell would, they “roll” along the surface of your vessels more slowly. When bacteria get in your skin (just an example) a cascade of events happens. Local white blood cells that live in the skin (we don’t need to talk about the specifics here) find the bacteria and send out signals called cytokines. There are a ton of different cytokines, but we’ll just talk about two functions of them for now. They do two things: firstly they go to the closest blood vessel and tell it to switch it’s “rolling” molecules to “come on in” molecules. Now the white cells that were rolling along in the blood steam come across this vessel and stick to it and leave the circulation and enter the tissue close to the site of infection. In addition to the “come on in” signal, the first on scene skin white blood cells are also secreting “over here” molecules. So the white blood cell in the blood steam left the circulation due to one cytokine, and found the bacteria via another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They use chemotaxis. Basically they have receptors that identify trace amounts of chemicals released by bacteria. Chemical signals triggered by these receptors causes the  cytoskeleton - a meshwork of scaffold proteins inside the cell - to dismantle away from the desired direction of movement and reassemble towards the bacteria - producing gliding motion.
This is a gross oversimplification.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
