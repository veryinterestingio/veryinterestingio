		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the material of the mirror, and also varies with wavelength of light. An ordinary bathroom mirror is likely to use an aluminum coating which is around 90% reflective in visible light. A mirror using silver is likely to be 98% reflective. Gold is very good at reflecting infrared but poor at reflecting green and blue light (which is why it looks coloured). Dielectric mirrors use many layers of nanoscale thickness to create 99.99% reflectivity at their design wavelength by means of constructive interference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Does light lose energy from bouncing between mirrors? Iâ€™ve always wondered this because for example: if you point a flashlight at a wall we get a certain brightness, but if you angle a mirror to put the same beam on a wall it looks dimmer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A point to add about any reflective material is that the amount of light reflected or transmitted through depends on the angle that light approaches the surface at. Consider a glass window in the daytime, if you look straight on, you will see through it clearly. Whereas if you are standing off to the side, depending on the angle, you will see more of the reflected world than what is behind the glass. So for a glass window or a mirror, an additional consideration is the angular approach of incident light as it affects the amount of transmitted or reflected light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
