		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honey is a concentrated sugar. </p>
<p>When bacteria or molds land in concentrated sugars, any water that might be in their cells crosses the cell membrane via osmosis in an attempt to normalize the concentration within and without the cell. This dries the cell and kills it.</p>
<p>If you add enough water to honey, it will decompose, and if you put yeast in the mix you can make a tasty alcoholic beverage known as mead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding to the low water concentration (as people mentioned), bee's also have enzymes in their mouths to produce antibiotic molecules.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just want to note that not all honey has such a low water content, like comments here are saying. It really depends on how long the honey has been drying out in the hive. </p>
<p>If you look at honey-filled honeycomb cells in a hive, you’ll find a mixture of capped and uncapped cells. When the honey has suitably dried (by bees fanning it and also just by exposure), the bees will cap it with wax. Beekeepers have to cut off these caps in order to get the honey out. Depending on the hive type that could mean crushing the comb or putting it in a special spinny-machine. </p>
<p>Not all of the cells will be capped when honey is being harvested, and beekeepers have to keep track of the ratio of capped-to-uncapped frames to make sure the water content doesn’t get too high.</p>
<p>Or you could just not harvest any of the uncapped honey, but where’s the fun in that? Use it up within the year and you’re fine :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
