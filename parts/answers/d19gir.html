Paul McCartney composed &quot;Yesterday&quot; in a dream, and spent a month playing it for anyone he could, to see if they recognized it. But there is no sure way to tell, other than to put the song out and see if anyone complains.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it, it's the plaintiff's job to prove that it's very similar (one standard was that more than six consecutive notes have to be identical) and that the person who is supposed to have copied has heard the original.</p>
<p>A good case example would be when the Chiffons sued George Harrison. I believe Queen and Vanilla Ice had a similar suit.( A really <em>strange</em> one was when the rights holder to older John Fogerty material sued John Fogerty for writing a song that sounded too much like a John Fogerty song. )</p>
<p>This doesn't mean the artist doesn't have a responsibility to cover their asses. For example, the morning after they wrote &quot;Walk This Way&quot;, members of Aerosmith double checked that they didn't accidentally cover a James Brown song.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a documentary I saw years ago about music ,creativity etc. In one section it mentioned this very subject, and how, as western music has a set number of notes and a set of &quot;rules&quot; (for what is melodious, upbeat, atonal, ominous etc)  there really are only so many ways &quot;catchy&quot; melodies can go.</p>
<p>Then they interviewed  Billy Joel who said that years after he wrote &quot;Uptown Girl&quot;, he was listening to a classical music radio station playing various mozart pieces (cant remember which). While listening, he heard a long section  in one these mozart pieces that was almost the exact tune for Uptown Girl. The melody broke off and went in a different direction, but he said it was the same beginning melody. He then joked Mozart wrote &quot;Uptown Girl&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can't.</p>
<p>That's why so many songs have passages that sound similar. It's not copying, it's just that a lot of modern songwriting is based around the same patterns and has the same historical origin.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdxkVQy7QLM" target="_blank">For example...</a> (Rob Paravonian's rant about the pervasiveness of the chord progression used in Pachelbel's <em>Canon in D</em> in modern popular music.)</p>
<p>The Foo Fighters song <em>Best of You</em> intro uses the same basic chords as Dave Matthews Band's <em>Crash Into Me</em>. To my knowledge no one has tried a lawsuit.</p>
<p>Where you usually get successful suits these days is where the influence is very obvious. Despite his protestations to the contrary, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr4KbSU_UZw" target="_blank">it was pretty obvious that Sam Smith borrowed the melody and song structure of Tom Petty's <em>Won't Back Down</em> for his song <em>Stay With Me</em>.</a> Maybe unintentionally (subconscious after hearing it at some point), but the similarity is beyond coincidence.</p>
<p>And that's why Petty was awarded royalties for that song. It's not just a minor similarity, the more recent song is obviously a slower-tempo ripoff of Petty's song.</p>
<p>But the standard of proof is pretty high in cases like this precisely because when you have 100 years of popular music based around blues chords in a musical framework that consists of 12 notes (in different octaves), certain patterns are going to emerge over and over again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
