<p><strong>Dry, as some have mentioned, is the word used to describe the opposite of sweet.</strong> I will reference a few laws below that use this definition in legal practice to confirm this as the internationally accepted, and in many cases, legally-binding definition.</p>
<p>Water is dry. Add sugar to it and it has some level of sweetness. You might hear words like &quot;off-dry&quot; to describe a small amount of sugar, &quot;semi-sweet&quot; a bit sweeter yet, and &quot;sweet&quot; or &quot;lusciously sweet&quot; to describe things even sweeter still. These are typically used to describe ranges of sugar expressed in <strong>grams of sugar per liter</strong>, which, if you multiply by bald eagles and divide by original colonies, can be converted to American. ;)</p>
<p>For reference, Coca-Cola has \~126g/L of sugar. It's what most industry folk would call something like &quot;sweet&quot;, &quot;cloyingly sweet&quot;, or &quot;lusciously sweet&quot;. <a href="https://www.coca-colaproductfacts.com/en/products/coca-cola/cherry/2-liter/" target="_blank">Source.</a></p>
<p>The amount of sugar in a wine can typically be found (except by many American producers) by searching google for &quot;(insert wine name here) tech sheet&quot;. For example, find the technical notes for Moët &amp; Chandon Imperial Brut <a href="https://www.moet.com/en-us/moet-imperial" target="_blank">here</a>, where sugar is listed under &quot;dosage&quot; to be 9g/L. Keep in mind that most bottles encountered in the wild are 750mL, so to obtain a sugar level per bottle, simply multiply by .75.</p>
<p>A few laws for describing dryness, for the purpose of confirming the above definition:</p>
<p>German wines are allowed to call their wines &quot;trocken&quot; (dry in German) if and only if the wine has 9g/L of sugar or fewer.</p>
<p>Vouvray, a wine-making village along France's Loire River Valley, only allows for their wines to be labeled &quot;sec&quot; (dry in French) if the wines have 8g/L of sugar or fewer.</p>
<p>See below for a law on Gin.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Common misconceptions:</strong> &quot;Dry&quot; is often used by consumers to refer to the drying sensation one experiences after taking a sip of a beverage. This is a mistake, because the technical word to describe that sensation is &quot;bitterness”, while the word most often used to describe the bitterness coming from grape and oak tannins is “tannic”. However, most beverage professionals (assuming they're paying attention) are in tune with the fact that this misconception is quite prevalent, so an astute salesperson should respond to &quot;I'd like a dry wine&quot; with something to the effect of &quot;Dry as in 'the absence of sugar' or dry as in 'dries my mouth out'?&quot;</p>
<p>The word &quot;tannic&quot; describes the sensation of astringency brought on by tannin, a compound--long name polyphenols--found in grape skins. Red wine, which is colored by leaving the crushed grape skins in the juice until the color seeps out--think of a tea bag leaching out its color--are prone to having tannin by the nature of this process. The longer the skins stay in the juice (sometimes as long as several weeks) to color, flavor, and add texture to the wine, the more tannin will be extracted from the skins, and the more the wine will dry your mouth out. But, again, this is not &quot;dryness&quot; technically, this is tannin--polyphenols--binding to your saliva and leaving a drying, sandpaper-like, cottonmouth feeling. Tannin can also be found in such things as tea leaves. Think over-steeped tea.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>About things like gin specifically, London Dry Gin is a spirit which must, by law, be flavored predominantly by juniper and have no more than .1g/L of sugar. This level of sugar is what the industry folk would call &quot;bone dry&quot;. Keep in mind that this is different from &quot;Dry Gin&quot; and simply &quot;Gin&quot;, which are principally made the same way (by flavoring a neutral spirit) but may have different interpretations of flavors and different levels of alcohol and sweetness.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Dryness is also distinct from alcohol content in terms of organoleptic qualities, though high levels of alcohol can change the mouthfeel (especially adding viscosity, a liquid's resistance to flow or &quot;thickness&quot;) and add a perceived sweetness--a bone dry liquid with the viscosity of maple syrup may seem sweeter to the taster than a bone dry liquid with the viscosity of skim milk simply by perception, even though the two liquids in question have the same amount of sugar.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>A word of caution:</strong> As alluded to above, many wines and spirits are regulated by law in their production. Those which are not so regulated (American products, and products of countries who don't have bi-lateral trade agreements with countries who do regulate these things) are a great deal more laissez-faire when it comes to what words and designations end up on their products. A wine labeled &quot;dry&quot; in the states has no required limit of sugar. It could have 200g/L and face no legal recourse for naming it as such. Do your research on wines if you have any questions!!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a very simplified way it refers to how sweet or, in this case, not sweet a drink is. A dry drink is not going to have much sugary (or fruity - another term used) taste in the mouth. </p>
<p>So a fruity drink is sweet while a dry drink is not sweet to the taste.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fully dry (“brut”) means the yeast have converted all available sugar to alcohol, leaving little/no residual sugar. A brut beer still has some residual sugar, and this is because yeast can’t eat maltose (malt sugar). In contrast, the sugar in fruit alcohol (cider, wine, champagne, etc) is fully digestible to the yeast, so a brut wine will have no residual sugar.</p>
<p>*EDIT - other redditors have made right what I got wrong in the comments below. Here's a fresh take at the point I was attempting to make: It is a challenge to produce a fully dry maltose-based alcohol (e.g. beer) because the yeast will naturally cease activity before all sugar is consumed. Conversely, it is a challenge to produce a sweet or semi-sweet fructose-based alcohol (e.g. cider) because the yeast will generally be active until all sugar is consumed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As the other commenter said, it's essentially the opposite of sweet. Dryness refers to how much of the sugar has been converted to alcohol. The drier it is, the less sugar left after the fermentation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
