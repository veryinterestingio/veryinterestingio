		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, trained vocalist/singer/voice over here.</p>
<p>The phenomenon you’re talking about is related to how sound travels through your skull to reach your own ears. </p>
<p>Most people are completely unaccustomed to listening the sound of their own voice that it sounds bizarre to them when they hear it played back on a recording, though this is what other people actually hear. </p>
<p>As someone who has obviously trained their voice, and been exposed to recordings of my own voice for absolutely years, I can say that from my perspective my ‘through my head’ voice and ‘recorded voice’ don’t actually sound that different to me anymore. Maybe that my ‘through my head’ voice has more low frequency content. </p>
<p>As for doing impressions and voices or even singing, I have to say that what I hear directly in my head and what is on the recording sound almost identical when compared with my normal speaking voice. I attribute this to paying more attention. You have to pay attention to what you’re doing and how it sounds when you do voices or sing properly. As such, the effect gradually starts to be less of an obstruction. </p>
<p>EDIT: I’m just clarifying a point because some people are confusing my wording somewhat. </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I meant, if I do voices or I sing, on a recording they sound virtually identical to how they sound when I hear me doing them. This is in contrast with my normal speaking voice, where the effect of different sound between me hearing it and the sound on the recording is more noticeable. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it’s not that much about the sound being exactly like you hear it.</p>
<p>When we do impressions we generally try to mimic the distinctive mannerisms of the speaker. That means trying to use high/low tones, pauses, amd speaking fast/slow in way that the subject you try to impersonate does.</p>
<p>And also vocabulary, everyone tends to use some words more often than the others so picking out the ones your subject uses gets you even more accurate.</p>
<p>And lastly there is the body language. Hand gestures, eye movement etc.</p>
<p>To make a good imperssion generally speaking you need these three things.
1) Voice/sound characteristics
2) Vocabulary
3) Body language</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is consistency and perspective. While from your perspective your voice sounds wrong, if you hear a recording of your impersonation it'll likely also sound wrong to you. Because that's not how you perceived it.
With consistency, ie. Practice, we get used to the difference and notice it less and less </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people don't do accurate vocal impressions to begin with. Most &quot;cheat&quot; using mannerisms, clothing or catchphrases. Alec Baldwin does not do a good impression of Trump. However, he has created a fucking brilliant caricature of The Donald. </p>
<p>Most SNL impressions are so weak 90% of the time someone simply says the name.</p>
<p>Accurate vocal impressions are pretty rare from scarily gifted people. Those that are that good get hired to dub dead actors for film restorations. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you are taking/listening to yourself talk, there are (at least) two components to what you hear</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The sound coming out of your mouth and into your ears</p>
</li>
<li>The vibrations from your vocal chords reaching the bones in your ears</li>
</ol>
<p>The recording device, and everyone except for you, only hears the sound coming out of your mouth.</p>
<p>So when you listen to yourself on a recording, it sounds weird because it’s missing a component that you are used to hearing.</p>
<p>Edit: to answer the question, some people can easily mimic the component that you hear coming from your mouth (or someone else’s mouth), and that’s all that anyone hears from other people, so the impression sounds right</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
