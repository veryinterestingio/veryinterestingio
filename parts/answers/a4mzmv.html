		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Med student here. </p>
<p>Emotional stress can cause our autonomic nervous systems to activate like our sympathetic nervous system (known as our “fight or flight” response”). </p>
<p>Without getting too specific. When this specific system is activated by stress, anxiety, or strong emotions, it causes release of epinephrine and norepinephrine from our adrenal glands and these hormones cause our blood vessels to constrict and our heart to beat faster and stronger. With this combination, at times your heart won’t get enough blood going to it since the coronary arteries become constricted, causing what’s known as angina (basically a chest pressure or “pain”). </p>
<p>There’s actually a medical term and condition for this scenario called Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy aka Broken Heart Syndrome. It’s a cardiomyopathy and weakening of the heart that occurs during severe emotional stress. Now it encompasses a lot more than just the decreases blood flow to the heart muscle but it’s kind of like a severe form of this phenomenon. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't a biology question, it's actually a psychology question. When your brain has experienced a stressful event, being emotionally hurt, it releases a hormone called cortisol into your heart to try and reduce inflammation in the heart. On the biological level/unconscious level, your nerve endings are sending signals to your brain to tell you that something is wrong with your heart. It's called a slow pain because you know you're not in immediate danger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
