		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally to connect to satellites you have to be authorized.  </p>
<p>the satellites have a list of authorized equipment that can talk to them and vice versa.<br />
You still need to &quot;paint&quot; the satellites or aim your dish at them to get the signal in the first place</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I fly interplanetary spacecraft for a living and none have passwords or secret codes or any such thing. Our command format is well documented in public standards (CCSDS, ECSS).</p>
<p>Military / government spacecraft have authentication units which do handle encryption through the use of keys.</p>
<p>Generally speaking we rely on the difficulties of deep space communication to prevent hacking. You'd need to have a spare 35m+ antenna, a hydrogen maser and several kilowatts of radio amplifier to start hacking. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The OS the ground terminals ran was UNIX but there wasn't a password or login to connect to the bird. Each operator had a separate login/pw for the ground terminal but that was more to record who was at the wheel.  You could logout out of the terminal and the satellite would keep doing it's thing because the plan had already been uploaded, so all you would do after sending the initial flight plan was make ad hoc changes. The protocol to connect was proprietary and encrypted however, and the encryption had to be loaded to connect, so I suppose that could be considered a type of password.  The entire ground system software was a one off interface.  The data going up was encrypted on the ground and decrypted on the bird, and data coming down was encrypted on the bird and decrypted on the ground. It's been a while, but his reminds me of hearing, go get the keys to the F-16's. It's all proprietary, encrypted, and complex.  And you would need to know the exact technical specs of the transmitters and receivers to even know where to look.  Even if you found that, it would just be noise.    </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Given that there are lots of satellites, designed by lots of different groups of people, it probably isn't correct to say &quot;yes they do,&quot; or &quot;no they don't.&quot;. Good chance more than one satellite is running Linux with SSL, in which case, yeah, it's password protected and the traffic is encrypted.</p>
<p>The method of communication is entirely separate from the presence of an authentication system, like a password.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
