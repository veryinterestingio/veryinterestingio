		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you sleep, you lay on your back for an extended period of time. Normally, while due to gravity there’s an accumulation of fluid in your legs while you stand  or sit or move around, and when you lie down for a long period of time, that fluid more evenly distributes throughout your body. As a result, your vocal cords swell, and your voice changes a bit - that is, until you stand up and redistribute that fluid.</p>
<p>This is also why people with heart failure have a tough time sleeping lying down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
