		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tremors, limping, muscle spasms, etc. are still definitely symptoms, especially during flashbacks. However, it is important to note that shellshock was far less well understood than our current, nuanced understaning of PTSD, and as a result some people were called shellshocked when they were physically injured or had disorders other than PTSD.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The symptoms of shell shock are still seen at times. But the kind of trauma that soldiers are in is not the same today as in WWI. They are in war zones far shorter periods of time now, they are in direct combat for minutes or at most hours not months at a time, and they are not under constant bombardment being subjected to the pressure waves of dozens if not hundreds of explosives a day.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because we learned from World War I.</p>
<p>No soldier today goes through what those poor men went through at places like Verdun.  Even the cold and brutal generals of the day eventually recognized that you couldn't let your soldiers sit under constant artillery for <em>months</em> and expect them to be even sort of functional at the end.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
