		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the reciprocal nature of the plugin <a href="https://help.joinhoney.com/article/30-how-does-honey-make-money" target="_blank">sending you to sites that pay to have you sent their way</a>, Honey also aggregates and monetizes big data about all of its users (the standard <a href="https://help.joinhoney.com/article/29-what-information-does-honey-collect" target="_blank">name, email, computer specs, shopping habits</a>) and likely makes the lion's share of its income from selling that data. It gets sold on to advertisers who build profiles on you to determine how to best sell future products to you, much like Google, Facebook, and other large &quot;free&quot; sites will do with their collected data.</p>
<p>EDIT: To address a point made by another poster, I was apparently unnecessarily reductive in saying that they &quot;sell&quot; your data, as I was trying to keep the post ELI5 friendly. For those interested:</p>
<p>Honey, like many other websites, uses a variety of techniques involving the scraping of data from its users to make money, including ways that they are legally allowed to declare as not being a form of monetization.</p>
<p>The easiest way to put it would be to say that while they are not literally writing down your details in a giant Excel spreadsheet to sell for hard cash on the information market to advertising companies, they are nonetheless collecting data, processing it either internally or through an external contracted ad agency, and then determining the best way to tailor their service to get you to buy the majority of products at stores for which they have deals and coupons. This is done with the explicitly stated purpose of sending you to stores they have deals with, making new deals with other stores, and in general producing monetary gains for their company. So, in spirit, but maybe not in law, they are &quot;selling your data&quot;.</p>
<p>The data, as their privacy policy makes clear, does indeed make its way into the hands of external businesses and advertisers from time to time, which then means it can be passed on many more times without you knowing. One company can have many policies which dictate how strict their data sales to advertisers and other third party agencies are, but that third party may not have quite so strict policies, and then the next person they sell it to may have even more lax policies... until you start getting spam Nigerian Email Scams on the new email you just used to sign up to Facebook with. The first company, or even the third or fourth in the chain may have taken &quot;good care&quot; of your data, but the farther you go down the chain, the more lax they are with your data.</p>
<p>It's also worth mentioning that the &quot;anonymization&quot; of data for aggregate sharing and sales is rarely as anonymous as people are led to believe by the language included in these deliberately vague and occluded terms of service. <a href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/static/browser-uniqueness.pdf" target="_blank">Browser fingerprinting</a> is a well known tactic by many advertising agencies on the web, requiring little else other than the specifics of your computer specs (which are often fairly unique) and a couple of websites you've visited in the past to be able to identify exactly who you are.</p>
<p>I don't say all of this to poo-poo sites on the internet or even Honey itself. The app is probably a good exchange if you use it frequently. And, frankly, we live in a world now where if you're going to be monetized, you might as well work the system and get what deals you can get out of it in exchange. I just think it's worth being informed about how these sites really function so that you aren't caught off-guard if something ends up spilling down the line from the nth corporate merger Honey's owners do which ends up with the personal shopping habits of you and the other millions of users in the hands of someone who has far fewer scruples about how to take advantage of that information.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Amongst other things, it's probably collecting a horrifying amount of information about your shopping habits that they can sell to the highest bidder. To be honest, I don't know entirely how Honey works, because my suspicions about how they use your data makes me not want to go anywhere near it</p>
<p>Never forget the mantra that if you're getting a service for free, you are not the customer, you are the product being sold</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To anyone saying they sell your info, while that is common  nowadays, a <a href="https://www.joinhoney.com/privacy" target="_blank">30 sec search shows this is not the case</a>. From their website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We know how important your personal data is to you, so we will never sell it. We’ll only share it with your consent or in ways you’d expect (as we explain here). That means we will share your data if needed to complete your purchase, with businesses who help us operate Honey, or if we are legally required to do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They go on to say,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please know that when we share information with our service providers, it’s for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and not for their independent use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://help.joinhoney.com/article/30-how-does-honey-make-money#:~:text=Honey%20makes%20commissions%20from%20our,a%20commission%20from%20the%20merchant" target="_blank">A different ( and just as easy) search will reveal</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Honey makes commissions from our merchant partners when a member uses Honey to find the best available coupons or to activate our Honey Gold rewards program. We work with affiliates to help confirm your purchase so we can get a commission from the merchant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They then mention Honey Gold, a free rewards program they describe as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a win-win for our members and for us and it’s what allows us to provide a free service (and without selling anyone’s data). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm generally very cynical of free programs selling information, but this sub is not for wrong information, if you are going to comment take the time to make sure you are right. </p>
<p>So, TL;DR, Honey does not sell your information but rather makes commissions with included thirds parties to draw additional traffic to them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>That cute little &quot;honey&quot; smily face you see, that's basically spyware.  Facebook, Google are basically spyware mining every bit of your online DNA so that  prospective advertises can guess and train people how to think.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
