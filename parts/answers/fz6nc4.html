		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Photons don’t have charge, but that just means that they don’t couple to each other. They still couple to particles which <em>do</em> have charge. And that’s usually what’s happening: a photon is scattering off of a charged particle.</p>
<p>Scattering of light by light is possible due to higher-order effects, but it’s very rare.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A photon is a wave in the electromagnetic field. A charged particle (e.g. an electron) experiences a force due to this EM field. Thus, by Newton's third law (conservation of momentum), the photon has to experience an equal and opposite force.</p>
<p>So in this sense, it is the back-action of charged matter on the electromagnetic field that causes photons to scatter off matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Photons interacts with matter in the form of the electromagnetic force. In fact photons are the “carriers” of the electromagnetic force. We know photons are both particle and waves, and as strange as it sounds electromagnetic waves carry momentum, this momentum is associated with the wave itself as the particle is massless. This is why it is possible for photons to interact with charges and impart momentum or energy to the charges.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
