		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Taken from &quot;and then you're dead&quot; - Cody cassidy &amp; Paul doherty-  about eating a lot of cookies like cookie monster:</p>
<p>First, a thin physique helps. Exactly how you can stay thin while eating 11 pounds of cookies is a bit of a paradox, but it’s true that with less fat in the way your stomach has more room to expand outward.
.. </p>
<p>Unless you have eaten 60 cookies many times (and thus suppressed your gag reflex), your stomach will revolt and you will vomit. But that’s a good thing: 60 cookies equals roughly 4 liters of food, and that’s approaching your stomach’s breaking point.* We know the physical limit of the stomach thanks to the German physician Algot Key-Aberg, who in the late 1800s attempted to cleanse a patient of an opium overdose by pumping water into his stomach. Unfortunately, the patient’s drug use suppressed the normal vomiting response and his stomach broke like an overfilled water balloon, killing him on the operating table. This event piqued Key-Aberg’s curiosity and he began experimenting to determine the true capacity of a stretched human stomach using corpses. He concluded that the typical stomach can hold 4 liters of food before eruption. (Imagine two party-size sodas next to each other. If you eat or drink more than that, you are approaching what we will call here the stomach eruption limit.) This limit applies to all of us, except, however, for a gifted few. A small number of people have publicly passed the 4-liter mark. Depending on your training, or whether you received the genetic gift of a flexible stomach, it is possible to eat more. Joey Chestnut, the reigning hot-dog-eating champion, once ate 69 hot dogs in 10 minutes. That’s approximately 9.5 liters of food—or 130 chocolate chip cookies.</p>
<p>(this book delves into what can kill you, with science. It's brilliant and interesting and I recommend. Yes I copied from kindle, yes it's cheap, no I didn't write it and I wish I did 😄)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's a Matt Stonie thumbnail! World's #1 competitive eater.</p>
<p>Long story short, your stomach can change i  size because it's not a rigid organ. Over time he trained himself to be able to eat more by... eating more. Obese people go through the same thing; they have to eat more to sustain their size, so then they <em>can</em> eat more because of how much they eat. You can see Matt's stomach expansion after a meal in some of his videos - it's quite terrifying, really.</p>
<p>As to why Matt is skinny, he doesn't eat like thst every day and he likely does a fair amount of exercise. He may even 'purge' after a session but that's not sustainable long term so I doubt it. I'd imagine he eats a mostly volumetric diet between competitions - that is to say, he eats food that takes up a lot of space but has relstively low caloric value (leafy greens), so he naturally needs to fill up more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who trained for and participated in an eating competition, i can give a more practical background on how people stretch their stomach.  About two weeks before the contest, you change your diet: two big meals a day increasing daily, usually consisting of low calorie-dense foods (lots of veggies and rice without much fat). Drink lots of water. Day before competition,  about 24 hours before, eat one enormous meal to the point where you want to puke. Do not eat anything except maybe a cup of yogurt between big meal and competition. This all stretches your stomach out and makes you able to eat way more. </p>
<p>Some people do this with water, but it is very dangerous.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know what this guy does, but eating one meal a day helps me. I work long hours and don't eat until I get home, but I'll eat a meal like 2 turkey sandwiches, 40 pizza rolls, a bowl of ice cream and then snack on something else and feel fine. Sometimes I'll go for round 2 before bed. Not this exact thing every day, but a ton of really shitty food like this usually. Also, I'm 5'10&quot; and can't seem to get over 155 lbs.</p>
<p>I think my stomach has just gotten used to stretching so much. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
