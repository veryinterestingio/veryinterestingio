<p>It is counter productive, and it’s something I have suffered from. You can reduce the effects of this by eating “better”, low GI carbohydrates to avoid blood sugar swings and crashes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is only the case in some instances, but with an 'empty' stomach the PH level of the stomach 'juice' is higher, which is irritating, especially if it gets into your oesophagus.</p>
<p>A condition called GORD (Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease), also known as heartburn or acid-reflux, is when the stomach acid gets into the oesophagus and for some people this is very common, especially those with a loose seal between the stomach and food pipe, most commonly caused by a 'hiatus hernia'.</p>
<p>This means when the stomach is empty, the stomach and oesopagus become irritated and it can lead to throwing up, or feeling we need to throw up.</p>
<p>However, this is not the only reason, just one reason. If eating food like a banana or having antacid medication makes such nausea go away, chances are this is the cause.</p>
<p>Other posters have listed the other main causes so I feel it's not necessary to repeat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you are hungry your body secretes a hormone called ghrelin. There are other hormones involved in hunger and digestion, like insulin, but ghrelin is the one playing a direct role here. Ghrelin basically says to your brain 'go get food', and says to your stomach 'get ready for that food'. The way your stomach gets ready is to produce stomach acid. Ghrelin levels drop once you start actually digesting things. So when your stomach keeps being told to get ready, it secretes more and more acid. That acid, with nothing else in the stomach, sloshes around and hits the place where your stomach and esophagus meet, sometimes even leaking back into the esophagus. As you can imagine, this is a big nausea trigger. </p>
<p>What's interesting about this is that your body doesn't even need to be in some irregular state (like low blood sugar) to feel this. You can make this happen just by having an expectation of food. Seeing or smelling food triggers this response, but so does merely thinking about food.</p>
<p>In the the second part of your question you note that this seems counter-productive. This is related to a very common misconception about biology and how evolution works. The key thing about evolution via natural selection is that a particular trait has to have an effect on survivability for it to be selected for or against.  So the reason we still have this reaction is probably down to it just not mattering enough. The processes and systems that utilize ghrelin are likely more beneficial to us than the downsides of occasional nausea with regards to humans surviving to a reproductive age. And frankly, it doesn't need to be very beneficial at all... lots of species have vestigial organs and parts floating around that haven't disappeared simply because their existence doesn't significantly jeopardize that species' chances of survival.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>There is no paradoxical situation as SHITTY as feeling so absolutely nauseous that you can't function....yet it's because you're hungry. And everything you think about eating... Makes you feel more sick. </p>
<p>I thank all that is good on this earth for zofran- because me and my yet unborn child (I'm 37 weeks today!) are only here today because zofran allowed me to keep down the massive amounts of food I needed to eat during the 8 weeks of hellish vertigo and morning sickness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
