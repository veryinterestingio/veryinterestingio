<p>“There are two reasons that COVID-19 is such a threat. First, it can kill healthy adults in addition to elderly people with existing health problems. The data so far suggests that the virus has a case fatality risk around 1%; this rate would make it several times more severe than typical seasonal influenza and would put it somewhere between the 1957 influenza pandemic (0.6%) and the 1918 influenza pandemic (2%).</p>
<p>Second, COVID-19 is transmitted quite efficiently. The average infected person spreads the disease to two or three others. That’s an exponential rate of increase. There is also strong evidence that it can be transmitted by people who are just mildly ill or not even showing symptoms yet. This means COVID-19 will be much harder to contain than Middle East Respiratory Syndrome or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which were only spread by those showing symptoms and were much less efficiently transmitted. In fact, COVID-19 has already caused 10 times as many cases as SARS in just a quarter of the time”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The two main metrics are CFR (Case Fatality Rate - the percentage of infected people who will die), and R0, which measures the spread of the disease. R0=1 when an infected person infects one other person on average. This gets more complicated as more of the population is infected, so you might see Reff (effective R0) used instead.</p>
<p>The CFR in Wuhan/Hubei province is about 4% but about 1% in the rest of China (according to the official statistics). The difference is likely due to treatment availability and the heads-up the rest of the country got. That’s compared to about 0.01% for seasonal flu, about 2.5% for Spanish flu and ~10% for MERS.
(EDIT: 10% for SARS, 20-60% for MERS, thanks for the correction.)</p>
<p>R0 is normally about 1.3 for this kind of virus, however the long incubation time means the infection rate is probably higher here. This is why the massive quarantine in China has been effective, and why there’s the potential for a huge impact on countries that can’t or won’t impose the same level on containment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It is unclear why men and women are affected, but an intriguing possibility is an X-linked gene that creates the ACE-2 receptor, which is exploited by some coronaviruses to enter cells. Females are XX, while males are XY, meaning they only have one copy of the gene and a subpopulation may be more vulnerable. Primary research can be found <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41421-020-0147-1" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41368-020-0074-x" target="_blank">here</a>, with a more accessible summary <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/why-some-covid-19-cases-are-worse-than-others-67160" target="_blank">here</a> This matches a similar pattern with the 2003 SARS outbreak, where 13% of females died while 22% of men did.</p>
<p>The origins of the virus are unknown, but genetically it is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00548-w" target="_blank">very close to a similar virus in pangolins</a>, which unfortunately are poached for traditional medicinal purposes. While it is not definitely known where the virus comes from originally, it is most likely an episode of zoonosis - where a virus spreads to a new species from another. Many human pandemics have their roots in animal transfer, including influenza (chickens), Ebola (chimpanzees), HVI/AIDS (chimpanzees again), measles (cattle), among hundreds of others. If you are interested in the history of these kinds of disease species jumps, I recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Spillover-Animal-Infections-Human-Pandemic/dp/0393346617" target="_blank">Spillover</a> by David Quammen.</p>
<p>My background is as an archaeologist, and I've been researching the emergence of epidemics for the past few years (no pubs on the topic though, sorry). If you are interested in this too, I recommend William McNeill's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Plagues-Peoples-William-H-McNeill/dp/0385121229" target="_blank">Plagues and Peoples</a>. Historically, diseases seem to have gone through an initial high mortality phase, followed by a more contagious phase. This is only an hypothesis - and by a non-specialist at that - but I wonder if the SARS to COVID-19 infections follow that pattern. The difference being that a modern medical system can isolate the more lethal first step (SARS). Unfortunately, for more contagious diseases (like COVID-19), only massive containment measures are likely to be effective. Not all governments are capable (or willing) to do this.</p>
<p>Lastly, some may read the low infection rates for young people as a reason not to worry. As a parent of an infant, I take some solace on them. But keep in mind that even if you get a mild infection, you may spread it to someone you care about who will have a much harder time with it. While masks (N95 or greater) may be effective at preventing contamination, the most effective measures will be simply hygiene like frequent showers and washing your hands thoroughly. WHO recommendations for hygiene habits to reduce disease transmission can be found <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, I caution agains the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias" target="_blank">normalcy bias</a>. It is easy to assume that this will blow over like so many other supposed crises have. But the only comparable disease in the modern era is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu" target="_blank">1918 influenza epidemic</a> that infected 500 million, and killed 40-50 million. If the numbers from Hubei are representative of the infection (and keep in mind - that is with extraordinary containment measures), then a 2.8% mortality infecting 500 million today would be 14 million people. It is unknown how international travel through airports and crowded cities of 10+ million will factor into this pandemic - we don't have a historical precedent for that. We also don't have a precedent for how pandemics interact with modern medical systems. There are a lot of unknowns. Wash you hands.</p>
<p>I hope this helps. Stay safe everyone.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been checking in on <a href="https://ncov.r6.no/" target="_blank">this site</a> daily just for a quick stats update on the outbreak. It has comparisons to both the swine and SARS outbreaks on graphs 2 and 3. Like the author of the site says, many things have changed with each virus outbreak, such as detection methods and when information was spread about them, and so I wouldn't use this as a bulletproof analysis, but it's nice as a graphical representation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The fatality rate is presently a dynamic function. You can't divide by the number of infected, as they may yet die. But you also can't divide by the number of cured because those infected may yet survive. The point is, the only correct way of calculating the fatality rate is to wait until the dynamic effects wear off, and we reach the steady state infection rate. </p>
<p>Professional virologists have access to some impressive, highly sophisticated modeling software which considers the limitations I mentioned above and beyond. They seem to be going with 1 - 3% HIGH end mortality rates. I consider these estimates to be conservative, but nonetheless within the realm of possibility.</p>
<p>Another factor to consider is the novelty of the virus. Due to containment efforts, and the aforementioned dynamic response, the current healthcare system is overwhelmed. This superficially adds to the mortality rate as we can expect persons to have reasonable access to healthcare during steady state.</p>
<p>So in conclusion, the most reliable &quot;back of envelope&quot; calculation you and I can make will be a gross estimate. But it can be done. Deceased / Cured will give an extremely conservative estimate during early dynamic states. Consider week one had a few deceased and no cured. This method leads to a mortality rate of infinity percent! As time goes on, it will approach a more stable mortality rate. In contrast Deceased / Infected could potentially be completely erroneous. Overall, it lacks meaning during a dynamic state for reasons mentioned previously. It doesn't add much at steady state either as a greater percentage of deaths will occur during the dynamic response and overall the rate of change regarding infected people will decrease leading the rate to continue artificially inflating with time. Best someone like you and I could do is wait another month for more data. Take a 1 - 2 month window and calculate the Deceased / Cured ratio within that period. It will still have dynamic effects or second order effects, so it will remain conservative. But it will isolate a window with 3 - 4 full cycles of infection, death, or recovery.</p>
<p>An interesting project for someone to take up would be to plot the daily <em>moving average</em> D / C curves over varying window lengths. Say 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month etc. It will start at infinity as we mentioned, and should decay to some steady value over time. Regression techniques could then give fair estimates of steady state rates ... that is until the bell gets rung again somehow.</p>
<p>TLDR: We're seeing the <em>dynamic</em> response of a novel virus. Mortality rates will be relatively high at first, but should decay to a steady state. 1 - 3% rates are conservative, as they are derived using dynamic data. Expect it to go down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
