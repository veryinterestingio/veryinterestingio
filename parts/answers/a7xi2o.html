<p>Bridging circuits use a series of transistors or diodes that can change current flow in DC circuits. While single diodes can block simple “mistake” polarity issues, a bridge of transistors or diodes (not an opamp) can produce the correct electron flow regardless of battery installation. It usually isn’t done because it adds to the cost of R&amp;D, mass production manufacturing, etc because the more complex the circuit is, the more expensive it is to make. It is entirely possible, however as voltages and amperages increase, it gets prohibitively expensive for mass production. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sure. A simple arrangement of four diodes called a full wave rectifier will do the job. Why isn't this standard? Well, there's a voltage drop of .7 volts across a diode, so in a multiple battery circuit, this loss of voltage for each battery could be a problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you just meant swapping polarities, it can be done with a <a href="https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/diode/diode_6.html" target="_blank">rectifier circuit</a> but it will reduce the voltage.</p>
<p>If each individual battery can be inserted in any direction, it may not be possible, for example if your two batteries are opposite to each other, the output voltage is 0 and there is nothing we can power with it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, a simple filament bulb doesn't care about polarity. <a href="https://www.circuit-diagram.org/circuits/260d5f2e" target="_blank">This circuit</a> functions identically if you flip the cell around. </p>
<p>But more complicated electronic circuits (definitely anything that starts to resemble a computer) will almost certainly contain diodes and other components which require current to flow in one specific direction. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Devices that use mains electricity do this, because mains is AC the direction of the current flow switches back and forth 50 times a second (depending on where you live). This is kind of like flipping a battery around the wrong way and back.</p>
<p>They work by using a full bridge rectifier. It's a little circuit that uses four diodes (components that only allow current to flow in one direction) arranged in a certain way.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/diode/diode_6.html" target="_blank">https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/diode/diode_6.html</a></p>
<p>This would work fine with batteries, it's just expensive to use more components (also a standard battery socket only let's the battery fit in one way unless you force it)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
