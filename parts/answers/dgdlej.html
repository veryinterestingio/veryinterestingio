		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's an excellent video by David Bennett that discusses this exact topic: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC6zLP97wWA" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC6zLP97wWA" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC6zLP97wWA</a></a> Amusingly, a lot of the answers were sourced from Reddit, so I guess this closes the loop!</p>
<p>Basically, there's two schools of thought: one that claims there's some innate quality to 4/4 that makes it common, appealing or natural, and some that believe 4/4 is popular due to cultural or societal factors. The 'humans are bipedal' argument falls into the innate camp, whereas the cultural camp notes that more unusual time signatures can be quite common in non-Western cultures.</p>
<p>Naturally these answers are not mutually exclusive. It can be a little bit of nature, plus a little bit of culture. But it's a really interesting topic!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Beats differ across culture. And people respond differently to different beats based on their background.</p>
<p>However, musical notation originates from classical music, which uses the western 4 beat notation. As such, 3 beat, 2 beat and other forms are often notated as a different version of 4 beats: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_(music)" target="_blank">link</a> </p>
<p>There does seem a preference for 2 beat music over 3 beat music.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my opinion, it's largely cultural. 5/8, 7/8, and 5/4 time signatures are incredibly common in Greek and Armenian music, for example. Also, I think I encounter 6/8 time signatures <em>nearly</em> as often as 4/4, 3/4, or 2/4. It's all over the place. So I guess I kind of disagree with the premise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As with most things in music it's very hard to tell what is a result of society and what is the result of nature. Many cultures have different approaches to rhythm. Some types of music don't have a steady rhythmic beat. Balkan music has steady beat, but those beats have different lengths, some are short some are long. Our ideas about rhythm in the west come from Africa and Cuba (usually called afro-cuban) combined with traditional western European music.  </p>
<p>Grouping 4 beats together isn't universal, but it does provide a lot of benefits. Groups of 4 are symmetrical. Almost always 2 of those 4 beats will be emphasized, 1 and 3 for more European styles 2 + 4 for more afro cuban styles  (I'm speaking like super duper generally here). Where as a group of 3 has 1 emphasized beat and 2 unemphasized. A group of 5 or 7 would also not be symmetrical. A big advantage of 4 is you can have a really steady rhythm that's not as unbalanced as other groupings. </p>
<p>Personally I think that when you start combining multiple rhythms at the same time and making those rhythms fairly complex, like afro cuban music it is helpful to have a steady underlying beat. The actual rhythms are so complicated you want that steadiness of a symmetrical rhythm rather than one that that has a natural unbalance to it. </p>
<p>To your point your brain certainly does group noises into 4 beat patterns, but that's because you've heard 4 beat patterns grouped together your entire life. How often have you heard anything different? If you grew up listening to music that didn't primarily feature this type of rhythm would your brain still group 4's together? I don't know, but its hard to say definitively.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
