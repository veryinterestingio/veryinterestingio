		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Visually? It doesn't.</p>
<p>From a mathematical perspective &quot;it's not that hard&quot; to appreciate <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Four-DimensionalGeometry.html" target="_blank">4D geometry</a> but it doesn't translate into our physical reality. </p>
<p>We can make outlines with 3D figures in plexiglass, say, but they capture one slice at a time.</p>
<p><a href="http://eusebeia.dyndns.org/4d/vis/10-rot-1" target="_blank">You can rotate a computer generated 3D model to get a shadow of one, but it's like a cube in 2D space - it doesn't translate well.</a></p>
<p>There is pretty much no way you can draw on a page or watch a Youtube video about a 4D object and get a good representation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot; But I feel like I'd be able to at least get a good grip on it eventually since it's not that hard. &quot; </p>
<p>I think this is quite a leap of logic there, I'm not so sure you'll be able to understand it since the analogy applies to us in the 3rd one trying to understand the 4th</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>2D-3D: imagine you're standing inside a chalk circle you've drawn on the ground at the middle, the 3rd dimension is whichever direction takes you away from all points of the circle at the same time - in this case up, or down (if you dig).</p>
<p>3D-4D: imagine you're perched in the middle of a spherical bird cage, the fourth dimension is whichever direction takes you away from all sides of the cage at the same time.</p>
<p>That... Is as close to visualising it as I can personally get, because I've never experienced that direction, but it's there... In mathematics at least.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a great book on the subject that targets your current understanding level called Flatland.  It's a quick and easy read, so I'd definitely recommend picking up a copy.  Best to use a book so that you control the speed at which it delivers information.</p>
<p>There's also a <a href="https://www.urticator.net/maze/" target="_blank">4D maze game</a> that was written to test if a human mind could learn to visualize 4D space well.  The overall finding has been that despite it being possible to become somewhat okay at navigating 4D mazes, your brain never gains the ability to visualize them well.  You end up using higher cognitive tricks instead of visualization.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
