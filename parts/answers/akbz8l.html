		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a study (that I will try to find) that shows kids’ shows that “hedge” to the audience (like Elmo or Dora pretending to talk to the kids and responding with their prerecorded scripted answer) don’t teach kids much at all in terms of language acquisition. The way the study tested this was comparing hedged responses with an actual Skype conversation to toddlers. It turns out that even young kids understand when they are actually being spoken to vs when they are being spoken “at” </p>

<p>Edit 2: I said “hedged” but the correct term was “yoked.” My bad </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is lots of research showing that TV is not very effective at educating very young children. </p>
<p>Lots of studies <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15213260701300931" target="_blank">like this one of children 15-24 months</a> have found that young children learn most effectively from real life adults.</p>
<p><a href="http://healthland.time.com/2010/09/07/like-crack-for-babies-baby-einstein-fails-again-in-new-study/" target="_blank">Another study looked at Baby Einstein</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>compared 72 12-to-18-month-olds, who were divided into four experimental groups: those who watched an educational video aimed at improving vocabulary at least five times a week for a month; those who watched the video with a parent; those whose parents were instructed to teach the 25 previously unknown words featured in the video in whatever way they preferred, without a video; and those who got no instruction or video at all.</p>
<p>The children who were taught by their parents, without video aid, learned the most words — about half of the words on the list. Researchers say that’s because kids learn vocabulary words through meaningful gestures and interactive communication with parents — things you can’t get by watching a video screen. There was no difference among the other three groups in the study, though all of them improved slightly, learning about a third of the words.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a 2009 study called Teaching by Listening: The Importance of Adult-Child Conversations to Language Development which you can easily find in PDF.  It is a longitudinal study of US children 2 to 48 months.  They found that the number of conversational turns, the higher the rate of language development.  This study found that when conversational turns are included in the regressions, television drops from significance, suggesting that the adverse effects of television exposure, if any, would operate by reducing opportunities for adult-child interactions.  So the problem isn't that TV is evil, the problem is that a low level of conversations stymies language development and TV tends to reduce conversations.  Early education is more effective with real life people than TV.</p>
<p>However, Sesame Street does educate preschool children.  Sesame Street was not designed as entertainment but as education.  They have a team of early education specialists working on every single episode which is very unusual.  Also, the target audience is 3 to 5.  Preschool age children are inherently different from toddlers and infants.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/sesame-street-and-its-surprisingly-powerful-effects-on-how-children-learn/2015/06/07/59c73fe4-095c-11e5-9e39-0db921c47b93_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.c1f50384a963" target="_blank">A quirk in the PBS system created a natural experiment where some people just didn't have access to the original run of Sesame Street.  Later research found that children who had access to Sesame Street were less likely to be be behind in school.  The effect was particularly strong for boys of all races, black children, and low income children.</a></p>
<p>But as beneficial and Sesame Street is, it isn't creating geniuses, it is just making it less likely that children fall behind.</p>
<p>I did a quick search to see what articles have been published on Dora and there aren't a ton (unlike Sesame Street and Baby Einstein).  And what there is tends to focus on non-English versions of Dora (Greek, Finnish).  The articles were pretty middle of the road, not critical or full of praise.  </p>
<p>A lot of people are bringing up how they learned English through TV or video games, but how old were you?  Dora the Explorer is aimed at children under 6.  Studies of children age 8+ <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439880903561876" target="_blank">like this one</a> often show a connection between subtitled English television programs and English language acquisition, but that is a different population than Dora's target audience. Also, those kids probably already had some English and were not learning from scratch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
