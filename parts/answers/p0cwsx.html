		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To start, my answer is going to focus on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_power" target="_blank">geothermal power</a>, i.e., using geothermal energy to generate electricity, and ignore other uses of geothermal energy, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_heating" target="_blank">geothermal heating</a>, since OP seems to mainly be interested in electricity generation (at least based on the relationship drawn to nuclear power). It's also important to note that depending on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_power#Worldwide_production" target="_blank">where you're considering</a>, the premise of the question doesn't necessarily hold, e.g., in places like Iceland, the Philippines, El Salvador, and Kenya, geothermal power makes up a substantial component of their total power generation, but generally these are the exception rather than the rule.</p>
<p>As to why there is not wider global adoption of geothermal power, the closest to a single answer will be that it's not economically feasible in many places because of the background geology. Some of the geological considerations for what makes an area good or bad for geothermal power generation have been touched on in recent threads (e.g., <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/nwl00r/do_geothermal_power_plants_need_to_be_built_in/" target="_blank">this one</a>), but in short, in order for a geothermal power plant to be economically viable, there needs to be the expectation that the cost of building the plant can be recouped (plus a profit) by selling electricity over a reasonable lifetime of the plant. The cost of building a plant is intricately linked to how deep you have to drill to get to sufficiently hot rocks/fluids to generate power. Where these hot rocks are close to the surface, like in volcanically active areas like Iceland, plants are economically viable. In cold interior of continents, like the middle of North America, where you would need to drill much deeper to reach the same temperature, plants are not as economically viable. Thus, importantly, the idea that &quot;it's basically free&quot; does not consider that there are real, sometimes substantial, costs associated with accessing the hot rocks and fluids necessary to generate geothermal power.</p>
<p>Of course, the geology is not the only control, and there are important considerations like the type of plant in question some of which are viable with substantially lower subsurface temperatures, the ability to use preexisting boreholes as drilling is one of the most expensive aspects, technologies that improve the efficiency or longevity of plants, or simply the background cost of other power sources (i.e., an area where geothermal power might be too expensive now, might be a good option as the cost of other power generating mechanisms increase). That being said, as stated before, if you want something close to a simple answer, the geology and the local, shallow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_gradient" target="_blank">geothermal gradient</a> are good first order explanations as to why geothermal power has seen limited adoption in some places.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simply put, the effort and risk is very high for not that much energy.</p>
<p>I've seen the Krafla plant in Iceland. It's a huge area. It has dozens of drill holes which are <em>kilometers</em> deep. It's in probably located in one of the best locations for geothermal energy world-wide.</p>
<p>Still, its power output is only 60 MW. That's about twenty wind turbines, which really isn't that many.</p>
<p>Add to that the risks to the environment created by the drill holes, and the risks to the drill holes created by the environment, and it just usually doesn't add up to the best option to generate power.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other comments, it should be noted that geothermal sources can be quite toxic. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puna_Geothermal_Venture#Hawaii_Geothermal_Project" target="_blank">The Hawaii one</a> has had continuous issues with hydrogen sulfide gas releases. It's a great source of energy, but not without its own dangers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>… its basically free…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s only free fuel, which is only one part of the cost of energy. </p>
<p>Free fuel doesn’t necessarily make a project make sense economically if the costs to build, operate, and maintain the plant are high enough. You also can’t forget the costs of transporting, whether that’s building a new powerline or purchasing transmission rights.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since the electrical production side has been talked about, just want to add there are more things nuclear plants can be used for than just electricity.</p>
<p>CANDU reactors for example sell tritium that they produce from normal operation for example. Breeder reactors can generate multiple streams of income, by selling the electricity they produce, and the fuel they are producing. Reactors can also be used in many more places, to include actively moving around so can be used in far away outposts/bases or as a source of propulsion (like the crusader airplane, submarines, surface ships, space ships, space rovers, or even a cruise missile the soviets made).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
