Butt powder is basically talc to absorb moisture while climbing chalk is magnesium carbonate and serves an entirely different purpose, including grip.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like another commenter said it's to decrease moisture. With your hands it removes hand sweat so the ridges on your hands and fingers can grip like they are made for. With your cheeks, moisture makes it sticky and so they can't slide against eachother like they need to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ideally climbing chalk doesn't increase grip on an already dry hand -- just dries the sweat quickly so you can grip the holds better. Climbers will typically bring brushes to scrub chalk off overused holds. Chalk usually reduces grip to the smallest degree but increases much more due to lack of moisture</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
