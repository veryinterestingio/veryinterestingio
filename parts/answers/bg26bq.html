<p>Edit: Here is a more detailed answer which I hope would help you understand nightmares better.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Nightmares are described as being disturbing dreams that rattle an individual. While they are more common in children, adults do suffer from them as well. They occur during REM which is when most dreaming takes place. Having nightmares is quite normal however if you report having several nightmares, it becomes a problem.</p>
<p>Frequent nightmares often are a result of ongoing mental problems such as PTSD, bipolar disorder and the like or sleep disorders. Having a poor diet or eating late can also cause nightmares.</p>
<p>Nightmares cause sleep deprivation which can lead to stress and anxiety. Other than the usual problems that arise with sleep deprivation such as daytime sleepiness and exhaustion, nightmares can be used to predict Parkinson's and other diseases like Asthma . However, nightmares cause a plethora of mental problems such as resistance to sleep in fear of a nightmare(in kids this can be particularly damaging because sleep allows the body to recover and repair itself), it can be an indicator of PTSD and other mental disorders like bipolar disorder, and some even link it to suicide.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate to see the stigma surrounding nightmares because although people dismiss of them as childish, they really can be quite serious and should have more attention put on them. Even scouring the internet, nightmares were relatively unexplored, with even peer-reviewed research stating that more research is needed.</p>
<p>tl;dr: While having a nightmare once or twice is quite normal, frequent nightmares are often a sign of mental illness and should be taken seriously.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Prazosin is a drug used to treat ptsd nightmares. It works by inhibiting the adrenaline released by the body during these nightmares. But it doesnâ€™t work for non ptsd nightmares. </p>
<p>So it depends on the kind of nightmares you are having. If they are rooted in trauma, they are doing more damage than if they are not, because of adrenaline release and downstream effects (increasing cortisol, taking you out of deep sleep, etc).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
