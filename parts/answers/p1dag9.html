		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very few people are going to be spontaneously immune, in the formal sense of &quot;immunity&quot;, to a novel pathogen.</p>
<p>What can happen is that people can be genetically resistant to infection or disease caused by a new pathogen, due to random or not-so-random mutations and variations. The classic example is CCR5 deletion -- CCR5 is a receptor for HIV, and people with a particular mutation in CCR5 are highly resistant to HIV (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1044532306001011" target="_blank">Genetics of resistance to HIV infection: Role of co-receptors and co-receptor ligands</a>). (Someone is about to jump in and claim this was a mutation in response to the Black Plague. Nope; that was never more than a wild idea with no evidence that someone threw out in the Discussion section, and there are multiple lines of evidence against it.)</p>
<p>Does such a thing occur with COVID? We don't know. One of the ways such genes are identified is through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and several of those have been conducted with COVID, but so far as I know no slam-dunk powerful resistance loci have been identified. A number of loci have been linked to relative resistance to severe COVID, but none of them are very clear or convincing links. </p>
<p>(This is typical of GWAS -- I think the early hopes that GWAS would quickly identify genes very important for infection, or other disease associations, have pretty much faded, and it's generally accepted that most loci identified this way tend to be relatively weak and more important as cumulative contributors.) </p>
<p>Someone lacking the ACE2 receptor for SARS-CoV-2 would probably be very resistant to COVID, but ACE2 is an important receptor for many important functions, and people lacking ACE2 would probably be severely affected. </p>
<p>There may well be other genes that are important for SARS-CoV-2 infection or replication, and there may be people who have variants in such genes and are therefore resistant, but we don't know of them yet.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd point out that there are groups that get COVID but don't really get sick as well as groups that don't get it at all - and I think those things are very commonly getting conflated. Those who don't get particularly ill: possibly healthier immune system in the first place, there's a little bit out there regarding insulin resistance, vitamin D status, etc., factors that might set someone up for the inflammatory cascade that is what we think of as the severe illness associated with COVID - people like that got the virus, cleared the virus, but didn't get the immune freakout, so they were &quot;fine.&quot;  </p>
<p>Other people don't seem to get it at all. I haven't missed a day of work since March 2020 (I'm a shrink) seeing high risk patients in the office, hotboxing every day - haven't had so much as a sniffle. Did an antibody test, negative. Did the T-detect T-cell test - negative. I've been joking I can't seem to catch this thing no matter how hard I try! It has been suggested that some people may have pre-existing partial immunity resulting from exposure to other coronaviruses which are responsible for a percentage of the colds we all get. It has also been suggested that high LDL (mine is a little high, not crazy high) is associated with greater resistance to infection.   </p>
<p>Then - this study hit the news:  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353402720_Physical_activity_and_the_risk_of_SARS-CoV-2_infection_severe_COVID-19_illness_and_COVID-19_related_mortality_in_South_Korea_a_nationwide_cohort_study" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353402720\_Physical\_activity\_and\_the\_risk\_of\_SARS-CoV-2\_infection\_severe\_COVID-19\_illness\_and\_COVID-19\_related\_mortality\_in\_South\_Korea\_a\_nationwide\_cohort\_study" target="_blank">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353402720\_Physical\_activity\_and\_the\_risk\_of\_SARS-CoV-2\_infection\_severe\_COVID-19\_illness\_and\_COVID-19\_related\_mortality\_in\_South\_Korea\_a\_nationwide\_cohort\_study</a></a>  </p>
<p>Caveat - it has all the normal problems big population studies have, lots of confounding factors, etc. But it's the first time it's been suggested that not only do well trained athletes (in the study, the criteria was 150min moderate to high intensity training per week) not get sick with COVID, they are much less likely to get it at all! And I fit that profile perfectly - I'm a competitive rower, lift weights generally six days a week - that's the first piece of data I've seen that is consistent with my experience the last year and a half - it's of course not necessarily athleticism that's protective, but perhaps multiple factors that tent to go with that - nutrition, lifestyle, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If it’s a specific condition like sickle cell anemia and malaria where a mutation causes immunity, i guess you could call that natural immunity. But even then, it has to be passed down over many generations to become effective. </p>
<p>You don’t just have “natural immunity” against viruses… you do need specific antibodies for specific strains, to do this, one of your ancestors would have needed to fall ill with a similar strain of virus and pass on the antibodies to you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a really interesting question actually and I’ve been wondering the same thing.
I work in healthcare and have been in the frontline against Covid since the beginning. Ive lost count on all the times I’ve been in direct exposure to the virus, without any or with insufficient protective gear (our hospital didn’t provide the correct gear until about a month in), and yet haven’t had an infection. Every time a coworker showed symptoms of Covid there was pcr screening. I never tested positive on them nor did I have any antibodies. I’m aware you don’t always ger a confirmed pcr test or have antibodies even though you have had covid. But among my coworkers, the ones that tested negative on pcr was positive with antibodies later on. And vice versa.
I’m not alone either. I have quite a few of my colleagues that never got a infection that could be confirmed and never got antibodies, even though we were the ones working closest to the patients. I’m very curious as to why we made it out so well while others got so sick.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>I’m no doctor but I read an interesting article a while back to do with Coronavirus, which stated that people in a small village in China were immune.</strong></p>
<p>“Peter Daszak, the president of EcoHealth Alliance, a private research organization based in New York that focuses on the connections between human and wildlife health, is one of Ms. Shi’s longtime partners. “We’ve been raising the flag on these viruses for 15 years,” he told me on Friday with calm frustration. “Ever since SARS.” He was a co-author of the 2005 bats-and-SARS study, and again of the 2017 paper about the multiple SARS-like coronaviruses in the Yunnan cave.</p>
<p>Mr. Daszak told me that, during that second study, the field team took blood samples from a couple of thousand Yunnanese people, about 400 of whom lived near the cave. Roughly 3 percent of them carried antibodies against SARS-related coronaviruses.</p>
<p>“We don’t know if they got sick. We don’t know if they were exposed as children or adults,” Mr. Daszak said. “But what it tells you is that these viruses are making the jump, repeatedly, from bats to humans.” In other words, this Wuhan emergency is no novel event. It’s part of a sequence of related contingencies that stretches back into the past and will stretch forward into the future, as long as current circumstances persist.”</p>
