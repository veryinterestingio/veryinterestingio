		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans have been making bread considerably longer than that.</p>
<p>Only 0.7%-1% of people actually have some form of gluten intolerance which at worst causes mild discomfort or diarrhea like symptoms, signifcantly fewer have full blown celiac disease in which gluten is a serious problem.</p>
<p>Much of the rise of the fear of gluten in the past decade is complete nonsense. The vast majority of people eating gluten free food have no intolerance for it and there is no scientific evidence that gluten causes weight gain.</p>
<p>Like many other allergies there are several theories.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It's likely that they have been common place for thousands of years but it's only now that we understand and diagnose them. Childhood death rates have dropped drastically in the past 100 or so years and part of that is identifying and treating seriously allergies in children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cross breeding and creating 'super wheat' and other plants, or mass produced industrial food may have unintended side effects. But the jury is still out on that one. There is no significant evidence at this time that GMOs are harmful in any way.</p>
</li>
<li>There are studies trying to link the rise hygiene and allergies. anti-bacterial chemicals and drugs, baby wipes, hand cleanser and other products may be having unintended side effects to human development. Much of it linked of all things to gut bacteria.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An important consideration is that modern grains used to make breads and pastas are much higher in gluten content than the strains used even 60 years ago. Selective breeding, hybridization and optimum growing conditions produce flours higher in gluten. Modern breads use higher gluten to produce doughs that rise further and more consistently. So the mixing and baking techniques are all aimed at making the most of that fact.</p>
<p>Another factor is that modern serving sizes tend to be bigger than what our ancestors were accustomed to. (Especially in North America) So total carb intake is higher. </p>
<p>Finally; one theory about the increase in gluten sensitivity (which is lower than the public thinks) is that the changes in our intestinal flora by having so much meat and processed sugars in our diets have sacrificed gluten digestibility. Basically, if we have so much readily digested sugars, simple carbs and proteins, the gut doesn't need to break down gluten and other complex carbs for the intestinal bacteria to thrive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So first part - there's evidence of bread being made 30 000 years ago. It's way older than 5000 years.</p>
<p>Secondly, celiac disease is a genuine thing. It's just anyone with it wouldn't have survived if they didn't know about gluten. Nobody would have known the cause for centuries.</p>
<p>Then there's gluten intolerance, which isn't a scientifically supported thing and doesn't cause any significant issues, and could just be linked to eating too much of the carbohydrate associated with gluten.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Confirmed Celiac here. </p>
<p>I get this all the time from people. They say that they cut gluten and now they feel a million times better. They must be celiac. Or at least gluten sensitive(gtfo)</p>
<p>When most people cut gluten they end up with healthier alternatives. Oh so you’re telling me you stopped eating pop tarts, cheese it’s and fast food and are eating “natural gluten free” food and you feel better?</p>
<p>I then explain to them that they probably just ate garbage and this is their body sighing in relief from getting a break from hell. </p>
<p>Like when the dude on the yearly Fourth of July hot dog eating contest hears the ending buzzer. That’s your body when it gets that single day break from the absolute shit we put into it including food and beverages. </p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>*and yes I was scoped 15 years ago back when there was no such as a “gluten friendly menu” or the gluten free sections you see in the store. Man has this fad helped me</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several theories about why gluten intolerance is on the rise.</p>
<p>1 - We don't live with the same bacteria, worms, etc. that we evolved with. While these may seem like undesirable things, in underdeveloped countries rates of allergic reactions to certain foods/intolerance to certain foods has been markedly lower than in developed countries, and a lot of that is because we've become used to clean environments and clean food where these useful bacteria are just absent. </p>
<p>2 - There's just a lot more wheat in our modern diets than what our ancestors ate. A researcher of the USDA claimed that the US has tripled its amount of wheat gluten consumption in the past 40 years, and the thought is that it is just too much and it is overwhelming our body's ability to digest it.</p>
<p>3 - Antibiotics are being prescribed more and more, even when they aren't really needed. These are generic kill-all medicines that also destroy healthy microbes in our digestive system, which could impact our ability to process wheat.</p>
<p>4 - The theory that the rise in gluten intolerance is more or less a hoax or over-exaggerated issue, and that people are quick to claim they are gluten intolerant or even possibly be diagnosed as such even when they're not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
