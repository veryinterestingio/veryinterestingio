		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was a medic for 2 years.</p>
<p>To make sure the needle is inside the vein.<br />
If the needle was inside muscle or fat, there would not be enough blood to come out.<br />
If you tried to put a lot of stuff there, you could get hurt, it's going to be painful, and the stuff will take a long time to affect you as all the stuff is stuck in that place and not flowing around the body.      </p>
<p>Many (most?) needles have a tiny chamber built in that fills with blood if you hit the vein. So you don't even need to pull on the syringe.<br />
The pressure of the vein is usually enough, often they tie a rubber band on the arm to make it pop up and increase the pressure further.</p>
<p>This also happens for both the thing you plug in a vacuum tube for taking blood samples, and the thing they use to put in large amounts of fluids.<br />
So medically, &quot;mixing the blood&quot; has little to do with it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Do people trying to hide their usage, not go into webbing of their toes? Or are their large enough veins there to get it into the circulatory system?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
