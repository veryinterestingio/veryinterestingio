		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Seeing a lot of misinformation. A blackhead and a ‚Äúpimple‚Äù are the same thing in essence.  Both are actually called comedomes.  They are blocked pores or hair follicles.  A blackhead has a wide opening and oxidizes.  A whitehead is closed.  Blackheads are open comedomes.  Whiteheads are closed comedomes.  Both are types of non-inflammatory acne and can be present in more severe acne as well.  These lesions are just blocked collections of natural sebum production, the oil your skin uses to lubricate itself. </p>
<p>Comedomes are differentiated from pustules and cysts.  Cysts are deep, often firm, and do not manually express‚Ä¶easily.  Pustules are more yellowish and are filled with pus from bacteria and neutrophil collections.  These two types of lesions are present in more severe, inflammatory acne types.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's a blackhead when the top is open to the air. The exposure to air makes it darken and dry out.</p>
<p>It's a pimple when the top is not open the air. It stays white and juicy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blackheads and pimples are formed when a pore in the skin gets blocked and the secretions in the pore accumulate. </p>
<p>The difference is blackheads are closer to the surface of the skin and are exposed to air, which oxidizes it and forms the black part. Pimples form deeper, are not exposed to air and therefore remain white.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blackhead is just oil blocking pores, dead cell and other body material gets clogged in there, which then turns black (its painless).</p>
<p>Pimple (the common painful one) is the same process, but the region is now inflamed, which causes the region to raise up and become sensitive to touch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
