<p>Polygraph test are crap! The do not sense if you are being honest or lying. The sense changes in your level sweat, respiratory, heart rate and blood pressure.</p>
<p>Bring nervous is common for everyone. For people who suffer from anxiety the testing would be a waste of a greater than the average person.</p>
<p>In some places the use of a polygraph is prohibited from being required.</p>
<p>Bit of fun trivia, the polygraph was &quot;invented,&quot; by the creator of Wonder Woman.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I use to work closely with polygraphers. I ran the recruitment, hiring, backgrounds, and testing for a large law enforcement organization. </p>
<p>Poly tests are only good at getting a confession. And fairly easy to beat.  Never confess anything but also never really outright deny anything either. During the test if asked if you are nervous just make up something about you think you left the garage door open.  </p>
<p>During the post test interview if you are asked for more information on topic whatever... Let's say drugs.  Give like a half confession.  Say something along the lines of &quot;I grew up Mormon and now I drink a beer every now and then so I guess I feel bad&quot;.  </p>
<p>Something that shows stress, but not really against the law or whatever.  If you ever want to see polygraphers shit their pants tell them you want to run a blind comparison against another examiner on their results.  We got threatened to be sued and blackball by all local examiners if we did that.  They cannot replicate their results which is like you know.... science.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
