		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tapeworms attach themselves to the wall of the small intestine so they can obtain nourishment. The scolex, (the head of the tapeworm) has hooks and suckers which helps the tapeworm to stay attached to the wall lining and to resist the peristalsis action of the intestine (peristalsis is the contractions of the muscles in the intestines which creates wave-like motions, pushing food further down the digestive system). Furthermore, they have a thick tegument, which is a kind of barrier which makes it quite resistant to acids and alkalis.
(Btw please correct me if I am wrong/missing information. Im only in highschool)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
