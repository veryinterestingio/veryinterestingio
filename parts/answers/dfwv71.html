		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several years ago, Jack Horner gave a TED Talk entitled &quot;Where are the baby dinosaurs.&quot; The subject of his talk was the possibility that at least some of the variety of named species of dinosaurs are likely all members of the same species merely in different stages of development. For example, he suggests that Dracorex hogwartsia, Stygimoloch, and Pachycephalosaurus to all be the same dinosaur at different developmental stages.</p>
<p>My questions are, do you think this theory has merit, and if so, should it change the way we look at other fossils as well, especially from the perspective of evolution?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a normie, so this is from the perspective of someone not too versed in 'boney' news. </p>
<p>We always hear about big discoveries of dinosaur fossils, but what about animals from the time gap between them and us?</p>
<p>Are discoveries not related to dinosaurs not mentioned as much in media just because of dinosaurs being more 'flashy'/'cash graby'?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I'm a paleontology student in Brazil, I used to study fossil lizards from the Crato Formation, after the fire that destroyed the National Museum I find myself without a project.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fossils can take years to be described after they're unearthed, and more fossils are being discovered than ever before; is there generally buzz among paleontologists about bombshell papers before they're made public? </p>
<p>If so, are there discoveries in the pipeline which are going to blow our minds?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
