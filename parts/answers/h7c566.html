		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electrons have negative electrical charge and therefore repel eachother via the electromagnetic force (which is one of the 4 fundamental forces in nature). That &quot;just is&quot;, just like objects have mass and thus attract eachother via gravity (which is another one of the 4 fundamental forces in nature).</p>
<p>Now, since electron repel eachother, it follows that if on one side (A) of a wire there are more electrons repelling eachother than on the other side (B), electrons will travel from A (where they are repelled from harder) to B (where they are repelled from less).</p>
<p>The business of &quot;potential&quot; is in this context just a bookkeeping tool, an abstraction of the simple fact that electrons repel eachother that allows for useful calculations. All it means is that if there is more potential, there are more electrons close to eachother, so electrons are pushed away from that location harder. (EDIT: Potential is typically expressed in units of Volt. Voltage is thus another word for potential, be it more specific for the context of electric fields while potential is a more general term also used in other contexts.)</p>
<p>The bookkeeping tool of potential works for a great deal of other things, such as water flowing down, some of which feel more intuitive to us and therefore are used as analogies. But personally, I think there is too much focus in analogies.</p>
<p>Electrons repel eachother, it's really quite simple.</p>
<p>Then, a battery is an electron pump which brings electrons from one side to the other, causing an abundance of electrons on that other side that repel eachother and thus move away.</p>
<p>And when charges move, this is called a current. The unit of current is Ampere (causing current also to be referred to as Amperage), but that is actually just equal to Coulomb/Second, i.e. simply counting at a certain position how many units of charge (e.g. measured in Coulomb) pass that point in a single unit of time (e.g. measured in Seconds).</p>
<p>And when the electrons bounce of metal ions in a conductor as they are pushed from point A to point B along a wire, this obstructs their movement (i.e. electrical resistance), and by these collisions kinetic energy of the electrons is transformed into movement of the ion crystal, which is nothing more than heat (i.e. ohmic heating).</p>
<p>In general, I personally believe teachers do their students a disservice by not focussing enough on the underlying mechnics (such as &quot;charges repel&quot;), which are quite often actually very intuitive without the need for distraction analogies, while introducing more abstract descriptions (such as &quot;potential&quot;).</p>
<p>This became long and soapboxy, so I guess a &quot;Thank you for coming to my Ted talk&quot; is in order.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electric fields exert forces on charged particles, described by <strong>F</strong> = q<strong>E</strong>. In situations where there's no time-dependence, the electric field vector <strong>E</strong> can be written as <strong>E</strong> = -∇V, where ∇ is the gradient operator and V is some scalar function of <strong>r</strong>.</p>
<p>V is the electric potential.</p>
<p>So combining this with the force equation above, and Newton's second law (<strong>F</strong> = m<strong>a</strong>), we see that m<strong>a</strong> = -q∇V is the equation of motion for a charged particle in a potential V.</p>
<p>That means that as long as ∇V is not zero, in other words there's a difference in potential between points in space, then a charge will feel a force due to that potential difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This was a concept I struggled with until my first full fledged calculus based physics class. It may help to stop thinking of it as &quot;voltage&quot; because that's just the unit. A better name is &quot;the electric potential&quot; The answer to your question that finally made it click for me was that &quot;in a conservative force field, the potential defines that which is conserved.&quot; So basically the electric field E(x,y,z) is conservative, meaning you can move around in it but as long as you end up exactly where you started, you'll have the same energy as you began with no matter what path you choose. When this is true of a vector field (like E), it turns out you can define a scalar field V such that E is the gradient of V and where the energy of putting a charge q in the field is simply qV. Working with scalar quantities is always easier for analysis so that's what we typical use. In a way it's an extension of how a physicist does mechanics. Newtonian mechanics work but dealing with vector equations can be clunky. It's much easier to deal with the system in terms of it's energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electrons do flow, jumping from valence layers to valence layers of atoms,  if the valence layers are loose enough to let them go, as they tend to be in metals. (But not in insulating materials)</p>
<p>In most materials the flow isn't as directional as water,  with electrons going every which way,  but with the collective motion creating the current relative to the resistivity of all materials in the circuit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
