		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you're asking for is the infected fatality rate, no? In other words, the percent of people who get the virus, who die. </p>
<p>For 18-49 year olds, that's about 0.05%, and for 65+ it's about 9%. That's according to CDC best estimates. </p>
<p>If the vaccines reduce the risk of COVID death by 99%, that would reduce the old people IFR to 0.09%. Which is still higher than the unvaxxed death rate for young people. </p>

<p>Edit:
Some have pointed out that the 0.05% IFR is too high for very young people (since most of the deaths are people in their 40s), and the 9% IFR is too high for people in their 60s (since the death rate is much much higher by people in their 80s). These criticisms are valid. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html" target="_blank">CDC estimates</a> that 25% of all Americans have contracted COVID. So you can click <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#SexAndAge" target="_blank">this link</a> and multiply the COVID deaths by 4 to understand how many people in your age range might die if COVID ran through the population unchecked. Then, if you want to do some extra math, divide that number by the total US population by age band <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/241488/population-of-the-us-by-sex-and-age/" target="_blank">here</a>. If you do this, take a look at that all-cause death number to understand how much increased risk of death COVID poses. It's really quite a minimal increased risk for most ages.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a very hard question to answer but I can ballpark it. </p>
<p>Taking the Pfizer vaccine as an example, they report at 97% efficacy at preventing hospitalization under real-world conditions:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/real-world-evidence-confirms-high-effectiveness-pfizer" target="_blank">https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/real-world-evidence-confirms-high-effectiveness-pfizer</a></p>
<p>This suggests that a 30 year old is about 6.5X less likely to be hospitalized than someone who is 75-84 years old.
<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-age.html" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-age.html</a> </p>
<p>The would suggest vaccination is much more effective (97% vs. 84% reduction) at reducing hospitalization than age. That said, the 97% doesn't account for age and the 84% doesn't account for health so those numbers are a bit fuzzy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why does everyone focus on deaths? I for one was just as worried about the long lasting side effects people have experienced. I know a 25 yr old who has lung scar tissue. His doc says it's the equivalent of a 1 pack a day smokers lung capacity and he's never smoked. It's not just bad if you die, people. Being permanently altered by it sounds just as bad to me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The rates at which people are infected by, display symptoms, notice these symptoms , have any serious complications, etc. are so low in each group you're asking about that it creates two problems answering your question:</p>
<ul>
<li>the sample size to estimate &quot;chances against&quot; becomes incredibly small; you need to use the population of vaccinated people who have died from Covid-19 - <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html" target="_blank">there have been only 88 cases of death where there was a &quot;breakthrough&quot; infection</a> among 87M fully vaccinated Americans</li>
<li>Along with small sample size, the importance of the phenomenon is small - i.e. we're talking about whether a vaccine is 99.9999 - 99.999999 effective in preventing covid death and so, generally, appetite to conjecture with a small sample is extremely low</li>
