		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of it is just for show, although many people argue that &quot;loud pipes save lives&quot; meaning it alerts people in cars and trucks to the fact that there is a motorcycle nearby.</p>
<p>There are many Japanese and German motorcycle manufacturers who make extremely powerful bikes that are very quiet.</p>
<p>Personally I ride a KLR650 which has a throaty thumping sound (single cylinder - they call them thumpers), but it's not really noticeable from more than maybe 100 feet away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both. Some people put louder exhaust pipes on their motorcycle on purpose. They believe it’s cool or they believe the extra volume will help alert drivers of their presence so they don’t accidentally run them over. But design also plays a role. Motorcycles are designed to be lightweight whereas the average car is designed for comfort. Cars are much heavier, so if you add a really nice muffler on it, it doesn’t have a profound impact on the overall weight of the car. A motorcycle might sacrifice sound dampening in order to reduce mass. Also a car’s engine is surrounded by the body of the car, dampening the sound further. Motorcycle engines are more exposed. Lastly, motorcycle engines rev faster than typical car engines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
