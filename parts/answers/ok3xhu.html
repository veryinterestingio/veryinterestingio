<p>From what I can tell, they would not remove the synovium in its entirety but just the inflamed tissue and/or excess synovium (if producing too much synovial fluid). According to the link above, excess synovial fluid can actually cause local inflammation due to an enzyme produced with the fluid (in excess). Post-op appears straightforward for surgery, checking for infection,  checking for improvement of condition, and physical therapy. </p>
<p>So, if they completely removed the synovium then you're probably right that it could lead to inflammation (and pain of course). However, they do have treatments for inadequate synovial fluid like hyaluronic acid injections.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Various types of synovectomy can be performed. In a total/radical synovectomy, for a diffuse process (like diffuse PVNS or an infected arthroplasty revision), most/all of the visualized synovium is excised. In a limited or partial synovectomy, for localized pathologies (like localized knee PVNS or post-traumatic elbow contractures), only the pathological regions of the synovium is excised.</p>
<p>However, in both cases, it is difficult to visualize and remove really all of it safely. </p>
<p>Picture being inside a hollow tree with hollow branches. Imagine wanting to cut away all the inner bark from the inside of the tree and branches without piercing to the outside and going through the outer bark, all of which is millimeters thin.</p>
<p>Scrape too hard and you break through, cut too lightly and a little remains. The trunk is easy to see, the big branches are slightly harder, but with all possible effort, you cannot really get to every single tiny branch from the inside of the tree, and you certainly cannot only scrape the inside within such a tiny space.</p>
<p>You can easily see how difficult this task is! Synovectomy is somehow similar.</p>
<p>Synovium is thin. Joints are often closely surrounded by neurovascular structures which must not be damaged. Fear of damaging those structures just millimeters outside can prevent surgeons from removing some synovium covering those important structures.</p>
<p>In most joints, large portions are easily accessible and seen. Some partw are more difficult. But some small nooks and crannies are literally inaccessible from the inside. Thus, the only way to be certain to truly remove all the synovium is by working from the outside and removing a layer of what is covering the synovium itself, part of the joint capsule itself. Or even more radically, by resecting the whole area. These are rarely done as there are consequences to those types of resection. </p>
<p>Fortunately, those resections are not always necessary. A typical synovectomy is usually sufficient for the most common conditions.</p>
<p>TLDR: in total or partial synovectomy, some synovium remains and still secretes synovial fluid, because some parts of the synovium cannot be reached from the inside and/or are unsafe to remove because of proximity to important structures. Synovectomy still does the job for most conditions for which it is indicated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body makes synovial fluid. It makes more joint fluid sometimes as an inflammatory response. Too much fluid in a joint will cause pain and decreased function. Removal of some of this excess fluid will help temporarily but fluid may collect again as your body makes more, especially if the joint is damaged to begin with. Hyaluronic acid injections help some people with decreased cartilage but once again is temporary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
