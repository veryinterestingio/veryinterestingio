		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for doing this AMA. I’m a researcher embarking on my first project investigating the microenvironment of aggressive tumors. An overarching theme of such research is to identify “targets for novel therapeutics” as you say. I’ve never actually had the chance to ask anyone about this ultimate goal. Does this mean that your role as a researcher is to elucidate a mechanism in the tumor micro environment, and then some industry folks take on the task of drug discovery to target that particular mechanism? If so, how do we ensure beforehand that this same mechanism isn’t at play outside the tumor microenvironment? I’m curious about the journey from “bench to bedside” in this field.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I have a few:</p>
<ol>
<li>What information should someone know to help make decisions about breast cancer treatment?</li>
<li>Are certain women in a higher risk group for breast cancer?</li>
<li>What clinical trials are available for breast cancer at the moment?</li>
