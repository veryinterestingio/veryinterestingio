I'm not sure if one could diagnose a primate, unless all the criteria for the diagnosis were observable behavior patterns. If the gorilla was compulsively and frequently tearing off scabbed flesh, I would assume the gorilla is anxious or bored, possibly due to the zoo environment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Back in the 50s and 60s, Harry Harlow did experiments on Rhesus monkeys that could be considered unethical by today's standards. These experiments included giving infant monkeys a choice between surrogate mothers; one was made of wire but had food, and the other was made of cloth but had no food; the infants preferred the cloth mother, who was soft like a real mother would be, despite the lack of nourishment.</p>
<p>He did another version of the experiment in which the monkeys did not have a choice, and those raised with the wire mother behaved differently from those raised with the cloth one.
Harlow also put infant monkeys in &quot;the pit of despair,&quot; where they would spend their first years in almost complete isolation. The monkeys who underwent this emerged &quot;disturbed&quot;.</p>

Nonhuman primates are also models of dementia and other diseases of aging. Prion-related diseases were first confirmed in Chimpanzees, and the most translatable (relevant to humans) models of Alzheimer's are in monkeys. In fact, the current issue of the Journal of American Primatology is a special issue on this topic: <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/10982345/2019/81/2" target="_blank">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/10982345/2019/81/2</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Self-inflicting lesions are a strong indicator of animal stress and anxiety. The anxiety itself is not a mental disorder but is caused by the stimulus. He was mostly likely in an environment that is crowded, which is typical of zoos and is one of the most common reasons of animal stress. </p>
<p>Not all stressed animals self inflict, however. There is a spectrum of stress behavior across different species. But when an animal self inflicts, it is mostly likely from stress. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a source for gibbons in zoos with behaviors that would probably be classified as mental disorders if humans were exhibiting the behaviors, from Cooke and Schillaci (2007): &quot;A lack of physical contact and social bonds for the young primate can sometimes trigger abnormal behaviors such as self-injuring, self-mutilating, digit-sucking, exhibiting bizarre posture, lack of sexual behavior in adults, highly aggressive behavior, prolonged or repetitive locomotion, rocking and pacing (Mitchell, 1970; Lutz et al., 2003).&quot; The last two references can be found in the article, free on researchgate. Personally, I find the conditions that primates are often kept in deplorable, for one thing the enclosures are generally way too small.</p>
