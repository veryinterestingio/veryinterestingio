		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a good balance of speed, browning, and not burning.</p>
<p>Virtually all baking relies on some generation of steam, so you need to be far enough above 100C to get that done. </p>
<p>Then you don't want to wait forever, so you want to go well above 100C. If you want browning you need the food to get up to about 150C, so you want the oven even more than that. </p>
<p>Above about 250C things start going haywire...paper (like muffin cups) starts to char, things go from browning to burning, and you ruin the outside before the heat can propagate to the middle. </p>
<p>Without specific constraints, 200C/400F is hot enough to do what you want quickly without ruining anything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Maillard reaction is a chemical reaction when the proteins and sugars break down and change, browning the food and changing it's taste. This happens around 140 to 165 °C (280 to 330 °F), so to make sure that the whole meal, even the inner most part of it goes through the process, cooking recepies usually call for a higher temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That oven temperature is hot enough to make the cooking process go quickly but not so hot as to cause certain chemical changes to happen in the food’s molecules. For example, if you were to cook steak in a 1000 F oven, it would “cook” faster but that temperature may cause the texture of the food to change drastically due to chemical reactions happening that can only take place at that high temperature. 400 F strikes a balance between keeping the cooking time low and making the food have good taste and mouth feel. Side note: look up sous vide cooking methods. You can cook things at very low temperatures over much longer periods of time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is not.  It really does depend upon what you are cooking and what you are looking to accomplish.  Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pizza is best if you cook at fast at high temperatures.  The dough gets some lift and crispiness at the same time.  Lower temperatures create sad pizza</li>
<li>Steaks and anything else that needs browning to taste good need a blazing hot fire as well.</li>
<li>Chuck roast and pork shoulder need a low, slow, long cook to turn all the tough connective tissue into melted delicious.</li>
</ul></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of cooking techniques that are lower temps, like smoking, Sous Vide, poaching, braising, steaming and slow cooking.   The problem with these is that many require special equipment or techniques, and take a long time.</p>
<p>There are a lot of cooking techniques that go higher in temp, such as Wood-Fired Pizza, Grilling, Searing, Tandoor Ovens..  But again, require special equipment that can handle the temps, create a lot of smoke, and have a high risk of fire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
