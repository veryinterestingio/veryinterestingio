		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dionysius created the AD (now called CE) system in 525 CE, approximately 1500 years ago. It was likely based on a line in the Book of Luke, which says Jesus was about 30 years old after the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar. The BC (now called BCE) notation was added later. </p>
<p>Other historians noted that Josephus mentioned an eclipse that took place before Herod the Great’s death. Originally, his death was assumed to have taken place in 1 BCE, which was a much more historically documented event than the birth of a baby in a stable. However, Kepler (the astronomer) was able to show that based on the movement of celestial bodies, that eclipse actually took place in what we would have known as 4 BCE. </p>
<p>So, basically a monk made some calculations, some historians based the calendar on that monk’s numbers and a reference in an early historian’s work, and an astronomer proved the numbers were a little off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The error was introduced by Dionysius Exiguus in the year of 525. He did not give any background for his calculations but he calculated back to when he thought Jesus was born and then based his easter calendar on that. Previous calendars used the name of the roman consuls for that year or the name of the emperor or other regant. Dionysius did not want to publish a Christian calendar using the names of all the tyrants so he used the year of our lord instead. Part of the reason this became popular and not just in Christian circles was that the Roman Empire was pretty much on its last leg at that point and everyone had started to name the years after whatever local ruler might happen to name themselves king at that moment which made it hard to use calendars across boarders.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Changing everything would be a major inconvenience. Imagine changing all calendars and legal agreements in the world to reflect something new.</p>
<p>Also, the modern terms are CE (common era) and BCE (before common era) because not everyone is Christian.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
