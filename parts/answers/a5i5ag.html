		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.ussnautilus.org/education/pdf/stemlessons/harris%20_How-Do-Submariners-Breathe-Underwater.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> is a review.</p>
<p>There's two issues, the first is that people consume O2, and the second is that they produce C02 (from the O2). The first is not actually not that big of a deal, you only use about 25% of the oxygen you breathe at a given time. The bigger problem is that C02 makes you feel like you are running out of air. Technically speaking, your body doesn't &quot;detect&quot; oxygen. </p>
<p>The first problem is solved by electrolysis, which starts with pure water and splits it into hydrogen and oxygen. The second problem is solved by scrubbing the C02 from the air to prevent that from building concentration.</p>
<p>In SCUBA, it's wayyyy too small and contained to do electrolysis. It requires a huge amount of energy. But they CAN use the scrubbing technology, which is called a rebreather, and allows you increase the amount of oxygen you use (of the oxygen you take down). Since you only use 25% of the oxygen per breath, you can re-breath that air, plus a little oxygen to bring it back up to 20% concentration, less the scrubbed C02 and it extends the time you can do your thing. </p>
<p>But this is considered <a href="http://divermag.com/rebreathers-are-they-safe-for-recreational-divers/" target="_blank">technical diving</a> which is basically, anything beyond the normal SCUBA procedure, and technical diving has additional concerns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any time there is a potential for an accident it does give me pause. And certainly rebreathers do give divers a variety of new ways to kill themselves. And it’s a risk that needs to be appreciated by the diver and then managed to a reasonable degree. Of course, what’s ‘reasonable’ can vary from one person to the next!
But with regards to the data, I would say, yes, there is an increased risk with rebreather diving at this point in time. That’s the experience you see in the marketplace. Per capita there seems to be a higher level of accidents with rebreathers than with open circuit.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The machines on the ISS get O2 by separating water and venting the H2 into space.  In a submarine they store it in tanks and use it as necessary (they also have special candles that create oxygen when burned in case of an emergency). The technology used on the ISS takes up a lot of space. People are always trying to make it smaller but we just aren't quite there yet. However rebreathers for scuba divers do exist and can last quite a while, but not forever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The tech has been adapted and actually predates the specific invention of SCUBA by Jacques  Cousteau. It's called a rebreather and uses chemicals to scrub CO2 from an air supply that is replenished with oxygen from a tank. One of the advantages of the rebreather is that it doesn't release bubbles,  consider essential if you're swiming over to plant a mine on the bottom of a ship. Scuba was invented due to issues from the original rebreather, like oxygen poisoning from too rich an oxygen getting into the mix. Also incomplete CO2 scrubbing from saturated chemical absorbers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Submarines have a room for mixing air from different places throughout the boat with several large fans providing circulation. Fresh air is brought into this mixing room, and O2 bleeds and chlorate candles keep the partial pressure levels sat (which is ~18%, CO2 averages ~400% atmospheric). Ambient pressure can vary significantly.
A scuba tank is usually just compressed air from the surface. About 3,000 psi when jammed. Simple two stage regulation to ambient pressure (depth).
A rebreather is related to the chlorate candles above, providing O2 and functions in a narrow range of the water column. Kinda spooky due to O2 toxicity hazards, nothing like seizing at depth. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
