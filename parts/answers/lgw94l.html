		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we do cardio, blood is more directed towards the muscles you are working out (and away from places that aren’t doing a whole lot at that time).</p>
<p>The blood flow is increased. The volume of blood is also increased when it is returning to the heart.</p>
<p>Over time, the left ventricle enlarges to adapt to the larger blood flow. Now this ventricle can hold more blood and eject more blood per beat (even when resting). This decreases the heart rate over time.</p>
<p>There is also evidence that exercise stimulates the production of new blood vessels. This creates more efficient circulation.</p>
<p>Also, there is evidence that at the same time that cardio increases the number of blood vessels, resistance training increases the size of those blood vessels. This allows for fewer blockages and more efficient blood flow.</p>
<p>The new blood flow (with fresh oxygenated blood) helps keep your other body parts healthy (like your organs).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cardiovascular system changes just like muscles on a weight-lifter change.  If the perceived effort to your body is low, then you won't need responses like sweating, increased heart rate, and heavy breathing like you would to keep up with a high degree of perceived effort.</p>
<p>There's also biomechanical efficiency aspects at play.  When you do something often like run or swim or bike you learn to relax and use better form and hold it even when you're getting tired.  You can get &quot;more bang for the buck&quot; from the energy you do have by moving more efficiently.  The &quot;couch potato&quot; will be less efficient with his energy to begin with then break proper form faster when they start to feel tired.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two main channels. </p>
<p>The first is that the body adapts to do the things we require of it. The cardiovascular system becomes more efficient at extracting oxygen from the air and distributing it to muscles. The relevant muscles may not become huge as in body-building, but they still become stronger and better able to handle repetitive stress. The same holds true for the heart, which is after all a muscle too. </p>
<p>The second is practice. Lots of time spent doing an activity like running makes you better at running in both conscious and unconscious ways. An experienced runner will be more aware of their pace, breathing, and stride. They will also have significant muscle memory that lets them take particularly efficient strides. If your hypothetical fit twin <em>only</em> trained in running, they would be a much better runner, but only a somewhat better swimmer, than their twin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your organs adjust according to how they are used. So the more you use your muscles, the larger they will become. Same with heart (which is also a muscle really) etc. it makes sense - if something is not used, then it is probably not needed, so there’s no sense for the body to put resources into maintaining it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neuromuscular junction. The more you grease the groove the more the NMJ fires. Like a mental habit but this one is a connection to your peripheral nervous system. So a fit person has a NMJ firing a harder action potential than someone who's out of shape. The action potential increases from extra connections to peripheral nerves or extra channel  proteins that let ions pass to generate a bigger current (action potential)</p>
<p>So uh like take a stick and draw a line through the sand. The more you do it the bigger the hole. When water comes in it goes to your hole more.</p>
<p>Also there's muscle memory. Basically muscle cells get bigger only, these cells can't grow more cells (fat cells can grow bigger and more). We all have similar number of muscle cells. These myocytes can have more than one nucleus. A nucleus is like a library that holds instructions to build shit. So those extra proteins are being made because fit people have more nucleus in their myocyte.</p>
<p>So uh like a nation with more schools can teach kids to build more weapons than a nation that can't read.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
