		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a big popular market in the countries who populations are primarily lactose tolerant. </p>
<p>Lactose Tolerance developed 3 separate times in humans. Once in Northern Europe, Once in the Asian Steppe, and Once in Africa (particularly the Masai people). Descendants of these groups typically inherited that tolerance and so can drink milk their whole lives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the reasons is that there's a big chunk of people with lactose intolerance that actually get obstipated/constipated as a reaction. But since the general idea is that you get the shits, they never get tested or realise they have lactose intolerance because their symptoms do not fit in with their idea of it.</p>
<p>Source: I was one of those people.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because lactose tolerance is clustered population-wise and mild cases of lactose intolerance can be treated with OTC medication, it can be low visibility to you.</p>
<p>If you live somewhere where most people can digest lactose into adulthood (Europe or N. America) and/or mostly know people with enough disposable income to buy Lact-Aid or the like, then you might never hear someone commenting about not being able to have a scoop of ice cream or cheese on their sandwich.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
