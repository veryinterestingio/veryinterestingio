		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think if you had a single piece of metal, and you split it in two. Now, you pushed the piece back together. What stops the piece that you broke into two pieces from becoming a single piece again? Also, what made it &quot;one piece&quot; to begin with? </p>
<p>Metal atoms are held together by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_bonding" target="_blank">metallic bonds</a> which is the sharing of free electrons. You get atoms of the same type of metal together, they will bond via sharing free electrons, and they make a very strong connection. So, that answers what makes metal a &quot;single piece&quot; instead of just a bunch of floating atoms. </p>
<p>But, why, when you break it in half, does it not bond back together if you shove it back? Well, on Earth, there is oxygen in the air, which produces a thin oxidation layer over the metal when it is exposed to air. That oxidation layer stops the free sharing of electrons, so they can't re-form a metallic bond. But, in space, no oxygen, so no oxidation. The two pieces of metal touch, they are able to share electrons again, and a bond forms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a nutshell, it's exactly the same forces that keep the molecules of one piece of metal together. The only thing normally <em>stopping</em> the molecules of the two pieces from becoming one piece is the presence of some kind of barrier between them, which isn't present in space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Does this mean that metal fatigue cracks donâ€™t form in space?  Where micro cracks would normally form, does the metal just fuse back together?</p>
<p>Or does the work hardening alter the crystal structure of the metal so that metallic bonding can no longer occur even without the presence of oxygen?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically the reason this doesn't normally happen on Earth is due to the atmosphere. Oxygen reacts with metals creating a layer that prevents it from bonding with similar metal. But in space without that layer, they are free to connect because they are the same element. The bonds that hold the metal together can freely link up with other pieces of the same metal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can read about this by looking up something called cold welding.  </p>
<p>Without getting too complicated it has to do with postively charged ions interacting with negatively charged electrons.  </p>
<p>Normally, in atmosphere, oxygen interacts with metals and creates a layer stopping this (think of rust, which is iron and oxygen, or iron oxide). But in space there is none, so no oxygenation and no layer, means that with force the ions and electrons of the two pieces of metal can interact, forming a bond.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
