		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My father was from Russia and none of my family on his side ever smiled. Recently I read this article and it mentions that one of the reasons Russians do not smile is because showing full teeth is “Vulgar” and resembles an animal. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A smile doesn't just mean happiness. It's a social queue that can show many things including being nervous.</p>
<p>Also, other apes use smiling in a similar way, such as chimps.</p>
<p>So, like many human traits, they were adopted from previous ancestral behaviors (like &quot;smiling&quot; to show your teeth as a sign of aggression) to become much more social.</p>
<p>Showing your teeth as a sign of aggression simply became <em>look, even though we're friendly right now, I'm still an apex predator, look! I even have these pearly whites that are for tearing up flesh hahaha we're so friendly right? Right? Now let's go work together and get some food. But remember... I can be aggressive if I want to so don't overstep my boundaries hahaha</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
