<p>I think they feel that whichever it is, it's going to be your predominant language.</p>
<p>But that's not how it works at all for me. When I dream there is no set language. It's just my brain making stuff up independent of language.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You just kind of know. I’m bilingual and even as an adult I can use two languages at the same time, depending on who I’m talking to. If I’m speaking to an English speaker who happens to know Armenian I definitely will insert the English word for chair into my predominantly Armenian conversation and vice versa. However, I can have a conversation in both languages without an issue. </p>
<p>My understanding is that it does delay language skills in children but you eventually catch up and then hopefully surpass other students.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a problem with the question that makes it harder to understand what's actually happening here.</p>
<p>Words aren't the smallest &quot;unit&quot; of a language. When you engage a language, you're not choosing words from a dictionary one at a time. The question seems to be asking &quot;why don't people mix up their dictionaries more often?&quot; </p>
<p>The answer to THAT question is, well, they do. You can flub pulling a word just as easily between two languages as you might flub a word in English when you only know English. </p>
<p>But, speech is a natural human process that has a lot of stuff running under the hood, stuff that most speakers only really sense in an instinctual way. Each language has rules for which sounds have meaning, how those sounds are articulated in the mouth and throat, and which sound combinations are allowed or disallowed. Then, there are rules that determine how those sounds make words, and how those words and their order make sentences. </p>
<p>And that's not even considering tonal languages that derive meaning from tone, or polysyntheic languages that derive contextual meaning from word order. There's a lot of habits you employ as a speaker of a certain language that make it difficult to completely mix up fully formed sentences. Your brain will FEEL that you're speaking Spanish even if you meant to use English. </p>
<p>We code-switch often somewhere between the word and sentence level, though. Phrases are easily grabbed and slotted into our thoughts even if the language changes. It's more of a choice than you realize. Sometimes it's just easier or more fun to say something in one language over another. </p>
<p>Sorry, I don't often get to talk about linguistics lol. </p>
<p>In ELI5 speak: People do actually have a sense of which words in a languages fit together, because they have an intimate knowledge of sound combination rules at the bottom and sentence rules at the top. That prevents most (but not all) copy errors. When errors do occur, there's usually a reason. Or they just like how it sounds or feels in one language?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
