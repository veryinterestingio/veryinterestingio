		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not really the same kind of uncertainty relationship, since you are correct that time is not an operator.</p>
<p>Instead think more as a time evolution on states. If a state is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, it is stable in time. If a state is not an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, it can be written as a linear combination of Hamiltonian eigenstates, with a time dependence determined by the difference in energy levels from the spectrum of the Hamiltonian. It is from this time dependence that the time energy uncertainty comes from.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it's not really a time-energy relation.</p>
<h3>Uncertainty principle</h3>
<p>The fundamental form of the uncertainty principle is:</p>
<ol>
<li>σ_A^(2) σ_B^(2) ≥ (〈[Â,ˆB]〉/(2i))^(2)</li>
</ol>
<p>(Because the commutator of two Hermitian operators is anti-Hermitian, both sides are always real and positive.)  Substituting [x̂, p̂] = iħ gives the familiar position-momentum form, σ_x σ_p ≥ ħ/2.  Or with sloppy notation, ∆x ∆p ≥ ħ/2.</p>
<h3>The &quot;time-energy&quot; form</h3>
<p>The &quot;time-energy&quot; relation is obtained by picking A=H and B=Q, where H is the Hamiltonian (think &quot;total energy&quot;) and Q is any generic observable. So,</p>
<ol>
<li>σ_H^(2) σ_Q^(2) ≥ (〈[Ĥ,ˆQ]〉/(2i))^(2)</li>
</ol>
<p>However because &quot;i ħ ∂Ψ/∂t = ĤΨ&quot;, it follows that &quot;d〈Q〉/dt = i ħ 〈[Ĥ,ˆQ]〉 + 〈∂ˆQ/∂t〉&quot;, and the above simplifies to:</p>
<ol>
<li>σ_H^(2) σ_Q^(2) ≥ ((ħ/i) d〈Q〉/dt/(2i))^(2) = (ħ/2)^(2) (d〈Q〉/dt)^(2)</li>
</ol>
<p>and taking the square root,</p>
<ol>
<li>σ_H σ_Q ≥ (ħ/2) |d〈Q〉/dt|.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ergo for a given state, the variances of H and Q are related to how fast the expectation value of Q is moving (and from (2), if H and Q commute, then 〈Q〉 is constant and Q is conserved in this sense).</p>
<h3>Abusing notation, an analogy</h3>
<p>To obtain the familiar form, define ∆t = σ_Q/|d〈Q〉/dt|, the linear approximation of the time for 〈Q〉 to drift one standard deviation, and ∆E = σ_H. Then, ∆E ∆t ≥ ħ/2. But beware: the ∆'s no longer mean the same thing!</p>
<p>​ </p>
<p>Let me know if you need me to simplify any of this. This is the simplest explanation that proves the answer to your question, but I could simplify and explain individual concepts while preserving technical correctness.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I might be wrong, but isn't it because quantum mechanics is all about the probability of certain states?  Therefore, there is an inherent relationship with time and probability, because given a length of time there is a distribution of each state existing for a period of time.  The most common states will make up 99.99999% of the time, but there may be some really rare state that would only exist for 0.00000000000001% of time (I'm likely using significantly less 0's than the mathematical description but you get the point).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
