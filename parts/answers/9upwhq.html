		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because sound is vibrating air, moving “stuff” also creates moving air, so when you cut an object it, along with the blade vibrate because the surface and object are not even, when crushing the folding and bending creates fast moving sections of the object and push out air that creates turbulence and therefore sound</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When doing something like crushing a can different parts of the can suddenly twist and buckle causing the vibrations in the air that we perceive as sound. Even if it looks like things are deforming relatively smoothly, on a microscopic scale there are constant sudden random movements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When things bond together, they enter a lower energy state.</p>
<p>To make them break, you have to do work on them (push them, pull them, cut them, etc.).  This temporarily increases their energy so that the bonds can break.</p>
<p>Now that the bonds are broken, they have excess energy and settle back into a lower, unbonded energy condition.  To settle, they release their excess energy, which comes in the form of sound waves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Things, at the small scale, are held together by a bunch if tiny connections, almost like a bunch of elastic bands. If you flick an elastic band, it goes twang, cause it can (ok it vibrates the air, but I really wanted to make that rhyme). </p>
<p>When you cut something you cut all these tiny bands which all make small twangs but come together to make a big TWANG. </p>
<p>If you rub to things together, they get their connections dragged and of course twanged when they get released</p>
<p>When you smash or crush something, some sounds could just come out because you punch it. Otherwise, things could rub against eachother inside the material or things could get snapped or cut, als inside the material. Being crushed could be, to be honest, a very large amount of stuff so if you want to be more specific I think you'll have to specify ;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
