		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually got to learn this in one of my chemistry lectures :D the inside of the pod actually does have a little water in it despite the little plastic package stuff being water soluble, the reason it doesnt just dissolve is because of the activity coefficient (just describes the ability of mixing) due to it being in the gel stuff, when the pod is in water the activity coefficient is high enough that it can mix and dissolve. Sorry if I didnt phrase it well, just really excited to actually contribute to a question I kinda know c:</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, pourable detergent is mixed with a bit of water to make it easier to pour and also to increase it's volume so they can sell it for more money. Tide Pods are way way way WAY more concentrated than the bottle detergent, and therefore have extremely little water. If you ever cut open a tide pod, you'd notice the consistency is almost as thick as set jello.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
