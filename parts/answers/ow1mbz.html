		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To take things on a tangent: Not everyone can &quot;picture images perfectly in our heads&quot; different folks are able to visualize things internally with different acuity or in different ways. Some can't do it at all and that is called aphantasia. But to whatever degree you are or aren't able to visualize things it doesn't seem to impact creativity at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like it’s more around your brain filling in the blanks making you confident that you have a whole picture in your mind when you actually have just a few feelings of what something looks like.  More comparable to the reason you feel like you don’t need instructions or directions than to the necessary skill required to draw</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if it answers your question, but when you draw at a professional level, you’re not trying to recreate/copy what is in your head (minds eye) — you draw through a process of naturalization where your hand is making what you’re thinking simultaneously— it’s like when you speak, you are not internally forming and then reading the words, you just “speak” it as you think it... that’s the end goal anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you're fooling yourself if you think you can imagine something perfectly in your head.</p>
<p>Imagine someone who has a wide and open smile. It's pretty easy, but your mind fills in the blanks and deliberately obfuscates the fact it doesn't know everything. How many of the front upper teeth are visible in that smile. What's the size ratios of those teeth? Were the incisors the 3rd or 4th from the center? What's the 3d shape of the incisor and in what angle is it positioned in the mouth?</p>
<p>You want to draw a human body? How many muscles do you know the shape of in the legs or the back? These are crucial for realistic depictions and the best way to know these is through studying - either by drawing people or reading literature. It's no surprise that medical books about anatomy are a staple reference material for artists.</p>
<p>Even drawing something as &quot;simple&quot; as hands is really difficult. Do you think you could accurately remember the amount of folds in the knuckles and at what point they visibly appear? Does everyone know realise that while fingers are of different lengths, they don't start from the same &quot;line&quot;? That fingers are attached to the palm differently than from the backhand?</p>
<p>Imagine your favourite pair of shoes that you wear. You surely must remember everything about them. If they have laces, how many laceholes do they have? How are your shoes laced - when the laces cross which side is on top?</p>
<p>when people do art, they imitate reality. They base it on items and shapes people find familiar. Few artists just improvise everything and gain fame. So one good way to get better is just  to copy, evalute, copy, evaluate and copy and evaluate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
