		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dick Van Dyke in the 1970s did a very popular PSA.</p>
<p>Before that, the early 50s had enough instances of clothes burning people, that the Flammable Fabrics Act of 1953 was passed.</p>
<p>Between those, someone came up with the catchy phrase.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was at my Indian friend's wedding and her sister's back caught fire while lighting candles. She started running around screaming and her American friend who instantly thought &quot;stop drop and roll&quot; tackled her and rolled her out. Managed to put her out before her hair caught on fire and she &quot;only&quot; needed grafts on her back.  But yes,  I concede to your point:  my high school  life skills class was much more useful on a daily basis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My dad is a Pyrotechnician</p>
<p>Years ago some fireworks exploded during a show. </p>
<p>Fortunately as a Kid he was taught “Stop! Drop! And Roll!” When he was on fire. </p>
<p>He probably learned it as a kid 50 years prior. </p>
<p>Fortunately he escaped with minor burns and is still alive and kicking 15-20 years later. </p>
<p>Somethings are worth instilling in kids when they young where they stick with you for life. </p>
<p>Safety is one of those things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Along with “stop, drop, and roll” we were also taught to always sleep with your door closed, and when you wake up in the morning, touch the door to make sure that it isn’t hot. I went to sleep every night believing when I woke up in the morning my home would be on fire. Like TRULY believed this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
