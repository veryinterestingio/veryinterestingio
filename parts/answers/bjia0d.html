<p>I'm currently studying Astrophysics in college in the US and I'm working toward a Bachelor's degree. What options do I have in terms of jobs? Are there specific states that have more opportunities than others? </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>(warning, I have no idea what I am talking about the but I am really curious)</p>
<p>The water hammer affect is when you have water flowing through a pipe and you suddenly seal the pipe, they pipe may break from the momentum of the water molecules. </p>
<p>Electrons have mass and move along atoms within a wire. Do they have momentum? If they do, is there a water hammer affect when you open a circuit? What would happen on a rediculously  large scale? Could the wire shake or something.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
