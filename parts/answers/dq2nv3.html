<p>This makes me wonder: are there geographic arguments for and against? In Perth WA, the summer afternoons can be brutally hot through to 5 or 6pm standard time, I've always thought this played against implementing DST. Also possibly <del>lat</del>longitude relative to the 'natural' timezone (not specific to Perth)?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Would you be in favor of introducing more timezones?  Perhaps at half hour increments instead of an hour? </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is there any good reason to use winter time instead of summer time when locking the clock? I really really hope time will not be stuck on wintertime - that would mean crazy early sunrises in the summer and shorter evenings. I really hope we will stick with summertime.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
