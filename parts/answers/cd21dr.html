		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An allergic reaction is when your immune system overreacts to something foreign.</p>
<p>For things like bacteria or viruses, we can develop our immune system to fight them better the more we are exposed to them.  Every time your immune system encounters these threats, it builds more weapons to identify and fight then. This is how we develop resistance.</p>
<p>The problem with allergic/anaphylactic reactions is that we don’t want our immune system to be reacting to something,  but because our immune system learns and adapts, it gets <em>stronger</em> every time it is exposed to the foreign thing. </p>
<p>So if you’re allergic to bee stings here’s what might happen. You get stung by a bee the first time and your immune system identifies the venom as a significant threat. The first time you get stung you may not experience much because your system is learning about it and developing weapons to fight it next time it comes around.  The second time you get stung, you could go into full anaphylaxis because your body is prepared for an “all hands on deck” response. Your body overreacts to the point of potentially killing you.  Legitimate responses to fight your bodies, invaders (swelling for instance) go completely overboard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This might be slightly more in depth than what you’re asking, but maybe someone will be interested. </p>
<p>Your body can produce 5 types of antibodies: IgA, IgM, IgG, IgD, and IgE. These all serve specific purposes, but for an allergic reaction, the two important antibodies are IgA and IgE.</p>
<p>IgA is the “first responder” antibody. It is continually secreted into the blood and tissues. Each IgA has a unique binding pattern that can recognize some form of foreign antigen (antigen is molecules that get presented or secreted by a cell, so foreign antigen simply means molecules made by something other than the self). Imagine IgA like a snowflake, each is different from one another in their pattern, which gives the body the ability to recognize a wide variety of foreign antigen. When one IgA binds to a foreign antigen, it undergoes something called “upregulation”, in which the body will begin to replicate the specific IgA to allow the body to better fight the infection. </p>
<p>IgA is used the first time you’re exposed to a new antigen. During/After the infection, the body will begin to produce more specific antibodies with better binding ability, so it can be better ready to kill the foreign body.</p>
<p>In a relatively poorly understood process, sometimes the body will begin to produce IgE as a response to antigen. IgE activates a massive immune response that activates a number of very dangerous immune cells that destroy not only the antigen, but also the surrounding tissue. This response is what we see macroscopically to be hives, rashes, swelling, and sometimes even anaphylaxis. </p>
<p>The change from an IgA response to an IgE response is why a second exposure to an allergen elicits so much worse of a response. To make things worse, your body will continue to produce more and more IgE the more often an immune response is elicited, meaning the more often you’re exposed to the allergen, the more sensitive to that allergen you become.</p>
<p>Sorry if this got a little term heavy, but that was the simplest way I could talk about the reactions occurring on a cellular level and answer the question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
