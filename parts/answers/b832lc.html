<p>Basically the skin is an organ and is continuously remodeling itself. This includes generating more nerves to “conform to the sensory profile of a particular area”.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Follow on, more general, question. </p>
<p>Do all humans have roughly the same number of never endings? Are tall and short people just taking the same amount of never and stretching it compressing the amount of nerves they have per unit area?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You might find the dermatomal pattern of never distribution interesting.  It is a hangover from evolution in which nerve roots from the central nervous system (CNS) innervate the level at which they exit.  Looking at a worm, this makes sense, but given our spinal cord spots in our upper lumbar region, you have to follow from limb buds to legs to imagine how the tissue is stretched and twisted into what we have now.</p>
<p>Looking at dermatomes, you can start to get an idea for where these nerves come from and go to.  An obese person does not change their # of dermatomes, as that is based on nerve roots leaving the spinal cord.  These will ultimately go on to form the named nerves or dive straight into some tissue... But these numbers don't really change. These never roots take information from many receptors.  These receptors can have very broad or narrow fields they respond to as they send information back to the CNS... Kinda how we have different degrees of sensation for fine touch vs feeling the temperature of a room</p>
<p>Admittedly, I do not know the answer to receptors density, but these branches can change # and reorganize.  That should make sense because of you are injured, you will eventually gain sensation back (most of the time).  This is likely the # that is changing on you (again, not my specialty).  I did not see anything really compelling in a quick search of &quot;cutaneous nerve density,&quot; other than in diabetics with neuropathy (that is kinda of the rails for a few reasons). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
