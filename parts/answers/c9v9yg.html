		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Elephants can and do breathe through their mouths, just as most other mammals do.</p>
<p>Human newborns (can after a few months but prefer to use nostrils even after, comment below with source), horses (unless there are issues, see comment below), rodents and rabbits cannot, for example. They are referred to as obligate nasal breathers (human babies are a weird category here). </p>
<p>Elephants can also breathe through their trunks and do this while swimming, keeping their mouths closed. I knew this but finding a source to back this up was surprisingly difficult. Here we go with the textbook <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=mTPI_d9fyLAC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=elephant+breathes+through+mouth&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vMhgJ_uX7P&amp;sig=ACfU3U0tOmJ5TwNuqjMf-ED7Tne22jfAhg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjY_N3S4qDjAhWGmuAKHdMCANk4ChDoATAMegQICRAB#v=onepage&amp;q=elephant%20breathes%20through%20mouth&amp;f=false" target="_blank"><em>Mammal Anatomy: An Illustrated Guide</em></a>.</p>
<p>A few articles about elephant breathing and their respiratory systems:</p>
