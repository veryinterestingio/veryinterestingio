<p>People who get artificial hearts are usually in pretty dire shape and deemed unsuitable for traditional transplants.  They won't be playing basketball or making passionate love.</p>
<p>There is some current work on pumps that react to demands, but nothing commercially available.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't. You just get the heart rate you are given and it's better than being dead. Like it's not an ideal situation and has a lot of issues if you exert yourself and with emotional response stuff but when your other option is not having a heart people generally are okay with the trade off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it does not adjust on its own. It’s set at determined rate based on what they need to sustain life before they leave the hospital. I work on a transplant unit and starting to work with Syncardia, a total heart replacement (TAH), and the pulse rate is set to what the body needs. The patients will have follows ups for life and adjustments will be made as the body changes in one way or the other</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My brother has an LVAD and not only does it not adjust for emotional response, it doesn’t slow when he sleeps. He hardly sleeps at all.  It is not optimal. </p>
<p>Someone else mentioned this, with these devices it would be very difficult to die. He has had a massive stroke and his quality of life is pretty awful, but he can’t really die.  It’s strange.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1) Modern pacemakers (not artificial hearts, but implanted devices that help people who have improper conduction in their heart and thus don't have a fast enough heart rate) can kind of fake it; if they notice the pacemaker is moving a lot (breathing fast, jostling due to walking fast or what have you) they speed up the rate at which the pacemaker fires.   </p>
<p>2) In response to your question about what happens when they exert themselves if they can't match their heartrate to demand:  they get tired and short of breath quickly.  (&quot;Dyspnea on exertion&quot; is kind of a classic sign of a lot of kinds of poor heart function)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
