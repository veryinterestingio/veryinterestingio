		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The energy produced by nuclear power plants is due to nuclear fission of the uranium atoms, mainly the isotope Uranium-235. The uranium itself is hardly radioactive at all, and is quite safe to handle.</p>
<p>The intense radioactivity given off by spent nuclear fuel is due to the fission products that build up in the fuel as it's used. These fission products are the fragments from the fission that produces energy. These include eg. Caesium-137 and Strontium-90. While these fission products are much more radioactive than uranium, none of them are fissile - that is, they can not sustain a fission chain reaction, which is needed to produce significant amounts of energy.</p>
<p>That said, your question is important because in fact, over 90 % of the energy available from the uranium is still there in the spent fuel. This is because conventional nuclear power plants (BWRs and PWRs) only make use of the U235 portion, and about 95 % of the uranium in the fuel is non fissile U238.</p>
<p>Even though U238 is not fissile, it can be used to &quot;breed&quot; fissile plutonium-239 in a special type of reactor, known as fast breeder reactors. A breeder reactor essentially makes it's own fuel, it produces more fissile material than it consumes, although eventually you'll run out of U238.  So the technology to extract much, <em>much</em> more energy from spent nuclear fuel is there, but unfortunately, the political climate surrounding  the nuclear industry is such that it's not in wide spread use.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks for all the upvotes. I feel the need to clarify, that while breeder reactors are technically possible, they are not exactly a low hanging fruit. I mentioned them because they can extract almost all of the available fission energy from nuclear fuel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it no longer generates enough heat to heat the water efficiently, and power plants only have so much room for fuel.  </p>
<p>But in today's age, we actually do recycle quite a bit of the used fuel.  However, there is still a lot of stuff we can't recycle and has to be buried.</p>
<p>Think of it like this.  To make tea you should use pretty hot water, usually boiling or close to it.  If you choose to make tea with water that was boiled an hour ago, you will probably get very weak tea and it will take forever to make.  It would be an unsatisfactory product.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You’re not wrong - the “waste” from one type of fuel source can be reused as a different type of fuel source in another reactor, often after reprocessing it to remove certain impurities that mess with the chain reactions.</p>
<p>But eventually you get to a point where the waste is in the form of elements that have very long half lives and don’t readily form chain reactions that give out a lot of energy quickly, so the output is too low to be useful in generating power, and can’t be sped up, resulting in (at present) useless waste that’s incredibly hazardous to most life on earth for very long periods.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If they could they would is the short answer. We use nuclear energy by converting it into turning water into steam, it's the immense heat it puts out that is valuable. The spent fuel is considered spent because it's not capable of generating the heat necessary for the primary system, and it's a question of whether it is economical to try taking further energy from it. It may be technically possible but the returns just too small to justify spending money on it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
