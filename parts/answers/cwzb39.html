		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a parent of High School aged kids, and active with their school. Not only do my kids deal with what seems to be a high degree of anxiety and fear...but it seems to be a real problem that is growing at their school.</p>
<p>Aside from the usual &quot;take deep breaths&quot; and &quot;positive visualization&quot; type techniques. Do you have any suggestions (or are there some in your books) to deal with these feelings of fear and doom when they are occurring? Is there anything new or interesting in your field about actually dealing with these issues on a day to day basis?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This is a very general question, but where do you think the field of neuroscience is going in the next ten years? What open questions do you think researchers will be able to tackle now with improvements in technology? Thanks for your time!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
