		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>we're not really sure why humans have different eye colors. Most humans have dark / brown eyes. </p>
<p>There are also animals with different eye colors. The coolest of them are arctic reindeers. Their eye color changes with the season - they are golden in summer  and blue in winter. </p>
<p>So one could think that blue eyes see better when there's less light, or that the brown / dark hue is an adaptation to protect the eye from too much sunlight - just like dark skin. </p>
<p>Green eyes might be just blue eyes with some brown in it. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depending on your genes the concentration of melanin in your eyes affects how light is scattered and reflected due to Tyndall scattering.</p>
<p>Longer version, different colours have different densities of melanin (same stuff as what colours your skin). When light that has entered the eye is reflected back out it is scattered via the melanin present in the Stroma. This is similar to how light is scattered in the sky to make it seem blue. The Stroma is lots of layers of collagen fibrils.</p>
<p>Please correct me people if i'm wrong, i spent all of 10 minutes googling this and refining it down.</p>
<p>E: affects or effects you decide!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>The color of the iris is determined by the amount of melanin, the ratio of eumelanin (which is dark brown) to pheomelanin (which is reddish), and the way the melanin is distributed in the eye. Irises with little melanin appear blue due to scattering of light by collagen fibers in the iris. Blue, gray, green and hazel eyes are only common in people of European ancestry; other people's eyes are various shades of brown.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The color is protection from sunlight. It's the same reason skin is colored. Peoples from places that lots of clouds all the time have lighter eye and skin color because there's less sunlight. Peoples from places with more sun light have darker skin and eye color to help protect them from too much sun. Never look into the sun, the protection does not help you then.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
