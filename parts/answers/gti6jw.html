		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If any of these concerts were perfectly live (i.e., straight from the performers) it would be an unrecognizable mess of sound. Generally the feeds from the individuals are sent to a production team who sync the feeds and broadcast the synced feed. So really there is an amount of delay between when the performers play/sing to when you see it. Similar to sports broadcasts</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically you just play off the click track and backing track. It's a little secret, but many concerts are actually played exactly timed, each break between songs, song tempo and length, including start and ending.<br />
These events are highly choreographed to the second. Because these venues are expensive, the productions want to spend the minimum amount of time in them. The tear down starts before the last song has finished.   </p>
<p>This is achieved with lots of rehearsal and a click track. Now I'm not saying every artist does this, but this is the common way. A good rehearsed musician can play their part solo, without an issue.   </p>
<p>Then at the end they are just synced according to delay with the click, then the signal feeds are mastered and broadcasted with delay.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While all other comments are totally correct, and livestream concerts are usually being played against a metronome/click-/backing-track and produced by a production crew, there's actually some research going on with tools you may be able to use for &quot;distributed live music&quot;. There are some guys at Stanford that created JACK and jacktrip (<a href="https://www.jacktrip.org/" target="_blank">https://www.jacktrip.org/</a>), more aimed at jamming with friends than real livestream concerts, but they seem to manage latencies low enough that it feels like really playing live with each other. Just in case someone, like me, thinks of doing that himself...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The one band I follow who have been doing live streams every Friday the past couple of months figures out early in the week what songs they're doing for that week's live stream, most of the members pre-record themselves, and splice it all together, and the one whose basement it's broadcasting from plays live along with the videos of the others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
