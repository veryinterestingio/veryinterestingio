		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>“Does Jupiter have a solid surface?
We do not yet know if a solid surface exists on Jupiter. Jupiter's clouds are thought to be about 30 miles (50 km) thick. Below this there is a 13,000 mile (21,000 km) thick layer of hydrogen and helium which changes from gas to liquid as the depth and pressure increase. Beneath the liquid hydrogen layer is a 25,000 mile (40,000 km) deep sea of liquid metallic hydrogen. Beneath this, there might be a solid core which is about one and a half times the size of Earth, but thirty times more massive. The temperature here would be about 55,000 Fahrenheit (30,000 Celsius) and the pressure would be tremendous because of the weight of the atmosphere above. So, if it is a solid surface, it's not at all like what you would find on a rocky planet, and it's not something you could walk on.” <a href="https://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/ask/102-Does-Jupiter-have-a-solid-surface-" target="_blank">link</a> </p>
<p>The atmosphere is so large that it liquifies and even solidifies under its own weight. There may be a “rocky core”, made of heavier elements, there might not, we haven’t found evidence for it, we can’t see very far through Jupiter. But Jupiter does probably have a surface 30,000 miles or so down made of hydrogen compressed through liquid and into something resembling a solid.</p>
<p>You can’t really call it a rocky planet with a big atmosphere if 99.99% of the mass comes from the atmosphere and the rock might not exist</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>if we measure the diameter of rocky planets just from their surface ( their atmosphere is never taken as a part of &quot;how big&quot; those planets are)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It wouldn't make much of a difference. Earth's atmosphere is very thin compared to earth itself (ca 100km compared to a diameter of ca 13000km). If earth were an apple, the atmosphere would be 1mm thick. When comparing the mass with or without the atmosphere, the difference becomes even more insignificant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't, really. You could assign some arbitrary point as the planet's surface if you wanted, but it doesn't actually matter where the &quot;surface&quot; is--if your probe hits the atmosphere it's just as dead as if it hit a rocky surface, so as long as you know where the effective edge of that is you're good to go. We're never likely to send an actual lander to those planets precisely because they have no reasonable solid surface to land on (your probe would get crushed by the atmospheric pressure long before you got anywhere close to anything solid).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We measure the atmosphere of gas giants from the top of the atmosphere because we've got no choice. Don't know where the surface is, don't even know if there is one, but school textbooks want a number for the planet diameter, so, eh, here you go.</p>
<p>You are right, it is an inconsistent metric. But, for anyone doing technical work, &quot;What is the diameter of the planet?&quot; is never a question that needs an answer. The people who plot the trajectories for probes like Cassini need to know &quot;At what point will the atmospheric drag on the probe affect maneuvering, so how close can we fly?&quot; which is a completely different question specific to the probe's instruments, engines, and whatever. Very technically difficult to answer, but much less philosophically difficult to answer than the &quot;diameter&quot; question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
