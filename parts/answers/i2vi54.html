		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Air is normally an insulator, which doesn't allow electricity to flow through it. However, if there's a big enough voltage, it can rip electrons out of atoms in the air (called &quot;ionization&quot;). This creates a chain reaction: The free electron can knock out electrons from other atoms, ultimately creating a path of conductive plasma that the electricity can flow through. It's like an electric avalanche.</p>
<p>The reason it forms a jagged line is that it's a random process. It'll move into whatever direction the first ionized atom is, rather than moving in a straight line to the next best conductor it can hit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Jurassic Park Jeff goldbloom does this thing where how if you let a drop of water roll down your hand it will not follow a predictible path each time.</p>
<p>The charge follows the path of least resistance just like the water. It's very prone to small changes each mm, and this adds into a jagged unpredictable path.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Remember the right-hand-rule from physics?:</p>
<p>&quot;The various shapes of electric arcs are emergent properties of non-linear patterns of current and electric field (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_arc" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_arc</a>)&quot;</p>
<p>Because of the right-hand-rule, current never flows straight through an insulator like air. It will always curve in an <em>Arc</em> towards the nearest conductor, due to magnetic fields present. It's called <em>Arcing</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>afaik electricity travels through the path of least (air)resistance. The odds of that bychance being a straight line between the two points is astronomically small.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So out of curiosity, is it fair to say it has just as much of a chance to take a straight line as any other path, but there are infinitely more paths than the straight one, so the odds are against the straight path?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
