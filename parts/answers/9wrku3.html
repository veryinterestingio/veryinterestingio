These fractures scatter the light that passes through them, causing a surface to appear translucent or even opaque when bent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like already mentioned, it’s called crazing, and the voids are the most likely area for fracture to occur. At this site there is a localization of the plastic deformation, and can become the location of a macro-scale fracture if the load continues. The crazies aren’t technically voids or cracks, they actually have 50-55% free space by volume. The rest of the volume in the area is the polymer molecules that have been aligned by the force applied. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Isn’t this stress induced crystallization?  Stretching/bending aligns the polymer chains to pack and form crystalline domains.  The crystalline regions scatter light differently than their amorphous (non-crystalline) counterparts.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off, I do plastic fabrication for a living. So as others have said what you're seeing is called crazing, though the only reason you would be getting that is if you had over heated the plastic prior to bending it. It also very well could be the quality of the plastic you're bending.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
