		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I do a lot of reading for work and for my studies. When I try to actually remember something, and what to store it in my long term memory, I pause every page or so and mentally summarize what I read. Also, after long reading sessions, I try to take 5 minutes, eyes closed and recall what I just read.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just need a bit of time to work out how you read.</p>
<p>First question: do you subvocalise? When you read something do you... &quot;hear&quot; yourself reading it to yourself in your head?</p>
<p>It has been shown that people that do actually activate the hearing parts of the brain so any other noise can be really distracting and mean your brain can't quite work out which are the words in the book that you're reading and are the bits you actually need to take in. It could just be you might just be trying to read too fast. How much of rap god did you take in and memorise the first time you heard it? If you're reading it aloud to yourself in your head you basically can't go any faster than normal talking speed.</p>
<p>When I'm sat reading I need everything else off and Mrs A can snap me right out of it with a single sentence.</p>
<p>What are you reading on? My kindle has no other apps installed, the temptation to flick to facebook or anything like that is also a distraction. My kindle has my books and nothing else.</p>
<p>Keep going, keep reading and work out how you read and how you read best. Then set up your reading space at reading time.</p>
<p>This absolutely isn't meant as it sounds but... you get better at it the more you do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
