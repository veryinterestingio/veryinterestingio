		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To explain in simpler terms. I've run into a misconception occasionally that OP might be falling prey to. If a certain material has a half life of 100 years that doesn't mean it'll be fully decayed in 200 years, it means about half will decay in 100 years, then half of that half in another 100, then half of that half in another 100, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For radio active decay you can think of it like this: you can't ever know well all the atoms will decay, as that would imply knowing exactly when the last atom decays. And we can't know when the last atom decays because each individual decay event is random. But we can statistically predict when, let's say, half of the atoms decay and that gives us a value of the half life.</p>
<p>Another way of thinking about it is that theoretically treating the decay as an exponential would imply that a 'whole life' would require waiting an infinite amount of time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most common definition of half-life is: &quot;The time it takes for half a quantity of radioactive material to decay.&quot;</p>
<p>That's <em>technically</em> correct but breaks down in certain edge cases and can lead to justified questions like this one.<br />
A better definition, which I learned in Physics class, is: &quot;The timespan during which a radioactive nucleus will decay with a probability of 50%&quot;. </p>
<p>To speak of &quot;life&quot; instead of &quot;half-life&quot;, we'd need to know the time during which the nucleus would decay with a probability of 100%, which is impossible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
