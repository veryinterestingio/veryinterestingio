		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mostly the answer is &quot;not anymore..&quot; everything that currently orbits the Sun is moving at speeds that lie within a relatively narrow range that makes a stable orbit possible.  Nothing outside that range is around anymore to tell its tale.</p>
<p>But, there are still occasionally new objects that enter the solar system for the first time.  Those objects aren't subject to the same survivorship restrictions -- in theory they could arrive at basically any speed relative to the Sun, including speeds slow enough that the Sun would draw them in.</p>
<p>These new objects seem to arrive every few years, or at least the ones we can see do.  So far they have all been moving so fast they just visit for a bit and then take off again after a swing around the Sun, but who knows?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sun is a very small target on an astronomical scale, even accounting for its corona where an astreroid could bleed off velocity to fall into a sun. Unless it's a more or less direct hit, the asteroid's just going to slingshot around the sun and leave at a more or less equivalent outbound trajectory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Without outside influence, no. An asteroid, by definition, orbits the sun. And this happens because despite the fact that the sun's gravitational force is strong, it's very hard to hit the sun with anything.</p>
<p>Consider a rock that suddenly appears (no reason why, it just appears), and it sits stationary relative to the sun. The sun's gravitational force will pull it in, and it will hit the sun. But that's not a common scenario - if a rock has anything more than a tiny amount of motion perpendicular to the sun, or it is influenced enough (like by the graviational force of another planet), it will be drawn to the sun, but miss it, and end up in a long elliptical orbit.</p>
<p>If a rock is expelled from a planet or another asteroid (by a collision for example), the expelled rock will only end up in the sun if the expelled rock has almost no motion relative to the sun after expulsion, and it isn't influenced by any other large forces (other planets) on the way to the sun. It's very unlikely to happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Do asteroids fly into the sun?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not fly, so much as fall.  There are millions of asteroids, and although they are in relatively stable orbits, there are things that perturb those orbits.  An asteroid may find itself pulled/pushed into a Sun-intersecting orbit.  If you look at the surfaces of Mercury, the Moon, and various other celestial bodies, you'll see the results of bombardment.  There's no reason why the Sun wouldn't receive it's share of that bombardment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
