		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So i had to remove the top reply in this thread.  I know people are going to want to know why, and my explanation is buried there.</p>
<p>It was a copy and paste of <a href="https://redd.it/5640rc" target="_blank">this comment by /u/TheTimeNotTheMiles</a>.  That is one of the reasons that the OP of the removed comment didn't respond to anyone.</p>
<p>That violates our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/about/rules#" target="_blank">rule #3</a> explicitly.  I think though that it violates the spirit of rule #1 as well.  </p>
<hr />
<p>I'll post the contents of that original comment here for convenience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So lets say we have a scalpel, right? Simplest medical device there is. There's a number of ways to make it totally(ish) sterile- gases, steam, dry heat, gamma radiation.</p>
<p>But as you ask- the little bacterial corpses are still there. Waiting, one presumes, for tiny necromancers.</p>
<p>The problem occurs when you stab someone with the scalpel, preferably in a medicinal way. The bodies immune system works by identifying certain chemical triggers in bacteria, and has no way to know that, for example, the lipopolysaccharide hanging around in someone's heart is not part of a bunch of living bacteria, but the floating corpses of dead bacteria.</p>
<p>The dead byproducts of bacteria are called &quot;pyrogens&quot; because they cause (among other things, such as death) fevers.</p>
<p>Where do they go? Nowhere. Bacteria are small enough that water has completely different properties on their level. Beyond rinsing off gross matter and reducing bacterial load, washing can't do much.</p>
<p>So for things like heart surgery scalpels, there will usually be a second step of &quot;Depyrogenation&quot; This is the process, not of killing bacteria, but of removing the bits left behind so they don't trigger an immune reaction. This varies widely in complexity depending on what you have to depyrogenate- steel scalpels are easier than an injectable drug, for example. Typically, the goal of the process is to so thoroughly break down the biological material left behind.</p>
<p><strong>Are my hands covered in bits of dead bacteria?</strong></p>
<p>No your hands aren't covered in dead bits of bacteria. They're covered in happy, healthy bacteria.</p>
<p><strong>Then why wash my hands??</strong></p>
<p>Washing your hands removes dirt and debris that carry the nastiest bacteria. Sterilizing your hands is a ridiculous notion however- your hands are made of cells, bacteria are made of cells. Anything that would kill them would kill your cells. Your hands, and literally everything else on the world not currently under direct gamma radiation bombardment, are covered in bacteria,</p>
<p>Quick run down on terms:</p>
<p>&quot;Cleaning&quot; a medical device is basically doing dishes-getting blood n bits off the reusable ones. (plz dont reuse single use medical devices that makes regulatory professionals sad ?)</p>
<p>&quot;Disinfecting&quot; is using chemicals to get something purty darn clean.</p>
<p>&quot;Sterilization&quot; is killing all* the germs on something</p>
<p>&quot;Depyrogenate&quot; is taking bacterial corpses and reducing their remaining structure to a point where your immune system won't recognize it and freak out.</p>
<p>*SALx10-6 is the typical sterility level for a medical device. one in a million germs/one in a million devices</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like another poster has said, you can't really wash off the dead bacteria because water acts differently on them due to their size. </p>
<p>Also when you use antibacterials, the area will quickly become repopulated with bacteria from your environment, other parts of your skin and by the bacteria that wasn't killed multiplying. </p>
<p>As the area becomes repopulated, the new bacteria will use the dead bacteria as a food source. In essence, the dead bacteria becomes food for the still living bacteria. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Objects can be made &quot;bacteria-corpse&quot; free with depyrogenation using gamma irradiation. Pyrogens are bacteria fragments left over after cell death.</p>
<p>You cannot be depyrogenated, because you have bacteria that live with you all the time. They eat the dead ones when they find them, and they keep your outsides happy and healthy. If you lost them, you would end up with all kinds of horrible side effects because your microbiome (or personal bacteria ecosystem) is just as much a part of you as your own cells are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The irony here is that the human body contains just as much bacteria as our own cells. Not only that, but we are desperately dependent upon the bacteria that lives on our skin to protect us from all sorts of nastiness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hand sanitizer kills bacteria by lysing cell membranes. You are quite literally cutting them open and spilling their juice all over you. By rubbing your hands together there is mechanical removal of bacteria, to some extent, but your best bet is to wash under water with soap. The soap will help lyse the cell, and allow the bacterial remnants to become suspended in water. Then, they should slide off, as running water does. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
