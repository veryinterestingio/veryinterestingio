		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your visual processing system of your brain-eye system (they’re very closely integrated) filters out anything that happens during saccades (movements of the eye to fixate on something else), because it would just be a confusing blur. In fact, it replaces that time interval with something else, either “stretching” the last thing you saw a bit longer or post facto projecting the first thing you see after the saccade back into the past, or some mixture of both. That’s why the seconds hand on a clock can seem to stand still for a lot longer than one second after you focus on it: your brain stretches the image you saw after your saccade <em>back into the past</em> to fill the time of the saccade. </p>
<p>TL;DR: your own head is screwing with you, put on some tinfoil.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s because a mirror has no delay and you can’t see while your eyes are moving(at least not well enough to make out specific objects), this is due to a phenomenon know as saccadic suppression. </p>
<p>So to see your eyes moving you’d either need sufficient delay (such as with a webcam) or to be able to see well while moving your eyes (Which we can’t)</p>
<p>I hope that answers your question!</p>
<p>A quick source, also good reading material.</p>

Therefore, you can't see your eyes moving, but that's good, because if they didn't do that, you would view what's going on like a shaky camera.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
