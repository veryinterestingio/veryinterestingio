		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Earth has been hosting microbial life since quite near the beginning of its 4.5 billion year history. </p>
<ol>
<li>What is the likelihood of such life being ejected off earth by major impact events in that time, finding their way onto other worlds and thriving under the right set of circumstances? </li>
<li>Is there a possibility of life to have evolved first on Venus and then get carried over to earth seeding it with life?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1, Given how little we know about Venus's interior and ongoing volcanic activity, how confident are you that it's not the source of the phosphine? I.e. is your stance more &quot;Based on some reasonable assumptions, volcanism is unlikely to be the source,&quot; or &quot;There is no reasonable possibility in any model of Venus's volcanism that it could produce anywhere near this much phosphine&quot;.</p>
<p>2, Presuming the phosphine is biotic, could we place any constraints on the biochemistry of that life based on the nature of the environment and the fact it's producing phosphine?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Also, what was it like when you first detected these results? Was phosphine a possibility you’d considered, or was it totally unexpected?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
