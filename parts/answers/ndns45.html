Sometimes they will let the grass grow tall, harvest and bale it then put cows in after.
Trees block light, and get in the way of tractors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Grass does not grow well in shaded areas. The more of the land that is in full sunlight, the more it will be able to produce forage for them to graze on. Which equals less hay/grain requirements to keep them in good weight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I live in an area where agriculture is in decline, so to speak.</p>
<p>You can, in theory (there are a lot of ifs and buts to deal with) get a government grant for keeping livestock that keeps a pasture open and grassy.</p>
<p>Because it contributes to biodiversity, and a few other reasons.</p>
<p>However, you can sort of fail at it, like one of my friends did. The government did some fly-by's and took aerial pictures, where they swiftly discovered that his pastures had waaaay too many trees to count as a pasture. Grant revoked.</p>
<p>Well. Until he got rid of some more trees, of course.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
