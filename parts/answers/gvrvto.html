		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, Matija. Thanks for the AMA. I have a couple of questions:</p>
<p>- can your models indicate if there were other major interactions between Earth and other massive objects besides the one that led to the creation of the moon? How big does an object have to be in order to influence Earth's orbital dynamics?</p>
<p>- I recall that gravitational interactions of multiple, or even 3 bodies were quite difficult to model? Is this still true or has there been advancement on this recently? I recall there were also people at the University of Belgrade researching 3-body interactions.</p>
<p>Greetings from another University of Belgrade graduate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for joining us here on AskScience! We know that the variations in Earth's orbital parameters are one of the primary driver behind natural climate cycles (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles" target="_blank">Milankovitch cyles</a> for others reading this comment and not sure what I'm talking about) and there are lots of efforts out there to compare cyclicity we see in the stratigraphic record to orbital cyclicity and/or use orbital cyclicity to interpret cycles we see in the stratigraphy (i.e. 'astronomical tuning', e.g. <a href="http://www.geology.wisc.edu/~smeyers/pubs/Zeeden_et_al_2015.pdf" target="_blank">Zeeden et al, 2015</a>). Most of what I've seen is focused on the Cenozoic or Quaternary, but every once and a while I see someone trying to interpret cyclicity in 'deep time' records, e.g. Paleozoic age stratigraphy, etc, in terms of orbital cyclicity. So, my questions are (1) how far back can we accurately reconstruct orbital cycles for use in this type of effort and (2) assuming at the moment that the accuracy breaks down past some geological time period, what are the barriers to pushing back further (or is there just not enough data to do this with confidence beyond a certain threshold)?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>what do you program in? Is it something special for this kind of thing or a regular language that everyone uses but with special modules particular to your task?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
