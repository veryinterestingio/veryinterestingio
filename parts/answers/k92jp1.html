		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve seen this question posed here before and the answer then was regarding the oculocardiac reflex. Basically when you press on your eyes it slows your heart. I don’t know if anyone answered why exactly they do it, other than it being instinctual, but the net effect is that it calms them and prepares them for sleep.</p>
<p>I also remember someone saying that law enforcement might do this to someone to calm them. But also that it’s dangerous because it can cause the heart to beat too slow (Bradycardia). </p>
<p>You can do a deeper dive into this by googling Oculocardiac reflex.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
