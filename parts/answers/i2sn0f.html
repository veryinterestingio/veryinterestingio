		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, there is a natural <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_cycle" target="_blank">carbon cycle</a> that has been in operation for hundreds of millions (if not billions) of years of Earth's history (the carbon cycle as it exists now, would have been very different / nonexistent before the large scale presence of photosynthesizing organisms). If you look at the different components, you'll see that they operate on different time scales (e.g. the 'deep carbon cycle' is operating on a much longer time scale than any of the surface portions). Beyond the temporal scale differences, the different components and the individual fluxes in the carbon cycle have changed through time (which is one of the primary mechanisms by which natural climate changes have occurred) through a variety of natural processes (e.g. major mountain building events can cause an increase in chemical weathering which removes carbon from the atmosphere and sequesters it carbonate rocks in the oceans, etc).</p>
<p>More to the point of the question, carbon stored in fossil fuels is not removed from this cycle, it's just transferred into a different part of the cycle. So no, there was no danger of ecosystem collapse without us (and in fact the opposite, by mining and injecting vast quantities of carbon into the atmosphere geologically instantaneously, we have seriously perturbed the natural carbon cycle and the climate, and thus are increasingly pushing many ecosystems dangerously close to collapse because of the rapidity of the changes).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>So I saw a video a while ago that went into details about how the Earth has been losing carbon in its atmosphere for some time now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When, according to this video, was Earth's atmosphere losing CO2?  Prior to the industrial revolution its was 280 parts per million (ppm), now its around 415ppm.  10,000 years ago it was about 260ppm.</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide" target="_blank">decent article from climate.gov on CO2 in the atmosphere</a> which has a graph showing concentrations over the last 800K years.  You can see it bounces around between about 175-300ppm, with the peaks and valleys following the course of the ice ages.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In small scale experiments, increased CO2 does accelerate plant growth. This is called CO2 enrichment or CO2 fertilization. Some industrial agriculture uses this technique to grow bigger plants in greenhouses faster.</p>
<p>But plants do not grow only on CO2, there are many other factors. For example, plants also require nitrogen to grow and nitrogen is often a limiting factor of plant growth (plants cannot extract nitrogen from the atmosphere). Additionally, plant growth and specifically crop yields are greatly affected by temperature: increase the temperature by 2 degrees and crop yields of certain types of plants will drop.</p>
<p>So, in a limited experiment where all variables are held steady except CO2 levels (and other required elements are abundant) increased CO2 helps plants grow. But increased atmospheric CO2 in the real world also has other side effects that may actually hurt plant growth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The only time something happened whereby there was not enough carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was the Permian age. That was because trees were  new and nothing could break down their cellulose  at the time. However, trees are easily composted now by microbes that release their stored carbon when they rot. So there is no need for people to add extra carbon. The earth is quite full of it, thank you very much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
