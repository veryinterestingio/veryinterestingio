		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This article is almost ten years old, but the owner of a dollar slice place says in an interview that he makes fifteen to twenty cents of profit per slice. Small space with cheap rent, plenty of pedestrian traffic, high volume of up to 400 pizzas a day.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two ways: First, flour is cheap, tomato sauce is cheap, and you can use a surprisingly small amount of cheese on a surprisingly big pizza. Second: barely. Despite their pretty favorable ingredient costs, pizza restaurants run on thin margins. Rent is expensive, and at 50Â¢ gross margin a slice, it's hard to sell enough slices to stay in the black.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's really cheap to make a pizza. If it costs $4 to make a pizza, and you cut that pizza into $12 slices, you are able to make $8 for each pizza you sell. And since you have low prices, a lot of people go and buy pizza from you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pizza in itself can have a high mark up. Meaning the cost to make it  is a fair amount lower than what it's sold for.</p>
<p>Basic pizza base is just flour, oil, yeast , water and sugar. Sauce is a mix of tomatos and seasonings. Then toppings vary depending on preference and place.</p>
<p>All in all, bought in bulk these ingredients quite cheap.</p>
<p>Let's say pizza can range from $1 to $3 to make and is 8 slices. Then because of it being NY and cheap eating, say they sell 80 pizzas during lunch period. Making $640 from a $80-240 spend. On the cheaper side you have $560 profit which can be put to wages, maintenance etc. Then when you consider opening hours, they probably sell more than 80 pizzas a day. It's enough to keep a business running.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's like $8 a pizza. They do it the same way little caesars  sells $5 pizzas. Cheap but not terrible, convenient but not at the store's expense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
