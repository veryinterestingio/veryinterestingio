		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ul>
<li>
<p>Most of these calls originate from overseas.  The US has zero jurisdiction to police these calls, so the Do Not Call list does nothing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Caller ID system doesn't have any verification of accuracy.  You tell Caller ID what number you want displayed, so it is easy to spoof.</p>
</li>
<li>The carriers (like AT&amp;T) <em>could</em> put restrictions or verification processes in place, but they are not required by law to do so.  As spam calls don't harm them in any appreciable way, there is no reason for them to work on reducing them.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The basic problem is that the telephone system like much of our technology was not built with security in mind. It was made to run in a trusted environment. The system assumes that the number of the caller that it is been provided is actually correct. There is really no way for the system to verify the authenticity of the caller. To add the capability into the system would require that the entire system be upgraded at the same time. Otherwise, people who were not using the upgraded system would lose service. To make the problem worse, &quot;the system&quot; is not actually a single system, but multiple independent phone systems run by numerous companies that all talk to each other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the phone companies have deliberately failed to add a spam-reporting feature, because their revenue still depends on terminating calls, even calls you, their erstwhile customer, don't want.</p>
<p>That's because when a call originating from one phone company connects to a customer of another phone company, the receiving company collects a call-termination fee.</p>
<p>Legislators have mandated feedback loops for email, systems which directly flag unwanted mail and transmit to the sender an instruction to cease sending or face being blocked. There is no technological reason why you couldn't have a button on your phone which flags unwanted calls back to the phone company, so that they'd face punitive actions if too many recipients report them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>What’s amazing is how fast they will have a verbal fight with you when you call them out instead of hanging up and trying again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
