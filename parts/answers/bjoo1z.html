		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spicy things taste spicy because they trick your mouth into thinking everything is warmer than it really is. When you breathe room temperature air like this, it feels like it's warm enough to damage you, so your temperature receptors say, &quot;ow, I'm burning!&quot;</p>
<p>If you eat a lukewarm thing which is spicy, the boost makes it feel a little hot, but if you eat an already hot thing which is spicy, it feels really really hot!</p>
<p>More technical explanation:</p>
<p>Capsaicin binds to the TRPV1 receptor in your mouth, which is the receptor you use to detect when something is burning you. This receptor is stimulated by heat, and normally it's calibrated to exactly the right point to detect damage. Since the receptor is already a little bit stimulated from the capsaicin, room temperature is enough to stimulate it over the pain threshold. The more total heat, the higher over the threshold it's stimulated, and the more pain you experience.</p>
<p>Interesting note: while room temperature is enough to stimulate it over the threshold, things like ice aren't warm enough. That's why sucking on an ice cube takes away the spice for a bit, until it warms up in your mouth. Think about this on a scale from absolute 0 to the hottest thing in the universe, an ice cube is still well above absolute 0 and thus has some &quot;warmth&quot;. The way we perceive cold is actually a totally different mechanism, with the TRPM8 receptor. Menthol, the chemical in mint gum and toothpaste, is like the cold version of capsaicin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Capsaicin, a chemical produced in chili peppers, activates the same sensors you have that detect (temperature) heat.  You feel it as hot because your heat receptors are telling your brain that they are sensing heat.  They aren't either on or off; they can detect a range of heat.  If the room or the food is also temperature hot, then the receptors will detect and report to your brain more total heat so everything tastes even hotter.  </p>
<p>Fun fact, your sense of cold isn't from the same receptors.  They can be tricked, too, with substances like menthol, into reporting cold when none exists.  </p>
<p>Also, when you get a sun burn, your skin releases chemicals that change the temperature range at which your heat sensors fire.  So whereas they normally wouldn't fire very often at something near room temperature - let's say 85 F / 29 C - with the chemicals in your sun-burnt skin they'll fire much more often at that same temperature.  As a result, your skin will feel hot and thus you continue to feel the &quot;burn&quot; of the sunburn long after you come inside.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
