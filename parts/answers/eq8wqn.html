		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>3 types of flying machines. Fixed wing, rotary wing, and ornithopters. Fixed wing doesn't mean solid and unmoving wings. As planes with folding wings or variable angle wings still are fixed wing, but rather that they do not move to produce lift, hence &quot;fixed&quot;</p>
<p>Rotary wings are like helicopters, where the movement of the wing surface creates lift</p>
<p>Ornithopters are old school creations where people would flap wings to try and achieve lift</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The other option is a rotary wing aircraft, such as a helicopter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Helicopters = rotary wing aircraft (the blades are shaped the same way a wing is and operate in the same fashion with minor differences to accomodate and they rotate above the aircraft)</p>
<p>F-14 Tomcat (the jet from Top Gun) = variable wing aircraft (called swing wing, but not really, the wing adjusted forward or swept back to either provide additional lift/ maneuverability or was swept back to provide less lift/ drag to go faster)</p>
<p>Everything else = fixed wing (wing doesn't move, it is the center of everything for the aircraft, with some exceptions)</p>
<p>V-22 Osprey = freak of nature. Do not trust this thing. It floats with magic and is usually filled with pissed-off crayon-eaters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best counter-example for fixed wing aircraft is an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGwVZIWEUoE" target="_blank">autogyro</a>.  It looks like a helicopter but works like a normal (fixed wing) aircraft: the engine drives a propeller and the (free spinning) wings are unpowered with the lift coming from the forward motion of the airframe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
