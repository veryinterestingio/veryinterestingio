		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’d like to clarify a bit... I’m asking about the simplest organism that sleeps because I’m wondering if EARLY early lifeforms did it. Did/do microbes sleep? If the very first life form didn’t sleep... wouldn’t the first mutation that slept be at a huge disadvantage evolutionarily? The first thing to turn off and lay still in a survival of the fittest world should’ve been eliminated immediately. I get that sleep is important for my complex body, but why was it beneficial to simple organisms, and why was it more beneficial to them than lifeforms that didn’t require it? A brain needs sleep... is it based on consciousness then? Then why would something without that level of brain activity need to rest? </p>
<p>Sorry for rambling... this is keeping me up at night, and I’m trying to figure out why that’s bad for my health. </p>
<p>Keep in mind my brain will let me fall asleep while driving, but won’t let me sleep in my bed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
