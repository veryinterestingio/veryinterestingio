		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve been told it has to do with a small release of adrenaline that occurs in your body when you continue to stay awake. You’ll feel tired, continue on with your day/night, your body realizes you need to stay awake, and it releases a small amount of adrenaline to do so, which keeps you from falling asleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The body is naturally meant to stay up later as a natural protective system . This in return makes the body think that you are staying up late because there is danger. </p>
<p>The same can be seen when changing time zones, it's easier to stay up later than it is to go to bed earlier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>About every 20th minute there’s a sleep train. You gotta go on the passing train when it runs past you. If you miss it you will have to wait at least 20 minutes for the next train. My boyfriend taught me this at the age of 25, he had been told this as a small child and I love “getting on the train” when I can feel it coming, and I curse myself when I see it leaving the station without getting on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly, your body releases melatonin to help you go to sleep.  It's pretty rhythmic. Your body will start to release it around the time you normally go to sleep. It will eventually peak and if you resist it ect the process starts over making it harder to go to sleep. </p>
<p>&quot; In humans and most diurnal mammals, melatonin is secreted at night with a robust circadian rhythm and maximum plasma levels that occur around 3 to 4 AM. The daily rise of melatonin secretion correlates with a subsequent increase in sleep propensity about 2 hours before the person’s regular bedtime. The time before this secretion is the least likely for sleep to occur, and when it starts, the propensity for sleep increases greatly as the “sleep gate” opens. &quot;<a href="https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/role-melatonin-circadian-rhythm-sleep-wake-cycle" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/role-melatonin-circadian-rhythm-sleep-wake-cycle" target="_blank">https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/role-melatonin-circadian-rhythm-sleep-wake-cycle</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
