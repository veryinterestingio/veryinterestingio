		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would be extremely unusual for an airplane to suffer a crash as the result of atmospheric turbulence, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BOAC_Flight_911" target="_blank">but it has happened at least once before</a>. In the accident I linked, in 1966, a Boeing 707 flying near Mount Fuji hit very strong atmospheric turbulence associated with the movement of air near the mountain and broke up in flight, presumably because the gust loading was so severe that it exceeded the design limits.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/AAR9306.aspx" target="_blank">In a more recent incident (1993), a Boeing 747 freighter encountered severe turbulence as it approached the Chugach Mountains immediately after departing Anchorage, Alaska and suffered severe enough loading that an engine and engine pylon was torn off the aircraft.</a> No one was injured.</p>
<p>It is significant that both of these incidents were suffered by airplanes designed and built  in the 1950s through 1970s. At that time, aircraft design was not as well informed as it is today - it was not possible to apply realistic  wind loading associated with turbulence and do detailed stress calculations over the entire airframe to ensure that there would not be a failure. For example, at the time, federal regulations only required aircraft designers to perform uniaxial loading analysis on engine pylons, rather than accounting for combined lateral and vertical loads. If you can tolerate X force vertically and Y force laterally, you may not be able to tolerate simultaneous application of both loads. Modern aircraft are designed using coupled aerodynamic-structural solvers, so designers can apply an arbitrary flow field and evaluate structural response.</p>
<p>By far the most significant hazard associated with atmospheric turbulence in commercial aviation is the risk of injury to passengers who are unsecured. <a href="https://www.faa.gov/travelers/fly_safe/turbulence/" target="_blank">Turbulence is the leading cause of injury in non-fatal aircraft accidents in the United States.</a> About two thirds of those injuries are suffered by flight attendants rather than paying customers. Turbulence-induced accelerations can, in some cases, cause momentary negative g-loading, i.e. the top of the aircraft becomes &quot;down&quot; and people and objects fall upward - and then down again a moment later. This is why it's vital to stay buckled in your seat unless absolutely necessary, and to keep luggage stowed in the bins or under the seat in front of you.</p>
<p>Atmospheric turbulence is not a major structural hazard to aircraft, but aircraft wake turbulence can be. There have been a few recent accidents where planes have encountered wake turbulence and suffered structural damage or failure as a result. <a href="https://aviationweek.com/business-aviation/german-challenger-totaled-after-a380-wake-turbulence" target="_blank">In 2017, a business jet encountered an A380 wake at cruise altitude and rolled several times and dropped about 10,000 feet before the pilots recovered control.</a> This caused not only injuries to the people inside the aircraft but also structural damage to the airframe. <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief2.aspx?ev_id=20130728X01815&amp;ntsbno=CEN13FA438&amp;akey=1" target="_blank">In 2013, a small aircraft encountered the wake of a narrowbody commercial airplane (an MD80)</a> and broke up in flight either as the result of the wake itself or the pilot's reaction to it. Fortunately, wake turbulence has been a recognized hazard since the early 1970s, when a combination of much larger aircraft being introduced and more crowded airspace began to cause encounters. ICAO and other regulators like the FAA have established separation requirements associated with wake turbulence that reduce the frequency of serious wake turbulence encounters to a very low level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are at least a couple of examples of this happening:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BOAC_Flight_911" target="_blank">BOAC Flight 911</a> was destroyed by clear-air turbulence in 1966. The vertical stabilizer failed.</p>
<p>In the same year, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braniff_Flight_250" target="_blank">Braniff Flight 250</a> was destroyed in thunderstorm-related turbulence. Again it was the tail that failed first.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_587" target="_blank">American Airlines Flight 587</a> encountered wake turbulence from another aircraft. The first officer allegedly used excessive rudder inputs to respond to the turbulence, causing the vertical stabilizer to break off. Whether this counts as &quot;turbulence bringing down the plane&quot; is a matter of opinion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Clear Air Turbulence (CAT) can be significant in that it's invisible (no clouds like thunderstorms to see that something significant is in your path) and that it can be incredibly strong (such when it's associated with the jetstream boundary). A sudden change in airflow can result in uncommanded flight path changes giving the effect of negative G forces, just as was stated above in wake turbulence encounters.</p>
<p>Pilots often offer ATC &quot;ride reports&quot; aka turbulence reports. ATC will then pass on anything significant to following aircraft. There are also SIGMETs (SIGnificant METeorological condition alerts) that are published urgently to advise ATC and pilots of potential hazards from actual reports or forecast conditions. Turbulence categorized as &quot;severe&quot; indicates potential for loss of control of the aircraft and over-stressing of airframes. Aircraft have lost thousands of feet in height recovering from such turbulence and everyone takes this very seriously, indeed.</p>
<p>A website called <a href="http:\\avherald.com" target="_blank">AvHerald!</a> processes reports from global aviation authorities (on commercial air carriers with great detail) on an ongoing basis and includes, like the poster above stated, numerous reports of people &quot;injured by turbulence&quot; in exactly the method described. Neck and back injuries are the biggest, though others occur. They are surprisingly common.</p>
<p>EDIT: I accidentally posted this to the top level when intended to follow up on Coomb's post, which was very well presented...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>for the average commercial aircraft, it's an infinitesimally small possibility--something else would have to go wrong </p>
<p>there is an aerodynamic condition called &quot;flutter&quot; that can lead to catastrophic wing failure, but its more of a factor on experimental-type aircraft (specifically those that are looking for maximum efficiency to weight ratio). flutter looks like this:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tg94QflBY" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tg94QflBY" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tg94QflBY</a></a> </p>
<p>any mass-produced plane is going to have designed and tested for flutter, but generally the longer and thinner the wings (which is good for fuel efficiency) the higher the possibility of permanent deformation or failure of the system when used outside the intended limits (like in a thunderstorm)</p>
<p>so--yes it's possible, but its generally unlikely</p>
<p>also, if by plane you meant any aircraft...i gotta tell you that helicopters will definitely be brought down by turbulence in the right conditions</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
