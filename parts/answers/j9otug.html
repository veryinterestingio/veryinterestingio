		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that humans are pretty unique in our vertical torso set up. Most other animals have the weight of their bodies relatively evenly distributed across 4 points. We put all the weight of supporting our upper half on our lumbar. Even in the best of conditions, problems are bound to happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chairs.  I dont see why this isn't at the top.  Humans are not meant to sit as much as we do.  Our quads tighten up, our hips tilt forward, and our spine compresses.  We sit too much from an early age and all through adulthood</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pro-tip: as you age, you will find everything starts to hurt.  But to your question: In addition to all the good fitness advice I would add one other thing.  Get in the habit of getting good sleep.  A common symptom of chronic lack of sleep is muscle spasms in the back - people often call it a &quot;pinched nerve&quot; but it's really a muscle that just winds itself up and won't let go because your sleep-deprived brain has lost the ability to send it the right signals.</p>
<p>OK, here's one more thing.  As you're getting older and working out, you will want to spend more time on warming up.  It will save you a bunch of workout injuries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
