		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As we learn physical complex actions, we begin to &quot;chunk&quot; them, that is, group them together into what the brain considers a single action.  A novice thinks in terms of placing each finger on a piano key, and expert thinks in musical keys and intervals and chord progressions, and other advanced musical things I have no idea about.</p>
<p>Once an action is chunked, the brain loses visibility to the individual details.  An expert pianist can play the second inversion of an F minor seventh as a single action without being specifically aware they were playing C Eb F Ab.  If that pianist knew there was a thumbtack on Eb, they would have a hard time avoiding it.  They would have to start thinking in terms of individual notes, could no longer chunk things together, and their playing would suffer greatly.</p>
<p>A similar thing happens when you are performing repetitive chunked actions.  We get a little bored, pay attention to the action, then start thinking inside the chunks, which breaks them.  Even worse, we are aware this can happen, so we are actively thinking about not thinking about something, which of course tends to make us think about it more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Flow state requires you to be detached from thought.</p>
<p>When you overthink, it hinders your ability to tap into the flow of things.  Which is why when you overthink things, and let nerves get to you, you mess things up very easily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Now that there are fewer predators, our brains are still trying to find where the next danger or attack is, and we get caught up in the whirl of catastrophizing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
