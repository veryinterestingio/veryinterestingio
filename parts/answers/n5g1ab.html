		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you throw a blueberry at a window, it will bounce off. If you throw a rock at the window, the rock won't bounce and also the window will break. All of the pieces of the window are still there in a pile on the floor, but it's definitely not &quot;a window&quot; anymore.  The same happens to colorful objects, but the blueberry is regular light and the rock is UV. The UV breaks the molecules that gave the object its color. Now those molecules are in a pile on the floor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Colourful things are made up from dyes. Dyes are molecules which are lots of atoms bonded together. </p>
<p>Now imagine each atom is a lego brick and a dye molecule is a lego model. </p>
<p>Sunlight is made up from particles called photons. Theses are like little hammers. </p>
<p>Now imagine if you hit your lego model with a hammer it will break into its individual lego bricks. </p>
<p>This is the same process when dye molecules are broken up by sunlight and its called photodegredation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something known as <em>photodegradation</em>
It is all about the chemical makeup of an object. The technical term for color fading is photodegradation. There are light absorbing color bodies called chromophores that are present in dyes. </p>
<p>Ultraviolet rays are one of the causes of fading because they can break down chemical bonds and fade the color in an object. Other major contributors to fading include visible light and solar heat.</p>
<p>Some objects may be more prone to this bleaching effect, such as dyed textiles and watercolors. Other objects may reflect the light more, which makes them less prone to fade.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When pigments reflects light, it absorbs and then re-emits the photon. Sometimes the photon imparts enough energy to break one of the bonds making up the molecule, changing the color it reflects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Somewhat more complicated explanation: Actually most chemicals look colourless to us because their electrons absorb in the ultraviolet (very energetic light). The colours we see are actually caused by absorption of unusually weak (long wavelength) photons by electrons. Often the electron can absorb such an unusually weak photon because it is part of and can move over a very big organic pigment molecule, which lowers the energy needed to excite one of those electrons  (because the others can jump in and take its place). Now like I said the UV part of the light is absorbed by many more kinds of electrons and this can result in very reactive molecules, break all kinds of bonds and stuff. And if it breaks the big electron continuum of the pigment molecule in two, the molecule will lose its special ability to absorb these unusually weak photons and thus have a colour.
TLDR: UV light is very aggressive and destroys many things, especially the often complicated molecules which have colour.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
