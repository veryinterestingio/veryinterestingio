		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is not possible in the long term, at least not for planets. Let's consider that the atmosphere always remains aerodynamically flyable by a suitable craft, which is around 100 km on Earth (depends on the design of the craft really, but air density has a big say in it). It's less on Mars and more on Titan.</p>
<p>So let's put Titan in orbit around Earth and have their atmospheres touch. Interesting things happen here, as we've really caused both objects to overflow their Roche lobes. Do the math, and you find that the surface of Titan is 500-900 km from the surface of Earth. That's very low!</p>
<p>Things get really exciting really quickly. Earth, being more massive, strips atmosphere from Titan. It's a slow process, but eventually Titan would have no appreciable atmosphere left. It won't get this far, though. It'd need around half a million to a million years, and we don't have  that time.</p>
<p>The most exciting thing is the tidal effect. Being in a prograde orbit at 3,400 km (Titan's radius is 2,500 km), it orbits once every 115 minutes, rising in the west and setting in the east, really whipping around Earth. It raises, depending on location, 1 km to 5 km water tides and a 100-200 metre land tide. This causes cataclysmic earthquakes and complete volcanic resurfacing of both bodies, but more fun is still to come.</p>
<p>As Earth rotates much more slowly than Titan is orbiting, it sweeps the tides back a little, causing slight concentrations of mass just behind where Titan is in its orbit. This pulls Titan back ever so slightly, speeds up Earth's day a little, and lowers Titan's orbit. After around 50,000 years, Titan has experienced so much tidal drag that it gives Earth a nice big hug. The disintegrating Titan will smear itself around Earth's equator, leaving a trail of 10 to 100 km deep, 800 km wide gouges down to the upper mantle, boiling the atmosphere and leaving behind fractured, smashed terrain. It's not so much an impact crater as a complete obliteration of Earth's entire surface.</p>
<p>So in short, yes you can do this, but you don't want to be anywhere near either of them if you do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To some extent, it depends how much atmosphere would be enough to satisfy you. The definition of the exosphere includes all the molecules still gravitationally bound to a planet. There's no hard limit on that, and since the Moon is gravitationally bound to Earth, it would be within the exosphere, if not for pressure from the Sun on those molecules knocking them out of orbit. Further away from a star, and you could get that.</p>
<p>But you're probably not interested in a few loose molecules zipping around. There gets to be a pretty direct conflict then; the more contact there is between atmospheres, the more drag.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would think the orbit would have to be so close, and the satellite so massive, that it would certainly be within the Roche limit if the atmospheres touched.</p>
<p>Once you take into account just how thin our atmosphere is in terms of planetary radius, I'm pretty sure it's impossible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the moon is sufficiently massive,  yes. Each world will be stretched out into an egg shape comforming to its Roche Lobe. There are known real-world astronomical examples of this at the low and high ends of the mass scale (contact binary asteroids and overcontact binary stars which share an outer envelope) and no particular reason to think that the arrangement wouldn't be stable for planet-mass bodies as well.</p>
<p>Robert Forward, a giant of hard science fiction, already wrote a well-known series of books about just such a system, starting with <em>Rocheworld</em> (also published as <em>Flight of the Dragonfly</em>).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
