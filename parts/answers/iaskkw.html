		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Insect flight is influenced by many factors, including visual, olfactory, auditory, and temperature signals from the external world; as well as internal variables like hunger or memory states. Since these signals can have a very complex structure (think of the puffs and whirls of an odor signal like a candle's smoke plume) and are very hard to measure experimentally, the resulting flight trajectories can still look very random, and it's an open question how much of a given flight trajectory could be perfectly predicted if one knew the values of all these influencing signals at every moment. That said, one of a fly's main &quot;goals&quot; in life is to find food and mates, and there are search algorithms that benefit from certain kinds of randomness, so it may benefit the fly brain to have some kind of random-number-generator-like neural circuit to help create these random-seeming flight patterns. (See <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1831497/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1831497/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1831497/</a></a> for instance about a useful movement pattern called Levy flight.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is some super interesting research on flies (often /Drosophila/) flying in seemingly random patterns but theyâ€™re altered by the presence of odor and other stimuli... Tao et al. (2019 I believe) actually were able to use hierarchical hidden markov models to model flight (a) broken down into a few types of motion and (b) the breakdown of these types being influenced by odor</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
