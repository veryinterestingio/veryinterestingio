<p>The entire reason that we have butcheeks is that they are our glute muscles that allow us to control balance and power our walking and running on two legs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To elaborate on what u/cbd03b said. Our butt muscles are there to help keep us upright when standing and running. The book Born To Run (which was somewhat controversial) recounts a lot of interesting studies about how humans run. We actually barely use our butt muscles while standing or walking, but they are working very hard when we run. We don't have a tail which many other animals use for counter balance while running. So instead the position of our but muscles helps us run smoothly and by engaging to keep our upper body movement still while our legs are moving quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
