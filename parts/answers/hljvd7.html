		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you can’t ride a bike as slowly as you can walk. There will be a maximum speed you can maintain up a hill depending on your fitness, you and your bikes combined weights and the steepness of the hill. If that speed is below a certain level (maybe 2mph) then you won’t be able to balance your bike and will find cycling very hard. Obviously you don’t have a minimum speed when walking so you can reduce your speed as much as you like.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because when you're cycling uphill you have to constantly push the pedals hard enough (apply enough power) to act against (the slope-parallel component of) gravity and to overcome friction while maintaining a speed that allows you to keep yourself balanced, and if you use a very low gear (which makes it easier to overcome gravity) you need to spin the pedals faster to maintain that minimum speed. When you're walking, instead, you're only pushing forward against gravity for part of the walking movement, with the friction between your feet and the ground doing most of the work in the remainder of the time (there is a bit of energy expenditure to arrest the downward movement towards the end of each step, but it's not much and you're not pushing the bike then), and you can go at slow as you wish (and pretty much always go slower than the slowest you can go on a bike).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A bike is a tool that moves you just like a lever is a tool that lifts things. Depending on where the center of that lever is, it might be easier just to pick the weight up. </p>
<p>If the center of the lever is closer to you than the thing you’re lifting, then you get more DISTANCE of lifting up because you put more POWER into pushing down. </p>
<p>It’s the same with a bike. When you pedal, the circle your feet go is smaller than the circle your wheels take you. But you get more power in the wheels which takes you a longer distance than you could walk. </p>
<p>But when it comes to a hill, you need more power because you’re not just traveling across, you’re traveling UP. It’s like having too much weight on a lever whose center is near you. It’s just easier to lift it. When you walk your bike up the hill, you’re just turning the power and distance combination back to normal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It isn’t if you use the proper gear for the % of incline.</p>
<p>Bikes are harder to start moving than walking but easier to continue because of their initial weight at your starting point and then momentum, there is almost no drag on a wheel bearing and a tyre against a road, if you stop peddling your momentum carries you, if you stop walking, you just stop.</p>
<p>As you approach an incline you will be carried by your momentum until gravity matches and outweighs you. Then you have to fight against gravity with the added weight of the bike. If you dropped down to your lowest (Granny) gear, you would be able to contribute with relative ease up to a point where your leg strength wasn’t capable of carrying your weight and the weight of the bike, at that point you may find it easier to stop the bike and push it as it uses the same muscles but in a different order or hierarchy. As a perfect example of this think of Triathletes, they swim 2.4 miles, ride 115 and then run a marathon at the end and their running gait and speed is as if they were fresh out of bed.</p>
<p>A lot of downhill riders, like myself, will stubbornly “never ride up hills” which started as a joke, but it does actually help keep your legs fresh for the descent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
