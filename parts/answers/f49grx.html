		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The two space shuttles that blew up had their explanation from video and understanding of what was going on.</p>
<p>The Challenger had a bad o-ring seal which was expected by some of the engineers in advance but they were overruled the flight took off anyway. They demonstrated later that an o-ring at a low temperature wouldn't be able to keep things sealed and that was consistent with what happened.</p>
<p>With Columbia they could see where the problem started and then reviewing video they could see the damage that happened to the wing.</p>
<p>Edit: corrected shuttle name</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the cause of a failure is unknown you can also try something called a fault tree analysis. By ruling out all the faults on branches of the tree that canâ€˜t have occured (by seeing if observational data is inconsistent with the fault) you should end up with very few probable causes left.</p>
<p>That of course requires that all possible faults and their interactions have been thought of before. Sometimes new and unexpected failure modes can occur.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As u/SirHerald has explained, there is often video evidence as well as pre-event analysis by engineers saying &quot;this is a possibility.&quot;  However, there are other methods used to determine root cause(s) in aerospace (and marine vehicles, etc.).</p>
<p>Space vehicles and test aircraft are outfitted with &quot;telemetry,&quot; which transmits/records a number of different readings/conditions (a &quot;black box&quot; on production aircraft is a simplified form of this).  If you know the performance characteristics, temperature, g-loading, speed, altitude, attitude (position relative to the wind and earth), system parameters (oil temperature, throttle setting, fluid pressures, etc.), control inputs by the crew, recordings of what the crew is saying, etc. you can see if one or more of them are out of order.  Combine that with any physical evidence, and then you can understand that something was the cause of the incident or was the result of the incident. When you combine all of this, you can pinpoint the root cause(s).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Despite the geniuses commenting, after the Columbia disaster, I witnessed the military be deployed to stand guard at every bit of debris found by reconnaissance, as it lay on the ground (sometimes for days), across east Texas. The debris was recovered by specialists and combined at a warehouse. </p>
<p>ALONG WITH video and telemetry the physical pieces were studied and placed to approximate the destructive event.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to do failure analysis for a living.  Take all the broken parts that are available, figure out how it is supposed to work.  Read alloy, polymeric and ceramic fracture surfaces to figues out which direction cracks propagated in.  Trace the fracture back along the path to the origin.  Figure out what event provided enough energy to start the crack at the origin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
