		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We're playing the odds really. When you get right down to it, life is just a complex symphony of chemistry.</p>
<p>For life to exist, you need three basic things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A building block for making complex molecules. An atom that is capable of forming many stable bonds with other atoms to create a variety of complex molecules.</li>
<li>A means of generating energy because without energy, there won't be a way to animate life.</li>
<li>A medium in which all of that wonderful chemistry can take place. For chemicals to react, they need to get in contact with one another. That requires a medium in which that can happen.</li>
</ul>
<p>And ideally, the elements above should not be rare. The more common they are, the higher the likelihood that things come together in a way that makes life possible.</p>
<p>That's why all Earth life is carbon-based. Carbon is an extremely common element in the universe and it can form up to four stable bonds with other atoms. It's not just capable of doing so, it tries extremely hard to do so. That makes carbon capable of creating a staggering variety of complex molecules.</p>
<p>Nearly all life on Earth generates energy through the process of oxidation. Once again because this a chemical reaction that uses an extremely common element, namely oxygen. And it's a simple reaction that creates a lot of energy.</p>
<p>And finally, Earth life uses water as a medium for those reactions to take place in because water is made of two of the most common elements in the universe, hydrogen and oxygen.</p>
<p>So why not alternatives? It's not impossible but when you start to look at alternatives, they all complicate the likelihood of life by a lot.</p>
<p>The periodic table of elements is very predictable. It starts with hydrogen, which has one proton and one electron, then comes helium with two protons and two electrons and so on. This predictability means we know we're not missing any of the basic elements. We sometimes discover new elements at the far end of the table, but the further you go, the more unstable and rare these elements get. Instability isn't really conducive to the existence of life.</p>
<p>That means we can limit our view to the stable and common elements on the periodic table. And in that list, most of the other candidates simply don't look as likely as carbon-based life that needs water and oxygen.</p>
<p>Take for instance, silicon. Silicon can form four covalent bonds just like carbon. That means that in theory, silicon can support a large number of complex molecules just like carbon.</p>
<p>The trouble is that silicon loves binding with oxygen. In fact, it loves binding with oxygen so much that it will break molecules just to bind with oxygen instead. If silicon comes into contact with water, it'll break the oxygen atoms out of the water molecules to bind them to itself.</p>
<p>And when silicon binds with oxygen, you get silica. Which is basically rock. As you can imagine, turning to stone in the presence of oxygen is problematic for the existence of life. Especially since it means you can now no longer use water or oxygen-based reactions like oxidation.</p>
<p>So we're not saying that it's completely impossible for life to be very different than we know. But if you want to play the odds, there are no better components for life than water, oxygen and carbon that we know off.</p>
<p>Based on our knowledge of chemistry and physics, which we can extrapolate a lot of thanks to the predictable way the periodic table works, we can't imagine better components for life.</p>
<p>And based of our understanding of how atoms come to be, we certainly can't think of any more common component atoms for life than oxygen, hydrogen and carbon.</p>
<p>So if you want to search a truly stupendously, unimaginably large universe for life, water is not a bad starting point for the search.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If someone sent you out to find a medical doctor where would you go. the library or the hospital?</p>
<p>I mean there *could* be a doctor at the library, you don't know there isn't but you have a far better chance at the hospital. </p>
<p>Same with extraterrestrial life.  while life that doesn't need water <em>could</em> exist we stand a much better chance of finding it in an environment with liquid water so focusing effort there has a better chance of return.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something that nobody has said yet is that the only way that we know life to work is if there is a liquid which can be used as a solution. That's the way that atoms and molecules move around. Water is made by a couple of the most common atoms in the universe, and it is great at forming solutions, which are basically water with other stuff just floating around in it. </p>
<p>Life which doesn't depend on liquid water isn't impossible, but it's probably going to be far less likely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It could, sure. However, we need to have some kind of criteria when searching for life. We don't KNOW that life without water is possible so what would we even look for? Instead we start by looking for the prerequisites for the only type of life that we actually know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
