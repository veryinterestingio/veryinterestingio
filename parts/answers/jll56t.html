		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Size does play a role. But, in general, the big difference is between enveloped and non-enveloped viruses.</p>
<p>Some viruses have a capsid that is surrounded by a fatty &quot;envelope.&quot; Fats, or more precisely here lipids, are more susceptible to disruption by things like soap, acid, or alcohol. If the envelope is destroyed, the virus is no longer able to infect cells. This is why many viruses that infect your gut (and have to survive your stomach acid) are non-enveloped.</p>
<p>The composition of the capsid or envelope also plays a role. Embedded in the envelope are proteins that can confer stability. Stomach acid will destroy many envelopes, but some are protected by protein &quot;reinforcements,&quot; as it were.</p>
<p>The size of an envelope also affects stability. Smaller particles will have higher curvature, a physical property. High curvature can reduce the stability of envelopes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Coronavirus clearly does not need large &quot;droplets&quot;. Neither do other respiratory viruses, it seems. For the last decade or so, there has been a lot of emerging evidence that we have respiratory viruses all wrong and that they are in fact primarily spread through aerosols. Coronavirus has only strengthened this evidence. It's pretty much undeniable now, IMO.  </p>
<p>The original linked comment is clearly wrong in its assertions that coronavirus is too heavy to stay in the air. This has been disproven by multiple studies now.</p>
<p>See here for one example of this evidence: <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30323-4/fulltext" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30323-4/fulltext" target="_blank">https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30323-4/fulltext</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know particle size is correlated with the ability for it to get deeper into your lungs. But I think there's something to do with the viral load as well. </p>
<p>It is and it isn't 'droplets' those are usually larger particles of fluids. When it infects your lungs further in, it can be transmitted on basically the shaken apart 'droplets' we call 'bioaerosols' which is still the same thing, just a smaller object. </p>
<p>I think it has to do with capsid composition, viral load, and lung infection. After all you're not likely to breathe out an infection that targets the gut. Viral load I think is a factor because that's just &quot;It's everywhere and trillions of them.&quot;   </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OOH!!! OOH!!! I CAN ANSWER FOR CHICKEN POX!!!
I did a study on the herpes family which chicken pox or varicella zoster is a part of, much like its' also commonly known relatives, HSV 1, HSV 2 and HPV, it's passed through contact with the infection, which is why hygiene is so important with the people surrounding an infected individual as well as the individual, it's also vitally important to keep surfaces they come into contact with clean as well because the virus can live on surfaces for up to seven days unless measures are taken to stop the spread such as disinfecting common work and otherwise surfaces, like a bathtub or kitchen bench. To prevent reinfection in the case of varicella zoster it's also highly recommended to thoroughly was all bedding and clothes.</p>
<p>Wow. I was able to partially answer a science question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
