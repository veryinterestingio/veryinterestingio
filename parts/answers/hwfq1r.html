		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was a slow process where countries using their own calendars found the confusion in communicating with other countries greater than the confusion caused by switching. </p>
<p>Russia arrived at the 1908 Olympics 12 days late because they forgot to convert from Gregorian to Julian Calendar. The Russian Revolution of 1917 is called the October Revolution, even though to the rest of the world it happened in November.</p>
<p>The pope created Gregorian calendar in 1582. UK switched in 1752, Russia in 1918. Other countries switched or started using Gregorian when their European influence increased.</p>
<p>Wikipedia has a good list of when countries started using Gregorian Calendar: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_adoption_dates_of_the_Gregorian_calendar_per_country" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_adoption_dates_of_the_Gregorian_calendar_per_country</a></p>
<p>Saudi Arabia was last in 2016. Before that it was Greece in 1923.</p>
<p>It should be noted that some countries switched away from Gregorian before switching back. Lithuania for example, switch to in 1585, back to Julian in 1800 and then back again in 1915.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As other commenters said, Answer 1 is Europeans did it.</p>
<p>Answer 2 is more involved. Roughly 2000 years ago, the Julian Calendar was established. 12 months, the same 30 and 31 (plus 28) day months, 7 day weeks, 365 day years. The astronomers at the time were precise enough that they knew a leap day was needed every 4 years to keep in sync.</p>
<p>That system was precise, but not precise enough. By the middle ages, a lot of places had undergone calendar drift, where the seasons no longer line up where they should. Some people corrected by adding leap days at coronations and such, but it got confusing quickly. Pope Gregory XIII comissioned astronomers to fix the system during his time as pope. In 1582, they said a particular day was Friday, the 15th of October. People generally had to skip forward 10 days, but it fixed the drift we already had. Now, leap years occur on years that are multiples of 4, but not multiples of 100, but being a multiple of 400 makes it a leap year again. 1700, 1800, 1900, not leap years. 2000, leap year.</p>
<p>That was one time a particular authority told everyone to sync up and they did. Of course, many other calendars are still in use today, but that's the calendar most people on Reddit use.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In India, the native tradition was to count the days since the last full moon (purnima) or new moon (amavasya). There really was no observance of a week at all, and none of the Hindu holidays are based on the day of the week. When the Romans started spreading their weekdays, it came to India, and now the days of week in many Indian languages are based off that: Sun Day, Moon Day, Mars Day, Mercury Day, Jupiter Day, Venus Day, and Saturn Day, using the Indian names of the planets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The system we currently use came into existence at some point about 2000 years ago in what was then the roman empire. The days of the week were named after celestial bodies, that is the sun and moon and the planets which themselves were named after gods.</p>
<p>In Germanic languages like English those names were switched to the corresponding Norse gods. Tyr instead of Mars as the god of war Odin instead of Mercury for the god of wisdom and Thor instead of Jupiter for the thundergod slot. Venus was replaced by Freya or some other female deity that sounded similar. Only Saturn kept his day perhaps due to the lack of any chthonic gods of death and the underworld that would have been a good fit. </p>
<p>The weekday concept spread  throughout Europe and even to Asia while mostly being kept synced up or getting re-synced when more regular contact was reestablished later.</p>
<p>This goes so far as to include distant places where they don't name either planets nor days of the week after gods, but they do name both after the 5 elements and the relation stays synced.</p>
<p>The origin of the whole 7 day week is probably from a way to have quarters of a lunar cycle. Unfortunately that comes up about 3/8th of a day short so any continuous cycle of 7 days will inevitably dirt out of sync with a lunar calendar very quickly.</p>
<p>Judaism probably helped popularize the week as a thing independently from the month it was originally derived from.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
