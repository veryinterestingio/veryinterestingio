		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have a natural instinct to stretch. Stretching is good for you, and it can be observed in many animals other than humans.</p>
<p>As a result of stretching beneficial to preventing injury, your brain releases reward hormones that make you feel good in order to encourage stretching.</p>
<p>Stretching is most beneficial after being still for a long time, such as after sleeping. Therefor, you've evolved to receive the most pleasure from stretching after sleeping.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you stretch you are essentially forcing blood to muscles that have been relaxed for extended periods of time and the sensation of the blood running back into those muscles feels good. It can also make you feel light headed (which can slightly add to the sensation of pleasure) as you are pulling blood away from other areas of your body, such as your head.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
