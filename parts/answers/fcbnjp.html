		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The weak force does not have the same 1/r^(2) dependence that the gravitational force (or 1/r potential) does. The 1/r potential for the Coulomb and gravitational forces comes from the fact that the photon and graviton (if it exists) are massless.</p>
<p>The weak bosons are not massless, so what you get instead of 1/r is something like e^(-kr)/r, where k is proportional to the mass of the boson. And the weak bosons have very large masses, meaning that the weak potential has a very short range.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
