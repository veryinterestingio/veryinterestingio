		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trainee clinical psychologist here. There's no current diagnosis of psychopath. That term, and sociopath, are a bit outdated and currently covered by antisocial personality disorder in the DSM-V (the manual used to diagnose mental health disorders).</p>
<p>It's a good question though. Theres no reason why the two shouldn't overlap. It's entirely possible (if not quite likely) that someone diagnosed with ASPD could have experienced distressing traumatic events when younger. That distress could reach a diagnosis of PTSD and they may have developed ASPD as a response to that trauma (or they may be unrelated but I would find this highly unlikely). Personally I would be surprised if someone with this diagnosis hadn't experienced some form of abuse when they were younger (though they may not).</p>
<p>When you think about it, it makes a lot of sense. Reduced empathy, heightened aggression and self-serving behaviour are relatively effective self-protection strategies at face value. They keep others away from you, reduce the chances of being caught in emotionally vulnerable relationships, reduce the chances of people knowing enough to hurt you and make sure that your needs are met before anyone else's. Quite a sensible response to trauma... Though perhaps not the most useful for personal growth and fulfilment.</p>
<p>But, yes, since ASPD is characterised by an unwillingness or inability to consider the individual's impact on others, there is nothing that precludes a comorbid diagnosis of PTSD. They can still feel fear, anger and sadness like anyone else. They're just not likely to feel compassion for <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>Edit: So it seems a lot of people felt personally affected by the third paragraph I wrote. I just wanted to say that I apologise if it was distressing for anyone. As someone who suffers from mental health difficulties myself, it can be difficult reading things laid out so plainly sometimes. It wasn't my intent to cause any upset and now I'm thinking perhaps I spoke bluntly.</p>
<p>If anyone was, I'd just like to say that there is help available for things like this and, if you're motivated, change is possible. If you do want things to be different, professional guidance can make a world of difference. Hope you're all ok! Doing my best to respond to as much as I can but I'm quite busy atm so I may not get time to reply to everyone!</p>
<p>Edit 2: Nobody complained! Everyone's been lovely and respectful (except that one guy). Just wanted to make sure people is ok!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have offered great responses. But many don’t directly answer your question, so I will: “yes, but...” </p>
<p>I believe the answer is yes but that takes some qualifying. I want to offer some anecdotal information, and some references to journals, to bolster some of the responses and mine.</p>
<p>Take Ted Bundy: a group of roughly 80 psychologists got together in 07 and created a consensus profile of the killer.</p>
<p>They said he was a “classic example of Antisocial Personality Disorder” with all of the markers of the diagnosis. In addition, while others have said the term Psychopath or sociopath is outdated, in favor of ASPD, not everyone in the field agrees with that (some have the view that all psychopaths have ASPD but not all who have ASPD have psychopathy). Those who don’t, believe that Bundy was a “prototypical psychopath.” (Daryl Turner, PhD, Forensic Psychologist). Other consensuses included a diagnosis or recognition of possessing markers above the diagnostic threshold for Borderline Personality Disorder, Narcissistic Personality Disorder, and Bipolar Personality Disorder.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough - and I say all of the above to say this - Ted did exhibit some signs of empathy, regret, and shame. Though these moments were short lived or temporary, there were times where he attempted to disassociate himself from his actions - he didn’t want to talk about some of his more violent moments in multiple interviews. He squirmed over some of the gruesome questions he was given about his actions.</p>
<p>Experiments done on so-called “psychopaths”  (as recent as 2013) and their capacity to feel empathy resulted in conclusions that psychopaths ARE capable of feeling empathy. But this empathy-capacity is not present at all times and during all situations - obviously, killers or rapists don’t empathize with their victims in the moment. But the capacity, in other instances, is there and measurable. The experiment referenced is measuring the brain waves of a “psychopath” while they watch someone’s hand slapped with a ruler. Their brains would trigger a response indicating a neural “mirror” response which translates to empathy. Essentially, their brains react like ‘that hand was hit, hands being hit cause pain, and if my hand was hit it would cause my hand pain.’</p>
<p>See: Pemment, Jack. (2013) Dissecting Empathy: How Do Killers Experience Other People, /Psychology Today/.</p>
<p>So, essentially, my response is to say (and to get at your question): “psychopaths,” which is still a term used by some in the field, are not emotionless robots. They are capable of fear, pain, laughter, happiness, (controversially) love, sadness, etc. While they don’t feel these emotions at all times, the capacity is there. Rates of PTSD are probably considerably lower than the general population, however.</p>
<p>Journals into the subject indicate a theory that Psychopathy and similar conditions can act as a protective buffer against conditions like PTSD but doesn’t outright preclude such a condition. Said another way, if you did a vin diagram of psychopathy compared to PTSD, there’d be an extremely small sliver of overlap.  (Side note: Again, this is a 2017 journal that still references Psychopathy as a legitimate diagnosis. Also, many psychologists can’t even agree on how much they like the DSM-V compared to the DSM-IV. The field of psychology, like many fields, is marked with politics. Diagnoses and even the tools for diagnosing patients are wrapped up in politics).</p>
<p>See: Moul, Caroline &amp; Nickerson, Angela. (2017) Psychopathic Personality Traits as a Protective Factor Against the Development of Intrusive Memories, /Journal of Experimental Psychology/, Vol. 8, Issue 1, 2-12.</p>
<p>So “yes, but...” at a much smaller rate of incidence as the general “non-psychopathic” population... given that you accept psychopathy as a valid diagnosis... and that you accept the research presented on the topic... but only IF said so-called psychopath falls into the much smaller population of psychopaths whose condition didn’t sufficiently act as a buffer to intrusive memory based conditions like PTSD.</p>
<p>Great question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People with severe anti-social disorders often have trauma associated with it. PTSD is a spectral and varied disorder. Its symptoms are not consistent between sufferers. So yes, absolutely people with anti-social disorders can and often do have PTSD.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
