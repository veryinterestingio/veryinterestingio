From carbs to meat to diary to saturated fat to grains, left with very little if you stop eating everything that everyone says might cause problems.</p>
<p>Has there actually been any  scientific studies on this? Like even at the individual level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/acne/acne-causes" target="_blank">They don't.</a></p>
<p>Acne is (highly simplified) a minor infection of one of the sebaceous glands on your skin. To create an pimple, you need sebum (natural face oil. again, simplifying) which has become inundated with bacteria. There are a variety of ways this combination can occur: overproduction of sebum i.e. during puberty, poor hygiene, picking at your skin with dirty fingers, wearing tight-fitting non-breathable clothing on the area. Basically, anything that helps bacteria and oil build up, while not taking steps to clean it off, will contribute.</p>
<p>While some foods cause you to produce more sebum, the direct links between why this happens are not well understood, and producing more sebum alone is not enough to cause acne breakouts (though it won't help). It doesn't help that the world is plagued with urban myths about certain specific foods (chocolate, pizza) causing acne.</p>
<p>Pizza will definitely give you acne if you rub it on your face. Eating it, however, probably won't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
