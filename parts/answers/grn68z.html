		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other comments here there are a few others things:</p>
<ul>
<li>More close ups: Domestic TV screens were usually quite small compared with the movie experience. As a result directors tended to use more close ups. Faces, and the expressions they have are necessary to convey the story line and if shot in the same way as for movies, they would simply not have been visible enough for a domestic environment - so you get more faces and they are closer.</li>
<li>One side effect of the above is that titles on made-for-TV movies tend to be bigger so they can be read. Typical movie credits are often too small. Similarly things with writing such a phone screens, monitors, books, signs, letters are all closer.</li>
<li>Fewer longshots: Similarly, large panoramas, distant landscapes etc look great on a big screen but on a smaller domestic screen a lot of the detail and &quot;atmosphere&quot; is lost so these tend to be less frequent and also closer.</li>
<li>Fewer &quot;blacks&quot;: Movie theatres are generally darkened so you can have deep dark shadows on film and still see into them. Domestically, TVs are often watched in a more brightly lit room. Those dark scenes would be impenetrable so lighting tends to be turned up and less contrasty for a TV movie.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised nobody mentioned a rather large part between the two. Movies are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_grading" target="_blank">color graded</a> to a higher degree, like in this <a href="https://i.imgur.com/pWyGp3I.jpg" target="_blank">example</a> (notice the orange and blue hue differences, in real life they didn't look that blue/orange). Most people don't realize it, but there are usually people hired in a movie production whose job is to painstakingly color grade each scene for a cinematic effect.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.psdbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1-example.jpg" target="_blank">This</a> is a direct comparison. Notice how in the movie everything has a green-ish/blue look to it? It's extremely memorable and is often done to give movies &quot;artistic themes&quot;, like the Matrix did with its color grading while Neo was in the Matrix.</p>
<p>It can completely change the mood of a scene with such a simple change, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/yCuxKke.jpg" target="_blank">like in this photo</a>, the one on the right uses more cool colors for a more depressed, ragged look, whereas the 'true-to-life' looks more healthy and positive</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Typically new shows are shot and broadcast at 4k/1080i 30fps, using cameras, lighting, and lenses that tend to keep everything evenly lit, and in focus. </p>
<p>Cinematic shows can be shot on either film or digital. The framerate first of all being reduced to 24fps, because this is just the cinematic &quot;feel&quot;. Plus they tend to use more deliberate lighting, lenses, and framing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have to understand that on a big budget production...they have a big budget. Every element that the camera &quot;sees&quot; is tailored to specifically what the director saw in their mind as they read the script. (Arguably, this &quot;vision&quot; is part of why directors are chosen. A John Ford movie looks like a John Ford movie, and that's something a studio is willing to pay for. They're willing to pay this guy a buttload of money to be a prick and say &quot;That horse on the far left, #412 of the scene, he led with his left forefoot. This is a right-hand regiment, reset, rebuild that wall brick-by-brick, prepare to reshoot, and get that horse taught to walk properly!&quot;) </p>
<p>A made for TV (MFTV) movie is much more of a &quot;it is what it is, actor walks here, delivers line&quot; product. They don't have the budgeting to really care about the tiniest little detail of a scene. If a jar in the background is reflecting a highlight, as long as it's not really distracting it might be left in this scene and the object moved before the next shot. </p>
<p>In a big production you get a composer writing music played by a 100-piece orchestra. MFTV movie, you get &quot;Sports Highlights Sound Reel 4&quot; in MIDI format in the background. </p>
<p>In a big production, you have someone who is 100% in charge of nothing but lighting, and that person may have hundreds of tint gels to make this light a specific hue for this scene. MFTV, well, this light is &quot;on&quot; and we can turn it &quot;off&quot;, but mostly we want it &quot;on&quot; because we want to &quot;See&quot;. Other than that, um, lighting is okay, yes. </p>
<p>In Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory (1971) one specific scene took over  <strong><em>forty takes</em></strong>...and it wasn't a scene that really brought the end result quality up that much. Good scene, but not exactly a crucial &quot;OMG if we don't get this it's all been for naught&quot; scene. In a MFTV production? I'm not seeing anybody doing forty tries at an essential shot that <em>is</em> crucial to the plotline. At best, we either get the &quot;best of the worst&quot; takes, or the scene would be rewritten around whomever can't get it done. The budget simply can't allow the production to take that much care and concern with a single scene. Get it done, get it shot, move on. If you're paying me $200 per hour to shoot this scene, you end up with a much better result than you'd get for a payment of a &quot;Buy two, get one half-price&quot; coupon for Ramen Noodles. </p>
<p>Basically the <strong><em>TL/DR</em></strong> is that the budget for a studio movie allows the product to have a higher attention to the tiniest details that, alone, mean nothing, but together make the whole thing work artistically. It's the difference between a chef-crafted hamburger with home-grown tomato, lettuce, handmade cheese, hand-ground beef carefully selected for its fat-to-lean ratio...and the $1 Hamburger-Shaped-Object you can buy at Burger king. Both are similar, but you can really identify the differences in how much one is better than the other and how the small details combine to make the overall result better. </p>
<p>This, of course, is in addition to other points others have made about a movie theater having a better visual translation than a TV or phone. The theater screen is what this piece is tailored for. Nobody is tailoring content to be viewed on a dozen randomly chosen TV brands and aspect ratios, they just go with a happy compromise that'll work on most. It's a compromised project whereas a big movie production doesn't understand the concept of compromise and doesn't have to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's definitely a combination of things. The length of shots, filters, angles, and editing all contribute to a film's look. In many cases less time and money is committed to the cinematography for a TV movie.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
