		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My brief googling showed that Ruth Byrne seems to have done some research in this area based on what she told the National Wildlife Federation in <a href="https://www.nwf.org/en/Magazines/National-Wildlife/2010/Handedness-in-Animals" target="_blank">this article</a> Then when I went to try to find anything published by her the best citation I found was in a 2017 post on /r/askscience which I have quoted here:</p>
<p>From &quot;The Soul of an Octopus&quot; by Sy Montgomery: &quot;University of Vienna researcher Ruth Byrne reported that her captive octopuses always choose a favorite arm to explore new objects or mazes... Tank-bound octopuses, at least, are known to have a dominant eye, and Byrne thinks this dominance might be transferred to the front limb nearest the favored eye.&quot; However, as others have stated in the thread, all eight limbs act somewhat autonomously. The author in this section actually refers to the possibility of &quot;bold&quot; and &quot;shy&quot; arms, describing how some arms will display curiosity when presented with a new object while others retreat.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5qog86/do_octopuses_have_a_dominant_right_or_left_side/" target="_blank">here is the rest of the reddit thread</a> if you are interested in the other responses</p>
<p>edit: after some more looking around <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2006-09888-005" target="_blank">here</a> is an article that at least in the abstract does suggest that octopuses have specialized limbs and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166432806002439" target="_blank">here</a> is an article that looks into if the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347202930897" target="_blank">dominant eye of an octopus</a> influences which limbs are used and says in the abstract that they did not find  lateralized behavior. </p>
<p>This is I believe where the conclusion quoted in the reddit post comes from that speculates that octopus arms are specialized but not like left vs right hands and more like the arms are autonomous with some being 'shy' vs 'curious.'</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question was asked previously, ~4 years ago, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/28za10/do_octopuses_exibit_handedness/" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>Here's what I said 4 years ago:
Apparently, they do indeed have a &quot;favorite arm&quot; they use when exploring new things (<a href="https://www.nature.com/news/2004/040615/full/news040614-1.html" target="_blank">source</a>). They also exhibit favored combinations of arms for various tasks as well. As u/vickinick mentioned, this may be related to the fact that it is known they have a very strong preference for using one eye over the other (<a href="http://www.angelfire.com/scifi2/ulrikegriebel/images/Byrne2002octolat.pdf" target="_blank">source</a>), and octopuses use their highly developed vision to get a better sense of what their arms are doing (their arms exhibit some degree of autonomous behavior)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;How did the octopus, a solitary creature with little social life, become so smart? What is it like to have eight tentacles that are so packed with neurons that they virtually “think for themselves”? What happens when some octopuses abandon their hermit-like ways and congregate, as they do in a unique location off the coast of Australia?&quot;</p>
