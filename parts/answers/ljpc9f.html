		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you live in countries outside the USA, you can buy toothpaste that contains a type of bio-glass that will fill in the holes in your teeth. Originally designed to repair shattered bones of soldiers, it was adopted for use in toothpaste. Once the holes are filled in, cold/hot liquids cannot pass into your tooth and irritate the nerve inside.</p>
<p>I have no idea why you cannot buy these toothpastes in the USA. You can order them online from Canadian resellers. Theories range from FDA blocking it's use in toothpaste to a conspiracy by the Dental Association.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you look at your teeth under a microscope, especially the root surface, it’s like looking at a windowscreen. Lots of little holes, or “tubules”. Sensitive teeth toothpaste has an ingredient that seals the tubules so nothing can go through them and hit the nerve of the tooth.
It’s like clear coat nail polish, it seals everything up. However, the best way to use sensitivity paste is to put it on your finger and directly apply it to the sensitive areas and let it sit there as long as you can. Like an ointment. Much more efficacious than simply brushing with it once or twice a day. Most sensitivity toothpastes work very well for sensitivity, but are not great for actually cleaning your teeth. They start working about two weeks after daily use, and will stop working when you stop using it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The nerve cells in our teeth transmit pain signals <em>electrochemically</em>. </p>
<p>Normally, when there's no pain, the nerve cells maintain a slight negative voltage potential (-70 mV) between the inside of cell vs. the outside of the cell.   They do so by regulating the flow of Potassium (K+) and Sodium (Na+) ions.</p>
<p>When nerve cells want to signal &quot;pain&quot;, they let excess the Potassium ions (K+) inside the cells to flow out (and conversely, let excess Na+ ions outside the cells to flow in).  This &quot;de-polarizes&quot; the nerve cell and we feel &quot;ouch!&quot;</p>
<p>Sensitive-teeth toothpaste basically work by flooding the outside of the nerves with K+ ions, from its active ingredient Potassium Nitrate.   </p>
<p>This stops the &quot;pain signaling&quot; from working. The abundance of K+ ions outside the nerve cells stops the K+ ions inside the cells from flowing out.  So the nerve cells can't &quot;de-polarize&quot; and the &quot;pain signal&quot; can't be transmitted.  No signal, no pain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wow an ELI5 I can actually help with. There are two ways toothpastes help with sensitivity. Occlusion (blocking) of the dentin tubules or desensitization of the pupal nerve. </p>
<p>ELI5:
You feel pain when a button is pushed. Someone has to run down a tunnel to press the button. Usually there is a door (enamel) but sometimes the door is broken or worn down, so someone keeps running in and pressing the button. Your teeth has a bunch of buttons inside them.</p>
<p>What toothpaste 1 does: Occlusion/blocking.
Every time you brush you put a brick down. As time goes by the place where the door would be is covered by a brick wall. No one and run down the tunnel and press the button.</p>
<p>What toothpaste 2 does: desensitization
Every time you brush you mess with the button a bit. As time goes by the button stops working. So when someone runs down the tunnel and presses the button, nothing happens.</p>
<p>Of course there are different actives, different properties, but if you have more questions I can answer them in the comments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
