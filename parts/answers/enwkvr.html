If multiple volcanoes are fed by the same magma chamber, there can be more of a direct link, but that is uncommon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn’t really work like that.

We usually have about 30-40 active volcanoes spread throughout the world on any given day, but they don’t trigger neighbors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
