		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Recently I've seen a <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/first-foreign-takeover-ancient-egypt-was-uprising-not-invasion-180975354/" target="_blank">Smithsonian article</a> that suggests the Hyksos were not foreign conquerors of the Egyptian Pharaohs as we had thought, and suggests the affair was an immigrant uprising from a population already living in the area.</p>
<p>Previous common wisdom I've seen suggests that the Egyptians learned of the spoked wheel and chariot from the Hyksos, who we had assumed used the devices to cross the desert and conquer the area for about 100 years.  </p>
<p>But this new information would suggest that if they Hyksos had the wheel, chariots, and horses that the Egyptians must have known of them.  Why would the Egyptians not have adopted this from them until after the Hyksos rule?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whenever there is an extraordinary crop surplus, such as the soybean surplus, why is the only solution post bailout to burn or bury the crop? With the recent potatoes surplus it makes me question if this happens so often shouldn't there be some government backed work force to move these crops so they don't just get wasted? It just sounds like a way to create jobs and lower food waste.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
