Basically while blindfolded she couldn’t tell what she was eating, neither if it had any condiments etc. </p>
<p>But then again, she’s in her 20s and the symptoms are known to vary a lot. I live in the same apartment with her and have yet to have any symptoms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here’s a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/coronavirus-symptoms-respiratory-anosmia-smell-taste-loss-ent-asymptomatic-a9418151.html" target="_blank">reasonable discussion </a> of it (if you can ignore the ads and opening paragraphs)</p>
<p>1) Loss of smell is fairly common in upper-respiratory viral infections. It’s temporary</p>
<p>2) Most of taste is smell, so that’s likely why taste is affected </p>
<p>3) Seems like the mechanism for asnomia is not super-well understood, but it seems like the cilia on your smelling cells go away, and/or the virus causes inflammation of the olfactory nerve causing it to not work well, and/or your nasal cavities are just blocked up by mucous or swelling</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
