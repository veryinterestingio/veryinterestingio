<p>Then you can listen to the actual handshake and follow along:

<p>Yes, this is what network engineers still do with packet sniffers and other protocol analyzers on various types of layer 2 networks like ethernet, PPP, MPLS.. etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Computers use electrical signals to establish connections. Phones take electrical signals and turn them into audible noise ( sure, when sending they also take audible noise and turn it into signals as well ) so what you HEAR is simply the audible representation of the signals sent to establish a connection.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Computers still 'negotiate' the same sorts of details ( at heart ) when making connections today. Its just that we do not do this over phone lines so we would have to design and engineer a new device or system just to play noise as phone modems used to do. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I say this to highlight that us hearing dial up modems at all was a convenient coincidence to provide live-feedback ( think audio progress bar ) of the process. Modems making noise was never a designed engineering goal, but more so taking advantage of a convenient opportunity to provide live-status of the establishment of the connection. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Keep in mind we are spoiled now by solid stable reliable connections. Back in modem-days phone lines kinda really sucked, in comparison to what we have now. Outages and drops were, comparatively, extremely common. Having the modem play noise gave you immediate information on the quality of the connection too - almost diagnostic in a way.</p>
