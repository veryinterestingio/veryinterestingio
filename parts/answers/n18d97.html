		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not from me but it's pretty good imo :</p>
<p>So... it turns out that the self is a fiction.  I mean you exist in the sense that there is a body there, and a brain in that body, and electrochemical impulses firing throughout that brain, that's all (apparently) real.  But this whole 'you' character, not so much.  You don't exist separate from your body, you don't inhabit your body, and your body is not separate from your universe.</p>
<p>See the table in front of you?  No, you don't.  You fake see a pretend table that your brain made up.  That doesn't necessarily mean there is no table, or that there is no brain.  But it does mean that you have no direct experience of anything outside yourself... you only experience the fictional, cartoon versions of things that your brain presents you.  That's why, for example, optical illusions work.  They present a reality that your brain is not well-evolved to fictionalize.  </p>
<p>So the voice in your head comes from your brain.  And the desk in front of you comes from your brain.  And the sky out side is all in your head.  You've never 'looked out'; in all directions you can only see inside your head.  The experiencer and the experience and the experienced are all made of the same stuff, are all the same thing.  You are not separate from your room or from your music, and the voice in your head and your memories of your childhood are not less material or more material than the chair you're sitting on.  You are not separate from your universe, you are your universe, and the ego, the &quot;I&quot;, your sense of separate identity is a fiction that that universe has conjured up.  But it's just smoke and mirrors, a trick of the light.</p>
<p>And ego death is a direct, immediate, absolute experience of your own non-existence and your own co-materiality with the entirety of your universe.</p>
<p>Make sense?  No, of course not.  It's not really something that can be communicated in a reddit post.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've used mushrooms before, and I tend to have a low tolerance to drugs in general. I experienced ego death to a drastic degree. I forgot my own name and the names of the friends I was with. I didn't know where I was or what I was doing. I was just existing and seeing things from a new perspective. It was a humbling experience and I learned a lot from it.</p>

<p>I won't go into the anatomy of the brain because that wouldn't be ELI5, but just know that some parts of the brain are responsible for your sense of self. Those parts make you feel like you are YOU instead of someone else. Ego death happens when those parts of the brain are far less active than usual. You lose your sense of self because that part of your brain is inactive. How would it manifest itself practically in day to day life? It won't. Your sense of self is there for a reason, and not having it regularly could be very harmful. Ego death occasionally can be helpful as a kind of brain reset, but you don't want it as an every day thing. You could start permanently forgetting who you are</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I really don’t like the responses here so far. I don’t feel any of them truly capture what ego death is, or what it means. And that’s understandable because it’s an extremely difficult to process phenomenon that usually only happens under the influence of drugs that alter your state of mind and memory formation, so it’s not the best state to be doing in-depth research and understanding of the already poorly understood human psyche.</p>
<p>First off, we need to have an understanding of what ego <em>is.</em> It’s not just yourself or your internal monologue. Your ego, as it’s been defined by researchers, is a way to filter information. There’s an infinite amount of information being thrown at you from all sources every single day. You have things you see, hear, smell, taste, and with all this information, your brain needs to subconsciously throw most of it away because it isn’t perceived to be important. Taking everything in would overwhelm you, so your brain has a goal of keeping the information at a digestible pace. This is your ego at work, subconsciously taking key pieces of information out of the world as you perceive it, based on what it has learned is important throughout your life. If you were once burned by a candle as a child, you will subconsciously be more aware of a lit candle in a room than most other things in that room, and you won’t be aware this is happening. What you perceive is essentially what your brain has been trained to perceive throughout your life, what you think you see and hear is being filtered through some layer of automatic filtering in your brain to remove what it thinks is useless information.</p>
<p>Now in comes ego death. If you’re introspective long enough, whether it’s from drugs or meditation or something else, you eventually come to the conclusion that you and what you know to be true, is only a piece of a very complex puzzle. You can make some good guesses about things, what things are, why they are the way they are, but it’s impossible to truly take in 100% of the information you are presented. So you wonder what you’ve missed, what things your brain has left out of the view and understanding of the world that it has given you. In a way, it reveals how little control you have over your reality. You can make choices, but they’re influenced by your desires and interests that were formed before you can really remember. You may feel like you have complete agency in normal day-to-day moments, but in ego death you realize you don’t. There’s factors at play you can’t fully grasp. And your understanding of the world is fundamentally altered.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
