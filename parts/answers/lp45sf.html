		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It isn't. The new recommendation is to have someone check in on you every few hours and make sure you are breathing normally. The reason they used to have people wake you was to check your mental faculties and make sure you weren't having a brain bleed. Sleeping actually helps heal after a concussion and it's very important.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is outdated advice.  The reasoning was that you wouldn't be able to notice their symptoms getting worse, because you're not slurring your speech/having balance issues/etc when you're asleep.</p>
<p>The current advice is that if you can walk and talk normally, and your pupils aren't dilated, sleeping is fine.  If you do have those symptoms, you should see a doctor.  In that case, they may recommend waking the patient up a couple of times during the first night, to check that symptoms aren't getting worse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are coherent and responsive, you can sleep. If you've been checked by a doctor, you'll be advised to sleep. It's when you're alone (or not with someone who can be responsible) and/or obviously in a bad way that it's a bad idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sleeping is fine.</p>
<p>It's you being asleep and then no one notices that you are unwell from say a bleed on the brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's a bad idea. Your brain is trying to make the person fall asleep since the brain went through a traumatic injury.</p>
<p>As the other users said it's best to rest and have a person check up on you so often. </p>
<p>There are sometimes when a person will still have symptoms even after a few days, but that's normal. It's abnormal if the person still has those symptoms months later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
