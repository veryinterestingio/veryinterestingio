And from my uninformed point of view, I would think once you get a medicine approved by the FDA you can’t really modify it without having to go through the approval process again, that’s what would make sense to me at least. So id gander we’re still using the same version of the vaccines that was first released</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So far, none of the vaccines on the market have changed their formulations in any significant way. I assume, that minor production details may have changed to optimise yields and so on, but not to an extent that affects final product. </p>
<p>BioNTech/Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca are working on a booster against South African variant, but seeing as that has been gradualy driven down by the Delta, it's hard to say what will happen. Moderna is also working on a refrigerator-stable mRNA-1283.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As people have noted, you cannot change a formulation or the drug substance without going through a new clinical trial.  </p>
<p>The biggest changes from the clinical trials and the approved drug monograph to this point have been 'off label' dosing regimens. Some countries have extended the gap between the two doses (to 2-3 months vs 3-4 weeks) in order to give some protection to a greater proportion of the population in the short term given supply constraints. There has also been dose mixing (heterlogous prime-boost) and some countries are preparing to give 3rd doses to at least some of the population without waiting for clinical trial data.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I heard the Queensland uni actually halted because they were unable to source a sars cov-2 sample to isolate the virus that wasnt already contaminated with monkey cells added to it to grow the virus in.  </p>
<p>It seems no one can isolate it in human tissue.  Which sounds very strange to me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
