		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Certain chemicals have certain shapes. In your tongue, there are places for those things to connect called receptors that are waiting for a certain shape. When they meet, the receptor is activated, signals are sent to the brain, and you taste that chemical.</p>
<p>Remember though, you can only taste a few things: sweet, sour, bitter, salty, umami. Your tongue is only basic equipment, the rest is all smell, though that works basically the same way.</p>
<p>Edit: After at least 20 people commenting about not knowing what umami is:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umami" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umami</a></p>
<p>TIL that people aren't as aware of umami as I thought.</p>
<p>Something to note: one of the ways to develop umami is through fermenting foods (I believe because it releases amino acids). Japan is basically the center of the world for fermentation technology, tradition, and history. It is not really a coincidence that it was Japanese food scientists that discovered it as a separate taste.</p>
<p>Second edit:
Yes, I know that the word &quot;Savory&quot; exists in English. The point is that umami, as a concept, that is, that we learned something about human physiology, is something new. As a result, we imported the Japanese word for it. It's no different than getting Taco from Mexican Spanish or Algebra from Arabic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you can mix certain flavours to come up with new ones. For example, citrus + cinnamon = cola.</p>
<p>However, unlike with light, there are many, many thousands (maybe millions) of primary flavours, because each one is a chemical or a mix of chemicals.</p>
<p>Some single chemicals have a definite flavours, for example amyl acetate on its own is recognizably banana, and benzaldehyde is the bitter cherry flavour, but any flavour that's just a single molecule will taste fake, because real foods have very complex mixtures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I won’t speak about scent, but will say a bit about color and light. The fact that we can mix different colors to get a new “pure color” really has more to do with our eyes than with light itself.   Light can take on a continuous range of frequencies, and can have any amount of each.</p>
<p>Our eyes only have the ability to take 3 measurements, though. We have three different types of cones, and each is tuned to a different peak frequency. You can kinda think of it as us seeing the world through a set of green, red, and blue <em>tinted</em> lenses at the same time.  But they overlap, any particular frequency of light is going to stimulate all three. It just will turn on some of the cones a bit more than the others.</p>
<p>So, our brain takes these three measurements and then constructs “color”.    For instance, there is no frequency of light that corresponds to magenta. It’s just what our brain “sees” when the red and blue cones light up at the same time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A restaurant I used to work at had Reese's cups we put in milkshakes. I found out if I ate one of those and drank their raspberry iced tea at the same time, it tasted EXACTLY like pumpkin pie.</p>
<p>So there's that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
