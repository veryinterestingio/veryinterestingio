		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's make it more ELI5 than the current best answer:</p>
<p>Electricity is weird. There's actually a tiny electrical field <em>around</em> your body, and most living things for that matter. We can make super-sensitive sensors that read electrical fields. We can also know what the sensor will &quot;see&quot; if no living things are near a device. So we tune those sensors to look for changes in the electrical field around them, and how to recognize what it looks like when an object gets close. </p>
<p>It's sort of like how even if your eyes are closed, you can still sort of tell if you're facing towards or away from a lamp. Your eyes are fancy light sensors, and your eyelids let a little light through, so by comparing the amount of &quot;dark&quot; you &quot;see&quot; through your eyelids, you can still figure out a lot about what you're looking at. This sensor &quot;sees&quot; tiny electrical fields.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong></p>
<p>The biggest contention with my answer seems to be, &quot;But doesn't the sensor see the phone's electrical field?&quot; Let's revisit my answer and handle this again.</p>

<p>Yes, the sensor does &quot;see&quot; the phone's electrical field. You also &quot;see&quot; your nose all day long. But unless you really focus on it, you probably don't <em>notice</em> your nose because your brain is used to it being there and removes it from your perception. In the same way, the sensor &quot;sees&quot; the phone's electrical field but is trained to ignore that and look for <em>different</em> fields.</p>
<p><em>More technically</em>, the sensor is really looking for <em>changes</em> in the field. So for the first few seconds after the phone is on, the sensor might think there's an object nearby. The people who made the phone are already aware of that, so for those few seconds the sensor is ignored. After a few moments, the sensor settles down and says, &quot;Hey, the field's not changing anymore.&quot; THAT is when the phone starts listening. If the field changes, something must have brought a new field within the sensor's range. That <em>probably</em> means something with a field is near the phone that wasn't near it before, so the phone assumes an object is near. Later, when that thing moves away, the sensor notes the field has changed back to how it was earlier. Then the phone assumes the object is gone.</p>
<p>Yes, that means things other than your face might get picked up. The engineers who made the phone don't care, all that matters is it detects a face within an inch or two accurately. Any other crazy thing that triggers it is probably someone having fun after reading an ELI5 post, and there's no harm if that is a &quot;false positive&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people explaining the sensor itself, but there isn’t much explanation on its purpose, so here goes:</p>
<p>Different regulatory bodies (FCC, EU, etc.) place restrictions on how powerfully your phone can transmit WiFi and Cellular signal. The catch is, these restrictions are not based on the absolute transmission power, but rather on how powerful the waves are <em>when they come in contact with human tissue</em>. Because waves become less strong as they travel, the further away you are from your phone, the more powerfully your phone can send it’s signal while still following regulations.</p>
<p>This is the purpose of the SAR sensor, it can tell how far human tissue is from the phone and let the device adjust its transmission power accordingly. It’s a small performance optimization that lets your phone eke out a little bit more performance when your phone is say on a table or in your jacket pocket, rather than in your hand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The top response is pretty close. The sensor just detects capacitance. People and pets have body's that have capacitance due to things like blood and electrolytes. If you try a sausage, it will work just like a finger. The physical contents are similar. Living vs nonliving detection is nonsense or just marketing</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
