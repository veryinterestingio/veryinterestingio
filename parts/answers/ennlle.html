When the brain notices that you need water, it triggers the &quot;thirsty&quot; signal. As soon as you drink something, the brain rewards you for what you did and gives you that &quot;ahh, hydration&quot; feeling. What matters to the brain is that you actually did the life-preserving action, no need to wait and see whether the drink actually hydrated you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's something cool to know even if it's a tangent from the poster's question: hydration already began before you even drank the water. </p>
<p>Water balance in the body is mainly controlled by a hormone called Vassopressin [or AVP]. Basically, this hormone is released from the brain when the body is either low in volume (hypovolemic or hypotensive) or too &quot;salty&quot; (or high in electrolytes). What it does is it reabsorbs water in the kidneys to combat dehydration. Since kidneys function 24/7, there's always water to reabsorb.</p>
<p>The brain releases this hormone at a lower threshold compared to the brain recognizing the body is thirsty. So, even without realizing you're thirsty, the body is already reabsorbing the water your kidneys are filtering.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are sensors in your mouth that detect when you consume something. You and your brain know that water has entered and doesnâ€™t need to send thirst signals. </p>
<p>People use this trick to knock thirst while wrestling by spitting water out so they can knock thirst and not have water sploshing around in their stomachs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
