		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Peanuts contain high levels of several heat-stable proteins, collectively known as Ara h proteins (from the scientific name <em>Arachis hypogaea</em>), that can act as antigens. Some people develop IgE antibodies against these antigens, which causes a peanut allergy. Sources: <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11882-014-0429-5" target="_blank">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11882-014-0429-5</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4451826/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4451826/</a></p>
<p>In particular Ara h1 is quite stable, <a href="https://www.jimmunol.org/content/164/11/5844" target="_blank">and the IgE-interacting epitopes can survive digestion.</a></p>
<p>This is why peanut allergies are more common than allergies to other legumes (e.g. peas).</p>
<p>Also as /u/DocWsky mentioned, peanuts are pretty common, so there are many opportunities for exposure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What is interesting is that USA and UK, where pediatricians used to be very careful instructing parents not to introduce kids to peanuts before they were much older, have some of the highest peanut allergy rates in the world. Israel has a baby food that is peanut based introduced to babies when first introduced to solid food. Some of the lowest rates of peanut allergy in the world. Not thought to be genetics based. But early exposure prevents allergy formation apparently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
