		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a satellite orbiting the second Lagrange point beyond the moon. From that point it can see both the Earth and the far side of the moon, and can therefore act as a relay.     </p>
<p>It's &quot;far side&quot;, btw. The dark side is the side that is not illuminated by the sun. Some pinhead will be along shortly to argue that &quot;dark&quot; means &quot;hidden&quot; and that both dark and far side is correct. Screw that. Dark means dark and far means far. Mixing them up just leads to confusion and misunderstandings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
