		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several things happens when you aply glue.
First, the fibers that makes up the paper absorb the glue and swells thus bending the paper outwards.
Secondly, when paper is dried, there a thing called withdrawal that happens. Withdrawal means that the paper shrinks a bit. But when you apply glue, you allow the fibers to move back to their pre-withdrawal positions because you break the bonds between fibers. Therefore the glued face becomes longer than the non glued one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of answers are close but its because when you rub the glue stick on you are stretching the glue material across the paper. Once you release the stick the adhesive material contracts back (remember it was stretched) pulling the paper towards itself creating the curling effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
