		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're getting radiation exposure and radioactive contamination mixed up in this case.</p>
<p>Exposure is when something is exposed to radiation, and will not become radioactive itself.  </p>
<p>Contamination is when radioactive particles land on an object, effectively making it radioactive as a result of the contamination or radioactive particles on it.  </p>
<p>If a person ends up covered in radioactive ash from fallout then they are both being exposed to radiation <em>and</em> acting as a sort of source. This is why containment procedures include a metric fuckton of scrub downs and cleaning for equipment and personnel when any sort of radiation pollution of any kind is suspected.</p>
<p>In the case of your question, if the person is covered in radioactive dust/fallout then yes. Otherwise no.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The radiation poisoning is due to being exposed to radioactivity, emitted from something that is radioactive. Being exposed does not make you yourself radioactive, so you would not be able to spread radiation since you would not be emitting any unless you physically had radioactive material on you</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oncologist here.  Patients often ask this when getting radiation.  'Can I be around my grandkids' etc.  The answer is yes you can, no you're not radioactive from being exposed to radiation, you're just radiated.  Same with therapeutic radiation as with radiation from a bomb/explosion.</p>
<p>To be clear, there are kinds of radiation treatments where radioactive seeds are implanted and left inside you.  Most commonly for prostate cancer.  In those cases you are technically radioactive, emitting some small amount of radiation like not dangerous to anyone.  But to be massively over-cautious, some places suggest you don't have kids on your lap for a few months.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You might enjoy the book, “Alas, Babylon,” which discusses surviving a post-nuclear war. As previously mentioned, metals can become radioactive. An amusing scenario in the book has roving motorcycle gangs stealing jewelry and fancy watches. Their loot eventually kills them when they contract radiation poisoning from wearing their bling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot of misunderstanding here.   Basically, nuclear bombs use a very specific and very clean fuel that when exploded releases a ton of energy and radiation....  And then it is over. There really isn't any &quot;nuclear fallout&quot; of relevance. If you can get to a bunker before the blast, you can safely come out almost immediately. This is why Hiromisha and Nagasaki are safe thriving cities now and remained inhabited after the blasts. </p>
<p>Whereas Chernobyl, for example, has a whole mess of radioactive elements that will continue to decay and radiate for hundreds and thousands of years. That type of fallout is a disaster.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
