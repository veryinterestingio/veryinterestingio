		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is not a term reserved for high ranking people.</p>
<p>Someone killed for personal reasons, or because he's involved in shady stuff etc is murdered.</p>
<p>Someone targeted for political or ideological reasons, by a government or other organized group, is assassinated.</p>
<p>If a guy finds out Putin is sleeping with his wife and manages to kill Putin, that's murder not assassination.</p>
<p>But let's say you're a complete unknown person with no rank or status whatsoever, but accidentally you find out some secret information and the CIA kills you, that's technically an assassination, even if the police will say it's suicide.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a <del>Venn</del> [Edit: Euler] diagram, assassination would fall within the murder circle. It's a specific, more descriptive type of murder. Similarly, manslaughter is also killing another person, but it's not murder.</p>
<p>Life has nuance, and different words help distinguish those distinctions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The word 'Assassin' is derived from the Arabic term 'hashīshīn' meaning 'hashish eater' given as a nickname to members of a Nizari Ismaili sect (who were believed to eat hashish, obviously). At the time of the Crusades lower members of the sect would be sent out to murder prominent members of the enemy in the belief that it would minimise all-out war. If, as Carl von Clausewitz stated, 'War is the continuation of politics by other means', then the aversion of war by selective murder is also a political action. That is the very definition of assassination - murder for a political purpose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assassination is a specific type of murder. You might as well ask why we even have the word &quot;murder&quot; when we already have the word &quot;kill&quot;? </p>
<p>Murder is more specific than killing, not all killings are murder. And not all murders are assassinations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
