		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Games produce 1 still image each frame.</p>
<p>Cameras record a certain timeframe per frame filmed.</p>
<p>That means a single image of a game is extremly sharp, and you need a lot more frames for you to not notice the sharpness of each individual still image as they will start to blend together the more are displayed each second.</p>
<p>Meanwhile due to the timeframe used in cameras movement of actors will blur within the image, so less frames will still blur better than rendered frames of a computer game.</p>
<p>Just look at this still image from the Kings Men church battle:</p>

<p>You see how most people are blurry? Because they moved while that frame was shot. And the next frame will have them blurry in slightly different positions. Your brain will then see a pretty fluid scene when viewed with a decend speed, which 24 frames per second is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Additional to the other comments: you donâ€˜t interact with movies but you do with games.</p>
<p>A rendered frame in a game is always a bit behind after your input because a new frame is only displayed every 1/24 seconds (Assuming 24fps). It also depends on the game itself, e.g. playing chess is okay but playing a shooter will feel horrible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After seeing a movie at 48fps, 24fps doesn't really look all that good. Or just try to watch the Bourne Identity series. The camera moves so much that 24fps is not sufficient. There is a limit to the amount that motion blur can help with this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fine answers, but I'd also believe that poeple are culturally accustomed to a lower fps in cinema, and even need that lower fps as a part of the experience to &quot;feel&quot; that they are watching cinema.</p>
<p>This means because you're accustomed to it, you expect it, and so you're not annoyed by it.</p>
<p>I don't feel this about movies, and would wish all movies would have 48fps, especially 3D movies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
