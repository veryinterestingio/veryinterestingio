		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bezos went to space essentially as cargo.  He didn't operate the ship, didn't have a job to do once he got up there beyond floating for ten minutes and wasn't in space long enough for space to negatively affect him.  Note that before Bezos, Astronauts went to space to do specific and important scientific and engineering work, two fields that already require a lot of training, but now have to be done in zero-G.  Making sure the most advanced machine man has ever built works and performing experiments that can't be done anywhere else takes a lot of skill and training.  Being carried to the edge of space by a rocket does not.  If general public space tourism ever does become a thing, you would require minimum prep to go into space, just enough for you to know how to move in zero-G, nothing more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Astronauts go to space for months at a time which has drastic effects on your body, Jeff Bezos was in space for minutes which has virtually no effects on your body. </p>
<p>Astronauts also have to do lots of maintenance, and experiments. All the billionaires have to do is sit back and enjoy the ride.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Explanation to a real 5 year old: </p>
<p>Driving a car is difficult and requires a lot of training. Mom or dad has to make sure they don't collide with other cars, they need to know how to start the engine, and maybe even do some emergency repairs on the car. Driving a car is hard and responsible work. </p>
<p>However, you, little Timmy, can sit in the car without any preparation! Just let mom or dad strap you safely into your chair and you're good to go. You don't have to operate the car and have no tasks or responsibilities while driving. Just don't touch anything that looks important or fragile, okay?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s a couple big differences. The orbital astronauts fly a lot higher and much much faster than the suborbital astronauts. That means high forces for much longer. For reference, the Bezos’s flight was 10 minutes from liftoff to touchdown, and went to about 100km. A crewed SpaceX/space shuttle mission burns for 8-9 minutes, gets up to 400km, and is going along the earth far faster than it ever does vertically.</p>
<p>Second, handling zero-g for a few minutes doesn’t put much strain on your body. Staying in zero-g for weeks can really deteriorate your body, and cause other issues.</p>
<p>Last, it’s the difference between a sightseeing trip, and working for several weeks on a few multimillion dollar projects where simple mistakes could be deadly, and you have to train for dozens of scenarios if something goes wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
