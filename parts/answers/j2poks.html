		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because its incredibly dangerous.  The treatment itself nearly killed the guy. The only reason they did it, is because he would've been dead in a few months anyway. He had both HIV and Cancer, the cancar treatment was a bone marrow transplant. </p>
<p>They just used a very specific donor marrow and curing his HIV was a secondary outcome.</p>
<p>HIV is no longer a death sentence, its not worth the risk to the patient. Except in extreme cases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, because the transplants themselves almost killed the Berlin patient. Transplants are a huge and risky medical procedure that you don’t do causally. </p>
<p>Second, because it’s been tried in many other patients in similar situations, and mostly it doesn’t work. I don’t know details, but as of a few years ago some 38 other transplants had been done in cancer/HIV patients, and only a couple seem to have actually worked well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people have commented the medical side so here’s a personal side.</p>
<p>I watched my partner go through a BMT with an unusually high match donated from his brother and it nearly killed him. There are also long term problems like graft v host disease which he has. He cruised through chemo, radiation etc with minimal side effects, but this ravaged his body at only 27 years old.</p>
<p>Witnessing that and the others in the ward, I personally wouldn’t go through it for an illness that there is a viable alternative to control it for. I have an autoimmune disease that there have been studies on BMTs to treat it and I can say without a doubt I wouldnt go through with it unless my medication that keeps me alive could no longer do it’s job.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To cause long term suppression of HIV, the stem cell donor must have a rare genetic mutation which makes their immune cells immune to HIV infection while also being a match to the patient. These people are very difficult to find and stem cell transplants are a costly and dangerous procedure. The current treatments for HIV are cheaper and less dangerous while allowing the patients a relatively normal life span.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
