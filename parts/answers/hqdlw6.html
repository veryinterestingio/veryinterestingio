		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>BUT I don't get it why you can easily cut out breast tumors or skin ones???</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Often you can. </p>
<p>By the time you do so, metastasis may have already started. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>sometimes cells from those tumors will travel through blood and that leads to tumors in other places, why is that possible?? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because every cell in the human body has the DNA for the entire body, and parts of the human body travel around within it. </p>
<p>The most obvious example of a cell that you <em>want</em> to travel around your blood stream, lymph nodes, and even through other tissues sometimes, is white blood cells. The ones that help you recover when you're sick, stop you from dying when a splinter pierces your skin, etc. Their ability to do so is encoded in the DNA of <em>every</em> cell and all a cancer cell has to do is then toggle that DNA back on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cancers spread via the circulatory system. So if you don't catch them early they can spread from a relatively non-vital area to several more vital areas.</p>
<p>Some cancers are very aggressive and even if you cut them out, all it takes is a few cells left behind for them to start up again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing I don’t think I’ve seen mentioned is that for the most part cancer cells are very “energy hungry”. It takes a lot of calories to fuel the rapid division of cancer cells and growth of tumors. Simply put they deprive surrounding cells of any nutrients and calories. </p>
<p>This is why people with cancers often appear frail and one of the warning signs is rapid, unintentional weight loss. This means that even cancers of non-essential organs can deprive the rest of the body of nutrients. </p>
<p>I’m a nurse and used to work in oncology for a number of years and have seen patients die from cancers of non essential organs like tonsils and appendix and it always felt so wrong that they should die from a cancer of an organ that a lot of people have removed as children.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
