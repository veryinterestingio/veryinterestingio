People prefer strangers with <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103111002927" target="_blank">easy-to-pronounce names</a>. Names which indicate <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2605853" target="_blank">racial identity</a> are triggers for discrimination. Someone who has a more <a href="https://myscp.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327663jcp1502_3" target="_blank">similar name to yours</a> is perceived as more similar and likeable; same with <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0079039" target="_blank">sharing initials</a>. Names of close friends and romantic partners also <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02699930126251" target="_blank">prime you to feel more positive</a>.</p>
<p>Whether all of that is due to <em>just</em> familiarity of the name or other factors is still an open question, and it gets complicated pretty quickly depending on the specifics of the scenario.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
