		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the centrifugal force does reduce your &quot;apparent weight&quot; from mg, everywhere except at the poles.</p>
<p>The effect is maximal at the equator, where the centrifugal force is maximal in magnitude and points entirely in the &quot;up&quot; direction.</p>
<p>Assuming the Earth is a rigid sphere with radius R (not accurate, because the Earth itself also bulges due to the centrifugal force, etc.), your effective weight at the equator is:</p>
<p>W = mg - mRΩ^(2).</p>
<p>The ratio of the correction term to your &quot;normal&quot; weight is RΩ^(2)/g, which works out to be about 0.003. So under these assumptions (Earth as a rigid sphere), your effective weight is 0.3% lower at the equator than at the poles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
