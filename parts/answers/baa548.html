What Mercator did was just make sure lines of longitude and latitude were straight, at right angles, and that (at small scales) distances worked the same in all directions -- i.e., that if 1 inch north was 10 miles north then 1 inch east had to represent 10 miles east.</p>
<p>This combination of constraints made it so features at high latitudes were depicted much larger than those near the equator, since distances between lines of longitude were smaller as you got closer to the poles and he's drawing them as equally distant everywhere. The precise way the longitude lines get closer near the poles corresponds to the spherical curvature of the earth and if you work out the math of how spherical coordinates get transferred to this style of map you end up with the log of the tangent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
