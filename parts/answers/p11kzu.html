		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When it doesn't grow any in it's growing season, no leaves, no flowers, no fruit.  That's the only non-invasive test, sorry that it takes a year.</p>
<p>You could cut the tree down and look for sugar concentration in the sap at it's core, but that doesn't seem like what you want.</p>
<p>Deciduous trees (which lose their leaves) are very hard to distinguish between normal dormancy and death, non-invasively.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plants are hard to declare fully dead because they don’t have the kind of complex interdependence that a more advanced animal has.  The individual plant tissues aren’t specialized into organs that do one particular purpose only, and they don’t need help from other organs either.</p>
<p>Thanks to this, many plants can regrow entirely from small stem or root cuttings even if the vast majority of the plant has died.</p>
<p>Since plants have this remarkable regenerative property, it’s very difficult to declare an individual plant fully dead until several growing seasons have passed with no activity.  Even chopping a tree down to a stump doesn’t necessarily kill it entirely.  The top of the tree will die, but the stump is still alive and can run off stored nutrients for some time trying to re-grow some leaves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There isn't one.</p>
<p>Supposedly &quot;long-dead&quot; trees have actually come back to life from underground root contact and feeding.  I've seen pictures of old gray stumps with new green shoots.</p>
<p>Check out German forester Peter Wohlleben's books about trees - they're brilliant, easy reading.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In humans, all the body tissues depend on constant upkeep by the organ systems of the body.  Stop the heart, and all your cells will be dead in a few minutes because without bloodflow they will suffocate for lack of oxygen and starve for lack of sugar. </p>
<p>But with plants, the different cells of the plant are less dependent on each other.  Sure, it's true that leaves do make sugar for the roots and the roots gather water and nutrients for the leaves, and both rely on the stem to transport those back and forth.  But there's no pump that is needed to move these things, so each &quot;pipe&quot; in the plant stems operates more or less independently.  There's no one heart you can destroy, you really have to sever all connections between leaves and roots to make sure you've stopped all flow to all parts of the plant. </p>
<p>But even then you might not have killed it. Plant cells get their oxygen from the air around them and in many species they store sugar and water, especially in stems and roots (but sometimes in leaves too).  A human cell dies rapidly if cut off from its supply network, many plant cells don't.  In fact, it's fairly common for parts of plants to have <em>so much</em> reserves stored that if you chop them off from the rest of the plant, instead of dying they will grow into a new plant!  </p>
<p>So with plants, death tends to be a more local phenomenon.  Is this or that branch dead?  Are they all dead or are there still a few living ones? Are the roots alive or not?  You can judge these by looking at twigs and roots and seeing if the interior of them is still alive or dry and dead, but it only gives you an answer for that part of the plant.   The plant's only fully dead when the whole thing's dead....and honestly the easiest way to tell that is just that there's no green on it anywhere anymore, even during a growing season when you would expect to see it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trees can take many years to &quot;die&quot;</p>
<p>Usually they become a safety hazard long before they are fully dead. They may start dropping big long heavy branches that could kill someone or dent wrought iron patio furniture.</p>
<p>Then they should be taken down saftely</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
