		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Could be a number of reasons, but a pretty big one is anexiety. When it's bed time, you think &quot;it's time to go to sleep, or I won't be rested tomorrow&quot; etc. So you put pressure on yourself to sleep. But if you're napping, it's usually because you want to, not because you feel like you have to. So it's easier to relax and sleep</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I study in this field of research actually, Chronobiology and Memory. Search up the circadian clock. Basically you are now adapted (entrained) to sleeping late and napping in the middle of the day, probably due to warmer temperatures, lack of energy or big meals. Light and temperature are both very prominent factors (zeitgeber) which help regulate your biological clock down to the molecular levels.</p>
<p>No phone, lights out and sleep at night. Then wake up early with fresh sunlight every morning for the next few days and you should be entrained back to the regular circadian rhythm !</p>
<p>Note: Can depend on your health and age and a lot of other factors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have heard that with prolonged lack of sleep, the brain begins to think that you are in danger and tries to cheer you up.Perhaps this is what happens when you are not getting enough sleep, and then, morning and afternoon, resist the urge to sleep. And because of this, in the evening, you don't want to sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>There's surely a term for this that someone already mentioned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
