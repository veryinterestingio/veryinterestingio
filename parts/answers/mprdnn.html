		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Professional working chef here. You can open an oven when something is cooking often depending on what oven you have. Most ovens in professional kitchens have multiple fans or an advance heating method as opposed to what most people have at home with just a raw heating element. It heats up really fast so opening it and checking to see what your food looks like wonâ€™t really drop the temp that much. Overcrowding the oven will mess with the heat source more than opening it a lot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I think being on camera makes a lot of people nervous too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Professional ovens tend to be convection ovens.  They have a fan that moves the air around which prevents uneven cooking (hot and cold apots) and will bring it up to temperature faster.</p>
<p>Standard home ovens have radiant heat, which will take longer to get back up to temp once it has dropped from the door being opened a lot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Does that really result in undercooked food? It seems to me that undercooked food would only happen if the chef checked the food, found it to be undercooked, and then <em>removed it from the oven prematurely</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On cooking competition shows, there's some range of cutting and editing going on depending on the show. If your only comparison is shows, you're probably overestimating how often their ovens are being opened.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
