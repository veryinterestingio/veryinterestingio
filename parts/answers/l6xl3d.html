		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From my very-basic understanding of the 'Oumuamua dispute, it sounds like the two sides are mostly arguing about Occam's Razor, and which theory is the simplest explanation: that either (1) 'Oumuamua was created by intelligent life, or (2) 'Oumuamua is a new kind of comet that we don't understand yet.</p>
<p>It seems like neither side would really have a way to falsify the other side's claims without more data.</p>
<p>Is that a fair characterization of the debate?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Avi,
I just listened to your conversation with Sean Carroll and you mentioned your idea to send miniature probes with a light sail attached to Proxima B. How long do you suppose it will take to have this idea come to life and what do you think would be a good timeline for your team to receive information from such a device once launched?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After reviewing your introduction, you appear to specialize in theoretical research. Do you have any observational experience with studying comets, particularly Oumuamua, that gives you insight in this topic? If not, is there any reason your theory regarding an extraterrestrial origin for Oumuamua should be preferred over the other speculations provided in this comment section?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
