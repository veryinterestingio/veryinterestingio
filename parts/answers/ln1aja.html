		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the specific case of the issues in Texas, it's generally providing heat and or insulation to various components susceptible to freezing.</p>
<p>In the case of wind turbines, the lubricant needs to stay warm enough to turn (lubricant selection also matters).  Heaters are used at turbines that work in cold environments.</p>
<p>For gas turbines, the inlet to the compressor has a low pressure and can experience snow/icing during this expansion phase from entrained moisture in the gas or air.  A preheaters is used in cold environments.  For gas pipelines, this is providing insulation so that ice doesn't accumulate from moisture carried with the gas.</p>
<p>For the nuclear reactor that tripped, there was a feedwater sensing line that froze because the turbines are literally outside instead of in a building.  Most reactors have a turbine hall where the equipment is located.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A very common way is something called Heat tracing on process lines. Effectively you put special insulation around pipes, when it gets too cold, the heat tracing starts putting heat into the pipes so it doesn't freeze (its also done for other reasons though).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This also helps things like Butane lines from coming out of gas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something that I haven’t seen said yet is that in colder climates (like up here in Canada) anything buried is buried much deeper to ensure it stays below the frost line. Ground temperature stays at around 15°C below the frost line. So I’m the city, gas lines, water mains, etc are deep enough they usually do not hit freezing temperatures. This is on top of the other measures mentioned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Coolant loops require flowing water to cool the steam back down, and keep operating equipment cooled down and not melting or losing their temper.  Even Nuclear Light Water Uranium Reactors can have issues if he coolant loops aren't sufficiently winterized for this operation.  And no, it's not as simple as adding antifreeze to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So while this may not be exactly what you are looking for but there are two major hazards that winter brings to the Distribution Grid on the East coast.</p>
<p>The first major one is controlling the vegetation. As the temps drop any preceptiation turns into snow/sleet/freezing rains and this tends to bring branches and trees down onto overhead lines( this also happens in summer/spring)</p>
<p>The second major one is the extra draw being pulled on certain feeders. So often we do winter readiness jobs to either harden the lines or do switching to move the loads in certain areas off some feeders on other feeders.</p>
<p>A third issue that is starting to come up in the underground distribution system is the havoc that salt, sand and deicer wreaks on underground cable and equipment so we also try to do inspections for some of our more critical customers and equipment to ensure that they are in good working condition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
