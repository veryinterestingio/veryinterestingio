		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nobody really knows. There are many competing theories, but since evolution works on geologic timescales, it's hard to falsify these theories experimentally.</p>
<p>What we do now know about handedness is that it's far from a uniquely human thing. Around 2/3rds of chimpanzees are right handed for example. Much closer to 50:50 than humans, but still a sizable majority of righties. Gorillas are about 75% rightie. </p>
<p>The most commonly accepted theory is that it's simply about division of labour between different parts of the brain. Brains aren't just one big wodge of neurons all doing the same thing. The brain is specialized into many functional units for performing particular tasks. So the part of the brain that deals with motor control also gets specialized somewhere. And which side of the brain it gets specialized determines your handedness.</p>
<p>As to why right-handedness is much more common, this is less clear. But population-level handedness seems beneficial for social species, with handedness being much more prevalent in animals with rich social structures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
