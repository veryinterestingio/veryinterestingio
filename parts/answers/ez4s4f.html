		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On the one hand, it’s a bonding experience. In most mammals, the mum grooms her babies, and you grooming your pet is similar to that experience.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you can scratch places they can’t and that is precious. Ever try to massage the outside of your dogs ear? Most of them go absolutely nuts. Scratch a horse on the back or withers and they go crazy as well.</p>
<p>Edit since several people asked: the withers is the bony part on a horses back between the shoulder blades, at the base of the mane</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if this helps out very much, but I watched a documentary recently that had some photographers that were taking photos of sharks. They had built up a relationship with these sharks over the years and the sharks love being petted. They will swim away and then come back for more and they recognize the divers, even if they are in different dive suits every time. (All of this is according to what I saw on said documentary)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My snake doesn't particularly enjoy being <em>petted</em> but she does enjoy cuddling and curling up with me on the couch. I am pretty darn sure it's just heat-seeking behavior. To her, I'm a furnace</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My bearded dragon seems to like it from time to time.  If she doesn't, she'll swat at my hand, her sign that it's time for me to fuck off elsewhere.  If she's into it though, she'll close both eyes and just chill out to enjoy the scratches and pets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
