		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I assume you mean the physical feeling of getting choked up during crying.</p>
<p>This happens because when your fight or flight response activates, the part of your throat that lets air into your lungs expands. When you try to swallow before you speak or whatever reason, you're fighting against the same muscles that are keeping your glottis (airway hole) open. </p>
<p>So the conflict there makes you feel like you're choking and can't get anything out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This may not be exactly the same as what you're asking about, but if someone is trying to verbalize a particularly painful memory or experience, it is actually quite possible that the language center of their brain isn't functioning at full capacity. I only know of this phenomena in the context of PTSD and recalling traumatic events, but I imagine that it may apply to recalling events that are just genuinely upsetting if not entirely traumatic (I'm not a neuroscientist at all though, so I may be off base in that assumption).</p>
<p>Brain scans have consistently shown reduced in activity in the Broca's area of the brain, which is involved in our ability to use language, in people with PTSD when they are experiencing a flashback. The amygdala (the emotional center of the brain) shows drastically increased activity at this time, meaning when a person is reliving a traumatic memory their capacity to verbalize it significantly decreases while they're experiencing heightened emotions.</p>
<p>So again, I'm in no way an authority on the topic, but based on that evidence as well as personal experience with both myself and others without PTSD having difficulty speaking when particularly upset, I've come to assume that the increase in activity in our emotional brain naturally decreases our capacity to put words to the experience. This is actually key to EMDR therapy, which uses various techniques to keep both the right brain (typically associated with emotion) and the left brain (associated with language) stimulated while recalling upsetting memories in order to help reprocess them.</p>
<p>I first read about this in Bessel Van Der Kolk's &quot;The Body Keeps the Score&quot;, but here is a link to an article that also describes this phenomena.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit: forgot the subreddit I was in. </p>
<p>Think of our emotions and thoughts as a sea, and our logical mind as a ship. When we have intense emotions they're like big waves.</p>
<p>Basically, if you don't know how to navigate the giant amount of emotions and thoughts you're having at the same time, it is easy to get swept up into those sensations and shut down/crash from being overwhelmed. </p>
<p>It takes training to learn how to steer when the waters are rough.</p>

<p>------- original comment below -------</p>
<p>I can't speak for everyone but in my case it's because I'm thinking of 12 different things to say and I don't know which one to say first.</p>
<p>Any one of the things that I'm thinking of saying could be misconstrued into something else and I'm also thinking of all of the different ways it could be misconstrued. </p>
<p>I'm also dealing with the potential fear or anxiety that comes with some sort of confrontation or argument, that fight or flight response is getting me ready to get angry or defensive if something I say gets misconstrued into an argument.</p>
<p>And then of course I'm thinking of the ways that these different thoughts would play out if I said them out loud and sometimes a lot of them are ultimately pointless because they would just lead to hurt feelings instead of fixing anything.</p>
<p>Without crisis training to learn how to sort out and focus with these emotions.... It becomes very overwhelming so most just would rather not say anything at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my case it's because I have emotional blunting, so it's really hard to know what I'm feeling and even feel something at all. This is a problem that you create a barrier of emotion, so you don't feel them and can't express your feelings in that moment. I tend to block everything in a emotional discussion, such as in anger, sadness, etc. This leads me to stare at the person unable to answer them, to think in absolutely anything, it's basically a sad statue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
