		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain has a dominant side but is trainable.</p>
<p>If you play guitar, you do the fussy part with your left and your right hand idles out.  If you're in the UK, you shift with your left instead of your right.  You can train your brain to do what you need.</p>
<p>I can wink either eye.  I can raise either of my brows.  I can do 10 key with either hand.  I'm fairly ambidextrous.  I'm also ambi-toeserous (my word) meaning I can use my feat like hands.  Apparently it's a thing. Ask a pregnant woman.</p>
<p>However, I can't write left handed at all.  I can't even draw a straight line.  I can't throw left.  I can't shoot a basketball left at all. I can kick left footed in soccer which is pretty cool. That's about it.</p>
<p>My mom is right handed but she bats left.  I've known quite a few people like that.  I had a friend that was super left handed but he uses the mouse on his right.  Because of that, I taught myself to be able to left-hand mouse.  It works fine.</p>
<p>The brain is malleable.  Just use it.  It'll work itself out.  If it couldn't, no-one could fly a helicopter or even drive stick.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TDLR: One side of the brain works harder than the other.</p>
<p>The right side of your brain controls the left side of your body, the left side of your brain controls the right side of your body, so one side our brain is just working harder than the other causing dominance on one side.
E.g. if your right handed, footed e.t.c. the left side of your brain is working harder.
Sometimes, both sides of the brain work in sync, so you don't have a dominant side.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
