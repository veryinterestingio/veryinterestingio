		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Really no good way of explaining this on a 5 year old level. But here it goes.</p>
<p>Low interest rates encourage people and businesses to spend more money than they have at the moment, essentially pulling demand forward. Allowing people to overspend (increasing demand) and allowing businesses to expand capacity to meet the artificially increased demand.</p>
<p>When you increase rates, people stop borrowing as much money because it becomes more expensive. So there is just less slush money flowing around. Less money flowing around (lowering demand) causes businesses to slow down capital expenditures (slowing down business growth). It then becomes a vicious cycle. People borrow less, demand falls, businesses slow down growth, businesses potentially cut hours or lay off employees, more people slow down or stop spending money on non-essential things, demand lowers more, businesses tighten down even more, paying employees less, cutting hours, more demand declines, repeat, repeat, repeat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think about interest rates as the cost to borrow money. Very few people can make major purchases with cash on-hand - homes, home improvement, cars, etc. So people borrow money to make the purchases, then pay the lender back plus the cost to borrow that money (interest). The more it costs to borrow money, the fewer major purchases are made because fewer people can afford to borrow that money - fewer people qualifying for loans. When you buy something, you're distributing wealth. If too many people aren't buying, because they can't afford to, then too many people aren't making money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If interest rate is high, people would rather keep their money in the bank and not spending it, as it will “grow” by itself. If interest rate is low, people would rather spend their money or invest it in a higher risk investment. </p>
<p>For instance, if you get only get 1% per annum for keeping your money in a bank, you would rather invest in your money in a business / any other means, this will generate more profit for you, and at the same time it will “drive” the economy.</p>
<p>From business perspective, if interest rate is high it will make people wary of starting / expanding their business because they are afraid that if they don’t generate enough profit, they can’t pay the interest. But if its low, they will more likely take that risk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Businesses and people take out loans when interest payments look low and affordable. Then interest rates go up and they can't afford the repayments. Economic collapse on a corporate and household level ensues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
