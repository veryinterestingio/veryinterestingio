		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eggs are either really tough, or soft and leathery. Trying breaking an egg in your hand, the shape makes them very resistant to pressure. To break the egg the bird would have to have such a serious impact that the animal is probably dead before the egg breaks. </p>
<p>Sometimes birds produce imperfect eggs. They can get stuck along the way for a bit before moving on, leading to odd shapes, or sometimes no shell at all. The shell-less eggs can tear, scramble egg in the nest, but the shell wasn't hard yet, so at least no cuts. If an egg gets stuck completely it's a life-threatening emergency. Usually you'd try to lubricate it and gently massage it out in one piece. Breaking the egg is a last resort and dangerous, because yes, the shells can cut the bird up. </p>
<p>The soft eggs of reptiles can tear when they get stuck. It's also possible that eggs accumulate and can't come out at all, same urgent emergency as with birds, gotta get them out or the animal dies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had a chicken get very ill from an egg breaking inside of her. We had to put her down,  because the infection was killing her. Sometimes they don't get enough calcium in their diets, and there may have been other vitamins or minerals that leads to that as well. After that happened,  I would cook my chickens breakfast sometimes,  with crushed up eggshells for additional calcium. It was really a terrible infection,  and I didn't want anyone else to go through that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apparently it is possible it breaks inside, see french post here with not terrible picture: <a href="http://www.natureln.librox.net/spip.php?article590" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.natureln.librox.net/spip.php?article590" target="_blank">http://www.natureln.librox.net/spip.php?article590</a></a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Basically it say the chick had a piece of broken egg outside and had trouble getting the rest out of itself.<br />
the second picture is the egg once out and hardened.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why are there so many people in a science sub that are convinced that bird eggs harden <em>after</em> being laid!?</p>
<p>They don't. The calcium shell is applied in multiple layers inside the bird, and each layer hardens right as it's being secreted. <em>NOT</em> from exposure to air. Chickens and other birds lay eggs that are already fully hard.</p>
<p>It's quite rare but bird eggs can crack while still inside the hen. Similarly, reptile eggs can tear open while still inside the female. Usually from external trauma. If bird eggs aren't all the way through the shell-making process when they crack, then they can be 'mended' by the next layers of shell applied. And the place where it cracked can still be visible after laying.</p>
<p>I've had one hen in the past lay a cracked-and-mended egg - she laid it the morning after she spooked when I was closing them up for the night, flew straight into the coop wall, and fell hard onto the waterer. Another hen had an egg break internally (finished shell - apparently too close to being laid to be 'mended') which got stuck inside her and ended up causing Egg Peritonitis - a serious internal bacterial infection. Like how mammals can get sepsis from a retained placenta.</p>
<p>The shell-adding part of egg laying is the last step. The whole process along the bird's oviduct is like an assembly line <a href="https://the-chicken-chick.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/reproductive-tract-of-hen-University-of-Kentucky.jpg" target="_blank"><em>(dissection pic of oviduct</em></a> &amp; <a href="https://opimedia.azureedge.net/-/media/Images/CFR/Editorial/Blogs/Rachel/Mommy-Where-Do-Eggs-Come-From/egg-formation-process-550-jpg.jpg?h=302&amp;w=550&amp;la=en&amp;hash=88800069E6A6DB5E27856D1878CCFF024DBD2A4E" target="_blank"><em>diagram of egg formation)</em></a>. Yolks start tiny, grow large, go down the tube to get the whites added, then enter the shell-coating area. Sit there for almost a day to get the shell layers applied and are then laid. But while that's going on another yolk is starting to mature and make its way down the tube, with another growing to be ready behind that. So an egg can't hang around much longer than normal without causing a backup and problems with the whole system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Never heard of occurrences like that, curious myself. I will throw in an extra question: if they do break, is it harmful to the bird in the long run or they can totally eject all the waste, eggshell shards included?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
