<p>As a medical student, what are some things you think are important for me to know when working clinically around these subjects?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, is much known about how the &quot;microbiome&quot; and various genetic populations? For example if x population eats a lot of a millet and thrives off feeding bacteria x, would a population elsewhere also thrive off that or could their DNA be geared more towards a grain that they historically have had more of a tendency to eat? </p>
<p>Also, are there any cool genetic adaptions that we know about, for example as I understand it Sherpa people are genetically better able to adapt to high elevations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Do you think being able to choose your babys eye color before they are born for example is ok morally or do you think it has a chance to fuel racism (can't be upset about having a black grandchild if you're designing it in build a baby workshop).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Can you share with us any stories of discoveries that were made only when research was done in understudied populations that lead to improved clinical outcomes for that population (or all populations)?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
