		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not an answer to the question. But monarchs migrate both north and south when the seasons change. They travel upto 3000 miles, but it takes 3 to 4 generations to compete the trip. Somehow the generations in the middle of the migration know they need to continue thier journey. So there's at least some communication there telling them to continue and where to stop.</p>
