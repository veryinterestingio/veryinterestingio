		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EDIT: The response I give below may actually be incorrect dogma. Thanks /u/Supp_Carries_U for pointing that out. It appears that the reason this advice is given to patients is because it is simple and works, but is based on old fears. That said, you are still better to finish your course, as it is known that shorter courses of antibiotics are associated with failure to treat.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The primary reason is because failure to finish antibiotic treatments leads to the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria.</p>
<p>All drugs take time to work. As you start the treatment the concentration of the drug in your blood starts to rise, and it may continue to rise over several days. Furthermore, even if the drug instantly reached an effective concentration, it would take time for the drug to act. What this means is that over the course of days antibiotics are starting to kill the bacteria in your system, but they don't all drop dead instantly. Which bacteria die first? Well the ones that are the most sensitive to antibiotics. And who does that leave behind? The ones that are the LEAST sensitive.</p>
<p>What makes some bacteria more sensitive to antibiotics than others? Well if we limit our scope the bacteria that could be killed by the antibiotic (some bacteria just don't have the required processes to be killed by particular antibiotics), we see that bacteria have special pumps that remove antibiotics from them. Others have small mutations that make the antibiotic less effective, and some bacteria produce enzymes that break down antibiotics.</p>
<p>Those bacteria usually aren't completely immune to antibiotics, they're just harder to kill. So when you start taking antibiotics, you might have a mixture of all kinds of bacteria, but after the antibiotic has started working, if you have any resistant bacteria, they will survive longer. And if you stop early, now those bacteria might be all that is left. And without any competition from the sensitive bacteria [i.e. the ones the antibiotics killed], their population will increase. If you'd finished your course, those resistant bacteria would have all been finished off, but by stopping early, you turn yourself into a factory for producing antibiotic resistant bacteria.  This is bad for society, but it's also bad for you. Not only are you selecting for antibiotic resistance bacteria, but your providing pressure for them to become even MORE antibiotic resistant, to the point that the antibiotic doesn't hurt them at all. At that point, if you get sick again, the antibiotic you took last time wont do anything. And by the time doctors realize that, you're usually very sick.</p>
<p>So finish your course of antibiotics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its important to take your medications as they are prescribed (this applies to everything not just antibiotics) but there is absolutely no evidence that &quot;not finishing the course&quot; causes resistance. In fact it's quite the opposite: more antibiotics used = more resistance. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/358/bmj.j3418" target="_blank">https://www.bmj.com/content/358/bmj.j3418</a></p>
<p>There is a big movement in medicine to decrease unnecessary antibiotic usage and stopping a course early is actually done very often in the hospital (if your index of suspicion for an infectious process is very low, we stop the antibiotics).</p>
<p>Also the antibiotic course lengths are very arbitrary. It's mostly what has just been traditionally done. Some research is being done to look at specific disease processes (for example there is good evidence on length for complicated vs uncomplicated UTI) but a lot of times the length for your antibiotic course is not based on any evidence at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The original thought is that it would partially kill what ever bacteria it was he getting and create stronger bugs. Now we know that the MORE you use, the more you select in favour of resistant bugs, regardless of how long your 'course' was meant to be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
