		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The process of canning includes a step after the vessel containing the food is sealed where the contents are heated above a temperature where bacteria can survive thus killing all the bacteria. Since it is sealed no new bacteria can get and cause the meat to spoil.  </p>
<p>In contrast, refrigeration does not kill off all the bacteria. It merely slows their multiplication significantly so it takes a lot longer to go bad than at room temperature but it is in fact slowly becoming more infested with bacteria every second. It's just kept below a level where it will hurt us for as long as possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The canning process heats the food to a safe temperature while also creating a vacuum and sealing out pathogens that could potentially get into the food. This creates an environment in which it is highly unlikely for harmful bacteria to grow, resulting in a more shelf stable food. Fresh meats are exposed to oxygen, which most harmful food-borne bacteria need in order to reproduce.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When food is canned it gets a “12D-kill” - which means it’s heated at a high enough temperature and pressure to kill all microorganisms, including <em>Clostridium botulinum</em>, the most dangerous food borne pathogen. So the food inside the sealed can is essentially sterile, and the food will remain unchanged for months if not years in the can. Eventually chemical processes may make the food unpalatable- but that’s a quality, not a safety issue.
When meat is refrigerated it significantly slows microorganism growth - but - spoilage bacteria will grow, slowly. These cause off odors, sliminess etc. Also a significant food borne bacteria <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> can still grow at refrigeration temperatures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
