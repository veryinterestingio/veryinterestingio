How much money would be required to rebuild with latest materials and techniques &amp; technology available?<br />
Edit: Gofundme and its brethren raise funds for any damn thing these days. Surely this is worthy of internet fundraising.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Arecibo team,</p>
<p>I'm really saddened to hear that the observatory is planned to be decommissioned. It was an icon for radio astronomy, not to mention some of the earliest indirect evidence for gravitational waves. That being said, I have a a couple of questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Can the Chinese FAST radio telescope be retrofitted with radar astronomy equipment to map near earth objects? If not, are there plans to increase the power in current radio telescopes that also do radar astronomy?</p>
</li>
<li>I believe this is a sad but also teachable moment to show how reduced or complete lack of funding could cause a substantial damage to some of the most invaluable scientific tools at our disposal. What do you recommend to funding agencies and the public in general about the need to keep such important resources afloat?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for doing AMA.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious how the research community from the perspective of resource allocation.  What happens to projects that received funding for research involving this telescope?  What happens to people who started their graduate thesis using data from this telescope?</p>
<p>It seems like operations were funded by multiple institutions.  What will be the process to figure out how to pay for rebuilding it?  Who owns it?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
