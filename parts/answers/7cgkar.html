		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally a hermaphrodite doesn't have any fertile genitalia. Rarely they will have one set that is fertile, but the other set is not. I have never heard of a case where both sets are fertile, so I'm not sure if it's possible.  </p>
<p>If it theoretically did happen, then no it  would not be cloning. You see cloning is when you copy both sets of something's dna. In this example you would have two different gametes that are each randomly mixing and matching genes from both sets, plus adding in random mutations. The result is more like super inbreeding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OOH okay as a hermaphrodite I feel this is my time to shine!! It really isn’t the most documented condition in the world so it’s hard to say, I’ll be the first to admit I haven’t had a specialist examine me, just a dozen or so very helpful nurses and doctors from sexual health clinics and the like. A bit of science I don’t understand from several blood tests and tissue samples and it was discovered I have a 3rd sex chromosome, Likely a XXY so I have the double X to make all the girly bits and a Y for all the rest. The only problem is eggs and sperm take half of your dna randomly and they can’t have a half chromosome so you get some with single sex hormones, some with double, it’s a real clusterfluff. This means there’s a large number of possibilities on the sperm/ egg combos you can make from my dna just in terms of Xs and Ys and of course many of them will not produce a sustainable embryo. So to answer your question it’s a game of chance, you could theoretically have a child with the same DNA, it’s hard to say if it’s a clone as it blurs the line between sexual and asexual, and sadly there’s a large proportion of possibilities that will never survive. All the other not identical but survivable combinations would produce a child that has similar deformities to a child conceived by two siblings.  Little end note for you I am pretty dyslexic so if that is worded terribly do ask what I mean and I can try break it down more:)</p>
<p>This is just added in an edit, I should probably say that it’s not exactly a perfect set off both down there, I’m talking very theoretical here, if you could easily extract an egg and a sperm and neither have any super genome fucked side effects, that’d be the case, I don’t actually know if I am fertile in either sexes case. The practicality of this is sorta nil ? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although the phenotype is fixed at conception, we start out as sexless embryos whose structures later differentiate.  </p>
<p>That is, the same gonadal structure differentiates into an ovaries or testicles.  A penis and clitoris come from the same structure.  The structure which becomes the uterus in a female becomes the vestigial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatic_utricle" target="_blank">prostatic uricle</a> in the male.  So that's why you can't have both, the structure can go one way or another or, in rare cases, stay intersexed, but you don't get a second set of gonads.</p>
<p>In rare cases you could have mutiplied organs, like having a third arm.  The interpretation of this is is that it's from an undeveloped twin, which may be a division into an identical twin that didn't finish, or a fraternal twin- which makes you a <em>chimera</em> (two organisms fused together).  </p>
<p>A person could be a chimera with a different-sexed twin and have a second set of gonads. However, it's not possible to develop as two genders with the same blood supply.  The hormones that guide development are shared, and incompatible.  One or both sets would be undeveloped and dysfunctional.</p>
<p>IF, somehow, both sets DID develop and become functional, they would be gonads from fraternal twins, which is siblings.  If they got themselves pregnant, somehow, the offspring would be the same as sibling incest, which comes with huge risk of birth defects.  This has never happened with humans, or AFAIK any mammal in the lab.</p>
<p>IF you had an identical-twin set of duplicate gonads, they would develop as the same gender (four testicles, lucky you! I guess...)  IF you were literally a mad scientist and used two of them from the male embryo to replace another female embryo's ovaries with them via transplant, they retain the male phenotype and probably could not develop into ovaries.  They would make testosterone and virilize the embryo into an intersexed individual incapable of reproduction.  Also, you've committed a gross crime against humanity, but this is about the science. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off: hermaphroditism (having both functional male and female reproductive systems, either simultaneously or at different points in one’s life) does not exist in humans. Everyone in this thread seems to have confused it with intersex conditions, in which the reproductive system forms in a way that is not clearly male nor female. Intersex people have often been called hermaphrodites, but this is misleading and scientifically inaccurate. They do not have two separate reproductive systems; they have one which is neither male nor female and they are typically infertile.</p>
<p>As for actual hermaphroditic organisms, self-fertilization is pretty common, especially in plants. It does not result in clones, because genes recombine during fertilization. Imagine shuffling a deck of cards; you’ll wind up with all the same cards, but getting them in exactly the same configuration again after shuffling would be astronomically unlikely. The child would be extremely genetically similar to their parent, but would not be a clone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

As far as I understand it, you can't create a clone through the germ DNA (sperm or egg) because that's always recombinant. Meiosis scrambles the genes during meiosis 1 so the combination of alleles is always different</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
