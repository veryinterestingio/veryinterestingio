		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The definition on the NIMH website isn't vague at all:   </p>
<p>People with borderline personality disorder may experience mood swings and display uncertainty about how they see themselves and their role in the world. As a result, their interests and values can change quickly.</p>
<p>People with borderline personality disorder also tend to view things in extremes, such as all good or all bad. Their opinions of other people can also change quickly. An individual who is seen as a friend one day may be considered an enemy or traitor the next. These shifting feelings can lead to intense and unstable relationships.</p>
<p>Other signs or symptoms may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment, such as rapidly initiating intimate (physical or emotional) relationships or cutting off communication with someone in anticipation of being abandoned</li>
<li>A pattern of intense and unstable relationships with family, friends, and loved ones, often swinging from extreme closeness and love (idealization) to extreme dislike or anger (devaluation)</li>
<li>Distorted and unstable self-image or sense of self</li>
<li>Impulsive and often dangerous behaviors, such as spending sprees, unsafe sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, and binge eating. <strong>Please note:</strong> If these behaviors occur primarily during a period of elevated mood or energy, they may be signs of a mood disorder—not borderline personality disorder</li>
<li>Self-harming behavior, such as cutting</li>
<li>Recurring thoughts of suicidal behaviors or threats</li>
<li>Intense and highly changeable moods, with each episode lasting from a few hours to a few days</li>
<li>Chronic feelings of emptiness</li>
<li>Inappropriate, intense anger or problems controlling anger</li>
<li>Difficulty trusting, which is sometimes accompanied by irrational fear of other people’s intentions</li>
<li>Feelings of dissociation, such as feeling cut off from oneself, seeing oneself from outside one’s body, or feelings of unreality</li>
</ul>
<p>Not everyone with borderline personality disorder experiences every symptom. Some individuals experience only a few symptoms, while others have many. Symptoms can be triggered by seemingly ordinary events. For example, people with borderline personality disorder may become angry and distressed over minor separations from people to whom they feel close, such as traveling on business trips. The severity and frequency of symptoms and how long they last will vary depending on the individual and their illness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My mother had this.</p>
<p>For an eli5 explanation:</p>
<p>Think of a time when you felt an extremely intense emotion. Maybe rage or grief or fear. If you have experienced an emotional extreme - and most of us have - you'll notice it temporarily changes the way you think.</p>
<p>Most people know that thoughts create emotions, but the opposite is also true. When you're enraged with someone, you probably can't remember much you like about them. You could even forget every positive thing about them and wonder why you ever hung around with that person in the first place!</p>
<p>Now most of us have what's called meta cognition, which is thinking about our thoughts. So when I get angry with someone and think 'why do I even hang out with this person?' there's another part of me that says 'yeah, you feel that way now, but give it an hour and you'll remember everything you like about them'. This is a type of emotional regulation that we learn through experience of noticing our thoughts shift with our mood - we start to take them with a pinch of salt and that knowledge that not everything we feel is reality helps us stay relatively calm.</p>
<p>But I bet you've sometimes had emotions strong enough to override that, right? You've occasionally acted regrettably due to a very strong emotion? Most people have, it's very normal.</p>
<p>People with bpd tend to experience very extreme emotions on a far more regular basis and are trapped in that state where the emotion overrides regulation, so they tend to take their emotionally driven thoughts as fact and they act accordingly. They also tend to lack meta cognition - often because they haven't been in an environment safe enough to learn it - so can't calm down. They often also deal with very high levels of shame derived from an abusive or troubled upbringing that add fuel to the emotional fire.</p>
<p>And that's essentially what bpd is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I have BPD and I'll try to explain as best as possible but they're are a lot of good answers here.</p>
<p>BPD is a personality disorder which means it's a group of behaviors and traits a person uses as they live their life. There is a biological and an environmental factor. Biologically, people with BPD have smaller, overactive fear centers in their brains. Environmentally, many people with BPD have trauma from abuse or some other event. </p>
<p>Having BPD basically means you have unstable patterns in regards to self-identity, relationships, and emotions. Much of the time those patterns are learned behavior as those patterns are what helped the person with BPD survive some type of situation when they were younger.  </p>
<p>For example, many people with BPD are incredibly black and white thinkers and you can either be a best friend or worst enemy. The ability to shift the thoughts so suddenly can come from needing to disconnect with inconsistent caregivers so you don't get hurt every time they change their tune.</p>
<p>Another example is that many people with BPD have a lack of self-identity and can be considered social chameleons. Which basically means we kind of just change our personality depending on who we're around, mainly to please others. Which is a defense mechanism from having to change who we are to please an abuser, etc.</p>
<p>One thing about BPD is that you have really extreme emotions. Not like in a Bipolar sort of way, though, which can get some people confused.</p>
<p>I like to explain it like this. We all have an emotional spectrum. 0 is completely apathetic while 100 is losing all control to emotion. Whatever your current situation is can raise or lower the number.</p>
<p>Most non-BPD people hover around the 20-30 range normally when dealing with the situations of life like minor annoyances or embarrassment and most get up to 50-70 when incredibly upset. Someone with BPD is constantly hovering at the 50 range and when something triggers them emotionally, they can easily go into the 80s-100s. Basically, you feel the extreme version of whatever emotion your experiencing. Shame instead of embarrassment, rage instead of anger, euphoria instead of happiness, etc. </p>
<p>There are a lot of people who claim people with BPD are manipulative and evil. I actually lost a friend when I was diagnosed because she claimed that if I had BPD that meant I was an evil abusive person because that was the nature of people with BPD. A lot of that comes from stigma. It's one of the most widely stigmatized and misunderstood disorders. A lot of times people chalk down crazy exes behaviors to BPD when in reality they, y'know, could just be batshit crazy. In reality people with BPD are more likely to be abused.</p>
<p>This is not to say there aren't jerks with BPD. BPD is incredibly tough for everyone involved and when it's untreated it can cause harm to not only the sufferer but their loved ones. But people with BPD usually aren't trying to cause suffering or trying to be manipulative. </p>
<p>A lot of times the manipulative behavior is something, again, learned in childhood that helped the person survive. </p>
<p>Another personal example: I have a really hard time disagreeing with other people. If I disagree with a friend I get super scared they're going to hate me and never want to be around me again and the like, so I end up beating up on myself and talking about how wrong I am and how they're right and I'm so so sorry for disagreeing with them because my opinion is worthless and theirs is perfect. </p>
<p>That, to most people, can come off as manipulative or guilt tripping. But when I fall into that spiral I'm being 100% serious about it all. I'm beating myself up because I've learned growing up that having the 'wrong' opinion from my caregiver will cause me pain or neglect or anything. I grew up learning that my thoughts and opinions were always wrong and the caregiver's was always right.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>BPD is an incredibly complex disorder but there is treatment for it that can be very effective. People diagnosed with BPD can also be un-diagnosed with it because they can lose the traits. They still might have the same emotional intensity, but the difference is they've learned better ways to navigate themselves, life, and others.</p>
<p>The reason why BPD can be 'cured' with enough hard work is because BPD, like most personality disorders, is a pattern of behaviors and reactions that are learned from the environment plus the biological component. It's possible to un-learn those patterns and learn healthier patterns even if you can't change your brain chemistry.</p>
<p>I'm nowhere close to un-learning everything and I'm still trying to unpack a lot about how I grew up and why I am the way I am but since my diagnosis I've become a lot better at interpersonal communication, emotional stability, and the like. Once you can recognize those patterns it's easier to pull yourself out of them and change them. So I can catch myself doing something and redirect my thoughts and know that of course my friend isn't going to hate me and leave me for not liking their favorite book. You can also learn how to tell when you're reaching that extreme emotional intensity point where you have a hard time being able to reason and de-escalate before you get there which I've gotten a lot better at as well.</p>
<p>I do want to specify that there are people with BPD that are fucking terrible. But there are also good people with BPD. Many times someone who runs into a terrible person with BPD will claim all people with BPD are like that. But, in my experience, if you've met one person with BPD....you've met one person with BPD.</p>
<p>Just like not all people with OCD or anxiety or depression or schizophrenia are the same, not all people with BPD are the same. We're not a monolith. No group is.</p>
<p>Hoped that helped some and didn't come off as a long rambling tangent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone with BPD, here is how I like to explain this to my friends. This may not be anything close to a scientific definition or anything, and I know that things like my ODD (oppositional defiance disorder) play a role too. </p>
<p>There is no middle ground. If I am thinking about ordering pizza, it's either I get a pizza and wings and bread sticks and soda and desert, or I skip it all together. I am fully aware when I am being unreasonably emotional, but in the moment it feels right. The world is constantly against you, and sometimes you do bad stuff out of fear and anger. If I am trying to imagine the outcomes of let's say me running away from home, what I see is either the cops will be involved and I will go to jail and my life will be over, or it will go perfectly and everything will work out and it will be sunshine and rainbows. My mind is not able to see that middle ground of I walk around for a bit and my parents freak out and then I come home and just get grounded, or anything like that. </p>
<p>It is a heavy burden on the people around you, but it is also very hard on the individual. Sometimes I will just be thinking &quot;what the hell am I doing&quot; But be unable to stop myself in the middle of one of these episodes. The hardest part is I've watched a YouTube video and then decided that I need to throw my life away, because one little thing in there influenced me, and that's all that will be ringing in the back of my head. </p>
<p>As someone with BPD I can say that the best thing someone can do to help when I am in one of these episodes is just accept it and don't take anything I say to heart. I know that may be hard, and I am not saying that you should accept abuse from others at all, but if you have a loved one with BPD and they are saying crazy shit like &quot;you never loved me&quot; Or &quot;we need to get married tomorrow&quot; Just try to console them until they can calm down a bit, and then have a serious talk about it. It may at times feel like you are playing into serious manipulation, but sometimes we can't control it, and feel like shit later. If it gets serious, don't accept it, don't let yourself get abused by them, but if you can just play along it can truly help them calm down quicker. Don't be afraid to after ask them &quot;what's going on, how much of that was rooted into the truth&quot; And to say &quot;I am not ok with this, you hurt me&quot;, but if you can, try to help them find a coping mechanism. </p>
<p>If you only take one thing out of this though, if someone you love has BPD and you end up having to deal with one of their meltdowns, do not fight back heavily. Do not escalate it in the moment. Wait to talk about it once they can actually speak without shaking. It shouldn't take too long normally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
