		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Gate Theory, basically replacing one sensation for another. You apply pressure or sensation to another part of the body, or even where you perceive the pain to be coming from like rubbing your temple during a headache, and your brain is a little busy with the new signal of sensation to bother so much with the other one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I saw a science show thing once where they had actors playing out random scenarios and then used bad 3D graphics to zoom in inside the body and show what was going on. Anyway they showed a girl who had broken her wrist and they pointed out that initially she felt almost no pain, because the brain releases endorphins to mask the pain until you can escape the dangerous situation. Later when that rush of endorphins weakened, she felt pain again, and they showed her rubbing her wrist and explained that it's a nearly instinctual thing we do that aids in blood circulation and getting more endorphins to the painful area. So basically I think the instinct to massage painful areas is to improve blood flow (sort of &quot;squeezing&quot; the blood around all the swollen areas) and help the body heal itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A tension headache feels like a band is wrapped around the head. It can be due to muscle contraction in the scalp or neck muscles. Putting pressure or massaging  these muscles, like the temporalis muscle located on your “temples”, is helping to ease the tension causing temporary relief.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pressure causes localized annoxia (oxygen deprivation) which stifles the pain response (and when applied at proper points for the proper time will disrupt current response patterns giving the body the opportunity to form new patterns).
