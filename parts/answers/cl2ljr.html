		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, congratulations on this amazing accomplishment! I have little knowledge of the subject at all, but it seems like this could be pretty ground-breaking. I have a few questions: How did you guys originally come up with the idea to design these proteins? Would a treatment using LOCKR still have side effects like drugs do? And you used the example of acute inflammation from a TBI; could these proteins be used for other kinds of inflammation as well, such as the chronic inflammation found in autoimmune diseases?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey guys, really interesting stuff. Molecular biologist here, so please do get technical.</p>
<p>I did not see an explanation as to how protein transcription is achieved - it is endogenous, right? How is the code implemented into the genome or is it ? How is transcription (or protein expression levels) regulated?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Do you guys know yet when LOCKR could be in commercial use? Even a ballpark guestimation would be interesting.</p>
<p>Thanks</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am just starting my path to my bioengineering bachelor's degree, so this is inspiring.  What advice do you have for an undergrad, looking to change the world someday?  Have any living trials been conducted yet?  Will there be any applications in an orthopedic surgical setting, like with joint replacements, to reduce post-op swelling?  What about for chronic joint inflammation?  Can this also be used in place of immuno suppressants after an organ transplant?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
