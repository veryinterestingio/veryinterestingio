		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Additionally autism is now basically a catch-all diagnosis. Every new edition of the DSM adds symptoms and imho it's being massively over diagnosed at the moment.</p>
<p>But to answer your question the brain is divided into regions with each region being responsible for a specific task. Examples are processing visual input from the eyes, muscle control, regulating emotions, controlling breathing etc. Most brain disorders only affect one or a few of these regions, leaving everything else working normally.</p>
<p>Often the brain compensates by using another region to do the task of the broken region, but this is a bit like having one person do the work of two people. It's more hard work and the results are suboptimal. This is why some people with high-functioning autism/Asperger syndrome are virtually undetectable. Their brains have compensated, but they may be consciously applying rules of social interaction that they've learnt rather than it being an automatic process.</p>
<p>Where an unaffected person would know that someone who is trying to change the topic of conversation isn't interested in the current conversation someone with Asperger syndrome would need to consciously recognise the body language and other signs that this is happening, compare that to previous conversations and figure out that's what's happening.</p>
<p>Someone without the condition would do this automatically and may not even recognise it's happening.</p>
<p>As you can imagine being able to hold down a complex conversation whilst simultaneously analysing the body language and subtle social cues of the people you're talking with is harder than doing one or the other. This is why some people with the condition just do one or the other, and will keep talking as you get more and more uncomfortable. 🤣</p>
<p>Edit:
/u/DuplexFields points out below that DSM-V narrowed the scope of autism.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of your brain as a character in an RPG. You start out with base stats, and you get to assign 10 points to any stat you want. Everybody gets roughly the same total ability, but how they distribute those points can be customized. </p>
<p>So you have languages, empathy, imagination, logic, memorization, coordination, anticipation, math, spacial orientation, all as possible things to put points into. </p>
<p>This is a way of thinking of the different things a brain does, which is a LOT. If you think about it from an AI perspective, just teaching a computer to have a consciousness is almost insurmountable, yet even the most Autistic person can do that easily. So things we take for granted, are still a kind of miracle, like looking at an apple and knowing it came from a tree, what it tastes like, smells like, what you can do with it etc. </p>
<p>People with learning disabilities may be deficient in some areas like memory, or logic, but be strong in others, like math, empathy, or anticipation. Someone could have excellent memory, but lack the capacity to really understand the meaning of what they are memorizing. </p>
<p>Now we don't all have exactly the same total ability, but I would wager the difference in brain power between Einstein, and your gardner is not as great as you think. Certainly not as large as the difference between IBM's Big Blue and a 9 yr old. </p>
<p>So people may be capable of much, but have trouble learning. They may arrive at high function, but it may take them longer to get there. People with dyslexia for instance are not dumb, but school can be hard for them and they need longer. </p>
<p>Other people may be severely disabled and lack the ability to do things we take for granted, and yet have extraordinary gifts in other areas. </p>
<p>Even average people may have a few abilities that are far above average. It depends a lot on a persons mind, and not just their brain. How organized their thoughts are, can affect how well they communicate ideas, how well they reason problems out, even without getting into the physical aspects of a brain. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>my theory is compensation. I am autistic, and I think I have to work  extra hard in some arenas just to keep my social head above water, and this manifests itself in some interesting ways. </p>
<p>pretty simple, if someone loses an arm, the other one gets stronger, because they must work harder with what remains. </p>
<p>In my case, I have a difficult time remembering information people tell me, because it all sounds like a wild cacaphony, so I don't well distinguish it from background noise or simply from people bullshitting, stuff I should ignore anyway. I don't have automatic context, and context is the only way I can find to retain information. I undergo far too many permutations to find meaning in what you guys automatically and skillfully rifle through. </p>
<p>My solution is to start to &quot;paint&quot; facts and feelings and stories on the landscape onto or near where I heard it. It barely works, and I fail all the time, no matter how hard I try. I put tons of effort into it though, and I really have to focus to listen and then apply. </p>
<p>The hilarious side effect is that I could recreate a setting I was in with uncommon clarity and detail, and tell you what facts or stories or information may have occurred there. Alternately, I'll revisit a place I &quot;painted&quot; the info onto, and I'll remember a lot of irrelevant data I applied to the scene. I won't remember the facts any better than anyone, but almost no one on earth will remember the setting better than I. This isn't especially useful, but I'm lucky that people are attracted to others with uncommon abilities. </p>
<p>Also, it makes me better than average at 3D modeling and spacial recognition, and visual problem solving, and pattern recognition. All of which I am in the top 1%. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With respect, the answers saying the autistic are dedicating more of their brain to memory and have special abilities are perhaps missing some practical information.</p>
<p>I've been working with the autistic for a decade now. The reason they seem to have good memories about preferred topics is <em>perseverance</em>. That's the symptom name for their habit of repeating things over and over and focusing on one small preferred topic. You hear about the autistic teenager who knows every bus number and scheduled bus time in Los Angeles? Well, you could know that too if you spent 6-7 hours per day staring at a bus schedule and repeating the numbers, for years, like he does. That's an actual example. Some of these kids wake up in the morning and grab their preferred material from next to the bed and go over the information for the millionth time and keep at it every chance during the day. They lag in other areas, and are often hard to draw into speech about anything other than their preferred topic.</p>
<p>If they're lucky the preferred topic can at least be something other people are interested in. If not, they might be memorizing part numbers for the 1965 sears craftsman tool and die catalog. It can be hard to understand or predict what they will seize onto. Your memory could be just as good, though, if you dedicated as much time to the narrow material choice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So this is a post about what causes Autism*</p>
<p>*Representing a pretty well supported but not final body of research in neurology. </p>
<p>Autism Spectrum Disorder is a diagnosis based on social and behavioral features (restrictive interests, repetitive behavior, problems with social interactions) rather than by a common biological cause. </p>
<p>Interestingly, there seem to be two rough groups of people affected by Autism. The first group tends to have the social/ behavioral problems in addition to intellectual disability, developmental delay, mis-developed body features, other stuff associated with  genetic disorders. There is mounting evidence that for these folks, Autism if often a result of various spontaneous genetic mutations in the parents sperm or egg (or in early embryo) that interfere with brain development in ways that converge on a common pattern &quot;Autism&quot; as well as other symptoms depending on what genes are affected. </p>
<p>But for group number 2, they have the same kinds of social/ behavioral features, but are otherwise completely normal and don't have the higher incidence of harmful genetic changes seen in group 1. I don't know of any comparable leads on the biological basis of the disease for this group but awesome science is happening a the time so who knows. </p>
<p>I can provide sources if anyone is interested </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
