		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's actually not a biology reason but an engineering one. Humans can breath pretty much ok as long as the oxygen pressure is around what we are used to. For example at 1 atmosphere of pressure we have about 20% oxygen in air. The trick you can do it lower the pressure and increase the oxygen content and people will still be fine. With pure oxygen you can comfortably live with only 30% of sea level pressure. This is useful in spacecraft because lower pressures mean lighter weight systems. </p>
<p>For Apollo (and Gemini and Mercury before them) the idea was to start on the ground with 100% oxygen at slightly higher pressure than 1 atmosphere to make sure seals were properly sealing. Then as the capsule rose into lower pressure air the internal pressure would be decreased until it reached 0.3 atmosphere once in space. However pure oxygen at high pressure will make a lot of things very flammable which was underestimated by NASA. During a ground test a fire broke out and the 3 astronauts of Apollo 1 died burned alive in the capsule.</p>
<p>At lower pressures this fire risk is less of an issue but now pure oxygen atmospheres have been abandoned in most area of spaceflight. The only use case is into spacesuits made for outside activities. Those are very hard to move into because they basically act like giant pressurized balloons. To help with that they are using low pressure pure oxygen.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great answer by u/electric_ionland, I'd also like to point out that by using one gas, you only need one gas tank, not two. You don't need complicated mixing/regulating hardware to mix in nitrogen for breathing either. Saves weight and complexity. Apollo continued using pure oxygen, even after Apollo 1.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other answers are good, but to answer you question directly: astronauts are not required to have 100% oxygen, they are required to have similar partial pressure to Earth. This can be accomplished by 100% oxygen at a low pressure, a similar ratio and pressure to Earth, which is 101kPa/14.7psi at sea level with about 21% oxygen, or anything in between.</p>
<p>By using a lower pressure, the internal pressure of a spacecraft or spacesuit is closer to the vacuum of space, so you can save mass structure mass (plus the mass of the gases is lower). But, there is a fire risk (eg Apollo 1) and some biological reasons why you can't breathe 100% oxygen for a long time, even with the correct partial pressure. But to move between low and high pressures, one has to compress/decompress to avoid the bends, just like divers do.</p>
<p>Fun fact 1: USSR/Russia always used Earth pressure for Soyuz. Apollo used 5psi/100% oxygen.  When they jointly had a mission together in 1975 ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo%E2%80%93Soyuz" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo%E2%80%93Soyuz" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo%E2%80%93Soyuz</a></a>  ), they had to used an intermediate pressure and airlock to be able to move between spacecraft. This mission helped restore relations during the cold war.</p>
<p>Fun fact 2: ISS uses Earth pressure, so compression/decompression is not required to enter or exit it. But an over-inflated spacesuit is no fun to move around in, so for spacewalks 5psi/100% oxygen is still used in the suit. Before and after a spacewalk, a few hours are required for compression/decompression.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They have to pre-breathe pure oxygen prior to going on a spacewalk to purge nitrogen from their blood. If they don't, when they depressurize the airlock, the nitrogen might form bubbles in their blood, a condition known as &quot;bends&quot; or decompression sickness. SCUBA divers can avoid it by coming up very slowly, but it's harder with airlocks. It's very dangerous if it happens, and more so given that they're at least a day's trip away from serious medical help if they need to make an emergency return. So it's better just to eliminate the source of the problem, nitrogen in the blood, entirely so that there's no chance of problems. However, the ISS and all crewed space capsules use nitrox (nitrogen-oxygen mix) to slow down any fires that might start in the cabin. This is a response to the Apollo 1 disaster, where a pure-oxygen atmosphere helped a fire spread through the cabin incredibly quickly, which resulted in the deaths of the three astronauts onboard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
