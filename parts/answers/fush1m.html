		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don’t see the right answer yet so:</p>
<p>The plasma contains antibodies from the donor. Presumably there are antibodies in the donor that have neutralized the virus. Antibodies are just proteins that latch on to a target and help flag it so the hosts immune system recognizes the problem and eliminates it. </p>
<p>The donor antibodies will circulate for weeks to months in the host, but they cannot make more of themselves — they are just proteins originally made by B cells in the host. Therefore plasma infusions for these critically ill patients are just a temporary measure until their own bodies hopefully learn to eliminate the virus without help.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The plasma contains anti-viral antibodies which were produced by the donor's immune response. These antibodies attach to surface proteins on the viral particles and serve to block the interaction between human cells and the viral surface proteins, thus inhibiting the ability of the virus to enter and infect cells.</p>
<p>The body may actually react to the antibodies as foreign (since they are from another individual) resulting in serum sickness.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is that antibodies can also serve as a homing marker for destruction by other immune cells. This is classically seen in a bacterial infection. The antibodies coat the bacteria (opsonization) and are then detected by white blood cells which eat (phagocytose) and destroy the bacteria. This process does not occur with a virus as it is far too small. In this case, the immunity is conferred trough functionally blocking viral entry into the human cell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The human immune system is a fantastic system &amp; it is very complicated.  There are scientists &amp; physicians who do nothing but study &amp; work with the Immune System.  One major component of the Immune System is the Lymphatic System, but there are many different parts that function together to protect their human host, including the bone marrow, the Thymus gland, the large intestine, the peritoneal cavity, lymph glands... The antibodies to some infectious agents provide a lifetime immunity, such as to Smallpox.  If you get Hepatitis B through infection directly from another person, that will give you a lifetime of being an active Hepatitis carrier, you can pass it to other people &amp; die from liver failure or liver cancer @ anytime in your life.  But, if you get the Hepatitis B vaccine, you will develop antibodies &amp; have a lifetime immunity.  Some infections, for example, from a strain of influenza or a cold virus, you will develop antibodies, but not for a lifetime, usually only approx. 12-18 months where the antibody titer (count of the number) gradually goes down monthly. The blood from survivors, of certain infections can be removed, is strained to isolate the antibodies &amp; infused into the overwhelmingly sick patient.  The donor antibodies will actively fight the infectious organism, but all antibodies, like almost all human cells, have a limited lifetime.  The hope is that the donated antibodies will give enough of an ‘edge’ to the victim/patient, to give the victim/patient enough time for their own immune system to catch up &amp; develop it’s own antibodies.  Sometimes the severity of an infection in a human host is because the human patient gets overwhelmed with a very strong organism that replicates quicker than the human host’s body can respond strong enough to fight it off.  This very new concept of taking the antibodies from a survivor &amp; injecting it into a failing human host patient, worked with Ebola patients, but it isn’t known whether it will work with COVID-19.  I think that the desperation of the situation dictates whether the scientific &amp; medical community chooses antibody donation as an option, because there are big risks with it also.  Anyway, I believe that the time that is chosen is dictated by 1) the antibody donor is strong, health &amp; fully recovered, 2) the donor is fully recovered - not still infected, 3) there is a blood donor program that is able to handle this.  It’s wonderful for you to offer to donate blood, plasma, antibodies...  Our nations Blood Services &amp; Hospitals are always in great need for blood products &amp; those blood products do save lives!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not the plasma that is injected. That is just what is extracted from the donor. The donated plasma is processed, refined, and the desired elements are extracted. In this case, the anti-Covid19 antibodies.  Do a quick search of Anti-D, or Anti-Tetanus, or Anti-Rabies. It would be the same process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
