		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It improves the efficacy. <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00528-6/fulltext" target="_blank">https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00528-6/fulltext</a> &quot;Modelling analyses showed an increase in vaccine efficacy after two standard doses from <strong>55·1%</strong>.(95% CI 33·0 to 69·9) with an interval of less than 6 weeks to <strong>81·3%</strong> (60·3 to 91·2) with an interval of at least 12 weeks.&quot;</p>
<p>We are not really sure why. One possibility is that it's due to the body having more time to get over the vector immunty problem. But mRNA vaccines like Pfizer also reported better results with a longer delay. It is quite possible that the 3-4 week interval selected for fast trial results is not optimal for overall vaccine efficacy. Or it's possible that the vaccine just get more protective over time, both Johnson and Johnson and Sinovac reported improvements if you measure months later. Most likely a combination of all those reasons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Where I live (Alberta, Canada) they decided to standardize on 16 weeks between first and second dose for all vaccines (including AstraZeneca), until we had the majority of people with one dose. Now they’re doing second doses, and it looks like it improves immunity across the board.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
