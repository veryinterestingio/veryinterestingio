		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A grain of sand gets into the flesh of the oyster and it has sharp edges that cut. The oyster in turn creates a coating that smooths out the sharp edges so they don’t cause too much damage to the flesh. The oyster has no way of ejecting the sand so it keeps making the coating, and keeps layering it on the grain of sand. Eventually you end up with a pearl. Other than protecting the soft flesh of the oyster from damage by sand, no, there is no real biological reason to create them. If the oyster could somehow eject the offending particle, we wouldn’t get pearls.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The mollusc is attempting to isolate an irritant which, with the constant inflow and outflow of water, will cause abrasion and injury.</p>
<p>Instead of letting that happen the organism coats it in goo, with a curved non-abrasive edge.</p>
<p>It is not a cancerous process, no.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pearls are the result of the way oysters deal with damaging particles (either alive like a bug or material like sand) inside their shell: Encapsulate them into layers of the same material the inside of their shell is made from, so they will stop harming the soft inside body of the oyster.</p>
<p>It is not a cancer, and it's useless for the oyster afterwards.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two things first: 1. oysters and clams are different, although I appreciate the attempt at using a broader vocabulary, and 2. pearls are not cancer material; they're more like boogers.</p>
<p>Semantics aside, the first point is actually kind of relevant because clams do not produce pearls.</p>
<p>To directly answer your question: no, there is no biological use for a pearl. However, a pearl is the result of an important biological function. Whenever a potential harmful external agent, such as a piece of sand or a parasite, slips through the shell and the protective barrier around an oyster's internal parts, called the mantle, the oyster begins secreting a substance called mother-of-pearl. This is basically what happens with boogers--the mucus in the nose coats flecks of dust and other irritants until they are too large to slip past our nose hairs. The oyster continues to coat the irritant until it is rendered harmless, and the oyster spits out the fully formed pearl.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
