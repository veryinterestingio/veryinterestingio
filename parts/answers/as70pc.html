<blockquote>
<p>My understanding of this is that the hair follicle somehow becomes damaged. What “stops” hair from growing is that they follicle goes through cycles.</p>
<p>In this damaged follicle, there is no “off” to the cycle, so it continuously grows. Additionally, a side effect of damaged hair follicles is sometimes the loss of the follicles ability to create color using melanin.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a genetic point insertion mutation (Resulting from improper correction of a UV induced covalent bond between adjacent Cytosine residue), very similar to the mutations that lead to Melanoma, but as it doesn't prevent senescence like a cancer mutation does, it doesn't multiply like a cancer nor get attacked by the immune system or initiate self-apoptotic pathways.</p>
<hr />
<p>To put it more clearly;</p>
<p>When a cell's DNA undergoes mutation, there's a bunch of mechanisms (failsafes) in place that your body uses to kill off cells to ensure they don't turn into cancers. In order to become a cancer cell, all of these failsafes have to fail at once. </p>
<p>However in the case of these long hairs, the mutated hair follicle escapes some of these failsafes (The ones that would normally &quot;Fix&quot; the mutated DNA) but doesn't trigger the remainder (As it doesn't behave like a cancer or trigger an immune response). Instead, the mutation forces the cell to produce hair as fast as it can until it starves or dies through normal mechanisms.</p>
<p>Because the mutation causes the hair to grow so rapidly, it doesn't have a chance to fully mature or properly form, as a result the hair is pale, thin, brittle and easily pulled, as noted in the OP. </p>
<p>One way to look at it is that every time you get one of those weird white hairs, you can see it as a time you &quot;Almost&quot; got a cancer cell.</p>
<p>EDIT: </p>
<p>Some points to clarify:</p>
<p>It's not in the same cells as melanoma, but Hair Follicles and Melanocytes are found in a similar place and the specific mutation is very closely related, both are believed to be caused by UV light exposure as well (Or at least that's one of many possible causes for a given point insertion mutation).</p>
<p>Additionally, not every mutation like this will lead to &quot;Cancer or long hairs&quot;. You actually get mutations like this all the time. 90 times out of 100, the cell corrects the mutation. 8 times out of 100, the cell kills itself to avoid further mutation or cancer. 1 time out of 100 the mutation isn't corrected, the cell doesn't kill itself or nothing happens at all and the very last 1 time out of 100, things like this happen; A cell may become cancerous, it may produce long white hairs, it may over-produce an enzyme or a receptor or it may change some aspect of it's cell wall make-up. (Just a note, these aren't exact statistics, just an example of probability. Most of the time, mutations are corrected, do nothing or just lead to the death of the mutated cell)</p>
<p>Mutations like this happen all the time, and variations can lead to all sorts of unusual changes when they occur in reproductive cells, although point insertions are less likely in that type of cell due to reduced radiation exposure (Deletions and substitutions are far more common).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
