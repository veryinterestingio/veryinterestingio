		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a game, a toy, a mathematical toy.</p>
<p>It merely demonstrates that a few very simple rules can generate extremely complex behaviour.  The &quot;rules&quot; for whether an individual cell lives or dies into the next generation are so simple you can do them by hand yourself.</p>
<p>But apply it to a large field of random cells, or a carefully chosen pattern of cells, and you can generate things that appear to wander off into infinity, to last forever, and even generate more things themselves that then wander off into infinity.</p>
<p>If you choose carefully enough, you can make a entire computer inside the game, powered entirely by little things running around based only on those same simple rules of what lives and what dies in the next generation.  An entire computer that could, in theory, perform any calculation that your computer could.</p>
<p>It's an interesting mathematical diversion depicting Turing-completeness, the chaos that arises from simple rules, and it just looks pretty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a fairly simple set of rules. And it kind of makes sense as a very simple simulation of how bacteria or other life might work. But this simple set of rules will still yield very complex systems which will do complex arithmetic, replicate itself and move around, just like simple lifeforms. And this have quite a number of philosophical implications.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a game that follows very simple rules.</p>
<ol>
<li>You have an infinite grid.</li>
<li>Spaces in the grid can either be &quot;alive&quot; or &quot;dead&quot;, represented in white and black.</li>
<li>A dead space becomes alive if there are exactly three spaces in the 8 spaces surrounding it that are alive.</li>
<li>A living space dies if there are fewer than two, or more than three living spaces surrounding it. </li>
<li>Keep iterating rules 2 and 3 for as long as you want. </li>
</ol>
<p>The interesting thing about this is that despite having simple rules you can get a really wide array of different behaviors out of the infinite grid. There isn't any direct significance to it you couldn't get from other methods, but it's a fun thing to play around with and talk about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's kind of a mathematical simulation that very abstractly shows how populations could evolve. The name &quot;Game&quot; implies it's not to model a real thing but actually to study random behavior that comes up from the rules.</p>
<p>Each coloured pixel is &quot;populated&quot;. And every step each pixel is updated according to a set of rules.</p>
<p>If an unpopulated pixel has enough (2+) populated neighbours, it becomes populated (life spreads there)</p>
<p>If a populated pixel has too few populated neighbours (1 or less) it becomes unpopulated. </p>
<p>If it has a medium amount of neighbours (2-3) it stays populated.</p>
<p>If it has a high amount of neighbours (3+) it's overpopulated and dies, so returns to white.</p>
<p>These rules lead to emergent behavior, of certain cycles being able to exist indefinitely, and some of them even moving forward. </p>
<p>It's a very easy way to show the property of &quot;emergence&quot;. That simple rules and simple agents can together form something very complex (wich is how actual life works too, or a human brain, or a computer)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You’re looking at simple rules that give rise to incredibly complex behavior that couldn’t have been predicted by just reading the rules.</p>
<p>The “glider” is my favorite, since it moves through the field even though there’s absolutely no rules about movement at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
