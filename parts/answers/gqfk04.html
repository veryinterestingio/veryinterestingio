<p>When and why did a single player mode in a game become synonymous with the term &quot;campaign&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a lot of good answers, but your question suggests that you're operating under a misconception.</p>
<p>Single player mode is NOT synonymous with &quot;campaign.&quot;</p>
<p>A campaign is a set of missions/levels/experiences set sequentially, and it usually tells a story.  It mirrors a military campaign which is usually set a battles in a particular theater.  It really needs to have both the &quot;missions&quot; component and the story component.</p>
<p>Fighting games have single player but it's generally not organized as a campaign because there's no story.  Games like Borderlands that have stories but aren't divided up into missions don't have campaigns.  Most open world games aren't going to call it a campaign for the same reason - no segmentation into missions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the military, a campaign is a series of maneuvers and battles, usually involving mostly the same forces at least on one side, attempting to achieve an overall objective.  There may be some downtime between engagements for repairs, replacements, and other logistical stuff.</p>
<p>Early wargames (both miniatures and boardgames) used the term as well.  It's perhaps a coincidence that many/most board wargamers often played solitaire due to lack of opponents with the same interests and able to coordinate time and location for such long games.</p>
<p>Early RPGs evolved directly from wargames, so they adopted the term to mean a series of adventures involving mostly the same group of characters, possibly with downtime in between for leveling up and stuff.</p>
<p>Many early computer games were based on wargames and RPGs, or simulators, so they adopted the same term for the same thing.  Coincidentally most early computer games were played single-player.</p>
<p>So for game usage it dates back at least to 1913, when <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3691/3691-h/3691-h.htm" target="_blank">Little Wars</a>, the first published set of wargame rules, was created.  There's nothing inherently single-player about a campaign, though campaigns are often used to make single-player games more interesting than random unconnected one-offs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since Wolfenstein there was just &quot;FPS&quot; as a genre. With the introduction of Quake 3 and Unreal Tournament in the late 90s though, the genre was split down the middle. Q3 and UT could be played single player, but were death match games first. The term &quot;campaign&quot; then was introduced to distinguish the old style FPS gameplay from the new death match format. If a death match game came out, you'd ask whether it had a single player <em>campaign</em>, to clarify that you mean a game mode specifically designed to be played through linearly by one person, as opposed to being able to play the death match mode with bots.  </p>
<p>The word itself is clearly military in origin, in keeping with some of the themes of certain FPS games. I feel like it might have been Quake 2 that introduced it, but I could be wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One possible source I've not yet seen directly attributed here yet is the Real Time Strategy (RTS) genre.</p>
<p>Could they be the missing link between games of yore and the more contemporary use of the term &quot;Campaign&quot; in video games?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>These have their roots in both the fore mentioned Table Top, pen and paper RPGs as well as in the military too, given their own nature of describing wars, battles and conquests.  Indeed, the RTS genre (as well as the RPG genre, if I'm not mistaken) could well be linked back to the wargaming used by Imperial armies to train their officers ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargame" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargame" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargame</a></a> ).</p>
<p>The earliest reference is Wacrfaft 2 (1995) which has  the term &quot;Campaign&quot; featured on its main menu to describe single player story missions.</p>
<p>It may be of interest that in Warcraft terminology - a single game might be referred to as a Scenario, while a series of games following a linear narrative become a Campaign.  </p>
<p>Perhaps someone is able to find an alternative original source demonstrating the use of this term in a video game in a Text Based RPG or something similar.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: I originally stated that Dune II (1992) had a campaign option labelled a such on the menu, but it appears as though I was mistaken.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
