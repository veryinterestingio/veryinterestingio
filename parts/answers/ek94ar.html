		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Planes try to avoid flying into areas that contain high amounts of moisture like clouds.  When that isn't possible there are de-icing systems on the plane that prevent the buildup of ice around critical areas like the engine inlets and leading edges of wings and probes.  They work by heating up or by passing bleed air from the engines underneath the surface or an electric heater.  This is the reason why the leading edges of engine intakes on most planes aren't painted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Ice on the wings is not a massive issue at high altitudes compared to lower altitudes as other answers have explained.</p>
<p>However, the cold can have other effects, like causing small amounts of water in the fuel to freeze,  which need to be mitigated (see BA38)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Planes DO accumulate ice. Not sure about -70F (at that temperature, air is pretty dry and may not have enough moisture). But at temperatures ranging from say, 20 to -20 deg F, a plane can definitely accumulate ice - on the wings, tail, and so on. This is why all commercially operated airplanes that are going to be flying in known icing conditions (at the right moisture and temperature combination for ice) are treated to prevent ice accumulation. There are several types of anti-ice and de-ice systems to prevent the airplane from becoming covered in ice, including spraying for the wing with chemicals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ice requires two things to form. It needs to be cold, which we have, and there needs to be visible moisture. Generally speaking at high altitudes there is very little moisture, and what moisture there is, is ice crystals which are difficult to stick onto an aircraft. Icing generally occurs at lower altitudes and is countered by anti-icing systems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
