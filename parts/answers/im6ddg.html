		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably a couple reasons:</p>
<p>When you’re indoors you’re likely at rest, meaning that your body temperature will drop. When you’re outside, you’re more likely to be moving, meaning your body temp is higher, and so the coolness of the air feels comfortable. </p>
<p>Also, outside you’re more likely to be getting sunlight, which comes with warmth. Sitting in the sun, even on cold days, feels warmer than sitting in the shade. The radiation from the sun will warm you up. Inside you’re less likely to be getting that sunlight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the time, relative humidity plays a huge role in how we perceive heat. Normally in an air conditioned house, the air will be between 45-55% humidity. Where I am (deep south USA), 80%+ is fairly normal. Just walking outside in the morning before the sun has risen, the perceived  change is fairly dramatic</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How hot or cold you feel tends to be about the rate heat enters and leaves your body, and that only partially depends on temperature.    There are really 4 ways that heat can enter or leave your body, and they all only partially depend on temperature.</p>
<p>1) Conduction, how well the material in contact with your body leaves your body.  In this case both cases it's Air, so it isn't this one.  However, this phenomena is the answer to why stepping on stone in the morning feels a lot colder than carpet, even though both materials are the same temperature.</p>
<p>2) Convection, how quickly the material in contact with your body moves towards and away from your body, taking heat with it.  Assuming it isn't &quot;windier&quot; inside or out, it's probably not this one.  It might contribute if inside you are sitting under the cold air ducts and it is blowing on you.</p>
<p>3) Radiation.  Since outside presumably the sun is shining, and the sun is 5800 degrees Kelvin, it will warm you, this is part of the answer.  It is the answer why 68 at noon under clear skies feels warmer than 68 at night under clear skies.</p>
<p>4) Evaporation.  Air conditioning dramatically dries out the air, so your sweat evaporates much more quickly indoors than it would outside, since the drier inside air has much more room to allow evaporation.  This is the most likely answer.  As your sweat evaporates, it takes significant heat away from your body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To throw my towel in the ring, I'm going to bring up exposure to sunlight.</p>
<p>Here in the southwest US, being in the shade (or better indoors) makes a world of difference.</p>
<p>90F(32.2C) in the shade is nice, but in the sun it sucks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
