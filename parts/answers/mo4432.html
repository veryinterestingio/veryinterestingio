		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>mRNA vaccines require compentency.  Cells have to identify the strand, take it up, produce the antigen, and then release it.  Then T-cells discover it, and recruit a B-cell to remember it.  Person to person, this could lower the amount of efficacy that a vaccine has if there aren't a lot of antigen being made because of a failure at any of the previous steps.</p>
<p>With the Ferritin, basically the T-cells discover the end product and recruit the B-cells.  That's it.  Delivery is faster, more effective, and probably much longer lasting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I mean there are a handful of different types of vaccines so your question is a little broad. Basically, ferritin vaccines are a type of virus-like particle. VLPs fit under the umbrella of subunit vaccines. The idea behind subunit vaccines is that you immunize with pieces of a pathogen rather than the whole pathogen. This is beneficial when certain components of the pathogen cause nasty side effects, modulate your immune system in an unfavorable way, or cause you to build immunity to components that are not important for establishing lasting immunity (think rapidly evolving viral proteins, like influenza hemagglutinin). VLPs are further beneficial in that they’re usually designed to be of a particular size that makes them readily taken up by your immune system. They can also be modified to stimulate your immune system in various ways. </p>
<p>VLPs have a number of downsides though. They’re often quite expensive to produce. They usually need to be stored at subzero conditions. Scaling up production can be a challenge depending on what particle and expression system is being used. Some (though I don’t think ferritin fits in this category) also elicit adaptive immune responses to the particle itself</p>
<p>In the case of this ferritin vaccine, the major difference between it and the Pfizer, Moderna, and J&amp;J vaccines is that it delivers a fully synthesized protein loaded on ferritin whereas the other vaccines all deliver nucleic acids that cause your body to produce the pathogenic protein. This is important because delivering whole protein (generally) elicits an antibody-mediated immune response whereas these newer nucleic acid vaccines tend to stimulate more T cell-skewed immune responses.</p>
<p>IMO, the ferritin vaccine you linked isn’t all that interesting. I don’t see a strong case for excluding non-spike pathogenic material. Also, from what I know of the covid spike protein, it is able to evolve fairly rapidly which means you probably want to elicit a stronger cell-mediated response to it than an antibody one. Without going into much detail, cell-mediated immune responses tend to target more conserved regions of proteins than antibody mediated immune responses.</p>
<p>Anyways this is already running longer than I intended and I have to get back to what I was doing. Might edit this later or feel free to ask me questions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some more info on the ferritin nanoparticles to contrast them to the lipid nanoparticles used in the mRNA vaccines:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5831262/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5831262/</a></p>
<p>Ferritin (a protein) forms nanoparticles which occur naturally within humans, unlike the synthetic lipid nanoparticles used to deliver the mRNA used in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. So there's a case to be made that using an endogenous delivery mechanism has less unknowns associated with it than using a synthetic delivery mechanism. Likewise, delivering raw proteins has more known history (see anti-venoms) than delivering mRNA to synthesize those proteins in vivo.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
