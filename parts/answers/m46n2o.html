<p>It means that if say 10% of unvaccinated people get covid, then only 1% of vaccinated people will get it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We’ll never have a truly comprehensive idea of why this is the case as everyone has small differences in their own individual biology. That being said, individuals who are partially immunocompromised or on immunosuppressants (even if the immunosuppressant has a specific niche molecular target rather than the entire immune system, like many mAb drugs) may not be effective at forming a robust immune response from a vaccine. The rationale with those people is “something is better than nothing, might as well try vaccinating cause it could work.” To a lesser extent, the same can be said for the elderly. After around 50 years old, an individuals ability to form T cell responses to NEW antigens gradually starts to diminish with age. And effective B cell/antibody responses of course depend on T cell responses because of cytokines and class switching.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s been shown that the higher your antibody count, the more you’re protected. And your antibody count is related to how your immune system responds to the vaccine. So while no studies looked at infected vaccinated people, aside from small studies and clinical trial, the belief is that the more responsive you are to the vaccine, it will keep you protected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I discussed this in a lecture recently, here are my thoughts (though u/What_the_muff is right, we don't have any data):</p>
<p>The efficacies are really high, which suggests some combination of immunologic disorders and technical error. Was the vaccine given as directed? At the appropriate dose? Was it prepared and/or stored correctly?</p>
<p>Those sorts of things - like how birth control is 95% effective. Why not 100%? Some people use it wrong, or there are manufacturing defects or something.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
