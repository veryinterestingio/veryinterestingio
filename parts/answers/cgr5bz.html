		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What could I say to a friend that does not believe vaccines are necessary as diseases are extremely rare? She also contributes the decline of diseases to the rise in sanitation instead of vaccines, which is partially correct but Iâ€™m assuming vaccines are what brought the end to the threat of rampant diseases. What could I say to her in response? No matter what I say, I cannot convince her out of her antivax stance and would like some advice from professionals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of my sons developed hard nodules in his leg muscles after his first series of shots, that the pediatrician said were probably sterile cysts.  They were there and easily feelable for at least 2 years.  I couldn't find anything online about this reaction for the longest time, until I came across some studies done that seem to indicate that this reaction can happen as a result of a localised allergic reaction to the aluminum adjuvant.  Seeing as there seems to be little info out there I can find on this particular phenomena, is there any wisdom you can impart to me concerning it, or resources you can point me to?
Edit: also, any vaccine for Lyme's in the works?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How long do most vaccines last?  I am a nurse and we are seeing a lot of women in their early 20's who had both the MMR and varicella vaccines as a child but now have negative titers.  Since I work in women's health I am concerned we will be seeing more pregnant women with measles and chicken pox because they are now lacking immunity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
