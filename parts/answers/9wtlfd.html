		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I misread the question, thought it was asking about something different. This is why you always carefully read problems, folks, you wouldn't want this to happen on an exam. I'll leave the original answer at the bottom as it can be helpful for people thinking about these things.</p>
<p>What you have, OP, is actually a proof. If you do things under assumptions that seem valid, but lead to a contradiction, then you can conclude that at least one of your assumptions is false. This is a proof of the fact that there isn't a uniform distribution on the natural numbers, ie that you can't randomly pick integers out randomly with equal probability. If you assume that there is a uniform distribution, then you should be able to do both of the things that you suggest, which contradict each other. Therefore, any distribution on the natural numbers has to give different probabilities to different numbers. Though, it is worth pointing out that rather than you not being able to do this because there is no uniform distribution on the natural numbers, it is the other way around: There is no uniform distribution on the natural numbers because you are not able to do this. </p>
<p>This doesn't mean that you can't talk about things like probabilities on the natural numbers as if there was a uniform distribution, you just have to be careful and understand that you'll eventually need to approach it from a different angle when you get to proofs. For instance, we do often say that the &quot;probability&quot; of a number being even is 1/2, but we always have a tiny asterisk there noting that it's not actually a probability that we're using. So if you hear people talking about the natural number as if there were a probability, just know that there are technical caveats to that statement. And, in fact, the technicalities are pretty much what you were using to get to this reasoning.</p>
<hr />
<p>The probability of something being zero does not mean that it is impossible. The probability of something being 100% is not a guarantee that it will happen. In the case when there possibilities are finite, these implications follow, but not when they are infinite.</p>
<p>The standard example is that out a dartboard. Pretend that you have a dartboard and an infinitely precise dart. The probability that you land on any particular section of the dartboard is the area of that section divided by the total area. What, then, is the probability of you hitting exactly in the middle of the bullseye? It's 0%, because this is a single point and has zero area. It's not impossible, but you will almost surely not hit it. </p>
<p>These ideas are made precise on the Wikipedia page for &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely" target="_blank">almost surely</a>&quot;, which is a technical term.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have mentioned, you cannot assign a uniform probability distribution to the natural numbers, but I didn't see any explanations involving the probability axioms, so I'm giving another quick explanation in case it's more clear to some people.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_axioms" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_axioms</a></p>
<p>The first axiom states that all probabilities must be non-negative real numbers.</p>
<p>Another axiom states that the probability of the entire sample space is equal to 1, i.e. that one of the events will actually happen. In our case, for example, we are assuming that a natural number will indeed be picked (as opposed to picking something outside the natural numbers, or picking no number at all).</p>
<p>The final axiom states that for any countable set of mutually exclusive events, the total probability of any one of those events happening is equal to the sum of their individual probabilities.</p>
<p>We can see that this prohibits a uniform (all the same value) probability distribution on the natural numbers. If the probability for picking each number is equal to 0, then the probability of our entire sample space is 0 - nothing can occur, contradicting our axiom that the probability of our entire sample space is equal to 1. </p>
<p>On the other hand, if the probability of picking each number has any positive value at all, then the sum of the individual probabilities for all numbers will be infinite. However, the probability of the union of all events can't be higher than 1, since the union of all the numbers is our entire sample space. Since the probability of the union of the events is 1, but the sum of the individual probabilities of the events is infinite, we are violating the third axiom I mentioned.</p>
<p>So to find a uniform distribution that satisfies the axioms, we'd need to find a non-negative real number that is not zero and not positive, which is not possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no uniform distribution over the natural numbers. You cannot have the same chance for every natural number, and you found the reason why already.</p>
<p>&quot;Random&quot; can still mean something  like 1/2 chance to choose 0, 1/4 chance to choose 1, 1/8 chance to choose 2 and so on. A finite chance for every number to appear. That is possible.</p>
<p>You can have a uniform distribution over e.g. the real numbers in the interval [0,1]. In that case every number has a probability of 0 to be picked but you still pick a number. What is different? The set of real numbers between 0 and 1 is not countable, the sum 0+0+0... approach doesn't work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The issue here is that standard probability is not &quot;weakly Laplacian&quot;, which is technical for &quot;you can't build uniform distributions on every subset of your space&quot;. This means we can't have fair lotteries on the natural numbers (sometimes called &quot;DeFinetti lotteries&quot;), unless we change the axioms and allow for infinitesimal values, which turns out to be a fruitful approach both epistemologically and mathematically.
