		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for joining us! How are you doing today? </p>
<p>This technology sounds like an incredible breakthrough. What was it like working with the machine learning algorithm in a situation like this? How quickly did it start to work effectively? Were there any hiccups along the way? Do you think the algorithms developed would be applicable between people?</p>
<p>Thank you for recognizing Bravo-1! His efforts here sound incredible, as do yours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The New York Times just had a piece on this research. It's quite exciting to read about. Did you find that engagement of the muscles related to speech increases or decreases the accuracy of translation?</p>
<p>Thank you for making yourselves available for questions, and much appreciation to Pancho for his spirit and determination.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Will the enormity of words in the human language ultimately be a limiting step in this technology?  (Also some words having similar meanings etc and he complexity of language.)</p>
<p>Is the ultimate goal to be able to have some sort of transcranial apparatus that would not have to be embedded directly into brain tissue?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This must be what is known in science fiction as &quot;subvocal speech.&quot; I've seen it as a trope frequently, but honestly I found it hard to believe it was really a thing. So, you're picking up intended lip and tongue motions as well? I guess the part that's hard for me to understand is how a subvocal mike in the throat (in books, it's always a microphone that goes straight to speech on the other end) can pick up words that won't be fully formed until they go through the mouth.</p>
<p>Edit: I read your intro more carefully. I see this is different. I suppose I was thinking of the act of saying words as more of a sequential series of real time muscle movements; but of course they all originate in the brain and there is no requirement that the first one actually be physically executed in order to perform the next one. Wow, that is truly amazing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very exciting work! Is it only effective for those that possessed then lost the ability to speak normally? Would it be effective for those that suffered damage to their motor cortex at birth (e.g. brain hemorrhages caused by premature birth) which interferes with their ability to control speech? Obviously &quot;it depends&quot;, but just curious if this technique might be effective for at least some of that population.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
