		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer to this is quite fascinating! A few hundred years ago the words <strong>did</strong> mean exactly what you would expect. Terrific meant a negative in the same way that horrific was a negative. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/56865/why-does-terrible-mean-bad-and-terrific-mean-good" target="_blank">Here</a> is a great article explaining all the details, but to pull out the relevant portion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This happened through a slow reshaping of the connections and connotations of terrific. First it acquired the sense, not just of terror-inducing but of general intensity. You could talk about a “terrific clamor,” meaning a whole lot of clamor. This was a bit of hyperbole—“so much noise it was terror-inducing!”—that eventually got reduced to a general sense of “more intense than usual.” Once a word like that gets established as a general intensifier, it may also be applied to positive experiences—terrific beauty, terrific joy—and from there the jump to a fully positive “terrific!” isn’t so unexpected.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simply because the usage has changed. &quot;Terrific&quot; did, in fact, mean &quot;terrifying&quot;, in much the same way that &quot;awesome&quot; meant &quot;causing terrifying awe&quot;. </p>
<p>However, definitions of words describe how they <em>are</em> being used. If people use the words in a different context, and that catches on, and spreads enough for long enough, then it becomes what that word means now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the most clever examples of the meaning of the word Terrific shifting is in the song HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS. When it says &quot;Gee, the traffic is terrific,&quot; it's playing off of both meanings of the word.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
