When we insulate something on earth its either in air or in a liquid, both of which transfer heat (conduct) a lot better. Basically the cold air or water &quot;steals&quot; your body heat a lot more than a vacuum would</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Temperature is a property of matter. The vacuum of outer space is, by definition, largely devoid of matter. For this reason, it is inappropriate to think of the vacuum of space as having a temperature.</p>
<p>What is true is that objects in the vacuum of outer space are often at the extremes of temperature. The reason for this is the fact that you do not have any air or water to help spread heat around (aka, &quot;convection&quot;). An object exposed to sunlight in space heats up just like an object exposed to the sun on earth, but on earth the air will carry away some of that heat. When we insulate things on earth to try and keep them hotter/colder than the surroundings (homes, food, etc), we either surround them with vacuum, or we do our best to keep the air from easily moving (styrofoam, fiberglass, blankets).</p>
<p>An astronaut's suit is typically white so that it does not absorb much heat energy from the sun to begin with, because the biggest concern in space for a human is generally getting rid of excess heat produced by the astronaut's body. The sunlight is a little brighter without the atmosphere absorbing stuff, but in general it's not a ton of energy from the sun, and in Low Earth Orbit (where the ISS is), you only have about 45 minutes of direct sunlight max as you circle the planet. The astronaut's suit includes a water cooling system that helps to combat the fact that they are basically in a vacuum thermos. Because our bodies are used to being able to dump our excess heat into the air around us and we get hot when we can't (imagine being wrapped in blankets), the heat has to go somewhere.</p>
<p>The ISS itself gets rid of excess heat the only way it can in a vacuum environment: by radiating heat energy in the form of infrared light into the darkness of space. The ISS uses ammonia-filled fins that are kept in shade to do this. They use ammonia because it can hold onto more heat energy drop per drop than water.</p>
<p>Scenes from movies where someone is exposed to a vacuum and instantly freeze are very, very unrealistic. If you were exposed to the vacuum of space, you would not have a great time, but as long as you didn't explosively decompress, you'd more or less stay your same temperature for a while and even survive if you were able to be rescued within a minute or so. Could get some localized cooling due to evaporation of water from your eyes and mouth, but nothing like freezing solid and breaking apart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: you know how in many movies if you get launched into space without a suit you almost instantly freeze? Well, that’s false. You would die of suffucation.
Heat gets transferred by contact. In actual space the atoms floating around are indeed very cold, but there’s so few of them touching you at any given time that you are losing heat very slowly, unlike on earth where, be it water or air, there’s always a lot of matter touching you.</p>
<p>Edit: ok, I was simplifying in the spirit of an eli5... you would die an horrible death based on a mix of suffucation, organ failure and internal pressure boiling you from the inside. But you definitely wouldn’t become a popsicle in the short term and would be very very dead long before becoming one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Space is not actually either hot or cold.</p>
<p>You know those thermos flasks that keep your cool drinks cool and your hot drinks hot? They use vacuum as an insulator to keep heat from transferring inwards or outwards to the drink keeping it the temperature it is.</p>
<p>The vacuum of outerspace will keep things exactly the temperature they are without allowing heat to transfer out in either directions the way it would for objects touching other objects like the air.</p>
<p>There are other ways you can transfer heat though. Things like simple infrared radiation the sort of thing you can see with thermal cams and infrared sensors.</p>
<p>A warm object in space would give of this sort of radiation until it cooled of to the level  of the background radiation of the universe at which point it would give off as much as it received and stay the same temperature.</p>
<p>This radiating heat away process is rather slow though.</p>
<p>A human body that generates a lot of heat normally would quickly overheat if the only way to transfer heat away was radiation.</p>
<p>Another important point is that there is a huge source of radiation in space called the sun. Sunshine will heat you up.</p>
<p>For satellites made out of solid stuff like metals and plastic and ceramics etc this is where it ends. You have to look at how much energy you receive from the sun to heat the thing up, how much heat it generates by running its machines and then find a way to radiate all that heat away with something like big metal fins to keep things stable.</p>
<p>For humans however we have another problem. Humans aren't made up out of just solid parts. We are rather squishy, with lots of liquid  components in the mix. Liquids behave in weird way in extremely low pressures.</p>
<p>Our normal human way of getting rid of heat by sweating out liquid is not going to do us any favors in a a vacuum.</p>
<p>Space suits mostly need to keep our body from being exposed to the vacuum and under pressure and ensuring that we don't overheat.</p>
<p>With suits designed for walking around on moons and planets we have a  different situation, because unlike the vacuum of space those have a temperature and mostly not one that is good for humans to live in. </p>
<p>On the moon where there is no atmosphere you only get heat transfer via the soles of your boots that touch the ground, but on Mars or similar it would be more complicated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heat and temperature are two different things.  Temperature is a measure of how fast some molecules are vibrating.  Heat is how much energy is contained there.</p>
<p>If you set your kitchen stove to 500 degrees, you can reach inside it with your bare hand for a few moments as long as you don’t touch anything.  The air is 500 degrees but it isn’t very dense — the air molecules are far apart so not many of them touch you.  But if you grab the metal wall of the stove you’re going to get a nasty burn instantly.  The metal is much more dense.  The temperature is the same, but the metal holds much more <em>heat</em>.</p>
<p>It works the same way with cold.  And in outer space, the atoms are very very very far apart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
