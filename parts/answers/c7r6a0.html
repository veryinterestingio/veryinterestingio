		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thank you so much for taking the time to answer those questions!</p>
<p>How will the navigation and mapping going to work? Obviously there will be no real time communication. I have read that our maps of Titan are less precise than the maps we had of Mars when Viking landed. Is is pure vision based? Radar? Inertial measurement units? How much autonomy will the dragonfly have for navigation and choosing landing spots?</p>
<p>From what I understand the power source is going to be based on the same RTG as Curiosity and the Mars 2020 rover. Will there need to be some adaptation on the module itself to work in Titan's atmosphere?</p>
<p>How are you going to handle communication? Is the aircraft going to use an orbital relay?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello! Thanks for this AMA!</p>
<p>What are the hardest engineering challenges you are facing in such a complex mission? Is it aiming for a specific orbit on a moon so far away? Is it making everything work under a strict power budget? Is it the payload that might be overly complex? Data transmission ?</p>
<p>As an engineer I would like to hear about what is the critical part of this mission and what might be surprisingly easy for you guys.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Firstly Hi, What a great project to be a part of!</p>
<p>Will you be examining the atmospheric cycle at all? I'm very interested in the  polar sea basin transfer of methane that appears to be going South to North direction at present but potentially will revert to a North to South direction over 10\^4 year timescales if I remember correctly. Is there a way to test this hypothesis?</p>
<p>I'm also very interested in the equatorial organic dust that occurs when the methane interacts with sunlight. Will you be examining this at all?</p>
<p>I'm a mature student in my 40's studying Astronomy and Planetary Science and for part of my end of year project this past year I looked into Titan to see how it can compare to Earth's atmospheric cycle and now I'm completely fascinated by Titan so this announcement made me very excited!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I appreciate any answers you can give.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

And if there is a delay in transmission from the moon how will it be controlled during high winds?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
