		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s actually fairly similar in both cases. </p>
<p>In cuts, the blood clots and a scab forms, inflammation occurs to get white blood cells to the area which eat up all the dead flesh, the cells needed to repair the area start to replicate, and then they start sticking together to make new skin. </p>
<p>In burns it’s similar except you miss out the blood clotting stage, it goes straight from injury to inflammation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Without gong into too much detail because I'm on a mobile device,  a burn wound can be worse in two distinct ways that makes cellular recovery more difficult.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It can damage the vasculature that feeds the area. This prevents both immune cells from arriving, which makes these areas ripe for subsequent infection, as well as the fibroblasts and monocytes important for granulation tissue formation and scar formation </p>
</li>
<li>If the burn is severe enough, it can kill the epithelial stem cells in the deeper tissue. This makes it much more difficult for the skin to regenerate and reform, sometimes making it impossible. Even deep cuts will only separate these epithelial cells, not destroy whole regions of them entirely</li>
