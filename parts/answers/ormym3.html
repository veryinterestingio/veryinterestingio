		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>2 ways:</p>
<p>1) Some types of mosquitoes hibernate indoors through a process called diapause. They hibernate in basements for the most part.</p>
<p>2) Other types of mosquitoes lay their eggs on water and proceed to die by winter. The eggs can survive up to 6 months. So when spring rolls around the ice starts melting the eggs become fully submerged in water, which triggers their hatching.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Airborne adults generally don't live that long anyway. 1-3 weeks generally assuming they aren't eaten by predators.</p>
<p>Mosquito eggs can generally tolerate frost and wont hatch unless temperatures are above a certain threshold. larvae are aquatic and eat freshwater algae and microorganisms. In areas where frost is only intermittent and bodies of water don't freeze completely for months it a time, the larvae can survive underwater aside from eggs. While such larvae normally grow rapidly, in the wintertime they simply stop growing and eat little. It's as if their adolescence had been placed in pause. They resume growing and eating in the spring after the danger of frost has past.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My husband had to camp in the winter in Alaska, as he was in the Army. They set up the camp stove, it thawed out the permafrost, releasing hoards of mosquitoes. Having not brought repellent, because who would have thought they would need it, they were eaten alive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
