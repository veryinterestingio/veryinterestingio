		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, many. You don't see them often as textbooks like to pick simple examples.</p>
<p>Here's an example:</p>
<p>Potential energy of a charge distribution in a dielectric material is:</p>
<p>U = 1/2  Integral[ rho (x,y,z) * phi (x,y,z) dV]</p>
<p>where rho (x,y,z) is the net charge density at each point (units C m^(-3)), phi  is the electric potential at each point (units V) and the integral is over the whole volume (so dV = dx * dy * dz and it is a triple integral).</p>
<p>The two functions rho (x,y,z) and phi (x,y,z) can be any function depending on your system in question.</p>
<p>Let say you have a box with area A in dimensions y and z and the functions only vary along X with a length of L. with rho (x,y,z) = e^(Bx) and phi (x,y,z) = Ce^(Dx) with A B C and D being constants</p>
<p>Then the electrostatic potential energy would be</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Integral[ e^(Bx) Ce^(Dx) dx dy dz] = A*C / (B + D)  e^(Bx)e^(Dx))  evaluated from 0 to L</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>or A*C * (e^(B*L)e^(D*L) - 1) /  (B + D)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>which has an exponential dependence on the length L</p>
<p><strong>You can probably see why this does not show up in intro textbooks often.</strong></p>
<p>Edit: intro physics textbooks (like 101 and 102). As the comments pointed out, that equation is in every intro E&amp;M textbook.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not energy per se, but the power generated by wind turbines scales with the cube of wind speed (energy per unit mass scales with the square, flowrate scales linearly)</p>
<p>Although wind power has a lot of advantages in certain areas, this highlights the need either for a baseline generation from some more predictable means or the need for vast amounts of bulk energy storage (pumped hydro)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The relativistic version of kinetic energy &quot;grows&quot; faster as it approaches the speed of light. It's maybe not what you'd expect with your question, but the growth speed increases as you get closer to c, as you'd need infinite energy for any object or particle with mass to reach c.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The power density available to wind turbines scales as the cube of wind speed. Does that count?</p>
<p>The equation is</p>
<p>P/A = 1/2 ùùÜv^(3)</p>
<p>With P representing power, representing area swept by the turbine, rho representing the density of the air, and v representing its velocity.</p>
<p>I don't fully understand this, but intuitively, as I understand it, this is because it is not a single unit of matter moving at that speed, but a flow of matter; the higher the rate of flow, the more matter is involved. If the speed of flow increases, the amount of matter (and the energy each unit of that matter embodies) passing through the swept area of a turbine is proportional to the cube of the velocity because the amount of material is also increasing, and not just the energy embodied by a single unit, which would only scale as the square of the velocity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
