		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there is. Lithium ion batteries work by the lithiation and delithiation of an anodic material through electrochemical processes. So far, the energy density is dictated by how well the anodic materials will alloy with Lithium. For example, when you charge a lithium ion battery with a graphitic anode, the graphite alloys with Lithium to form LiC6. This tells us that the anode has a theoretical capacity of 372mAh/g. Typical Li-ion cathode material has theoretical capacities in the ~270 mAh/g due to the challenge of ionically transmitting Li ions from the cathode to the anode. </p>
<p>Now, as for there being a known physical limit, this does not seem possible to calculate in my opinion. Since the Li-ion battery discovery by Sony in '91, better and new materials have been discovered. These materials have improved all facets of battery life: ionic conductivity, electric resistivity, storage capacity, cell stability, columbic efficiency, and energy density. On top of this, there are a wide array of lithium ion technologies for different solutions. A Li-S battery is hardly comparable to a normal Li-C battery. Not to mention that LFP batteries have different properties from an NMC battery as well. </p>
<p>For what its worth, we do know that Li-S batteries have a maximum theoretical capacity of 1675 mAh/g</p>
<p>EDIT: Thank you all for the awards and the questions! I'm happy to be answering as much as I am capable of, but I just want to remind people to do their due diligence. I am a PhD student in material science right now, and there are far, far more knowledgeable experts on Li-ion batteries out there. To anyone looking to read some papers on the technology, I highly recommend looking into Jeff Dahn out of Dalhousie University and Yi Cui out of Stanford University.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For any electrochemical energy storage device including lithium ion the energy content is a function of the capacity of the electrodes (Ah, usually expressed as specific capacity mAh/g) and the voltage difference between the anode and cathode. 1 Wh = 1 Ah Ã— 1V. So, higher voltages and larger capacities give you more energy. Both electrode voltage and capacity are fundamental materials properties related to the electrochemically acessible quantity and relative energy level of electrons or equivalently charged ions (like Li+) in the material. As mentioned above, capacities are typically normalized by mass or sometimes volume while voltages are expressed relative to a &quot;reference electrode&quot; rather than some absolute value. Li metal is the common reference used for LIB. Most commercial lithium ion batteries use a graphite anode with a theoretical specific capacity of 372 mAh/g, which corresponds to the electrical charge associated with of 1 Li+ ion per 6 carbon atoms to form LiC6, which is the maximum Li content the graphite structure can accommodate. Graphite has a theoretical voltage (at open circuit ) of about 0.1 V vs Li. The highest energy density LIB on the market use Ni-rich NMC compounds like LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 or similar. These compounds have a theoretical capacity of about 270 mAh/g but can only provide maybe 220-240 mAh/g. Removing all of the Li to form the MO2 compound causes some irreversible changes to the crystal structure which degrade the utility if your battery very quickly. LiCoO2 has the same problem and is limited to about 140 mAh/g so you can see the motivation toward NMC. So right there that answers your question in a way, because for most electrode compounds there is always some practical capacity limit below the theoretical value, but the picture is more complicated. Most layered compounds like NMC have an OCV when fully charged of about 4.3-4.4 V vs Li. When paired against graphite that gives you a fully charged cell OCV of about 4.2-4.3 V. If we use the specific capacities above, that means a graphite vs NMC811 LIB would have a specific energy about 630 Wh/kg, which is almost double what a commercial cell actually has. The extra mass is associated with the electrolyte, separator, current collectors, casing and any other &quot;inactive&quot; material needed to make a functioning cell. You can reduce the mass and volume of these components but not remove them in a practical device. Newer LIB or &quot;beyond&quot; LIB materials like silicon or Li anodes and sulfur cathodes generally have much higher theoretical energy content and sometimes demonstrate this in the lab, but often rely on using a limited amount of their theoretical values due to issues with electrochemical irreversibility. Another wrench is all of the above values are rate dependant, so higher discharge rates or other kinetic factors like temperature reduce realized energy even further. </p>
<p>So TL/DR, commercial LIB actually are fairly close to their theoretical maximum when you only consider the active materials but all of the inactive components bring down the practical energy value. Some emerging materials will continue to improve the practical energy content of batteries but they will have the same design constraints as LIB.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the reason lithium is used in rechargeable batteries is due to its location on the periodic table. It's all the way up there in the left hand corner. The consequence of this is that lithium is very very light, relative to other metals. Since batteries work by moving electrons around, ideally you want the battery materials to provide the most electrons at the lowest weight. Imagine if your iphone battery weighed 5 pounds...not ideal.</p>
<p>So one reason we use lithium because it has a high ratio of active electrons to atomic weight. In the same column on the periodic table, if you go down to sodium and potassium, etc, they will have the same amount of active electrons, but they are heavier. So lithium is preferred. Looking up on the periodic table, there is nothing above lithium, so given the current technology used in batteries, lithium appears to be the best choice. </p>
<p>There is a theoretical limit to the maximum energy density for a battery of a fixed weight or a fixed volume, yes. Since lithium gives the best electrons per weight, it's difficult to envision substantially higher energy density without a transformational change to the core technology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modern batteries are already getting close to the safety vs. capacity limit. The more energy you throw into an energy storage medium, the more volatile and dangerous it becomes. What's a little ironic is jet fuel and diesel have over 10x the energy density of Li-Ion but are pretty safe. Get some jet fuel or diesel, pour some on a surface and try to light it with a flame. You're going to have a hard time getting it to ignite at all. There's a reason you're not allowed to have large camera batteries in checked bags or carry-on for flying.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
