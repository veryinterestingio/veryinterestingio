		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no evidence I'm aware of that suggests it can't. In fact, there's considerable evidence that waking up in the middle of the night for about an hour and using that time to pray, write, have a snack or commit crimes was actually pretty common prior to the industrial revolution, and experimental evidence suggests this may even be the normal way for humans to sleep that was killed off by the invention of the electric light (which pushed our first sleep later and later as we stayed up to do other things until it merged with the second sleep).</p>
<p>Given it seems to have been able to do it even with a long period of interruption (and may even have been better at it) it does seem as if being interrupted isn't a huge deal for the cleaning process, as long as you get the total amount of sleep required.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Getting REM sleep in is particularly important. Studies have shown that when a participant is forbidden to enter REM stage of sleep, the amount of REM sleep the next night is compounded (increased). But as stated above, you naturally go in and out of 3 stages of sleep, with periods of wakefulness that you donâ€™t remember.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't exactly know if there is a way to sleep interruptedly but effectively, but from a &quot;disease&quot; point of view, many diseases that cause you to do micro-awakenings during the night or interrupt your sleep, stop the REM-sleep (cleaning sleep as you say).  To enter REM sleep you need 60-90 min of uninterrupted sleep, and then 30-60 min more to end the &quot;cleaning&quot; and start a &quot;no cleaning&quot; period again. As a consequence of the lack of &quot;cleaning sleep&quot; this people are notoriously tired, sleepy during the day and have a hard time concentrating.</p>
<p>Moreover, we have an internal clock, the circadian cycle, that activates and deactivates some hormones useful to be active properly during the day.</p>
<p>So from that point of view I would say no, or at least it's immensely more natural for humans to have a long period that also happens during our &quot;low time clock&quot;. That way we can have many &quot;cleansing&quot; cycles of sleep during the night and then, when rested, active as the natural clock &quot;turns up&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>depends where you wake up at during your sleep cycles.</p>
<p>if you wake up briefly at the very end of a completed full cycle, the interruption is probably extremely minimal, if anything</p>
<p>but if you wake up in the middle of a cycle you'll feel groggy</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
