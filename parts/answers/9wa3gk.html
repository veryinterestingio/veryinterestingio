		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A biologist will usually study one animal at a time. So in the case of hummingbirds, a biologist may spend their whole lives researching and studying different hummingbird species (usually they will focus on a particular geographical area like North America) until they become an expert on all things hummingbird. At that point they would notice details in different species that the average observer wouldn't, such as markings or unique behaviors.</p>
<p>Once they have found what they think is a new species it becomes a measuring game. They will capture one and look at it more closely, measure wing span, study anatomy, or even testing DNA with previously discovered species are just a few ways.</p>
<p>Then it gets into the question of where does a new species begin and another one end. What usually determines a new species is its inability to mate with others. But even that gets sketchy when it comes to interbreeding animals like how a Donkeys and horse's offspring is a mule. So they can breed but they are definitely not the same species.</p>
<p>Speciation is more of a spectrum rather than a specific definition so here's an image that shows the progression. Sorry about the quality.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Speciation isn't really that cut and dry, especially over long time spans.  Basically any time a new species is defined, one member is set aside as a type specimin that all other members are compared to.  If an animal is sufficiently different, then a type specimin is proposed, an article is written and argued over, and if it successfully makes it through that process, then it's a new species. </p>
<p>That's how it goes in paleontology anyway.  I don't imagine it's much different for biology. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There really is no specific way of doing it. Classically things were done with morphology, but that can be very deceiving. Males and females are often quite different, so they either need to be observed mating, or looked at genetically. </p>
<p>Ability to mate and produce fertile offspring is also used but, as others have pointed out, sometimes different species are able to do that (though it's rare that the offspring are fertile). Another problem with mating as a distinction is that it can be really difficult to replicate the conditions in which animals will mate. I work primarily with marine invertebrates and I can tell you that it's almost impossible to get some animals to mate or spawn in captivity, let alone raise the offspring to maturity so they can be mated and <em>those</em> offspring raised to maturity. Then of course there's plants where hybrids can still produce fertile offspring (most citrus fruits in the store are not naturally occurring). Then there's the vast majority of life on Earth that is single celled and reproduces asexually. </p>
<p>That leaves us with DNA. Every species has unique DNA right? But so does every individual. So we are left with the question of &quot;How different do they need to be?&quot; Until fairly recently, scientists used &quot;barcode&quot; genes that are typically the same within species, but differ between them. The problem is that some groups (I know about sea anemones personally, but there are others) have very similar DNA to the point that very distinct species would be considered the same by that method alone. Now we can sequence entire genomes very quickly. So quickly, in fact, that the problem is processing the information. Modern sequencers can generate a terabyte of data every 15 minutes! Then we have to figure out what's from the specimen, what's a mutation or virus modification, what is a normal modification, what came from bacteria living in and on the individual, etc. Then we still have the question of &quot;How different is different enough?&quot;</p>
<p>Finally there's discussion, debate, publication, more debate, and 20 years of old timers refusing to acknowledge the change because they've been calling it something different since grad school.</p>
<p>tl:dr - We have a lot of tools, techniques, and experience that still amount to &quot;we'll know a new species when we see it.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
