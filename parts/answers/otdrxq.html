		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is coated in a moisture blocking substance. This prevents the cheese from sticking together but it since it prevents moisture it slows mold growth. Generally there is also an anti mold growth additive as well. So basically the answer is, preshredded cheese has additives. It's not simply cheese that was shredded for you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because cheese when stored right is pretty shelf stable.</p>
<p>This varies from cheese to cheese and brand to brand depending on the differences in the cheese</p>
<p>Harder/drier cheeses last longer because there is less moisture that bacteria need to live.</p>
<p>But, it’s important to mention, that once you open the bag/break the seal, your cheese will probably not last as long (like only lasting weeks instead of months) because there is a chance that you’re introducing New outside bacteria/moisture/humidity to the cheese.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, bags are gas flushed so until they are opened there is little to no oxygen. Second, there is a mold inhibitor called natamycin in most shredded cheeses. Third there is anticaking agent added - this probably has the least impact on mold but it keeps it from melting into a big blob.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, it has some extra anti-mold properties. However, It's also a lot harder to see the mold on shredded cheese vs a block or slice, so it may not actually last longer... You just don't notice the mold as quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
