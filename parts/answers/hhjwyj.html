		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The same reason poop doesn’t drip out of out bootyholes. There are smooth  circular muscles called sphincters that contract closed and open as needed.</p>
<p>Also we have a little tongue like projection further up at the top of our esophagus called the epiglottis that’s let’s food down into the stomach without letting any into our lungs. </p>
<p>Our bodies are amazing, and evolutionarily plan for this type of thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding on to the rest of the comments, along with the sphincter, your digestive track is under peristalsis - a form of contractions that keep pushing food “down” the track. This is also why you are still able to drink water or swallow food upside down, without all of it coming out instantly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
