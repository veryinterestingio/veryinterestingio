		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this happens all the time in some radioactive elements. It's called alpha decay: the atom splits into two, and one part is a helium nucleus, also called an alpha particle.  </p>
<p>For example, a radium atom splits into one radon atom and one alpha particle.  </p>
<p>If you observed a single radium 226 atom for 1600 years, it would have 50% chance of splitting in this fashion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If it is an atom of a suitable type: Yes. The splitting process must release energy, otherwise it is not possible spontaneously.</p>
<p>The nucleus of an uranium atom can split spontaneously, the nucleus of an oxygen atom you'll find in nature cannot. It is a rare process - if you watch 10^20 uranium atoms (natural uranium) you'll get about one spontaneous split (fission) every hour.</p>
<p>Alpha decay has some similarities to fission (you start with one nucleus and get two afterwards), but it is usually considered a separate process.</p>
<p>Nuclear weapons use a different process, induced fission - a splitting heavy atom typically releases a few neutrons, these neutrons can split other atoms of a suitable type, leading to a chain reaction and many fission processes in a very short time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Does that mean that there is a non-zero chance for that to happen to <em>ALL</em> atoms in the universe <em>at the same time</em>? Like ... could everything just suddenly disintegrate without any apparent reason?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>lots of replies saying that yes, atoms can split spontaneously. I just wanted to add an example of how this affects us: radon is found naturally in the ground at varying levels across the world. radon decays into polonium + an alpha particle (2 protons &amp; 2 neutrons, so basically it's a helium atom). if that radon atom happens to be in a person's lungs when it decays, the alpha particle can cause DNA damage to lung cells. if the lung cell happens to make a specific type of mistake as it's trying to repair its DNA (an oncogenic mutation), it can lead to cancer.</p>
<p>radon decay--that is, 'a single, random atom splitting on its own'--is common enough that it's one of the major causes of lung cancer in the world. in Canada (which is where I'm from), radon is thought to be the cause of \~15% of all lung cancers.</p>
<p>as an aside, the number of cancers that radon causes could be a lot lower if people stopped smoking, because people who smoke are \~7 times more likely to get cancer from radon than people who don't smoke, even if they're exposed to the exact same amount of radon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
