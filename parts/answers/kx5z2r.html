		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many grazing animals don't really digest the grass itself. Take a cow for instance. When a cow chews up the grass and swallows, it ends up in a stomach chamber called the rumen.</p>
<p>This is basically a fermentation chamber. It's filled with microbes that digest the chewed up grass. These bacteria produce all kinds of lipids (fats), proteins, and so on as byproducts of their own digestive system.</p>
<p>The cow then regurgitates the cud from the rumen back into it's mouth where it chews up this mash of predigested material into a much finer particulate of broken down grass, bacteria and the bacteria's beneficial byproducts.</p>
<p>It then swallows this cud again, this time it's much finer and more liquid. It sinks to the bottom of the rumen and instead of remaining in the rumen, it's passed on to the cow's other stomach chambers. This mass of bacteria, byproduct, and predigested grass is then properly digested by the cow.</p>
<p>Without the bacteria and the byproduct of the bacteria, grass wouldn't be nutritious for the cow at all. But the cow feeds the bacteria and in turn, the bacteria feed the cow.</p>
<p>Most grazers have a system like that. Bovines usually have multichambered stomachs while animals like horses have extra long intestines where this process takes place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Long, slow digestive tract to give the body enough time to extract nutrients out of the tough plant material. Very importantly, they have lots of gut bacteria to help out with the digestion. Grazers also need to eat a lot in order to meet the animals' energy demands. Many animals, if they are stuck with a very limited diet, will also be able to synthesize a lot of their own nutrients using the chemical building blocks available in the food. For example, horses make their own vitamin C because there isn't a lot available directly from their food. Humans, on the other hand, usually get enough vitamin C from our diets that we have lost the ability to synthesize it ourselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ol>
<li>Their digestive system can break down cellulose in ways people can't. Cellulose is long chains of sugar molecules. When people eat cellulose (rough fiber), it does not get broken down into sugars that you can use. It passes through as roughage. But a cow for example has special stomach bacteria that CAN break down and digest cellulose into usable energy. This is difficult, so a cow has 4 stomachs and uses a long slow process to extract this energy. But it works.</li>
<li>There's still not much energy in grass even if you <em>can</em> access it. So they eat a LOT of it. For example, a beef cow eats 24 lbs of hay per day. That's <em>way</em> more food-per-bodyweight than animals like us that eat more nutritious foods. Herbivores have to spend the majority of their waking hours eating.</li>
