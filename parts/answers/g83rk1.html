Your overall body temp is regulated in that case</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am not certain how warm it actually gets under your blankets, but keep in mind your overall thermal conform is a measure of how easily your body can maintain it's normal body temperature.  That is, how much heat is the body losing, compared to how much it is making.  </p>
<p>The blankets trap some of the heat your body makes, preventing you from losing it as fast, but your head and, depending on how you are sleeping, you arms and such are also exposed.  This means they are losing mad amounts of heat from the exposed parts, while the blankets parts are trapping some.  This essentially balances out so you feel comfortable.  </p>
<p>To put it another way, parts of your are hot and parts of your are cold, and you feel like the average of the two, which is comfortable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humidity plays a roll in how you feel as well. Cold weather is usually less humid. 80 with low humidity isnâ€™t the same as 80 with high humidity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can't thermoregulate in the first scenario: There's nowhere to exchange heat, while in the &quot;cold&quot; room, you can pass heat from under the covers to elsewhere.  </p>
<p>The equivalent in a hot room would be running a dehumidifier and a fan so your body can lose heat from the evaporation of sweat. Probably sleeping in a hammock or similar to get better air circulation as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
