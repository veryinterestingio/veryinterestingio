		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems that no one has mentioned <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphene" target="_blank">phosphenes</a>, which IIRC are generated when receptors in your retina are stimulated by something other than light (usually mechanically: by rubbing your eyes).</p>
<p>Sometimes phosphenes can manifest just by darkness alone: if the noise floor gets low enough, random nerves firing will begin to show up as lights!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your eyes &quot;see&quot; with light-sensitive receptors at the back of your eyeballs.</p>
<p>There <em>is</em> other stuff between the receptors and the sources of light that you &quot;see&quot; when you look around.</p>
<p>For example, when you close your eyes you are essentially looking at the inside of your eyelids, if you shone a flashlight on your closed eyelid you would see red light because it's going through the blood and flesh of your eyelid.</p>
<p>You may also be seeing &quot;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/eye-floaters/symptoms-causes/syc-20372346" target="_blank">floaters</a>&quot;, which are small thing <em>inside</em>of your eyeball that casts tiny shadows. You can also sometimes <a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/what-are-the-wiggly-things-i-see-in-my-eyes-when-i-look-at-the-sky/" target="_blank">see your own white blood cells</a> (trippy, I know).</p>
<p>So, essentially, your peepers are simply peepin' more than you thought!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are they such tiny dots that you aren't even close to be able to focus on an individual dot? And they fill every part of your vision. I wanna say they are all different colors, maybe? But not really sure.</p>
<p>If so, I'm also curious to what it is I'm seeing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
