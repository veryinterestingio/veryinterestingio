		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What kind of time scale increments are you able to capture around black holes? It's my understanding your initial image was produced by processing months long, simultaneous  observations from multiple telescopes around the world. One gathers this had both the effect of making the &quot;aperture&quot; of your imaging device as wide as the earth, and potentially as wide as the earth's orbit; but it would seem it also had the effect of averaging out observations over a fairly long time scale in your image. Do you anticipate ever being able to image in hours or even minutes level time granularity so the accretion disc dynamics might be studied as it rotates around the black hole?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very cool work! Two part question - where did the idea/theory come from to use an array of radio telescopes from around the world come from? Was it a tried and tested method or was it a new innovation that your team came up with?</p>
<p>Second question - is there any utility in scaling it up for a bigger array? Like radio telescopes on the moon + satellites in orbit? I've seen it referenced as a possibility but would love to hear your take on if it would be useful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
