		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, time under tension encourages tendons and ligaments to grow and get stronger just like muscles. However, this process lags significantly behind muscle growth. This is one reason why it's so important to focus on good form as a new lifter, in order to prevent tendon injury. This is also why so many people who use steroids end up with tendon injury: their muscle growth greatly outpaces their tendon and ligament growth and they over do it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Muscle strength and size &gt; tendon and other connective tissue strength &gt; bone density and strength</p>
<p>Now anyone who was ever sad they did not get jacked overnight might be surprised that muscle adaptations are 'fastest' on this list, but keep in mind this is all relative.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely!  But it's important to remember that muscles have a very simple action, no matter where they are.  They simply shorten themselves.  Tendons, ligaments, and joints are the ones that make the shortening muscles into body movement.  However, the big muscle groups are easier to control with simple easy movements, whereas the smaller muscles that support more complex movements are harder to control, smaller, and thus harder to train.</p>
<p>Why does this matter?  In some cases, these tendons and ligaments are wrapped around bones under a lot of torque.  Think of them like a rubber band being stretched.  Supporting muscles can provide a safe way to relieve some of this tension by making sure that the load on a single ligament or tendon isn't too much.  It distributes load evenly across multiple joints and ligaments.</p>
<p>If you isolate a small tendon or ligament (because of lack of control) using a lot of weight, you will quickly tear it.  The rubber band will &quot;snap&quot;, sometimes audibly.  It's important to give your body time to grow, and your brain time to innervate muscle memory properly so that you can do exercises properly, distributed across muscles safely.</p>
<p>A lot of times, when you see inexperienced people get hurt, the overwhelming majority are putting themselves into an unsafe lift that they don't have the experience to properly gauge their strength vs. coordination.  This is especially important as your muscles start fatiguing, because as some muscles approach failure the inexperienced sport enthusiast may attempt to continue pushing lifts / exercises by relying on supporting muscles / tendons / ligaments with improper form that have no real business being strained in such a manner.</p>
<p>Especially when you first start out, keep the lifts simple, focus on doing them properly, and stop &amp; lower weight immediately if you cannot.  Unless you have an experienced exercise science spotter or coach, take your first years slowly and focus on having fun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
