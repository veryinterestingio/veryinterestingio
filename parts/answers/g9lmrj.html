		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, no. This <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robinandrews/2018/05/28/why-cant-we-artificially-drain-magma-chambers-to-stop-volcanic-eruptions/#279898f93d8d" target="_blank">forbes article</a>, written around the time of the 2018 Kilauea eruption, provides a pretty thorough take on a variety of 'Could we do <em>this</em> to stop <em>that</em>?' questions with relation to volcanoes. </p>
<p>This addresses both currently/soon to be erupting volcanoes and more lingering volcanic threats, but with regards to the former (since that was OPs question) it nicely highlights that (1) we aren't up to the task engineering wise to effectively 'plug' a volcano that is erupting, (2) drilling a volcano about to erupt to 'relieve pressure' is extremely problematic as magma plumbing systems are very complex (i.e. where would we drill?), magma is extremely hot (i.e. what are we going to drill with that's not going to melt/stop working?), and at best it just localizes the problem in a new place (i.e. how do you stop a blow out of an overpressurized magma well?), and (3) other strategies like bombing a volcano, if they did anything, would most likely just trigger an eruption.</p>
<p>Ultimately, for volcanoes, as with the majority of geologic hazards, our best strategies are monitoring (i.e. keeping a close tab on the status of systems so that we know problems are imminent), mitigation (i.e. modifying building habits, location, etc to better withstand or avoid the hazard in question), and communication (i.e. making sure the public is aware of the hazards and what they should do during an event). The best and most prudent response to an erupting volcano is to get out of its way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tangentially related, we've known for decades that injecting fluids deep underground will cause Earthquakes, and studies have been done to see if triggering many small earthquakes can dissipate energy stored as stress in the Earth's crust to prevent a large Earthquake.</p>
<p>It was found to be completely impractical due to the orders of magnitudes we're working with.  Let's say you can safely and consistently trigger a magnitude 3 earthquake. It would take ten thousand of those to release the energy released in a magnitude 7 earthquake (which are big, but not incredibly uncommon in the lifespan of buildings on the West Coast) and and it would take a million of them to release the energy of a magnitude 9 earthquake, which would start to get into the ballpark of &quot;the big one&quot; that could happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not really. It’s so much force that we can’t really stop it. At best you can attempt to limit the damage. This can mean using berms or ditches to try to redirect lava flow (there was even a suggestion to use bunker buster bombs to blow holes in the least worst spot of a volcano to direct flow). However even with redirection of lava the initial explosion of the volcano is mostly unstoppable and the ash and gassed from the eruption tend to actually cause the most Heath effects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>no, as said, we can only monitor them and evacuate the area as necessary. Depends on the volcano, eruptions can be disruptive or devastating. We can’t stop a geological event on that scale, only mitigate the consequences.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a word, no. The best thing to do is to clear out of the area so that you can live. Mother Nature won’t lose a challenge in this area. Be smart. The minute you hear its going to blow, go! Pack up and get as far away as you can.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
