		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is fairly common-- though most viruses are either not severe in any of their hosts, but there are exceptions. This is obviously one, some of the others are Ebola (humans), rabies (several mammal species), west nile (a bunch of mammals and birds). Fungal and bacterial pathogens as well-- salmonella is a bird to mammal issue, for example.</p>
<p>I know there are more, but those are the most widely recognized ones.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Other diseases have close-kin strains that are specific to one species or group, and another strain specific to another group. Conjunctivitis comes to mind here as a for-instance, E. coli is another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the reasons flu can't be eradicated - and flu pandemics are actually quite common, the last one was in 2009 - is the number of animal reservoirs for influenza viruses. We regularly discover new flu strains in pigs, birds, and so on.</p>
<p>SARS-CoV-2's wide tropism is somewhat unusual for a coronavirus, but might not be unusual for its sarbecovirus family, because the enzyme ACE2 whose receptors they exploit is fairly similar across mammals. But the others we know, like SARS, MERS, and a big family tree of bat viruses, don't seem to infect humans as efficiently, despite having other animal hosts (SARS-like viruses were found in civets, MERS is widespread in camels), so we don't pay as much attention to them other than surveillance to make sure they stay out of humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hanta virus is easily spread from rodents to humans but not human to human infection. You'll hear about bird flu. It's actually common for humans to get bird flu but it hasn't mutated enough to be transmittable from human to human.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
