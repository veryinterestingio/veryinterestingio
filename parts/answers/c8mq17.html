<p>What is the community composition within the pitcher plant? Any really surprising findings?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Carnivorous plants inspire fascination I think because they seem to cross a mental line people conceive separating plants and animals. Your intro seems be indicating pitcher plants have the equivalent of a &quot;gut biome&quot; enabling them consume flesh; but is this completely true? Do the plants themselves share any metabolic processes usually only seen in animal cells (and not seen in other non-carnivorous plants)?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

That sounds like a dream for me but I don't know how to break into that type of career. What was your education path like and how did you get into such specific research? Does your education path leave open options to research other macro/micro environments?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey thanks for doing this!
1.What's the biggest prey a carnivorous plant can eat?</p>
<p>2.are carnivorous plants typically apex predators or is there something that eats them?</p>
<p>3.Is there potential for a plant to grow like the one from the rocky horror picture show?
Edit :as in it can eat people and not that it's an alien,has teeth and a fantastic vocal range</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
