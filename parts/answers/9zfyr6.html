		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light travels at a constant speed. Imagine Light going from A to B in a straight line, now imagine that line is pulled by gravity so its curved, it's gonna take the light longer to get from A to B, light doesn't change speed but the time it takes to get there does, thus time slows down to accommodate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can make it simple.</p>
<p>Imagine a clock made of rubber, now stretch it out.</p>
<p>On the areas that are stretched, the second hand travels further between tics than a nearby, non-stretched clock. This corresponds to the interaction of particles and energy in matter, which is basically how we perceive events taking place in time. It's just stuff interacting with other stuff and the changes that take place.</p>
<p>If your space is stretched out, the electrons that make up your body and everything else will travel a further distance to meet other particles and so on. You won't notice this because you're made of this stretched space and your thoughts and perceptions are based on those same interactions of particles.</p>
<p>But from an outside perspective, an area that's not stretched out, you will seem to be moving a lot slower than they are. From the stretched out perspective, everything else will seem to be moving faster than they are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here’s a simple way I tell people to picture it;
Get a balloon, blow it up about 1/2 way. Draw a line on it with a marker that is a known distance, say 2”.
Now inflate the balloon some more and measure the line.  How is it longer?
The balloons surface is space/time. Gravity /mass stretches space/time. From the perspective of a person on the surface you wouldn’t know the difference because the “stuff” you’re made of acts the same way.
Push your finger into the balloon and this is one way to conceptualize the effect of mass on space/time; your finger represents say, a star. It makes a ‘dent’ in the surface and stretches the balloon around it/ remember, the balloon = space/time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gravity doesn’t bend time, gravity is the result of bent time.</p>
<p>Mass bends time. How does it? Nobody is totally sure at this point.</p>
<p>Time itself is, in ordinary space, Euclidean, and is like all the other dimensions. It is a totally different dimension than all the others. But near massive objects the time dimension is bent a certain amount through the 3 space dimensions and that amount less through the ordinary 4th “time” dimension.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
