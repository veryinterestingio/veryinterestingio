		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I got in a conversation with a scalper once and he told me he’d buy the minimum number of tickets to get the “group” rate (~10-15 continuous tickets) for games he thought would be popular which were discounted 50-66% depending on the section, then he could sell them at a 0%-50% discount from face value depending on the time before the game and still make some money as long as he sold at least 50% of the tickets he had originally bought.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People buy tickets they can't use at face value. Maybe they are season ticket holders,  maybe a friend canceled at the last minute, whatever. Other people stand outside the stadium, buy those tickets for pennies on the dollar, and resell them for close to face value.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is why lots of major pro sport stadiums and concert venues are going mobile only tickets that have barcodes that change every minute. Cannot screenshot it and send it to people because it expires. You can send the ticket to another account or sell it on the app’s approved exchange. The hassle to do this while walking into the event will definitely hinder some people from selling their tickets to scalpers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
