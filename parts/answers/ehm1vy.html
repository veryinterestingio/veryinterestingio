		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Expanding on the other guy, yes. It is genetic.</p>
<p>Cilantro and other members of that family including carrots, celery or parsley have a specific chemical that acts as a deterrent to wild predators eating it. Basically, it tastes bad to animals so they leave it alone.</p>
<p>Humans have generally evolved OUT of being able to taste or detect that flavour, but once in a while someone will be born with that genetic code (The OR6A2 gene) that allows them to taste the bad chemical.</p>
<p>That is you and also me and nearly everyone in my family.</p>
<p>Likely, if you hate the taste of cilantro, you will also find celery and carrot tops (just the tops) very bitter as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
