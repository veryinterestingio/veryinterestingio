		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on whether or not the memories are consolidated into longterm memory.  It takes several hours for recent memories to be consolidated into long term memory. This is the reason why individuals who suffer traumatic brain injuries tend to not remember what happened immediately prior to the injury.  Alternatively, if when an individual has consolidated a fact or event into memory and later is unable to recall it, this is most likely due to the retrieval pathway being lost. Sometimes, pathways can be retrieved.  An instance of this is struggling and eventually remembering someone's name. The memory (person's name) is there, it just took a while to retrieve it.</p>
<p>Dementia patients are often unable to consolidate new memories but are still able to recall events from their past.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That depends! Memory research largely speaks of three steps: encoding, storage, and retrieval. Any of these could go wrong.</p>
<p>If the memory is never moved into long-term storage, that is an encoding problem and it simply doesn't exist in your brain.</p>
<p>If something goes wrong with the storage (analogous to corrupt hard drives on your computer), that's another way you could lose your memory. Important to note that we distort our memories all the time, losing details and sometimes even fabricating new ones.</p>
<p>And finally, you could have stored memories that you are having trouble accessing (like when you have a word on the tip of your tongue that you never manage to find again). That's a retrieval error, and corresponds to the scenario where a memory is lost but technically still stored.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most neurologist agree that you dont loose the memories forever, just the pathway accessing them become narrower with time/drugs/injury until no longer accessible.  Like a road closed the stuff down the road dosent disappear you just have to get creative to get there or rebuild the roads.  </p>
<p>the use of cholinesterase inhibitors,  memantine.</p>
<p>Also its funny you speak of this because a lab just had a break thru in restoring lost memories in mice <a href="https://www.gilmorehealth.com/alzheimers-amino-acid-l-serine-may-help-restore-memory/" target="_blank">clickyyyy</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Synaptic pruning <em>may</em> be the reason memories are irretrievable for ever.</p>
<p>It's a similar process as passing out/blackouts, where buildup of chemicals in the brain require a complete stoppage of conciousness to flush out enough to survive.</p>
<p>Brain damage occurs after this point has been reached and the levels of toxins/chemicals continue to increase.</p>
<p>Edit^1 : </p>
<p>Y'all seem interested, so here's some more info, neural spi[n]es are theorized to be the foundations of new synaptic pathways as the wave forms merge and head in a direction that, for lack of a better explination, take the path less traveled.</p>
<p>So you end up smashing electrical potential, in the form of Na^+ or  K^+  into the walls of the synapses and cell bodies.</p>
<p>This leads to new &quot;spi[n]es&quot; that are essentially cilia on the membrane that push outward towards the next cell or dendrite.</p>
<p>Every time your body goes through a pruning phase these are the first to go as they do not have a myelin sheath formed yet.</p>
<p>Still not sure what initiates myline sheath pro[t]ection, but it must be a marker on the end of a spi[n]e signaling it has reached a significant length and needs to be maintained instead of being pruned.</p>
<p>This is also why headaches and migraines seem to be related to new knowledge acquisition and/or back propagation to reinforce previous knowledge.</p>
<p>Which is also why its paramount for you to retrace your memories and skillsets as often as possible, if you dont use it you're gonna lose it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most research suggests that our minds basically store rough outlines and that our brains fill in the details when we recall them.  That our brains are so good at filling in those details that we are extremely confident in the accuracy of those memories despite them being not all that accurate.  Post 9/11 they did studies where people hand wrote their answers.  When people were then asked later on and gave different answers some went so far as to claim that their earlier answers were incorrect.</p>
<p>Based on that I would be hesitant to trust a recovered memory.  I would think that it would be possible for your mind to possibly create it whole cloth or that maybe someone influenced you.  Though that doesn’t mean it’s impossible.  I have seen stroke victims regain memories and motor functions they had lost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
