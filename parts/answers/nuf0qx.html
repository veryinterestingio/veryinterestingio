<p>Vaccines contain antigens that induce an immune response capable of providing specific protection from disease. Individual vaccine antigens induce innate immune responses that may differ qualitatively or quantitatively according to the vaccine composition, but that induce a good adaptive immune response. ... These phenomena are crucial for triggering strong antigen-specific acquired immune responses necessary for protection against disease. These same inflammatory events may also lead to the development of signs and symptoms of injection-site inflammation (pain, redness and swelling) in the vaccinated individual ... Collectively, these data show that local inflammation in the muscle and draining lymph node after immunisation is a transient physiological event coinciding with the duration of solicited injection-site symptoms described in clinical trials after vaccination.</p>

<p>But in spite of the common belief, the side effects don't particularly correlate with anything. Not having side effects doesn't mean you didn't get a good immune response, and it tells you nothing about how you'd have responded to COVID, and it doesn't tell you if you have prior exposure. It's pretty random.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a common belief that an injection-site reaction to a vaccine is a predictive sign of a desirable vaccine response (‘no pain, no gain’ concept). However limited data either support or disprove this concept.... despite parallel associations of reactogenicity and adaptive responses with early innate responses, no predictive association was demonstrated between reactogenicity and the adaptive response, which suggests that the ‘no pain, no gain’ concept may not be valid, at least at the individual level.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I'm very curious how it would compare to say, a saline injection of the same volume of liquid, at the same location, w/ the same needle gauge. How much of the soreness is physical trauma, how much is related to immune response?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a small amount of pain from the tiny damage done by the needle into the muscle. But also the vaccine can trigger inflammation at the site of the injection, which suggests the vaccine is starting to activate your immunity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
