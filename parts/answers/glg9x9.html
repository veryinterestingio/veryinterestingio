		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>See <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/gfizqa/if_scientists_are_unsure_about_covid19_antibodies/" target="_blank">this recent thread</a>. </p>
<p>They don’t know if there’s long term immunity because there’s no long term yet. </p>
<p>That’s all there is to it. Scientists fully expect long term immunity (several years). There’s no reason why there shouldn’t be long term immunity. Infection drives plenty of antibodies, <a href="https://jcm.asm.org/content/early/2020/05/07/JCM.00941-20.long" target="_blank">in 99% of cases</a>. Those antibodies have <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.30.20085613v1" target="_blank">lasted as long</a> as anyone has been followed. Everything points to good, solid, long term immunity. </p>
<p>It’s just that when you have a virus that’s less than six months old, you don’t <em>know</em> what’s going to happen in 3 years. So technically the honest answer is, We don’t know. But that’s misleading (which is what media love! A misleading headline that will sell ads!). We don’t know, but the strong expectation is all good stuff. </p>
<p>Even back in April - before a half dozen studies that showed that 99% of patients develop strong antibody response - Tony Fauci said as strongly as he can that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fauci-recovering-from-coronavirus-immunity-through-september-antibodies-2020-4" target="_blank">he fully believes there will be good, protective, multi-year immunity:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a livestreamed conversation with Journal of the American Medical Association editor Howard Bauchner, Fauci said it's unlikely that people can get the coronavirus more than once.</p>
<p>&quot;Generally we know with infections like this, that at least for a reasonable period of time, you're gonna have antibodies that are going to be protective,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Fauci added that because the virus doesn't seem to be mutating much, people who recover will likely be immune should the US see a second wave of spread in the fall.</p>
<p>&quot;If we get infected in February and March and recover, next September, October, that person who's infected — I believe — is going to be protected,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Essentially, my understanding is that IgM antibodies will give people long-term immunity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think IgG provides long-term immunity, not IgM. IgM is the one that a pathogen encounters initially during an infection.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the case of any infectious disease, you have to prove how long protective immunity lasts. With a vaccine, that would be part of the safety data submission to the FDA. Believing that having antibodies gives you protective immunity is an assumption, it is not always true for a variety of reasons. We need more data to understand what kind of protection our innate immunity gives us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the points already made, it is worth noting that the antibodies produced by your own B-cells are subject to specificity as well. This also means that two people who are immunized by exposure, can have expressed different specificities.
We don't know yet, as far as I'm aware, to what degree the covid-19 virus will mutate, and as to what threat this will pose in the long term. If it's anything like the flu, long-term immunity might be hard to obtain, unless a new multi-target vaccine is able to effectively exterminate it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not an immunologist, but still a biologist, it's just too early to say. In all likelihood, people should develop protective immunity but scientists are erring on the side of caution when it comes to concluding anything about COVID-19. </p>
<p>It's also why scientists are cautioning people not to necessarily put all their hopes on a vaccine in the near future despite the massive  resources directed towards development at the moment. I would be shocked (but obviously, incredibly happy and impressed) if we have a safe, working vaccine by 2021. </p>
<p>Normal vaccine development takes a very long time to ensure safety and efficacy. Generally, various side effects are expected and tolerated in medicines/treatments but since vaccines are given to healthy individuals, including children, there is a much, much thinner margin for error.  Especially given the disturbing recent trend of anti-vaccination opinions, now more than ever, scientists cannot afford anything that may further undermine public confidence in vaccination.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
