I took the special relativity course on World Science U, and while it does not exactly fit on my resume for gas station attendant being able to say I took a course taught by a world renown professor is my top brag at partied. Thank you again for that.</p>
<p>Secondly, I guess I should have a question. If you could host a show with any historical figure, who would you choose and what would be the subject of the show?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I read your book <em>The Elegant Universe</em> when I was younger and very much enjoyed it. Unfortunately, I haven't reading as much on the topic of string theory since I left university.</p>
<p>So are there any new developments or big changes on the field of string theory in the last 15 or so years?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Do you believe we are getting closer to obtaining experimental evidence for string theory? What research and experiments have captured your interest lately in that area?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF4ju6j6aLE" target="_blank">Back in 2013</a> you have a talk on String Theory including possible experiments that could provide experimental data on it.  Now that we have an additional 7 years of experimental results, from CERN, astronomy, and deep neutirno and WIMP experiments, has your outlook for the future been changed?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
