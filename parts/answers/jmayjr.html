		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Music taps heavily into the pattern recognition centers of the brain. Basically our brain loves trying to predict the next note, next verse, when the chorus will hit, etc. and the brain releases endorphins (feel good signals) every time it either guesses a new pattern correctly or is pleasantly surprised by a brand new sound.</p>
<p>The more we listen to a song, especially on repeat, the less surprises the song will hold and easier the patterns are to predict or remember.</p>
<p>Fun fact: this is also why if you get a song stuck in your head listening to the entire song 2-3 times in a row will usually get it out of your head.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Music perception is a huge field that includes physics, math and psychology / biologists amongst others. One explained it to me like this (Im sure this is a simplification): Music has a tension between repetition and dissonance. Repetition makes the music accessible, catchy and fun. Dissonance makes it thoughtful, interesting and deep. Some music tilts strongly in one direction: repetitive dance music, others in a different direction: like experimental jazz. As you get more and more familiar with a genre, some of the repetition and patterns “unlock” for you and become accessible in a way that they may not be to a novice. If you COMPLETELY process the information it will likely bore you. However if you dont “Get IT” youll likely dismiss the song as inaccessible and offputting. This tension explains both why albums and songs get better with age and why some dont. It also explains in part why some complex music (jazz and classical or even metal and hiphop) have die hard fans while others seem to hate it or just not get it. It turns out some of musical appreciation is actually tied to exposure. The best songs “grow” with you, looping in to patterns you can already access and then “unlocking” different more involved ones as you go. If you add a layer of emotional tie during that process (ahem - first kiss, birth of a child, loss of a loved one) this adds another layer that may or may not actually interact with all of the above. Perception is awesome!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
