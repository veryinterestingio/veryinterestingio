		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you think that's insecure, boy lemme tell you about the fucking <em>U.S. Army's</em> approach to security questions.</p>
<p>The questions were static and answers were <em>multiple choice</em>. You of course got to write your own answer. During sign-in, when the question and the answers were presented to you, your answer was displayed exactly as you wrote it. You were not given any instruction on how to format your answer or any examples of what others types of answers would appear with them. This created a bizarrely insecure scenario where the correct answer was sometimes obvious.</p>
<p>For example, the question and answers might be</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is your favorite car?  </p>
<p>A) Porsche Carrera 911  </p>
<p>B) Chevrolet Impala  </p>
<p>C) jeep wrangler</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is your favorite sports team?  </p>
<p>A) New York Giants  </p>
<p>B) LA Lakers  </p>
<p>C) Los Angeles Dodgers</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Main issue is trusting a security configuration to the user. Of the top of my head I can think of some problems like:</p>
<p>-Trivial questions: there would be a lot of people that would just put something like &quot;what's your birthday?&quot;.</p>
<p>-Misuse of custom field:  people could just put &quot;your password is 1234ravioli&quot;.</p>
<p>-Not necessarily better: the fact that you can put &quot;what is the middle name of the cat of my neighbor from childhood?&quot; Doesn't really means someone who is super skilled at social engineering can get to that answer somehow.</p>
<p>Also there is a technical problem: you have to store those questions somewhere. If you have let's say 10 default security questions labeled 1-10, then each user will need just a number to know which security question belongs to them (1 byte at most), but for every user to have a unique custom security question you'll have to give them around 50 characters of storage (50 bytes), it might not sound like much, but it really depends on how big is your user base.</p>
<p>There is probably more considerations to be had, but I think what's written above is enough to make a case.</p>
