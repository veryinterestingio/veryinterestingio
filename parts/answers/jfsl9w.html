<p>The age of the universe does depend on your frame of reference. Time dilation from gravity and from moving close to the speed of light can change how old the universe looks to you. There is no universal age of the universe. We have to pick a frame of reference, and we choose the frame where the cosmic microwave background appears stationary as our frame of reference.</p>
<p>However, this only matters if you need your numbers to be very precise. Most objects in space (stars, planets, galaxies) move at 10s to 1000s of km/s relative to each other. The speed of light is ~300,000 km/s, and you really need to be above like 90% of the speed of light for time dilation to really get noticeable, so stars and planets don't have strong time dilation relative to each other. The only things that move really really fast are jets of magnetised ionised gas blasting out from rapidly rotating accretion discs around black holes, but you can't live in a thin magnetised plasma.</p>
<p>Gravitational time dilation is similarly weak in almost all situations. It only really gets strong when you are really right on top of the event horizon of a black hole. So, if you had a planet that was almost touching the event horizon - which is an implausible but not technically impossible orbit - then yes, any aliens on that planet will have a very different view of the age of the universe. But the Milky Way's gravity is too gentle to have a significant effect between the central bulge and the outer spiral.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
