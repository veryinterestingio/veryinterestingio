		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Iron on Earth used to be elemental iron. The iron we find today are different forms of oxide. Basically everything that is red contains some form of iron oxide. That's a conundrum because oxygen is very reactive so there used to be no free oxygen in Earth's atmosphere and as a result no new oxides could form. There was <del>atomic</del> iron basically floating through the oceans in great quantities. Iron is the most stable atom so there is an &quot;iron peak&quot;, stars form a lot more iron than other heavy elements. As a side note the atmosphere of Earth also contained methane and hydrogen.</p>
<p>This all changed during the great oxygenation event around 1.8 billion years ago. At this time, the first <del>algae</del> cyanobacteria evolved, creating oxygen through photosynthesis. This lead to two things. First, all other live on Earth died, since oxygen is toxic. Secondly, everything on the surface of the Earth or in the oceans that could oxidize, did. All the methane and hydrogen burned up, which might have lead to &quot;snowball Earth&quot;, entering a huge ice age because of the absence of methane.</p>
<p>The scale of this event is truly, truly massive. Think about the red deserts in Australia, and realize that this is all iron oxide, and that every single oxygen atom within it had to be released by photosynthesis. As such, the GOE lasted quite a while, over a billion years, until everything was oxidized and the atmospheric oxygen levels began to rise.</p>
<p>Anyway, the free iron floating in the oceans oxidized as well. Iron oxide isn't as soluble, so it floated to the bottom of the ocean and formed banded iron formations. This is most of our iron ore.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is assumed that at the beginning of time as 1st generation stars began forming, they only had hydrogen and helium to work with. These stars mostly are many more masses than our sun so they consist of more material. The universe at the time also was more violent, forming more stars and at a faster rate.</p>
<p>Most 1st gen stars originated in clumps along with hydrogen, like a nebula, and most went nova at the same time saturating the nebula with heavier elements, like iron. This means that the nebula or even small galaxy at the time was constantly being saturated with heavy elements, and mostly a large amount of them.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You've gotten plenty of answers here, and I only read the one by /u/madplayshd</p>
<p>2 points to make... </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Iron ore is iron that has combined with other elements that later has to be processed to relinquish the iron. Iron created by stars in super nova explosions <em>I believe</em> is pure iron (Fe), although I can imagine some reactions occurring in space  if the conditions were right. </p>
</li>
<li>Scale. Only the largest stars make it to the Iron producing stage before going super nova. Not every super nova explosion is a star that burned its hydrogen to iron. </li>
</ol>
<p>The star large enough to go nova has multiple internal layers, like an onion, with hydrogen most superficial, then helium, etc., until you get to the actual core where the final fusion reaction is covering silicon (?) to iron - I'm a bit fuzzy on the order of the element formation, but the science is out there.... </p>
<p>Also the fact that it's ONLY the core of this massive star that's finally fusing the penultimate element(s) into iron, representing only something like 10% of the star's mass (that percentage is a guesstimate on my part) means that iron isn't the most abundant of the elements spewed out after the explosion.</p>
<p>The final burn to iron then supernova, btw, occurs in minutes, as opposed to the life of such a star (short lived comparatively because the more massive the star the hotter it is and the hotter it is the quicker it burns through its fuel) which is in the tens to hundreds of millions of years. Our sun, which will DEFINITELY NOT be creating any heavy elements or going supernova, is halfway through its lifespan at around 4 billion years.</p>
<p>Finally, the question regarding where elements heavier than iron arise may come to mind as well.</p>
<p>That happens <em>after</em> the super nova explosion in the many nuclear events that occur as those elements are forced out into space with the immense number of neutrons and neutrinos that get created (maybe not the latter).</p>
<p>There's a whole nuclear science regarding slow and fast neutron capture and the creation of the transition elements and elements heavier than iron. </p>
<p>If you're interested, I'll give you the link. </p>
<p>Hope this helped fill in some more spaces.</p>
<p>Excuse errors, I'm on mobile.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it, the iron atoms are in the pre-stellar gas cloud.  As the cloud condenses into a star, the iron gets concentrated at certain preferred ranges of distances from the star. These concentrations eventually form into planets, like Earth. The Earth is 32% iron, and a lot of the rest is silicate rocks (mostly silicon and oxygen as SiO2) The very early Earth is hot and molten, and as it solidifies, the iron solidifies, in chunks.</p>
<p>Think of what happens in a puddle of mixed molten iron and silicates as it cools down. The iron remains molten down to 1538 C, then it &quot;freezes&quot; out. The silicates remain molten down to 1260 C, then they freeze as granite, quartz, or other rocky stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
