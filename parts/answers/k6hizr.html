		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's totally doable.</p>
<p>For instance, if the two suns are in a close orbit, they basically just feel like one big sun, and you can have a nice stable orbit without huge variations in temperature. If they're both about as bright as our Sun, you'd just need to be a bit further away so that the temperature is okay. Or, the stars could just be a bit dimmer than our Sun, and the planet could be closer (or vice versa). All you're doing is moving the habitable zone in and out, but if there's a planet there, you can have liquid water and Earth-like life.</p>
<p>Alternately, your planet could be in a close orbit around one sun, and that planet-sun system is orbited by (or orbits) a second sun. If the second sun is dim enough or far enough away, you'll be dominated by the nearby sun, and you again won't get extreme variations in temperature, and you could still have Earth-like life with liquid water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was going to post an answer saying that it's probably impossible due to orbital mechanics of three-body systems, but then I actually dove in and we've FOUND such planets. Whoops, I was wrong.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler-16b" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler-16b" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler-16b</a></a></p>
<p>Kepler-16b is a Saturn-sized gas giant near the outer edge of it's close-binary stars' habitable zone. Being a gas giant, it's unlikely there's life on it but considering how many strange and wonderful moons Saturn and Jupiter have, it's entirely feasible that Kepler-16b could have a moon that has life on it.</p>
<p>Kepler 16, the binary star system, is 245 LY away. Even if we imagine that somehow, that was the only such star within 250LY of us (it's certainly not) then there would be still be thousands, maybe millions of such systems in our galaxy alone. The galaxy is REALLY big.</p>
<p>And there something like 100,000,000,000 galaxies out there in the universe. </p>
<p>Statistically speaking, a planet very similar to Tatooine exists almost certainly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, it'd work.</p>
<p>Basically, around any star, there is a Goldilocks Zone (which I just learned is officially called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstellar_habitable_zone" target="_blank">circumstellar habitable zone</a>) where the planet could potentially support life (specifically, a part of the orbit where the planet's surface would be able to maintain liquid water, which could then potentially support life).</p>
<p>Changing variables about that star would move or potentially grow or shrink the size of the zone. It is possible for a particular star to not have such a zone, but having a two star system wouldn't necessarily preclude it from having one given the right conditions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The funny thing about interesting hypothetical questions in science is that the answer is usually super mundane.... In this instance: if life existed in such a solar system, it would have come about by evolving around any hostilities that the environment posed.... You might even see a creature whose preferred mode of heat transfer was radiation rather than conduction.... Extra sun pops up here tomorrow? That's a problem... Been living with it for eons? Just another day in the sand pits</p>
<p>Edit: conduction not induction</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All we know is life on earth so far which requires a really narrow temperature window and the elements we have on this planet and the amount of gravity / radiation we experience. I do theorize however, that it may be possible for life that looks nothing like ours to exist in far different combinations of elements, heat, radiation, and gravity etc. But that is just a theory from a guy on the internet. Extremophiles here on Earth already show us life shows up in crazy weird places. It seems possible that we are just a very specific type of life adapted to these very specific conditions and life that we might not even recognize may exist in forms and fashions we might not even think to try and detect because our version of what &quot;life&quot; is comes from a very restricted point of view. Because we only know this way.  </p>
<p>That said, it's possible binary suns could have goldilocks zones where earth like planets or moons could thrive in too, given the right conditions / combinations. Earth at this time still seems to be a relatively rare planet type either way, but with what we think may be trillions of possible galaxies containing about 100 million stars each on average out in the known universe, there could be countless Earth like planets. It's just gonna be really hard to find them given our known limitations of time and space. Everything is just sooo far away. We have a hard enough time traveling our own solar system let alone discovering extra solar planets in deep and meaningful ways. So at this point, the best we can do is math it out and observe the universe in terms of probabilities. And even then it involves so much guesswork.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
