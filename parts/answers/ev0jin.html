		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two ways a commercial dishwasher sanitizes dishes: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Hot water (180 degrees where I live) - requires a booster outside of the machine to heat up incoming water as most water heaters on site only heat to Around 120 degrees so people donâ€™t burn their hands when washing.   The water passes through the booster, gets heated, then travels to the dishwasher.  The dishes get sprayed just before they are finished the cycle.</p>
</li>
<li>Chlorine - a jug or pail sits outside of the machine and a calculated amount is auto-dispensed into the fresh water rinse cycle.</li>
</ol>
<p>At home a relatively small heating element in a household dishwasher takes a really long time to heat water to a temperature. Required to sanitize.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone has already pointed out the operating differences, but the costing of them is also of merit.
You get what you pay for. </p>
<p>Average price for a  commercial dishwasher would be about $4000.
Average domestic dishwasher $500.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because in a commercial kitchen you have a dish bitch. Like someone literally thoroughly washes them first, a commercial dishwasher is actually really just a sterilizer. Plus they use a ton of water and totally causitc chems you couldnt use in a home environment. As well as this they have large heating elements and are always on.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing that hasn't been mentioned is the dishware used by restaurants is more rugged that household dishware. Everything from the plates to the spatulas are designed for high heat and designed to take a beating. Plastic storage containers used by restaurants tend to be thicker and harder than the flimsy &quot;dishwasher safe&quot; tupperware we use at home.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
