		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is about cavitation. When the kettle is on the way to boiling the water touching the heating element at the bottom boils and turns into steam bubbles, which rise and cool as they go because the water around them is cooler. When they get below a certain temperature they collapse and the water rushing in is what makes the noise.</p>
<p>Just before boiling the water isn't cool enough to collapse the bubbles before they get to the surface so they collapse <em>at</em> the surface, and air rushing in makes much less noise.</p>
<p>This also makes the air in the kettle get hotter very quickly, which triggers the thermal cutout and switches the kettle off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you start your kettle there is something called a heating element in it. This gets really, really hot. Hotter than boiling water. Since most of the water is cold the water touching the element gets very hot very fast. Heat makes things expand, and cold makes them contract.  </p>
<p>So the water heats up very fast, expands, and moves away from the heating element. When this happens the rest of the water helps to absorb a lot of that heat. This makes that water contract very quickly. What you are hearing is the water expanding and contracting very quickly.</p>
<p>When your water gets hot enough your kettle gets quiet because the rest of the water can't absorb nearly as much heat. Think of it kind of like a rubber band. If you pull it tight then let go, it will snap back quickly with a loud noise. Keep doing this, but only stretch the rubber band half as much each time. This is a lot like the water heating in your kettle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you start to boil water, a couple of different things happen.  First, all of the oxygen dissolved in the water forms tiny bubbles which pop when they float to the surface.  This is the same idea as the <em>popping</em> you hear from carbonated water, only with smaller bubbles and a different gas.  This noise happen at a lower temperature than water boils at, and is also why you can deionize water by boiling it.  </p>
<p>The next sound comes when the water at the bottom of the kettle is boiling but the rest of the water is not.  Tiny bubble of steam form against the hot metal surface, but as they detach and float up, they cool off and implode.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before heating:  conditions do not exist to make bubbles
After heating:  Conditions exist to make bubbles, they escape to the surface.
During heating: conditions to make bubbles exist only near the heat.  Bubbles that are formed lift up away from the heat and collapse.</p>
<p>You are hearing the noise of this collapsing.  They stop collapsing when the water is hot enough to let them escape through the surface.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
