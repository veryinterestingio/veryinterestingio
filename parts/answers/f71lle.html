		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Barrier methods: copper coins, sponges, condoms made from animal intestines. </p>
<p>Douching with strong vinegars or alcohols. </p>
<p>Herbal abortificients like yarrow and pennyroyal.</p>
<p>Edit: Lots of people asking about the copper coin thing.  Copper has some spermicidal properties.  They use it to make some IUDs. </p>
<p>But seriously, please don't get contraceptive advice from this thread.  Talk to a doctor.  And please don't start shoving strange things in your vaginal canal.  The lives of old-timey prostitutes were short and painful for many reasons. Lack of sanitary birth control was absolutely one of those reasons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At least by the Greco-Roman era (and likely thousands of years before, but the toga guys with marble columns were when it started getting written down), there was a well-developed herbology for birth control, menstrual pain, childbirth, and abortion. They were not as reliable as modern methods but they were pretty good.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This may have been said by someone else here:  there are  areas where many newborn skeletons have been exhumed.  The one I read about recently was from the Roman era.  Archeologist have speculated that near by brothels practiced infanticide to deal with unwanted pregnancy/babies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>More or less, the rhythm method where you estimate when you're ovulating and not have sex during those days with a dash of herbalist magic to make conception less possible and a sprinkle of backroom abortions. Depending on how far back or what part of the world, surgical interference with the lady bits may also be involved.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
