Because of the shell turtles and tortoises gain fatty deposits on their neck and limbs, and it adds strain to their internal organs</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes! They get fatty deposits around their tails and legs. It’s not common in the wild but you do see it more in domestic or pet turtles. Reptiles have very different metabolism than mammals and have no upper limit on growth so mostly they don’t get fat they just get larger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if turtles get fat in the same way as tortoises...</p>
<p>But if tortoises get too much food (protein in particular), it can cause their shell to pyramid. This adds a lot of weight on top of the animal and causes mobility problems. Not sure if this happens to turtles so might want to double check.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
