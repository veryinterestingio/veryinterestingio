		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The only difference is that physical pain is caused by a lesion. Pain is the way you interpret the lesion, it's not your arm that is in pain because you burnt yourself, it's your brain that creates the pain.</p>
<p>In both cases, emotionnal pain or physical pain, the same brain regions are activated. That mean that you don't need to hurt yourselr to feel pain. And that's why depressed people can feel acute pain sometimes.</p>
<p>The point of both types of pain is more or less the same, it warns you and others that something is wrong with you and you need assistance</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's an interesting idea that emotional pain evolved in primates as a part of the social hierarchy. Instead of using physical violence as a reward-punishment system, primates use emotional pain.<br />
It could be that the purpose behind emotional pain is to avoid physically hurting the individuals of the group, while still being able to settle disputes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Emotional pain, like physical pain, creates memory in our brain so that we remember when weâ€™re in a similar situation in the future that something has caused us pain before and to be careful to not get hurt again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
