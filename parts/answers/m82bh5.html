		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Devices only take the power they need. Like a firehose, you could use a whole lot of water if you open it all the way, but your phone charger only needs a little bit of Power, so it's like opening it up a tiny bit. A trickle comes out. Even through there's plenty of water pressure available.</p>
<p>The fire hose is the main power to your house.</p>
<p>Your outlets are like garden hoses, they each can't let out nearly as much power as the main power line, but they're all connected to the same main location (your fuse box)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My (non-electrical engineering) understanding is that newer alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) transformers (which change the voltage of wall current to something lower voltage that digital devices can use) work by only using a little bit of current from the short period of time when the voltage is starting to go up and down in the AC cycle.  As such, they don't use resistance (which would make heat) to change voltage.  A part of the device called a rectifier switches the positive and negative parts of the cycle so the current is only running in one direction (DC). Then capacitors smooth out the current so it's basically constant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electricity is like a water supply in a closed loop (from live to neutral, or positive to negative, say).</p>
<p>Voltage is a &quot;pump&quot; pushing water through that loop.</p>
<p>The wires are pipes.</p>
<p>If the pipe is small and constricted, only a small amount of water can travel through it.  If the pipe is large, a larger amount of water can travel through it.</p>
<p>Low voltage devices, by the design and nature of being low voltage, are all very thin pipes.  High voltage devices are very fat pipes.</p>
<p>Now if you push hard enough, obviously the small pipes would burst first, but that's not how electricity works in practical contexts.  We push at a very standardised pumping rate (voltage).  The items we design are designed to always cope with that &quot;pressure&quot; without bursting (otherwise everything would be on fire!).</p>
<p>Given that we know that pressure, and design all our pipes to cope with it, our pipes cannot burst.  They might get very, very thin or very fat, but they're designed to cope with the pressure of 110V or 220V.</p>
<p>However, if you make a pipe like that, and its very narrow and thin, there's only so much water that can pass through it every second (the power).  If you make a pipe fat, more power can go through it, even though you're only pushing with the exact same pressure.</p>
<p>The size of the pipe you make determines the power that the device gets / uses.</p>
<p>And you never design it such that a pipe is so weak that it could &quot;burst&quot; (e.g. a wire burning out) or put more pressure down a pipe than it's designed to handle (e.g. 440V down a 110V cables) because then that's a fire hazard.</p>
<p>But it's the size of the pipe that matters.  And phone chargers only have a tiny pipe, and the electricity company only ever pushes with a certain amount of pressure, so only a tiny amount of power ever goes through them.</p>
<p>So long as that pressure stays the same, the pipe never bursts, but less water goes through the little pipe than through the bigger one that's fed from the same supply pressure (the same way that you can run a dribble from your tap and your neighbour can run a huge hose from the same water supply, and it doesn't BURST out of your tap when he does that).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I like to explain electricity coming from the wall as being sort of like water coming from the sink.... both have a pressure (how hard the water or electricity is pushed out) and a flow rate (how much water or electricity comes out every second). </p>
<p>Thinking about the sink - it's not really just &quot;off&quot; or &quot;on&quot;, is it? You can change how open your tap is, and that will change how much water comes out the faucet. Pay close enough attention and you can decide exactly how much water comes out by making the tap just the right amount open (or the right amount closed, if you think from the opposite direction). Electrical flow can be restricted too, which is why plugging in a phone charger won't suddenly drain the grid just like turning on your sink won't suddenly drain the reservoir.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
