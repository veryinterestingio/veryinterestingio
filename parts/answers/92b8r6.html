		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Im no expert by all means, I researched it a while back when one of my aviary birds had airsacmites.</p>
<p>In short, a bird has two types of lungs. One that takes in air and one that only exhausts air. (The air moves between them via tubes that exchanges the gasses with the blood). So air will only move in a single direction through these lungs (it moves cyclic).</p>
<p>Which is in contrast to mammalian lungs, as we suck in air and push it out from the same organ.</p>
<p>And additional factor is the way that the blood in bird veins flow. Iirc (dont quote me on this) the blood flows in the opposite direction of the air in those tubes I mentioned earlier. This increases the efficiency as the waste gasses (CO2) are dumped near the &quot;exit&quot; lung (in lack of a better term) and frees up space for oxigen at the intake lung.</p>
<p>There's also an inherent need for birds to evolve this way. Flying is hard work, but more importantly the air gets thin at heights so you need to process more air for the same oxygen supply vs groundlevel. Go climb a mountain, you'll notice😉</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've lectured on this.</p>
<p>Birds have one way respiration. As opposed to the mammalian lung, which has air sacs (alveoli), birds have sort of a &quot;honeycomb&quot; lung (faveoli). Think of it like a large radiator. The air is pumped through the lung with large air sacs, and the airways have  one-way valves that  keep unidirectional flow.
So, when a mammal inhales, the lungs fill up with air, and then during exhalation, the air goes back out the way it came. When a bird inhales, the air sacs fill. During exhalation, air goes out the air sac to the lung. Air travels in a big circuit.</p>
<p>Mammals have a significant amount of dead space, often about a third of their tidal volume. Dead space is air that enters the body but doesn't participate in respiration. Birds have very little.</p>
<p>Because birds have unidirectional airflow, the pulmonary circulation is oriented in the opposite direction. it's not truly counter current like a fish's gills, where water goes in the opposite direction of blood flow, but a cross current system, which approximates the fishes gills. Think of it like the airways and the blood vessels have little loops for gas exchange, but the overall direction is opposite.</p>
<p>This counter current gas exchange is very efficient. A mammalian lung reaches equilibrium with the alveolar gas content, meaning you will never extract more oxygen than what you exhaled.</p>
<p>When blood first enters a bird lung, it has very low oxygen, and it is exposed to the air at the end of the circuit, which has low oxygen, but still more than the blood. As the blood continues to flow, it keeps being exposed to &quot;fresher&quot; upstream air, which always has just a little bit more oxygen to drive oxygen into the blood. Near the end of pulmonary circulation, the blood is exposed to the air with the highest concentration (21%). The bird exhales air that is much lower oxygen content because the blood extracts so much more than mammals.</p>
<p>The reason this evolved is not for flight, contrary to what some others have posted. There was no evolutionary pressure to be able to fly a mile high when there is nothing else that can fly.</p>
<p>The reason birds evolved this is because oxygen levels during the Triassic we're much lower, around 13%. Dinosaurs had very efficient lungs, and when oxygen concentrations increased during the Jurassic and Cretaceous, they were fine. Birds are the surviving dinosaurs, and they can fly that high because they have excellent lungs. They did not develop those lungs in order to fly high.</p>
<p>Other amniotes that have been around since the dinosaurs, like archosaurs (crocodiles) and monitor lizards (Komodo dragon) have been found to have one way respiration as well.</p>
<p>Another interesting fact is that if you hyperventilate, you will black out due to cerebral vasoconstriction (decreased blood flow to the brain). A bird will actually get better blood flow to the brain during hyperventilation, presumably because they need more brain power when flying.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean respiration as in breathing, or energy production? As far as I'm aware, birds only breath more efficiently. </p>
<p>This is because rather than filling all their 'lungs' like we do, they fill different parts at different times and squeeze air between them, meaning air is always moving, and always in <em>one direction</em>. This causes the oxygen to diffuse in faster. It's kinda like breathing in one lung, then squeezing all the air into your other lung, then breathing it out -  the gas exchange happens while it it is moving between lungs, rather than in the lungs themselves as it is in us.</p>
<p>The reason why this is more efficient is because you don't get stationary air, and all the air is moved through. This means that fresh air always flows through the whole system, and so the oxygen difference is kept high.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It makes a lot of sense if bones weigh more, thus needing stronger and larger muscles to move them. These muscles require a larger amount of oxygen to be fueled. This, the dual functioning lung, which from an engineering perspective, is actually an advance. </p>
<p>Avian pulmonology seems to be an inefficient system evolution chose to improve upon in mammals</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, the bird has little to no body weight due to hollow bones and can achieve flight, so therefore will need to have lungs that can handle pressure changes. Although birds are endothermic, they have feathers to keep and maintain heat in cooler altitudes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the mammal has to:</p>
<ol>
<li>maintain body heat,</li>
<li>move large, non-hollowed bones</li>
<li>Take in several thousand times more oxygen to create the transfer to the organs</li>
<li>Also, the organs are a lot larger and heavier than in birds.</li>
<li>Mammalian digestion is much more complex than avian species as they separate areas for reproduction, urine excretion, and fecal excretion</li>
<li>Avian species gestate outside the body. The Avian &quot;womb&quot; is an egg. Mammals have an internal womb, the Uterus, which has to house, nourish, and expel the fully grown fetus. </li>
</ol>
<p>So, birds are much more efficient in the same way Denmark's government is more efficient than the US Government.</p>
<p>One runs a geographically small nation with a homogeneous population.</p>
<p>The other is the second largest nation on the planet by landmass with over 60 ethnicities represented in the population, an armed forces in over 40 countries, and a Navy that spans the planet. It interferes in the affairs of all the other nations and is where a majority of the world's wealth is concentrated.</p>
<p>So, yeah, birds are more efficient than mammals. But only because they are smaller, weigh less, and have a less complex digestive and reproductive system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
