		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you mean in software then no. Using a bit of hardware then yes, for example, voltage through photoresistor to ADC. Or amplify noise from any quantum device. Thatâ€™s how modern cpu random number generators work. Those are true random numbers ultimately coming from quantum fluctuations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most computer programs use what are called &quot;pseudo-random&quot; sequences - they appear random, but actually follow a set pattern.</p>
<p>True randomness requires gathering data from the environment (for example, capturing the low bit of a counter when an external interrupt is processed). Some systems have a random source built-in. These are usually based on variations in temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well that depends on what you mean by&quot;random&quot;, &quot;number&quot; and &quot;generate&quot;.</p>
<p>Randomness can be defined as unpredictability. A sequence is called random if the amount of information it contains is maximal, i.e you can't easily &quot;guess&quot; how the sequence continues given any part of it. Entropy is a common measure for the average information contents of some data.</p>
<p>Algorithmically, generating truly random data (high-entropy) from non-random (low entropy) data is impossible - you can't create new information using algorithms, only transform it (because alhorithms are by definition deterministic and depend entirely on their inputs). There are pseudo-random number generators, that take a &quot;seed&quot; of entropy and use it to generate data that <em>looks like</em> random data, but eventually the entropy of their output is the same as the entropy of their input (plus the entropy of the algorithm itself).</p>
<p>As others have mentioned, you can measure physical noise, which is essentially random, and use it as an entropy source for a PRNG to produce a sequence with relatively high entropy, or just use the noise itself (after some algorithmic &quot;whitening&quot;/debiasing), which is mainly done on cryptographic applications.</p>
<p>I want to address another point of the question; that is, can you generate a random <em>number</em>?</p>
<p>You can generate a random number from a finite set of numbers, e.g 1...N for some N. But can you truly generate a random natural number, or a random number in the range 0..1? Or a random real number?</p>
<p>The short answer is, practically, no, you can't generate any random element from an infinite set, simply because that would require infinite information.</p>
<p>Theoretically, this question gets even more tricky, because it requires some careful definitions of &quot;probability measures&quot; which essentially determine how numbers are &quot;grouped&quot; together, and the likelihood of choosing from each group of numbers. E.g if I want a uniform random number between 0..1, I know that there should be a 50% chance the number is between 0..0.5. </p>
<p>But anyway, I've rambled long enough. Hope this answer is satisfactory</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
