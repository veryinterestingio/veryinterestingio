		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sadly, the answer is &quot;who knows?&quot; The chin is a critical feature separating modern humans from all other hominids (Neanderthals did not have chins) but it does not have any clear mechanical benefit. One possibility is sexual selection, where for whatever reason early humans began finding chins sexy and so preferred big chinned mates. This would partly explain why males tend to have more prominent chins than females although there's so much variation involved that it's not a slam dunk. Some researchers think it may have to do with the development of speech but speech probably existed in some of our closer non chinned hominid cousins as well, and it isn't necessary for speech. So all the theories have trouble explaining the phenomenon and because it's a relatively minor but very interesting evolutionary feat it tends to get more curious speculation than serious research.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read (sorry no idea where) that the human face is designed to absorb blows, kinda like an airbag to protect the brain. This explains our spongy sinuses and structure of the cheekbones and somehow our brows being less dense than Neanderthals. A spongy chin fits with this. The theory is homo sapiens became their own worst enemy, 25% of adult deaths were from fights prehistorically?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
