<p>The FDA does approve some antipsychotics to use in autism but only for autistic agitation (rage) . </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of a misinformation here so I thought I’d pipe in.</p>
<p>So far what we think could be the cause of ASD, or at least connected to ASD, is failed apoptosis in the cerebral cortex. Apoptosis is planned cell suicide, and failures in apoptosis are implicated in various diseases, most notably cancers, tumours, and some others.</p>
<p>Considering the symptoms, and the volume of the brain increasing more rapidly than it should, it’s likely that the language, communication, and other areas/centers of the brain are compressed, leading to inhibited growth, development, and activity. The cranium has a likited space, anything in excess will lead to the detriment of another structure. Unfortunately we still aren’t certain of what occurs, but we do have various leads and various associated symptoms for ASD that could eventually lead us to an answer.</p>
