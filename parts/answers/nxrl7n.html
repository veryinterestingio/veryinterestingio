		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't work at an institution that handles student loans but I do work in IT at a different kind of financial institution. Our data resides not only on premises within our own organization, but also at other third party institutions, cloud services, and physical backups as you mentioned (tape archives in a vault somewhere). To completely &quot;wipe&quot; all traces of account data, it would require a fairly large coordinated effort that goes far beyond just accessing any one system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

IF a hacker got in and changed account values to zero as soon as the bank or institution realized this they would just go to the back ups and have the accounts restored in days, if not hours.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apologies ahead of time, I can't do this eli5.</p>
<p>I've actually designed several of the parts and pieces in use by banks over the years (edit: specifically the programs and the security in use).</p>
<p>First that debt isn't what you think it is. You're used to when you loan your buddy $10 that's the end of it. </p>
<p>The loan network is vastly more complex than you imagine. This complexity is what makes it so difficult to wipe out the debt, whether by law or by hack. </p>
<p>The biggest thing to understand is that your bank doesn't keep your debt to themselves. Instead your bank sells that debt to others, usually combined with other debts in a tranche.  Think of a tranche as a slushie of a large number of debts, poured into manageable portions for sale. </p>
<p>These tranches are then often combined in other tranches. </p>
<p>All of this is to adjust risk in the tranches to certain complex requirements to reach pricing goals.</p>
<p>I spent the time on those because each and every one of those tranches will carry with it documentation of the debts inside. </p>
<p>So even if the initial bank debts were eliminated, the courts can reconstruct your debt from the tranche documents. And even if those documents are lost or destroyed, the tranche documents can be reconstructed from the next tranche paperwork in the line. </p>
<p>Since this tranche paperwork is held in a massive number of places it becomes nearly impossible to find every copy to eliminate.</p>
<p>These tranches are also why it becomes so hard to wipe out for government. That tranche pricing is very sensitive to the exact risk inside. If certain debts included are adjusted it can dramatically impact on the value of the tranche. </p>
<p>Making this even more complex of an effort is that most of those tranches are owned by pensions which need consistent returns in order to pay the pensioners their income. </p>
<p>So after a massive amount of complexity it can't be done because it can be reconstructed. And even if you did wipe it out by law, the impact on your grandparents' pension would be unrecoverable. </p>
<p>It's a genuinely bad situation that will take decades to resolve.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hacking isn't what you think it is. Hacking is simply the act of making something do something it wasn't intended to do - think using a shirt as a bag to carry groceries in. Or making a server think you are making a legitimate request and giving you all password for all users.</p>
<p>It's not the nefarious black magic art of going into technical equipment and just destroying it. Student Loans are probably registered at multiple banks, multiple organisations and multiple different system, possibly even physical copies.</p>
<p>That said it's not impossible, it's just extremely unrealistic to think even a group of hackers would be able to infiltrate enough systems and minds to make a nationwide debt disappear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
