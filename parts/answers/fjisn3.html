		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically you have a 'lower' brain and a 'higher' brain. The higher brain is you. The lower brain is like your second in command. He's a bit simple but can perform basic logic tasks to decide whether to wake you up or not if you're asleep, and can also take executive action himself to deal with a perceived threat (e.g. Get you away from or lash out at an intruder). Lower brain is also very good at taking over tasks so you don't have to think about them anymore, like riding a bike or driving a car or playing the piano. Your higher brain can be completely knocked out yet it is possible for you to continue to be able to do these things if lower brain is intact because it knows how to do them on its own.</p>
<p>Lower brain gets to know what sort of stimulus is normal background and what isn't. For example if you live on a busy street with sirens going by regularly these won't wake you, but they might wake your friend from the country who's staying over for the night. You are still hearing the sound but lower brain makes the call that higher brain doesn't need to know about this. Fwiw he is able to do this when you're awake too which is how you are able to focus on 1 person speaking in a noisy room. </p>
<p>Equally when your spouse cuddles up to you, lower brain has become used to them being in the bed and knows this is them showing affection and not trying to kill you so is able to respond appropriately.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You become conscious during sleep quite often; you just don't build memories for these events. This is why sometimes you barely remember a dream, and you know there was more to it (because the feelings of your memory insinuate some deep past in the event). This is why we can sleepwalk, and all kinds of other crazy stuff. Consciousness is not the same as memory.   </p>
<p>There's a bit of a debate actually as to weather or not consciousness persists during anesthesia. So you would experience everything, in the moment, but never have recollection of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
