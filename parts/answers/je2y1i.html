<p>During December 2016–February 2017, influenza A viruses of the H7N2 subtype infected ≈500 cats in animal shelters in New York, NY, USA, indicating virus transmission among cats. <strong>A veterinarian who treated the animals also became infected with feline influenza A(H7N2) virus and experienced respiratory symptoms.</strong> … These results suggest that <strong>the feline H7N2 subtype viruses could spread among cats and also infect humans</strong>. Outbreaks of the feline H7N2 viruses could, therefore, pose a risk to public health.</p>

<p>But in general, influenza is relatively rare in cats and dogs, whereas it’s very common in many birds and in swine.  Also, the viruses that do infect cats and dogs seem to be poor at infecting humans. So while it’s not an impossibility, the opportunities don’t arise often and even when they do the risk is low.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is canine flu - h3n8 and h3n2 if memory serves. The H3N8 strain was passed to dogs from horses in stable yards in the 80s. Horses get it from ducks shitting in their drinking water (ponds mostly). </p>
<p>People don’t get canine flu very much for a couple of reasons. The dog upper airways have different cell surface proteins to those in people so the viruses passed between dogs are specialised to get into the cells in dogs’ airways and not very good at getting into people’s cells, even if you do breathe them in.  This also goes the other way (why dogs don’t get human-adapted viruses). Dogs and humans also have slightly different internal body temperatures which matters for virus growth.</p>
<p>Flu also is not that common in dogs, you only tend to see outbreaks in overcrowded kennels or pounds so there’s not as much exposure as you might think.</p>
<p>Part of my PhD was analysing how/why h3n8 spread from birds to horses to dogs (and not other species). I can go on at excruciating length so feel free to ask any questions that might interest you :D</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Diseases jumping from one species to another is very rare, especially between species that are so different, but there are things that increase the likelihood. Every time a virus replicates it has a chance of mutation; the more it mutates, the more likely it creates a strain that can jump species. More animals together with the virus means more virus replication, means more mutations, means higher chance of a species-jumper. This is amplified by poor sanitary conditions and high density of animals, as the virus can spread more easily. Hundreds of pigs or chickens together in high density with poor sanitation is a perfect environment for these strains to emerge, but the chances are much much lower with just one or two pets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Current vet student here that just took a course a course in virology last semester. I may not have the complete picture, but a large part of the prevalence of these two in humans is due to the biology of pigs. Swine have receptors in their cells for both the human  (SAα2, 6Gal receptor) and Avian (SAα2, 3Gal receptor) strains of the influenza virus.<br />
Of these two, most swine influenzas preferentially recognize the SAα2, 6Gal receptor (which I assume further allows for likely transmission to humans). Because of this, they are able to be infected with either strain, and sometimes both at the same time. When this occurs, these viruses can undergo genetic shift and become entirely new strains. For example the DNA encoding recognition for the 6Gal receptor may be transmitted to an avian influenza, allowing for it's transmission into humans as a new host. (They can also undergo genetic drift and mutate these effects, however this is a touch less common). To further note, swine can be exposed to avian strains either through close housing with poultry, or through exposure to aquatic fowl feces, which is much harder to control if the pigs are allowed outside.<br />
This also explains the lack of preemptive vaccines, as there is a need to isolate and analyze the virus in order to figure out what may have changed since the last outbreak. Expanding on this, there are   </p>
<p>More information on this topic can be found at this link which I was referring to in order to brush up on certain topics in order to form the paragraph above.  <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682213004091" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682213004091" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682213004091</a></a>  </p>
<p>As mentioned by an earlier commenter, cat and dog flu can be contracted by humans, but this is more in someone at higher risk and/or higher exposure to the virus such as the veterinarian in the example.<br />
In regards to these strains, I don't know if saying it's rare in these species is a fair assessment. It's always been recommended to vaccinate against canine influenza in the communities where I've worked, but its most certainly less common than either the swine and avian strains. At the same time feline and canine strains were really only a side note in our virology course, so I don't have much more to say on this topic. </p>
<p>(This paragraph is more off the top of my head, so I don't have a reference for you all)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
