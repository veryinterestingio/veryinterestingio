<p>What you're asking about is called a quadruple prime: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_quadruplet" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_quadruplet</a></p>
<p>Note that - due to multiples of 3 and 5 - the &quot;shifting&quot; you describe isn't even possible. Every third odd number is a multiple of 3. In order to have 4 out of 9 consecutive numbers be prime, it /has/ to be 10n+1, 10n+3, 10n+7, 10n+9, where 10n+5 is a multiple of both 3 and 5. In this case, 10n-1 and 10n+11 are both multiples of 3. If 10n+5 isn't a multiple of 3 for some n, then either 10n+1 and 10+7 are, or 10n+3 and 10n+9 are, and you don't have a quadruple prime.</p>
<p>A simpler question would apply to twin primes - pairs of primes n+1 and n-1. As far as we can tell, there never stops being twin primes, however, we don't have a proof either way.</p>
<p>This is a stronger form of the twin primes question - you're asking whether there are infinitely many sets of twin primes with this special spacing. If we proved that there were only a finite number of twins, then we would know that there is also only a finite number of quadruplets. Conversely, of we proved that there were infinitely many quadruplets, then it would natrually follow that there were infinitely many twins. To date, neither class has a proof either way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
