		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can a black hole singularity form in finite time, or even form at all? I’ve been struggling with this paradox: To an external observer, all matter falling into the black hole slows to a halt at the event horizon, taking an infinite time to cross, correct? Wouldn’t then the entire black hole mass (from the POV of an external observer) be concentrated on a thin spherical shell on the event horizon, and exist in this configuration until the black hole evaporated due to Hawking radiation?  In this scenario, the singularity would never form, as the black hole would evaporate before any matter crosses the event horizon.</p>
<p>Does this interpretation differ in any measurable way from that where all the mass is concentrated at a central singularity?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I've seen Bouman's TED talk and couldn't quite understand.Can anyone help me better understand why we have confidence that this image isn't dictated by our expectations?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
