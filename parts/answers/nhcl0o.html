		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>mRNA is notoriously fragile and is the constant target of enzyme degradation within the cell cytoplasm.</p>
<p>It is certainly possible some of the vaccine LNPs will infect cells in immunologically privileged areas like the brain.  It's also possible some of those cells will begin to manufacture the protein coded by the vaccine mRNA (Spike protein) for a period of time.</p>
<p>This will probably result in a minuscule amount of Spike protein floating around for a while until it is degraded and until the mRNA is degraded.</p>
<p>In addition to this, cells that absorb the mRNA and express its translated protein fragments are also targets, this time from the immune response.</p>
<p>The LNPs themselves are naturally degraded as well.</p>
<p>So one of the most elegant aspects of these mRNA vaccines is that they present something to the body and then vanish.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The brain has resident immune cells called microglia with receptors for mRNA that will chew the stuff up. In the case that the liposomes enter non-immune cells we should expect a little bit of neuroinflammation should the mRNA get translated. Again, the microglia will go ahead and chew up whatever was made that shouldn't be there.</p>
<p>The body has many dedicated methods for detecting and breaking down free floating RNA and proteins via the immune system. </p>
<p>Not sure what you mean by NLPs however.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're probably taken up by any cell they can get into, which will be most of them with varying degrees of efficiency, via endocytosis. In the endosome the LNP changes its structure; some of the RNA escapes into the cytosol to be translated into spike proteins. Which means that some of your neurons will probably express spike proteins for a day or two. The RNA will be degraded within about a day, and the spike proteins on the cell surface will hang around there until they're recycled/degraded like other membrane proteins - probably a few days.</p>
<p>The lipids are a bit complicated. Part of the LNP is natural (cholesterol for example) and found in normal membranes. No problem there. Part of the LNP is synthetic; an ionizable lipid is the most important piece. This essentially consists of a head and a tail; the tail is found in other macromolecules like membranes. The head is usually a novel creation and responsible for most of the toxicity. When it's attached to a lipid tail, it becomes very hard for the body to process because it is not water soluble. Modern lipids generally have weak points between the head and tail where the head can be removed by cellular enzymes, therefore making it water soluble and easy for the body to flush out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Disclaimer: This is just a guess, but I have written a review paper on SARS CoV-2 spike protein interactions with the cell (for class tho, not peer-reviewed). I have a B.S. in biochemistry and molecular biology.</p>
<p>LNP’s deliver mRNA into cells by fusing spontaneously with cell’s plasma membranes. This means that the LNP’s become part of the plasma membrane. Once the mRNA is inside the cell it either:</p>
<p>1) denatures spontaneously (mRNA falls apart really quickly in the body relative to DNA)</p>
<p>2) is actively destroyed by lysosomes</p>
<p>3) is translated by ribosomes in the host cell to create a mature SARS CoV-2 spike protein</p>
<p>The spike protein may then be destroyed by lysosomes within the cell, or may be exported from the cell. If it gets to the point that a spike is outside of the cell the mRNA vaccine is working!</p>
<p>Some of the spikes will get destroyed in the host’s innate immune response, others will be tagged with antibodies destroyed by the host’s adaptive immune response.</p>
<p>Once they’re outside of the cell the spike proteins may bind their receptor protein (called ACE2) and will just stick to that protein. There’s a lot of ACE2 on brain cells, and it’s mainly known for regulating blood pressure. Kind of like trying to walk when there’s a kid clinging on your leg like a koala, ACE2 is less effective when it’s bound to the spike protein. It makes sense to assume your brain could have a little bit of difficulty regulating blood pressure.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting though that there’s huge systems of signaling molecules that regulate bodily functions, and the important ones are super bioavailable. This is why even though everything I’ve said above is true, people are generally having safe reactions to the vaccines.</p>
<p>Let me know your thoughts on this or if you disagree :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
