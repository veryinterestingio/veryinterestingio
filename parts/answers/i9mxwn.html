		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those are animation cels. Rather than have the animator draw the background for each frame, they instead have one background sheet, and then a series of celluloid sheets with the movements of foreground objects.</p>
<p>Because of the different techniques for creating celluloid sheets, colour matching between the background and foreground was not perfect. This is why you can tell when something is going to be a moving object based on its colours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://youtu.be/il8bP4ZS4Vc" target="_blank">video of how animation cels were made</a></p>
<p>Painting starts at around 4min.</p>
<p>The difference materials alone makes it difficult to match perfectly. Often the cel is shiny while the backbrounds are matte  paintings.  Also for the purpose of consistency and speed, cels are often painted in broad, flat color blocks, which can contrast the more painterly backgrounds.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as someone in the video mentioned, the animated subject is often made to stand out on purpose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cartoon animation frames used to be drawn on clear sheets of celluloid. To save on time and labor, background illustrations, including any objects that arent moving, would remain unchanged with any action/movement being drawn onto higher layers.</p>
<p>When part of a stationary object moves, the drawings are on a different layer above the rest of the object. Light travels through the layers above the object <em>twice</em> before it reaches the camera doubling the amount of interference from the only <em>nearly</em> transparent celluloid. Thus, even when using the same color paint, objects with the same color will look like a more color saturated hue the further down the stack they are, and top layers will look lighter or washed out by comparison.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
