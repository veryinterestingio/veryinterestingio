		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, the percentages your phone shows you are not the absolute percentages for the battery.  There's a safety margin on both ends to keep it in the happier zone.</p>
<p>Lithium Ion batteries suffer at ultra low charge levels.  It relies on a reversible chemical reaction that builds up material on the ends when its discharging and puts it back into the liquid when its charging.  Every charge cycle some of the material builds up on the ends permanently and doesn't return to solution which cuts into your battery life, if you bring the battery charge too low it builds up more.  If you bring it too low it can drop below a critical voltage where it can never be recharged again, this is why your phone doesn't let your battery get to within 10% of its <em>real</em> charge level, the reported 0% charge isn't 0% real charge.</p>
<p>Overcharging is another risk because the battery will begin to heat up because there's no chemicals left to store the power in so it just turns it into heat.  Battery powered devices have charge controllers on board that will cut off the charging so you don't have to worry about this.</p>
<p>For the most part, people with wayyyy better information about the specific quirks of your battery have already designed a good battery management system for it so you don't need to worry as much.  Your phone is actually happiest when the battery is at 100% and on the charger because it cuts power to the battery and just runs off the charger power so hours spent like this are hours that aren't going up and down using up charge cycles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The engineering details of it are complicated (and beyond me) but basically, completely discharging a Li-ion battery puts extra strain on the materials inside, increasing the rate at which the battery naturally loses capacity over time. In fact, your phone is designed to prevent the battery from <em>completely</em> discharging, because doing so irreversibly changes the internal chemistry, meaning the battery can no longer be recharged.</p>
<p>As for overcharging, this is not so much an issue these days. Phones and adapters have gotten &quot;smarter&quot; and will usually charge your phone up the optimum level, then stop charging, wait until it drains a little, then let a little power trickle in until it's full again. This managed way of charging puts very little strain on your battery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lithium batteries have a number of charge wear cycles.  The first and last 15% or so charge cause the most wear.  So charging from say 20% to 70% twice would cause less wear on the battery than charging 0%-100% even though both examples should be the same watt hours.</p>
<p>Slow charging is also better for the battery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can absolutely do that with your smartphone. It has a tiny computer that runs the battery and keeps it healthy. It is more like the parent at the door telling a kid’s friends that their kid is going to bed even though they aren’t actually in bed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Having the state of charge close to 100% or to 0% stresses the battery, and causes the chemicals to slowly degrade which adds up over time to result in shorter battery life. This is different than the &quot;memory effect&quot; of older batteries where you had to fully discharge them each time. A bigger effect that causes lithium batteries to degrade though is heat, both ambient temperature and heat from using it. That means that a lithium battery will lose a significant amount of capacity just by sitting on a shelf in ambient temperatures.</p>
<p>There are a few ways to increase lifespan of lithium batteries, but they mostly have tradeoffs. I have a laptop that came with a program that limits battery charging to 80% unless you enable more, which makes sense when the laptop is plugged in most of the time, but probably isn't useful for a phone. Many phones now come with a slow charging mode that activates at night which reduces heat by charging slower over a longer period of time, which helps slow the heat based degradation. </p>
<p>Since options for stopping capacity loss are pretty limited, I think the best solution is to buy a device with a battery bigger than what you need, so that when it loses 30% of its capacity over 3-5 years of use, then you still have enough capacity to get you through the day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
