		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Listen, I'm gonna be honest with you. You only need to unplug things for about 10 seconds, before you plug them back in. You can often speed things up by pressing the power button and holding it for 1-2 seconds (this closes the circuits to things like fans and power LEDs, allowing any energy in the capacitors to bleed off faster).</p>
<p>But when some mouth breather calls tech support complaining about their computer being frozen and the poor schmuck on the other end has already had a half-dozen arguments that day with callers who insist upon pulling the plug out half a millimeter and then slamming it back in as if the flow of electricity through the overworked circuits of their device was directly responsible for each sluggish, strained beat of their plaque-encrusted heart, all because the plug is &quot;too hard to get to&quot; after they shoved it under their desk behind a box of antique porn magazines...</p>
<p>Well, 30 seconds begins to sound like a nice, round number. Just long enough to keep them honest, but not long enough to encourage them to regale you with their political opinions or anecdotes about their various medical conditions while they wait.</p>
<p>Edit: fixed a word.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
