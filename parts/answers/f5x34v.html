		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to guess that this number came from something like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_reserves#Estimated_reserves_by_country" target="_blank">reserve/production ratio</a>, which is basically a projection of when oil reserves would be depleted. When considering estimates like this, it is important to understand the assumptions, specifically that (1) no new reserves are found, (2) there are no changes in what is functionally extractable from known reserves (i.e. a new technology which allows us to extract more oil from a given reserve), and (3) that consumption stays the same (or grows at some rate based on the recent past, depending on the exact estimate). It is likely that some, or perhaps all, of these assumptions are not valid so we should view reserve/production ratios with some caution in terms of a straight prediction of time to depletion.</p>
<p>There is a lot of nuance with respect to the predicted future of oil reserves, oil production, and/or demand for oil that has more to do with economics than geology. I would refer you to this <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/dur4qo/when_will_the_earth_run_out_of_oil/" target="_blank">thread</a> for a lot of discussion on this topic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The number is unknown and complicated by many factors</p>
<p>The first factor is cost. Most of the easy oil deposits have been found. New ones will get increasingly difficult and expensive to find. Once a field is found, the first oil comes out easily. After a while, the remaining bits get increasingly difficult and expensive to  recover</p>
<p>The most important factor today is climate change. A lot of money is moving out of the fossil fuel industry. This is partly due to environmental concerns, but mostly due to the decreasing cost of renewables</p>
<p>So, it's kinda like an asymptotic approach. There will always be oil to recover, but the cost will continue to increase while demand decreases</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>2018:</p>
<ul>
<li>Largest continuous oil and gas resource potential ever assessed in Texas/New Mexico - 46B barrels of oil and 281T cubic feet of natural gas and 20B barrels of natural gas liquids  </li>
</ul>
<p>2019:</p>
<ul>
<li>Russia:  1.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent (Bboe). That's the equivalent of 17T cubic feet of natural gas</li>
<li>Iran discovered 53B barrels in Dec 2019.</li>
<li>Exxon discovered 5-9 Trillion cubic feet of natural gas off the coast of Cyprus.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's only a few of a dozen or more examples. With more and more deep water exploration there will be more.</p>
<p>We should see a change in the number of years not only because of the discoveries, but reduction of consumption due to new technology. It all could be offset by increases in population and other factors. But as others have said here, as long as it remains profitable to find it, we will.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates in the Annual Energy Outlook 2020 that as of January 1, 2018, there were about 2,828.8 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of technically recoverable resources (TRR) of dry natural gas in the United States. Assuming the same annual rate of U.S. dry natural gas production in 2018 of about 30.6 Tcf, the United States has enough dry natural gas to last it about 92 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
