		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans are very bad at feeling temperature. Our nerves and brain cannot easily perceive absolute temperature like a thermometer does. We feel temperature by how quickly the receptors in our skin heat up or cool down. That is related to the material and the difference in temperature between it and your hand. </p>
<p>You can see an example of this by holding a plastic fork and a metal fork that has been sitting out for a couple hours. The metal fork will feel colder even though they are the same temperature. This is because the metal can transfer heat out of your skin much, much faster than the plastic fork can. This is the same reason why objects feel cold and the air may not. Air is an insulator and doesn't transfer heat very well when it is still.</p>
<p>So why do their hands feel cold? They are mostly water, which transfers heat pretty quickly compared to other objects in the room. There is also a mental part where your brain doesn't expect it to be that cold so they may feel colder than they would otherwise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On a side note:</p>
<p>From personal experience, you can actually turn the cold of your own appendages into a vicious cold cycle when trying to warm them up with your own body temperature.</p>
<p>I lived in a house with an uninsulated floor and no central heating for a while (just a wood stove), and the corner where I had my desk and worked (home office) didn't get much radiant heat from the stove. So my feet would get icy cold up to the ankles and stay that way until bedtime.</p>
<p>So on days when my partner wasn't around, when I went to bed I alternatingly pressed each of my feet onto the opposite thigh, attempting to warm them up, but only succeeded in cooling down my thighs, which made me feel even colder, only adding to the cold feet problem to the point where my entire lower legs were cold up to the knees. Eventually, I would have to get out of bed and warm my legs in front of the stove.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding to the heat sensation aspect, hands may sometimes actually be colder than the environment. Our skin exhudes moisture, which when evaporates lowers surface temperature, potentially below the ambient. Hands have a large surface area compared to their mass, and they are also typically more exposed. This means more evaporation and more cooling. Our hands are kept warm primarily by blood flowing into them. However, when we get cold, blood vessels constrict to avoid excessive heat loss, such as through the limbs. This makes it possible, in some situations, for hands to actually be colder than the environment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imaging sitting in a sauna. It's 100 degrees Celsius  (200  Fahrenheit ).</p>
<p>It's hot but you manage to sit in there for 15min.</p>
<p>Now imagine just putting your hand in some boiling water (100 oC / 200oF). Same temperature but you will scold yourself instantly.</p>
<p>This is going from air temperature to liquid temperature. A hand would much more of a difference since it is a solid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
