		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body's sense of hot/cold doesn't &quot;measure&quot; temperature, rather it measures heat transfer. Touch a piece of metal that's at 32°F and it feels a lot colder than a piece of wood at 32°F, even though they are at the same temperature. This is because metal is much better at conducting heat than wood.</p>
<p>It depends on how much heat is added or taken away to feel hot/cold. If what you touch pulls heat from your hand (something at a lower temperature) then you feel cold. If it adds heat to your hand (at a higher temperature) then it feels hot. Heat flows from hot to cold to reach an equilibrium temperature, never the other way. </p>
<p>So to answer your question, something will feel &quot;warm&quot; only if it is at a higher temperature than your hand, as its heat will then flow into your hand. (keep mind, your hand is probably less than your normal body temperature. That's how you can feel that your head or body is warm). How warm things feel depends on how good it is at conducting heat.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm gonna add some stuff now. I kinda ignored the effects of the body's generation of heat or long term effects, that just makes it a more complicated to understand heat transfer problem. I just focused on a simple case of touching something with a few fingers at a reasonable temperature, so the small amount of heat genereated in your hand can escape to the environment through the back of your hand or something and you don't need to consider it. It's different than soaking your entire body in 97°F water for hours. </p>
<p>This is the coolest fact I learned in Heat Transfer, and changed the way I understand simple interactions. A cool example I feel like sharing is when you are outside in the winter for a while and your hands get really cold. When you come inside and before you warm up, if you wash your hands the water feels extremely hot even though its the same comfortable temperature it's always been normally, but now the heat transfer is high because your hands are at a lower temperature. This highlights another cool fact about heat transfer, that you can't exceed the starting temperature of either object (Without adding work). If the water is room temp, it will only warm up your hand to room temp, so even though it feels as if the water is dangerously hot, it can't burn you. </p>
<p>This effect is exactly why wind chill is a thing. Wind chill is a &quot;fake&quot; temperature, that describes what your body feels like when there is wind. (Without getting to much into it, the higher speed a fluid travels the more heat it transfers, whether in or out). So if the air is at 10°F and the wind is blowing, the wind chill might be -20°F because the air feels colder as it pulls more heat from your body. Ultimately though, you can't cool anything down below the actual temperature of the air (10°F in this case) because if you did... Then heat will flow from the air to the object warming that object up, as again heat flows only from hot to cold. (a car left overnight in 0° temp will be 0° in the morning regardless of the wind chill). So wind chill just explains how quickly the air will pull heat from you and compares it to a temperature of stagnant air so you can get an idea, it doesn't mean the air temperature is actually lower than what it is.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah and some spelling. Oof.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on both the temperature and a material property called thermal conductivity - you can think of this as how quickly a material will change temperature in its surroundings. </p>
<p>For example, steel has a higher thermal conductivity than wood, so it “pulls” heat from its surroundings faster (if the air is warmer than the metal), or “pushes” heat into the surroundings faster (if the air is colder than the metal) than the wood. So if you were to touch both the steel and wood at the same temp, the metal would feel more extreme than the wood (if they’re both hot, the metal will feel hotter).</p>
<p>As for when things change between feeling hot and cold, this really only depends on the difference in temp between your fingertip and the material you’re touching. It’s hard to say exactly, because even though your body temp is 98.6F, your fingertip is obviously not at that temp.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your INTERNAL temperature is 37 degrees, and going over or under that by as little as 2 degrees can have disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>But your EXTERNAL temperature varies.  Your skin can go up or down quite a bit and not make a difference to your internal temperature.</p>
<p>So if you've just come inside on a cold winters day your skin will not be 37 degrees it will be colder, and if you immerse your hand in water that is 37 degrees it will feel warm.  The reverse would be true in summer.</p>
<p>There's other things.   Like for instance air is a good insulator, so a room that is 21 degrees feels comfortable.   But water feels comfortable at 33 degrees because it transfers heat a lot easier than air.  If the air is 33 degrees it would be oppressively hot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
