		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A question related to my research! YAY. So:</p>
<p>Acid rain is a result of several combustion products (i.e., sulfur dioxide, SO2, nitrous oxides, NOx) reacting in the atmosphere to form acid (i.e, sulfuric acid H2SO4, nitric acid HNO3). Acid rain isn't pure acid - it's usually regular rain with acidic molecules from these pollutants mixed in.</p>
<p>Sulfur dioxide is a common by-product from fossil fuel combustion, when the fossil fuels contain trace amounts of sulfur. Nitrous oxides are also common combustion by-products, and are primarily created from the nitrogen in the air reacting at high temperature conditions.</p>
<p>Coal combustion is probably one of the largest contributers to acid rain formation, but coal usage for electricity generation has declined substantially over the past few decades with renewable energy technologies (and natural gas) replacing it. Also, with the Clean Air Act and CAIR, NOx and SO2 emissions have been generally declining since the 90's. There are also all kinds of technologies these days to reduce SO2 and NOx emissions - low temperature combustion reduces NOx, sulfur scrubbing can reduce SO2, so it's not as much of a concern going forward compared to other pollutants and carbon dioxide emissions levels.</p>
<p>Edit: to answer the question, it is not so much of a concern as it used to be, at least in the US. I'm not really aware of the status of acid rain in other countries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>yes and no.  The severity of the problem has been reduced a lot because of air emission rules limiting discharge of acid-forming gases (sulfur and nitrogen oxides are the main problem).  Restrictions such as requiring the use of &quot;clean coal&quot; (low sulfur coal) or use of air scrubbers for discharge stacks have resulted in significant decreases in total discharges of acid-forming compounds, and thus the precipitation is less acidic.  There is still some man-caused acidity that is mostly a problem in the northeast, but it is a lot less severe than it was only a couple decades ago. </p>
<p>It isn't gone, just no longer really bad and getting worse. Unless you live in China.  It is getting worse there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here in NY growing up this was a huge issue in the Adirondack mountains.  To the point it was killing off lakes.  The issue here was caused in a big part from pollution from Canadian coal plants.  I'm 41 now and the dead lakes were a huge issue when I was I kid.  By the time I went up.there for my limnology class the lakes were a lot better.  This was around 2007.  We did water sampling on a couple that were dead and came back.  The samples we took had all.indications of a relatively healthy lake.  The  pH was still a little off but it was a productive lake.  The state had to work with the Canadian government and do alot of work to bring them back though.  As I understand it now the pH of the rain is still a little off but nothing like what it was.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
