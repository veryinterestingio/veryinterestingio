		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The concept you're referring to is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoperiodism" target="_blank">Photoperiodism</a>  </p>
<p>Depends on the plant, and the phase of growth that plant is in. Some plants do just fine with 24/7 light and can benefit from no darkness.  </p>
<p>Other plants, particularly those that flower in the fall, are dependent on changing day/light periods to trigger blooming.   </p>
<p>Many of those plants will still be fine under 24/7 light but will stay in a vegetative state, growing, but not producing fruit or flowers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An additional point for clarification: many of you may remember hearing about the light and dark reactions of photosynthesis, but these are now commonly referred to as light dependent and light independent reactions. These two crucial sets of reactions can both operate during exposure to light, so at least in this sense, plants are fine. Just wanted to share just in case that's in the back of the mind of anybody who hasn't had a biology class in a while</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak for terrestrial plants, but I do know that for underwater plants there is a need for lowlight periods. Lowlight periods help replenish co2 levels within the water and allow the plants to flourish. For all planted aquariums, a fair portion of the co2 will be depleted by midday, which is why a lot of planted aquariums will opt for short 8 hour day cycles. Any more than that and there would be diminishing returns on plant growth. For non co2 injected aquariums, you can go for a longer 12 hour day by having a short 2-3 hour rest period midday. This rest actually allows co2 levels to rise to almost early morning levels, and the longer day hours helps promote stronger plant growth by imitating summer daylight hours. A shorter light cycle makes the plants believe it is winter and slows overall growth. Co2 injections and fertalizers can get away with shorter hours as the plants are already on an accelerated growth cycle due to the added stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Marijuana is an interesting example. Growers have traditionally used many different vegetative growth routines of 24 hrs on(or less) and then a variable schedule of 12ish hours on 12ish hours off and many variables on that when they are ready to flower. Now they have genetically bred &quot;autoflowers&quot; that don't respond in the same way. It is interesting, but in general you can manipulate it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You really can't lump all plants together even different cultivars of the same species can react differently to light.</p>
<p>I can grow some cherry tomatoes under 24 hour lighting and get them to produce fruit just fine. Some cultivars like &quot;Super Sweet 100&quot; will have blossom drop under 24 hour lighting.</p>
<p>Some bean cultivars like &quot;Kentucky Wonder&quot; will initially produce beans under 24 hour lighting but only for a few weeks before a darkness critical period is required.</p>
<p>When it comes to light sensitive proteins, which is what we are talking about, the only way to know for sure is to do the test because there are unpredictable protein downstream effects.</p>
<p>Here is a meta study on 24 hour lighting but keep in mind that even in this study different cultivars are being lumped together.</p>
