		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For me, the simplest way to explain it is that experimentally, we have measured the speed of light to be always the same value - 3 x 10^8 m/s, otherwise known as c. What does that mean?</p>
<p>It means that if you shoot a beam of light, it will always be traveling away from you at c. Even if you have a rocket ship, and manage to reach 1/2 the speed of light compared to where you started, the beam of light will still be traveling away from you at the exact same speed. Other weird stuff happens (time dilation, etc), but all of special relativity can be derived from the <em>experimental result</em> that the speed of light in a vacuum is always the same.</p>
<p>The short answer is, no matter how fast you go to try to catch up with it, light will always travel away from you at the same speed, and therefore you cannot ever catch up to a beam of light. That is why you, and also everything else, cannot travel faster than the speed of light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I like to think of it as a property rather than mere velocity. Being devoid of mass, it is a property of matter to travel through space at C which we define as the speed of light. As you cannot reduce the mass of a massless object, you cannot accelerate it any further, thus C is the upper limit of travel set by the laws of physics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even if it doesn't capture all the underlying physical concepts and is not strictly the &quot;correct&quot;  description, I think a simple and useful way to think about it is in terms of inertia.</p>
<p>Inertia is a measure of how difficult it is to change an object's velocity. For objects moving in a straight line it is simply the mass. This is capture by the most basic equation in physics F=ma. In words this tells us the more massive something is the harder you have to push it to speed it up by some amount.</p>
<p>Now following this equation you can already see a particle of light (photon) is special. Light is massless and therefore accelerating it (changing its speed) leads to nonsense a=F/0 -&gt; undefined/indeterminant. Even though this is nonsense I think it  intuitively leads people to the following correct conlusions without thinking about the more complicated (but often more informative) wave nature of light.</p>
<ol>
<li>Because light has no mass to restrict it's motion it moves as fast as universally possible.</li>
<li>Because light can't be classically accelerated its speed is constant.</li>
</ol>
<p>I like this because it also leads one to conclude all things that are massless move at the speed of light, which is correct! Light, gluons and gravitational waves are all massless and all move constantly at the speed of light.</p>
<p>Once we accept that light moves as fast as possible that means something must be missing from F=ma or else we could accelerate a mass pass that speed if we simply push hard enough. What is missing is that the mass should in fact be the relativistic mass. The relativistic mass tells us that as you approach the speed of light it will feel like you are taking on more mass. In fact you will start increasing your effective mass at such a rate that you will need to push infinitely hard to reach the speed of light, making the task impossible.</p>
<p>Hopefully this approach by inertia offers some clarity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
