For example, dopamine is secreted when you are looking for a funny post, not when you actually find it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a nutshell, a lot of what we do and what we plan for is governed by two parts of our brains and the functions they’re wired to handle. </p>
<p>Our limbic system: raw emotional processing, flight or fight, the urges for food/sex/sleep, generally seeking pleasure and avoiding pain (dopamine), etc.</p>
<p>Our prefrontal cortex: higher learning, planning and goal-setting, consequence recognition, morality, meta-cognition, etc. </p>
<p>Throughout much of early human evolution, we really only needed to rely on the limbic system and its basic urges in our daily lives. </p>
<p>As humans and their brains evolved though, the prefrontal cortex allowed us to set goals and create civilizations in which skyscrapers, literature, app development, and Olympic gold medals are all possible. </p>
<p>The problem is, our brains are still largely wired to just eat/sleep/fuck (seek pleasure/dopamine) and generally steer clear of anything that causes stress or discomfort (avoid pain) including hard work that might benefit us in the future. </p>
<p>I’ve recently been listening to the audiobook of Peter Hollins’ <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48563927-neuro-discipline" target="_blank">Neuro-Discipline: Everyday Neuroscience for Self-Discipline</a> which covers this topic and explains it a lot better than I can. Give me a minute and I’ll upload a copy of it if you’d like to check it out.</p>
<p>EDIT: Here’s a download link for that audiobook in .m4b format. I found it interesting and helpful.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best explanation I ever read about procrastination is “Why procrastinators procrastinate” from the blog Wait But Why (<a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html" target="_blank">https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html</a>) and the follow-up post “How to beat procrastination” (<a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/how-to-beat-procrastination.html" target="_blank">https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/how-to-beat-procrastination.html</a>)</p>
<p>I’m not sure how scientifically correct that explanation is, but it’s explained in a really intuitive way (at a level suitable for ELI5) that helped me take control of my own procrastination (in my case made extra hard by ADHD) and do something about it. There are still days when it’s tough, but I now have the strategies to do the things that matter the most to me on time. It’s exhausting to compensate my ADHD, so I can’t do it for everything, but I’m glad I can do it now when it really matters instead of feeling like a helpless victim against the procrastination.</p>
<p>The things you do while procrastinating are not really fun, they’re just a way of your mind to distract you from the pressing things that actually need to get done. Anything feels more fun than focussing on the fact that you have a hard task ahead, but even fun things are not fun if you’re doing them while you have the feeling that you should be doing something else in the back of your mind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
