		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your chest is not actually shrinking (thank god). But it's not just 'in your head'.</p>
<p>The feeling comes from a bunch of muscles contracting rapidly (most notably your heart) as well as your breathing ascelerating rapidly (aka your lungs going into overdrive). It's essentially your body going into (often contextually unnecicary) 'fight or flight' action mode but without the apropriate routine what to actually do.</p>
<p>That's why slowing/focusing on your breathing often helps. You force your body out of that 'action mode' and actively tell your lungs to stop overreacting ðŸ˜‰</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anxiety disorders in a simplistic explanation is your body going through a flight or fight response unnecessarily. Your sympathetic nervous system is involuntary and determines the necessity of Adrenalin in your system (which causes the fight or flight response when youâ€™re in danger). So when you get a panic attack, your nervous system is flooding your body with Adrenalin, which causes your heart rate to raise and your respiratory frequency to increase,and thatâ€™s when your chest will tighten up</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Panic attacks typically induce shallow breathing, so your chest muscles get tight with the faster and more frequent contractions. This is why belly breathing is the #1 thing to do during a panic attack.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of these answers are quite vague so I can add a little context for anyone who is interested. When you enter the fight or flight response, many things happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>You hyperventilate. This causes a large reduction in carbon dioxide previously dissolved in your blood. Since CO2 is an acid, this actually raises the pH of your blood. The relative lack of H+ causes the calcium in your blood to take its place on a protein called albumin, which ends up essentially causing a false low calcium level. This is one reason why you can have muscle, tightening, twitching, etc.</li>
<li>Because of the effects of epinephrine (adrenaline) that is released by the adrenal glands during the stress response, blood becomes shunted away from your internal organs and more towards your muscles. This could explain why we develop the 'pit' in our stomachs and feeling like our hearts are in our throats.</li>
<li>The adrenaline released by the adrenals also causes tachycardia, or a fast heart rate. This increase in cardiac output may also contribute to a strange feeling in the thorax.</li>
<li>Interestingly, the adrenaline also acts as a bronchodilator, which means your airways actually increase their caliber during the response. So the fact that people feel like they cannot breathe during a panic attack could very well be psychological.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Long GAD sufferer here. I've never felt the anxiety in my chest, I always feel it in my stomach. It's not a stomachache per say but it feels worse and the discomfort/pain irradiates all over. It's interesting to see how anxiety affects everyone in a different way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
