		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All pain is a warning of damage. Basically the pain you feel is a warning that your retina is receiving too much light and the sensory overload could fry your nerves. Your iris will constrict quickly, which is uncomfortable and plays into the pain response, but the basis of it is your body screaming &quot; hey, we evolved this really sick organ, but its sensitive as hell so take care of it&quot;. The pain is just an impulse warning and the fact that your eyes completely bypass your spine means that it's basically instant. There's none of that toe-stubbing wait. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The photoreceptors are connected to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). One way the retina adjusts the gain from the light signal is by having the RPE &quot;munch&quot; on the photoreceptor outer segment  (the portion that has the machinery for phototransduction). In the light, the RPE will reduce the length of the photoreceptor and reduce the gain of the signal. When you're acclimating to the dark, the RPE will reduce it's munching which lets the photoreceptors get longer and more sensitive to light.</p>
<p>So when you get up in the morning and turn on the lights, bright light is hitting more photosensitive receptors. The gain is higher so a normally innocuous stimulus becomes too much.</p>
<p>I'm less familiar with mechanisms of gain downstream of the retina.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what you mean as &quot;too bright,&quot; because you're asking several separate questions here: 1. what determines whether something is too bright? 2. what is/are the pathways that luminance data take in the visual system? 3. where does the pain associated with sharp increases of luminance originate?</p>
<p>I only study information processing in relation to social cognition, so I'll just answer what I can about #1. Pupillary constriction occurs in response to increased luminance. (I don't know the actual ratio or function here, and I imagine that information is probably a little more in the weeds than you want anyway.) This is a reflex that happens before perception and well before there's any semantic value assigned (like conscious thought: &quot;ouch, this light is too bright&quot;). It's a parasympathetic response, but with all visual processing (however shallow) this journey starts with the photoreceptors and ganglion cells in the eye.</p>
<p><em>What</em> the light is too bright for is perhaps an ill-posed question. It's likely several entangled things at once. The human being is a dynamic system. In one sense, it's too bright for the pupil, as light can be damaging to the optical machinery. At another sense, it's too bright for an organism whose goals of survival require the constant surveillance of its surroundings; without constricting and dilating our pupils, the visual data we get is going to be poor. So that's to say, just because it's a parasympathetic response doesn't mean the response is <em>just</em> tied to &quot;protecting&quot; our eyes' machinery.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to my optometrist, who I asked of this once (only a few weeks ago, coincidentally), it's the smooth muscles in your eye contracting too quickly, in order to close the iris, this puts a strain on them they don't normally undergo. Thus some pain. </p>
<p>It doesn't happen in reverse because it's the same muscles relaxing to open the iris.</p>
<p>He also told me that for all intents and purposes, the pain isn't a result of damage. But that it's possible the light that triggered it could be damaging. Also that some light isn't visible but can be damaging, like large amounts of IR or UV, and won't trigger this response, or for you to close your eyes until it's too late. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally your pupil is dilated a great deal after sleeping and when too much light enters through the pupil the ciliary body, which is responsible for the iris opening and closing and for compressing the lens of your eye, contracts really quickly, almost like a spasm, and that’s effectively the thing that hurts, in tandem with your retina receiving too much light all at once, which leads to transient retinopathy in the situation you described. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
