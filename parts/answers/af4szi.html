		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After we eat, the stomach and intestines dilate and expands, which trigger this reflex called the gastrocolic reflex - where basically ur intestines increase bowel movement to empty any food you had before to make space for the food you just ate. Furthermore, certain food like spicy food increase gastric emptying, which increases bowel movements even further :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When your stomach or intestines recognize something is very wrong, certain signals get sent out that result in your body flooding your digestive track with water to flush out whatever is in there as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Think of a conveyor belt. There are all sorts of carefully controlled steps along the way that do one small task after another, so over the full length of the belt, the raw material (food) is slowly turned into the product (stool) bit by bit.</p>
<p>Now imagine someone pukes on the conveyor belt. You can't just stop the belt and clean that one spot, what if there's a bit of puke somewhere you can't see? No, you've gotta clean the whole thing, so you ramp up the speed, spray it down with water and stuff, and stick a big ol trash can (toilet) under the end of the conveyor belt to collect all the wasted product and dirty water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Digestion only takes 6-8 hours. When you eat food your body automatically triggers peristalsis, which just means your body tells your intestines to make room for what you are currently eating. So if you eat a burrito and then 20 mins later have to go to the bathroom its not the burrito, its all the other stuff your body is getting rid of to prepare for the burrito.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
