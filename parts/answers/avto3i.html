		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Top comments are talking about nerves in your stomach which do exist, but are not the source of this feeling.</p>
<p>It's a surge of adrenaline/epinephrine released from your adrenal glands as part of the sympathetic nervous systems &quot;fight or flight&quot; response.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>True ELI5 answer: you stomach has the same things that your brain has for <em>feelings</em> when people say “I have a feeling in my gut” it’s because you can actually have feelings that feel like they’re coming from your gut. </p>
<p>Slightly More advanced answer: look up “stomach based nerves” or even “scientific answer for nervous feelings in stomach” your body actually expresses emotional responses physically in your gut. Definitely some interesting evolutionary advantages, your brain wants you to feel the same way about a scary/dangerous situation as you do with eating something dangerous. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe it has something to do with the vagus nerve, one of the 12 pairs of cranial nerves. It starts in the brainstem and travels down the neck, chest and abdomen all the way down to the colon. It has a variety of functions, but to keep it simple, primarily it is known to maintain heart rate, digestion and blood pressure. My guess is when you experience something that causes the &quot;butterflies in the stomach&quot; sensation, whether good (seeing your crush or someone you like) or bad (that feeling when your parents called you by your full name and your stomach drops), there is something going on with the vagus nerve. I'm not sure exactly, but I am thinking there is an abrupt, although miniscule, change in your blood pressure and/or heart rate and since since the vagus nerve runs through your guts, we pick up on it with our stomachs.</p>
<p>I am not a doctor. I teach anatomy and physiology so my knowledge is limited and this is just  a 100% guess based on what I know.</p>
