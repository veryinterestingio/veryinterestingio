		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fetuses are asleep almost all the time until third trimester, when they’re awake 2-3 hours per day. It’s unrelated to mom’s sleep, although people think it is because they notice their movement more when laying down and trying to sleep.</p>
<p>Edit - since this post became popular, I’ll add some info. </p>
<p>Fetuses rapidly cycle between active states. We don’t know if that is sleep as we experience it, but they have REM activity like adults do when they sleep so it’s possible. </p>
<p>Unlike adults, it is believed that they don’t have the muscle inhibition during REM that prevents movement, and therefore they move a lot in their REM phases. </p>
<p><a href="https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1113/JP275084" target="_blank">Here </a> is an article that shows REM like patterns (actually the most active active state) occur in &lt;6% of the time in 3rd trimester fetuses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This monitoring is used to check the health of the fetus and is done after 26 weeks. There will be occasions where the foetus is awake for longer towards the third trimester and a general pattern will form. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We talked about this in a developmental psychology lecture about half a year ago.
Afaik the fetus needs movement to develop its balance (which, in the beginning of developing a brain is one of the most important parts) therefore as long as the mother is moving and doing stuff the fetus doesnt move as much. But when the mother lies down to sleep the fetus starts moving.</p>
<p>In the last few months the activity levels drop significantly though (probably because there isnt enough space to move anymore and the brain has developed what it needs)</p>
<p>There was a graph somewhere, ill see if i can find it, wait.</p>
