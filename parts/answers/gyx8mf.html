		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are any of you at all worried about the huge output of data science &quot;boot camps&quot;?</p>
<p>It seems to me that an exceeding number of people come out &quot;knowing&quot; how to do statistics, meaning they can use code to test data but without having a deeper understanding of the limitations of using statistical approaches to describe the world around them.</p>
<p>Any thought on the value and risk of building a society where we are arming people with statistical testing without giving them the purchase of the theoretical or even ethical way to use these techniques?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, Ph.D candidate in Probability and statistics here, about to defend in two months. What do you think about the lack of theoritical knowledge in the data science/engineering field? I feel like more and more data engineers are basically programmers who know how to use libraries, but not the underlying theories behind. And same goes for machine learning on a lesser scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd really like to work as a statistician, however my education goes up to an ABD in applied psychology/psychometrics. Employers don't seem to believe there's any overlap at all but my personal experience differs. What kinds of actions (degree, certs, work portfolio) would be best for increasing both my visibility and experience with the field?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
