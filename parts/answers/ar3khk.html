		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heyy, a topic I am very qualified to answer! I did my PhD on developing isotopic tracers of salinity in the environment. I mostly focused on very saline brines from deep shale formations, but one of the major players that we were investigating just before I graduated was the 'salinization syndrome' in north america. 'Anthropogenic salt inputs' are destabilizing the salinity of north american waters, leading to loss of species diversity of both plants and animals, and in the not-so-distant future, the loss of our freshwater resources as easily-treated drinking water supplies! </p>
<p>Anthropogenic salt inputs includes road salting, agricultural runoff, industrial and municipal wastewater, and the dissolution of concrete. All these things are not only increasing total dissolved solids (TDS, basically all ions in solution) in rivers but also increasing the pH. </p>
<p>The reality is it has vast, broad-reaching consequences that scientists are only now starting to really identify. Here are two papers published in PNAS from Gene Lykens progeny. Sujay Kaushal is the real expert on this topic. </p>
<p>Huh our rivers keep getting saltier...</p>

<p>Damn, this is going to be a problem for drinking water and agriculture..</p>

<p>Oh shit, this is a real continental problem!</p>

<p>EDIT: also, if you live in Pennsylvania near oil and gas development, talk to your county about what they do about dust suppression in the summer. If you live near the Allegheny River, talk to your county about wastwater disposal into the river. Oil and gas brines are often in excess of 150,000 mg/L TDS, and they are discharged through 'treatment' facilities and spread on roads as dust suppressants. For reference, seawater is around 30,000 mg/L TDS. Did I forget to mention the brines are also pretty radioactive? Oh yeah they also have high metal concentrations in case they weren't nasty enough. Yes, yes I know they also have some nasty organics lingering as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Seattle and Portland have actually found that this is a huge problem. Salmon return to the same area every year to make babies, and they guide themselves by the gradient of salt to fresh water as they move upstream. When there is too much salt from the roads, they get lost and spawn in the wrong place so their babies die too, leading to population decline, which is obviously terrible for the salmon industry. </p>
<p>AFAIK they use some non salt alternatives that donâ€™t work as well to protect the salmon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I attended a seminar on this. After winter storms, salinity can spike in stream reaches, and temporarily become fatal to the life there. Additionally, after a while the salinity spike dissipates, but each year, the baseline salinity rises.</p>
<p>They still didn't know or understand much about the long term effects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I live in northern BC, Canada, and we have a problem with moose getting too close and into roads to lick the salt. I guess they lick mineral deposits in the winter for some reason, and road salt is just as tasty?  Causes accidents, endangers people and wildlife, etc. Not sure if they still use the salt or just sand now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Soil chemistry depends on cations.  Salts bind strongly to cation attraction sites in soil, by knocking off nutrients and places where future nutrients can later attach.  Thus the soil becomes void of nutrients, and loses the ability to gain nutrients in the future.  Salts also pull and bind to moisture.  Either pulling moisture out of roots, fungi, or preventing new moisture from being absorbed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
