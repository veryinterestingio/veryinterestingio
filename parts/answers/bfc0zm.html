		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's absorbed into your epidermis which is a layer of dead skin cells, and reflects UV rays from there.  Trace amounts *might* make it as deep as your capillaries if you're regularly using copious sunscreen, but your Kidneys will, in general, make short work of those traces and it will be expelled in your urine.  Most of it eventually wears off through water, sweat or friction as your skin cells shed off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Piggybacking on this - if I was to apply sunscreen and then remain inside - no sun exposure, no sweat - until it says it’s time to reapply... do I need to reapply?  Or is it sitting there “unused” in that instance?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, your body will absorb it - I can tell when summer hits, as I start seeing DEET (from mosquito repellents) and oxybenzone  (sunscreen) in forensic samples, eg blood and urine. </p>
<p>The body will metabolize oxybenzone into DHB and THB for example, although I don't know if I've made a note of those, but I see oxybenzone for sure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, I’ve not come across anyone else who complained about this, but if I use a “chemical” sunscreen (ie- not zinc or titanium based) after about a half an hour, I can taste it.  I get an awful taste in my mouth.  Took me months to figure it out.  I’d put on sunscreen to go out for a bike ride and start having to suck on hard candies to mask the taste.  I do’t have the problem when I use the metallic blockers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
