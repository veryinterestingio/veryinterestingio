		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So many wrong answers on this thread!  The body doesn't &quot;perform a check&quot; that's just crazy town, and there's no &quot;erection hormone&quot;, and it's not testosterone.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's &quot;parasympathetic&quot; tone. Erections are a function of your parasympathetic nervous system, which is most active at night while you're sleeping. You actually have erections all night long, and are more likely to have one when you wake up.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Someone did correctly mention though, if you have erectile disfunction *and* never have &quot;morning wood&quot; then you likely have a severe medical condition that you need to get checked by a doctor.</p>

<p>Edit: Thanks so much for the awards. </p>
<p>A side note:</p>
<p>-Even though popular culture seems to suggest that the fight or flight response is associated with urination, it's actually the other way around.  The sympathetic system is responsible for filling of the bladder and it's the parasympathetic that empties it. As your bladder fills the stretch of the bladder wall sends signals to your CNS, and in return your CNS triggers parasympathetic tone to drain the bladder.   The increased parasympathetic tone triggered by your body to initiate micturition ($100k word for peeing) could also trigger an erection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
