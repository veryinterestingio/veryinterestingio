		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am writing a PhD thesis on the ocean response to tropical cyclones. Contrary to what some people have suggested here, the energy of cyclone (hurricane) winds powers ocean currents well over 100 meters below the ocean surface. This has been observed directly using autonomous ocean profilers that measure temperature, salinity and velocity at different depths:
<a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/2010JPO4313.1" target="_blank">https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/2010JPO4313.1</a></p>
<p>Now, the answer to your question varies according to what you consider &quot;deep sea.&quot; However, a particular process does come to mind that can reach down hundreds of meters deep and impact marine organisms: hurricanes power vertical currents that lift up water towards the surface.</p>
<p>If a hurricane's eye moves slowly (say 1m/s), water may be sucked up from 150 meters deep all the way up to the surface ([source]{<a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/2009MWR2863.1" target="_blank">https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/2009MWR2863.1</a>}). </p>
<p>However, if the hurricane moves much faster, it will create a large underwater wave: deep, cold water will be carried up and down by as much as 80 m and with a regular frequency in time. These are called near-inertial internal waves (NIWs) and they are an effect of the Earth's rotation. Across the global ocean, these waves help transport energy from the ocean surface towards deeper regions and thus play a role in shaping climate.</p>
<p>Now... These effects are mostly localized along the hurricane track, and are likely to be very weak to the sides of the track. This explains why a submarine could navigate &quot;below&quot; a hurricane and not have much trouble. However, a submarine navigating right below a hurricane eye is about to get into A LOT of trouble, as it's going to lose (to some extent) the ability to control its depth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Large storms like Dorian with high winds cause a mixing of the nutrient-poor surface layer with slightly deeper, nutrient-rich waters, bringing nitrogen, phosphorus and trace metals to the sunlit photic zone which can cause phytoplankton blooms and subsequent zooplankton blooms, which then attract larger predators like fish. </p>
<p>As for deep sea creatures on the ocean bottom? They canâ€™t feel the relatively shallow surface mixing caused by storms (disclaimer: does not apply to creatures in shallow coastal waters), the energy dissipates with depth and in any case the ocean is separated by density gradients between different layers of water that kind of act as barriers to mixing/energy transfer</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sea turtles can get into trouble. I used to work for a major aquarium that had a sea turtle clinic. After hurricanes we sometimes have sea turtles brought in that were found stranded, and they were always terribly battered. They actually can get bruises on their shells, deep bone bruises. I still have pics of a loggerhead that was found after Hurricane Sandy that was missing a flipper entirely (right front flipper was gone) and was covered with bruises - we think it got caught in the storm surge and was rolled against rocks. (It survived &amp; learned to swim pretty well with 3 flippers). Another time, we happened to have a satellite tag on a sea turtle that had been heading southish in the North Atlantic and we were tracking it just before a hurricane came unusually far north through that area. The day before the hurricane, the turtle turned around and made a beeline north, for Nova Scotia, which was the closest land, and it hunkered down in the lee shore of a protected cove, where it stayed through the whole storm. A few days later it came out again and resumed its original track. We all had the impression it had felt the hurricane coming and deliberately looked for a protected spot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
