		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ooh! Finally! A question I'm 100% qualified to answer!</p>
<p>ELI5; a radar is basically what you get when you put a radio on the Steve Rogers super serum. It detects and tracks targets by sending out a ridiculously powerful pulse of radio energy and listening for that energy bouncing off of an airplane and back to the source.</p>
<p>Now, any radio can be picked up by another radio, so modern fighters have antennas and receivers all over that will detect when a radar is targeting them, and alert the pilot.</p>
<p>Such a system of antennas is called a Radar Warning Receiver and is standard on any military aircraft. We even have specialized &quot;Anti-Radiation&quot; missiles that use the same principle to attack enemy SAM sites.</p>
<p>I'm an ex-Air Force avionics tech who's super passionate about this stuff. If you want a more in depth answer, or want to know anything else about modern avionics, hit me up, I'll talk your ear off! The cat-and-mouse game of engineers designing radars to avoid detection by RWRs, and engineers designing RWRs to detect these new radars is also an interesting subject</p>
<p>Edit: Oh sweet Jesus this blew up! I didn't know I'd be doing an AMA today lol. Don't worry, I'll get to all you guys, but it might take a bit lol.</p>
<p>And thanks for the awards, strangers! I appreciate it!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Say we’re playing flashlight tag in a dark room. I sweep the light around to see if I can find someone. When I do find someone, I hold the light on them. </p>
<p>It’s similar with radar. The plane can detect the difference between the searching radar and locked on radar.</p>
<hr />
<p>Alright, since there are complaints I didn't explain it thoroughly enough (even though this is ELI<strong>5</strong>, cmon), have some more. We'll call this an ELI10 on how somewhat older, purely radar systems work.</p>
<p>I'm it. I have three flashlights: white, blue, and green. </p>
<p>When searching for someone, I will sweep the white light around. When I find someone I will turn on my blue light and hold it on the person. I will then turn on and <em>throw</em> the green flashlight at them. If the green flashlight hits them, they lose.</p>
<p>Planes have radar systems onboard that can detect other radars being used against them. The different colors of light represent different types of radar: white for searching, blue for paintaing/locking, green for missile. Between the type and action of the 'enemy' radar, the plane's computers can guess what is going on. If the blue light is shining on you, that means someone sees you and is watching you closely. If you see a green light flying towards you, you should probably dodge it.</p>
<hr />
<p>Others have asked about infrared seeking missiles. Radar is still involved here to track the plane from the launch site. Once the missile is launched, there's no green light since the missile follows the heat from the engine, but the plane can use its own radar to detect the missile coming towards it. It is a fairly safe assumption that a small object approaching at very high speed is a hostile missile.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Radars that serve different purposes behave differently and use different frequency bands.</p>
<p>A search radar scans huge swaths of sky every few seconds. Good at covering a large area, but accuracy is fairly low. It can tell you &quot;There's somebody flying around over in this general area&quot;</p>
<p>Track radar is more specific. It scans a smaller piece of sky and scans much more frequently. It can tell you &quot;There's something roughly the size of a tactical bomber on X heading, at Y altitude, and Z speed&quot;</p>
<p>Fire-control radar scans a tiny piece of sky and does it many times a second. It says to the operator &quot;That's an F-15, it's got a big scratch in the paint, and the pilot's name is Mike. Wanna shove a missile up Mike's ass?&quot;</p>
<p>A sensor on the plane can detect what kind of radar is looking at it. When it sees a search beam it says &quot;Someone just swept a big search radar over us&quot;, when it sees a tracking radar it says &quot;Someone definitely knows we're here&quot; and when it sees a fire-control radar it starts screaming &quot;Oh shit Mike, we're fucked!&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They monitor radar signals that are hitting the jet. Plane radar is generally scanning over a larger area, but when targeting a missile the plane will begin to ping a specific area more frequently. The jet being targeted can detect that increased frequency and warns that the radar is &quot;locking on&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The missile is using a directed radar pulse to track the speed and direction of the target.</p>
<p>Unlike a generic sweeping radar that might pulse the plane every few seconds, this new signal is <em>furiously</em> pulsing the plane multiple times a second to continuously track it.</p>
<p>If an unknown radar frequency is rapidly blasting your plane, something malicious is tracking you.</p>
<p>If the radar source is itself moving rapidly across your own radar, it’s a missile or enemy aircraft.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
