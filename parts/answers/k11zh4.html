<p>You can bet your ass restaurants aren't standing over pots of risotto for half an hour every time someone orders it - they have various different half-done and no-stir versions that they just bring to a finished state quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I always just thought it was because you dont want to put too much in. You can always add more. I know stirring helps to make it  creamy (with a wooden spoon of course). Kind of the opposite with regular rice, where you dont want to touch it and break the grains.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Itâ€™s because properly cooked risotto, like pasta, should be <em>al dente</em>, at least according to Italian culinary tradition. As other commenters have said, the problem with adding all of the stock at once is that it makes it difficult to control the texture of the final product. </p>
<p>A well prepared risotto should be creamy but not gooey. Overcooked risotto will be gooey because too much of the grain has cooked away.  It should still have some texture to it, which is why Italian chefs will say it should be cooked to order.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Theoretically they could produce a automated risotto cooker or add a stir to those asian rice cookers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
