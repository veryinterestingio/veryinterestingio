		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually just over reporting your earnings. If you make a million dollars doing something illegal, but you claim it as profits for a business then that’s gunna look like clean money. Pablo Escobar, who was probably the worlds largest cocaine dealer at one point, officially ran the most profitable taxi company in the world at one point. </p>
<p>It might be suspicious if you actually look at it, but unless they can conclusively prove in court that you actually got the money illegally it doesn’t really matter if pretty much everyone knows it’s not really legal money. There’s also a lot of businesses out there, the IRS can’t monitor every single one and make sure they actually did all the business they claim to. It would take more manpower than would ever be practical.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have some store. Let's say the store makes 5000$ a month. You report earnings  as 7000$ instead of 5000$. You now have made that 2000$ &quot;clean.&quot; Repeat that over and over to make your illegally earned money seem like it was legally made. It is a process over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unless you have a million of dollars in dirty money to dispose of, it is usually as simple as making a series of cash deposits to your bank.  Money laundering is less about coming up with some ironclad scheme that will hold up under any scrutiny, it is more about not drawing attention to yourself.  If you are a typical seeming chap, you are most of the way there already.  </p>
<p>If you do have to wash a lot of money, the typical way is to open or invest in a business that does a lot of cash transactions.  Bars, clubs, and restaurants are common.  You keep sloppy records and slip the money into the till slowly over time and act like you earned it.  A few thousand non-existant people paying $15 covers adds up quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A traditional money laundry is any business that has the following traits:</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't seem unusual that most of their sales are in the form of cash.</li>
<li>The bulk of what they sell is labor or services, not goods, so it doesn't seem odd that they never spend much money on inventory or supplies.</li>
<li>They're in a line of work that's considered boring. Something nobody would be curious about if you saw that business open up  near you. Something not even vaguely controversial. Something  that doesn't attract government license offices  or inspectors or auditors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Traditional examples include car washes, laundromats, lawn services, movie theaters, pool halls, auto detailing businesses, and video arcades.</p>
<p>A racketeer opens such a business, or an honest businessman agrees (under duress or out of greed) to participate. From then on, the business reports the best  imaginable business, but not more than would seem plausible for their location. Covertly, large sums of cash enter the building. The money launderer skims enough off of the top to cover inescapable business expenses like mortgage or rent and just enough supplies to explain the sales. They also collect a small but reasonable cut to reimburse them for the risk they're taking and what little accounting work they do. The rest of the money goes back out  as &quot;payroll&quot; (to the people whose money it was) or as &quot;profits&quot; (to the &quot;investors&quot;  behind the owner).</p>
<p>In these degenerate times, the old money laundering rackets are scarcely needed. It's too easy to smuggle cash out of the country in bricks, deposit it in  bank accounts in countries that don't enforce international banking regulations, use those foreign bank accounts to buy expensive goods that can be imported duty-free &quot;for personal use&quot; like ridiculously expensive suits or artwork or luxury cars, or otherwise bring the money back into the country in the form of &quot;real estate investment&quot; in any market that doesn't have know-your-customer laws for real estate. Whenever cash is needed, simply auction the art or fashion or car or real estate or whatever.  All legal as church on Sunday.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
