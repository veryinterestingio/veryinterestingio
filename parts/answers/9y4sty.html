		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes! There's a lot of research going into tinnitus. The DOD funds a good portion of it (turns out loud explosions and artillery are destroying the hearing of our active troops and vets.)</p>
<p>I'm sure there are many groups working on this, but I know the Tzounopoulos group at the University of Pittsburgh is actively working on a drug to cure/prevent tinnitus. Not my area of expertise so I don't know the specifics of the project, but here is a link to his website. Some of his papers may be interesting to OP and anyone else looking for info. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tinnitus is often associated with noise-induced hearing loss, which is in turn caused by damage and death of hair cells in the cochlea. These cells are responsible for sensing vibrations and translating them to nerve signals to be sent to the brain. Once damaged or destroyed they cannot regenerate naturally. However several methods of inducing hair cell regeneration are currently under investigation, see <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5534485/" target="_blank">this review</a>.</p>
<p>EDIT: As you can tell from my flair I am not an expert on this topic and I've only done some cursory reading because I have mild tinnitus myself, I won't be able to answer any questions that I'm not familiar with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Gene therapy is being worked on by multiple research firms across the globe. The most notable being Frequency Therapeutics who have a drug currently in phase 1/2 of testing. It's called FX-322 and it's an injection into the eardrum. It works by regenerating the hair cells responsible for the conditions in the first place. If things go well, the drug could possibly be 5-6 years away from release. Research for hearing loss and tinnitus has picked up a lot momentum in the past couple of years due to increased funding from multiple companies and governments. The reason that it is so late is because until now, the mechanisms behind the ear and the brain were not understood very well. Now that research has caught up, multiple solutions are being worked on. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am not a doctor or scientist but have done extensive research, participated in Tinnitus groups, and had multiple well educated Audiologists and Otolaryngologists and was very fortunate to have them. These were people who attended conferences and were always staying ahead of the curve in understanding the research and trials available, in the pipeline, and being discussed.</p>
<p>Many doctors have also said the same thing and it seems to be consensus - without having tinnitus it is difficult to assess from the outside, and there have been many audiologists I have seen in other cities who I have had the opportunity to educate based on my experience. There is a limited number of people worldwide who are truly invested in this condition.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
<p>Tinnitus (tin-ih-tus) is a catchall used to describe hearing noise when there is no external source present. Common understanding always brings this discussion to two of the most basic causes - trauma or long term degradation.</p>
<p>Trauma can be a single external event, such as a gun firing, explosion, a crash, but could even be smaller things too. There is some consensus (but it is not a silver bullet) that a shot of prednisone into the ear OR a regimen of oral prednisone taken within 48 hours (24 hours or earlier preferably) can limit the damage of a severe auditory trauma.</p>
<p>Long term degradation is similar to trauma, but is the result of noises less than severe auditory trauma over the course of a lifetime.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>These are the best understood because they affect the most people - those who have had military service, and the elderly. These cases affect the vast majority of tinnitus users, but the severity of the tinnitus in a good portion of these is manageable and most likely monotone in nature. The movies you may have seen depict this kind of tinnitus very well, and you may have even experienced it yourself after a night out at a concert, bar etc only for it to slowly die down over the next few days.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>As others here have stated, there is work here that focuses on the idea that hair cell regeneration may be a positive factor in repairing the damage.</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p><strong>What is it</strong> <strong><em>really?</em></strong></p>
<p>Now to the more extensive understanding. Tinnitus is really a neurological issue, despite the cause. I know many are hopeful for the ear hair cell regeneration but this is not as promising to tinnitus in general as it seems.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>There are many other causes for Tinnitus - a side effect of medication, infection (not just ear, but viral infections in the brain), acoustic neuroma, Meniere's disease, blood vessel issues, muscular issues, TMJ, and others!</p>
<p>Due to tinnitus having many causes there are some treatments which affect others and which do not work for most. There is even a type of tinnitus which is objective and the doctor could actually hear the noise, this is from blood vessels and is called pulsating tinnitus.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Since tinnitus is so broad and there are many underlying factors, it is incredibly difficult to 'cure' as you would only be treating some specific types of tinnitus. The type of noise people hear, the frequency, severity, number of tones/pitches, the nature of the noise, etc are all very very different although the name tinnitus is used to describe all of these. This means that it is very hard to create an accurate sample of people to run tests on, as the description and type of tinnitus may be very unique for people, and is also dependent on subjective evaluation by the subjects themselves.</p>
<p>The nature of tinnitus is normally that it is not constant on every day and can change in severity, volume, frequency etc on a daily or hourly basis. Tracking progress on treatment can be hard due to this, and there are a lot of factors that <em>could</em> impact tinnitus such as stress (#1), diet, sleep, external factors like noise, and others.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p><strong>The good news</strong></p>
<p>The good news is there are promising steps being made to treat the neurological causes and factors of tinnitus. To understand research both past and present, a tremendous resource is <a href="https://www.tinnitustalk.com/forums/research-news.4/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.tinnitustalk.com/forums/research-news.4/" target="_blank">https://www.tinnitustalk.com/forums/research-news.4/</a></a> which is a collection of tinnitus sufferers who have had it for years or decades and stay very active in the community and do a ton of research as well as share experiences if they participate in trials.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>There have been many medications developed, all of which have failed at the second trial round usually, which attempt to address potassium channels that can lead to the reduction or elimination of tinnitus. There is some promise here but the majority of these medications treat another primary cause like seizures and the added effect on tinnitus is secondary which makes trials for those with tinnitus ineligible. There have also been many trials with different medications which you can clearly see on that TinnitusTalk research board.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Other attempts at solutions have involved treatments to the brain with magnetic or electrical stimulation to address the neuroplasticity of the brain. Many of these are new and again will never be a silver bullet but could be a general use to assist those who are eligible due to the potential for reduction or elimination. rTMS or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation was a hot button for a while, and there are other treatments that are always in the pipeline but require much time and are essentially unattainable for the near future.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p><strong>The even better news</strong></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Research here is growing exponentially, and we understand more every day.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p><strong>The bad news</strong></p>
<p>There is a massive lack of funding for research here though and also a very low potential for ROI for pharmaceutical companies due to potential medications not having enough people that the cost of research and manufacturing would far outweigh those who could be positively affected and need prescriptions. A good few promising companies have gone under and hold on to all their research and it has not been shared with the scientific community, halting a lot of progress in a potential search for treatment.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>If you're interested, <a href="https://tinnitustalk.com" target="_blank">tinnitustalk.com</a> is a fantastic resource which contains a lot of very knowledgeable individuals. Be careful as there are tons of differing opinions and take no one person's words as fact, <strong>INCLUDING MINE!</strong> Also, us tinnitians (as a lovely facebook group member called us) can be a very very angry bunch due to living in eternal hell day in and day out so there is some petty bickering that happens here.</p>
<p>The American Tinnitus Association <a href="https://www.ata.org" target="_blank">www.ata.org</a> is a GREAT resource, and <strong>PLEASE if you are shopping Amazon for Christmas try using the Smile program to donate to them!</strong> The British Tinnitus Association is also at the front of the global community too.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>​</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
<p>Nope we're in trouble. There are tons of programs in existence and being developed that work to manage tinnitus, but there is no 'cure' in sight, and there may never actually be one! Too many causes and difficulty in getting reliable data along with poor ROI for companies discourages research.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
