		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, with surface ships, it works out that a pointed edge cuts through the water but if you’re completely submerged, a teardrop shape is more efficient. It also makes acoustic detection harder. They’re called “<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teardrop_hull" target="_blank">teardrop hulls</a>” if you want to read more. Basically, early subs did use the pointy design like ships and rockets but extensive hydrodynamic testing showed it wasn’t the best shape underwater.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rounded shapes are far better able to withstand extreme pressure without breaking, which is a huge factor for a ship that relies upon being able to lurk deep under the waves.  If a submarine needs to crash dive and their hull isn't able to take the strain, the whole ship could implode violently and reduce itself to twisted metal and a thin organic paste that used to be the crew.</p>
<p>You could build on a cosmetic outer shell, but that brings you to the main point:</p>
<p>Speed is a useful attribute, but Submarines are VASTLY more concerned with being as silent as possible.  For subs, unnecessary noise of ANY form directly equals <strong><em>death</em></strong>.  Their hull shapes are the end result of immense amounts of design work and testing to produce the quietest ship possible, and a rounded hull that slips smoothly and <em>quietly</em> through the water must presumably be the best way to go.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A roundshape is actually better for reducing drag as well as other answers given. Points create eddies or vortexes which induces turbulent flow which increases drag. Thats why torpedoes have rounded fronts as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
