		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you looked at alcohol prohibition because I'm wondering how general the model is with respect to different drugs and different geographical distances.</p>

Perhaps it might give some insight on the demographics of the people involved so we might better transition them away from violent behavior when we grow some sense and abandon this disastrous policy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

What's the main factor that needs to be changed and what is the country doing wrong. I know your research is based on Central America, but Colombia is a very interesting data point, probably the most interesting one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
