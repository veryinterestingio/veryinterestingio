<p>there are people who don't have ad block and seeing a short ad is something people tolerate if they have to. many people on mobile dont have adblock and plenty of public computers dont have it either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Ad blindness&quot; is something large ad companies take in to consideration. Unfortunately, most clients of these companies don't. They all pay millions of dollars for you to directly ignore them. However.....</p>
<p>By directly ignoring brands, you are interacting with them, and by definition, create a successful impact on that customer.</p>
<p>You know the brand name, and unless you already have a deep seeded position against this company, the ad has had it's intended effect.</p>
<p>It's all subliminal such as repetitive actions are used for reinforced learning.  Regardless of your reaction, you are being trained that brand X does Y.   When you need Y, you will recall brand X. You will most likely buy.from brand X subconsciously because you were trained that Y provides X.</p>

<p>ELI5 Since we all HATE ads and tend to skip it or ignore it at best</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I work in marketing management, have been very successful in digital marketing and can start by telling you your proposition is based on an incorrect assumption. <em>Many</em> people <em>do</em> watch ads, and many click through; it's often a matter of the right person being hit with the right one, and across multiple channels. The better a company's targeting, the better an ad's likelihood of reaching the right target and being fully viewed. I have plenty of regional Youtube ad campaigns where full-view rate is <em>over 50%</em>. Some are 20%. Many are lower.</p>
<p>It's also important to remember that reddit is very counterculturalist from an internet use perspective, and commenters are a poor sample of the general population. They're also critical and adversely reactive to advertising, and naive enough to think it &quot;doesn't work&quot; on them. Redditors being vehemently anti-ad is a demographic and, moreso, psycographic phenomena.</p>
<p>Outside of that, think of that <em>one</em> time you finished an ad. That's what we look for. That <em>one</em> person of many at the tipping point for interest in the product out of hundreds. Now multiply that by millions of views and impressions.</p>
<p>TL;Dr We get the views, people watch ads more than you realize.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is operating under the general assumption that almost everybody ignores paid advertising, which is strictly untrue otherwise the industry would be dead.</p>
<p>People still do click on ads and make use of them even if you don't. If people thought ads were annoying whilst still being relevant now, I can't wait for their reaction when third-party cookies is entirely phased out and advertisers will no longer be able to target users at an individual level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It works in 2 different ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Even if only 1 in 100 people buy or purchase a product, that person unlocks a whole bunch of opportunities for other people to reach that product.</p>
</li>
<li>Think like this: if you get advertised charmin, you aren’t going to go out an buy charmin immediately. However, the next time you’re at the store needing toilet paper, what are you most likely going to choose? That’s how it works.</li>
