		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most plausible explanation I've read was from Steven Pinker in one of his books (can't remember which). I did find an <a href="https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2008/12/18/why-music" target="_blank">Economist article that has a good summary of it</a> though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The third hypothesis, though, is that music is not functional, and also that Dr Dunbar has got things backwards. Music did not lead to language, language led to music in what has turned out to be a glorious accidentâ€”what Stephen Jay Gould called a spandrel, by analogy with the functionless spaces between the arches of cathedrals that artists then fill with paintings. This is what Steven Pinker, a language theorist at Harvard, thinks. He once described music as auditory cheesecake and suggested that if it vanished from the species little else would change.</p>
<p>Dr Pinker's point is that, like real cheesecake, music sates an appetite that nature cannot. Human appetites for food evolved at a time when the sugar and fat which are the main ingredients of cheesecake were scarce. In the past, no one would ever have found enough of either of these energy-rich foods to become obese, so a strong desire to eat them evolved, together with little limit beyond a full stomach to stop people eating too much. So it is with music. A brain devoted to turning sound into meaning is tickled by an oversupply of tone, melody and rhythm. Singing is auditory masturbation to satisfy this craving. Playing musical instruments is auditory pornography. Both sate an appetite that is there beyond its strict biological need.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edit: I realized this quote doesn't fully address dancing. So part of it is rhythm and music is satisfying to the auditory/speech part of our brains. There's probably an analogous reward mechanism for moving perfectly. I think most athletes and dancers would attest to this. It just feels good when you're trying to do some complex movement and nail it. If I recall correctly, Pinker had a similar explanation for why we like geometric patterns (I specifically remember something about crisp lines being satisfying because it's an extra dose of the reward you get when your eyes focus correctly).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're 5 or younger:
Long ago people lived in caves or tents in forests. To keep tigers and Lions from killing them at night they would bang drums and make noise all night and move around a fire. When the tigers saw these shadows and the noise they thought some large animals were having a stampede like the one that killed Simba's dad. Meanwhile the other people and kids in the tribes slept inside the caves/tents. If the drumming stopped there was an attack. If the noise was chaotic, it could've been a real stampede or elephants. So it got saved in our brains that beats played in a rhythm is safe and soothing. Rhythmic beats equal to time to sleep. Silence/irregular beats means danger. Nowadays we don't have to worry about tigers eating us or elephants stamping us to death in our sleep. We showed them who's boss huh. Yeah so now we use chaotic drumming/beats to make our brains think we're in danger. So in a club when the DJ plays the latest music, your brain thinks you're in danger. Then the brain finds a pattern in the music and relaxes, then the darned DJ changes the beat, again the brain finds the pattern. When you know you're in danger your brain tells you to run away/move it buster. When music plays your body automatically starts moving thinking it's danger then relaxes, and it goes on until the party is over. What happens if the same beat goes on for long? You get bored. It's not danger anymore. </p>
<p>Long answer, if you're older than 5:
To survive on this planet filled with creatures way more capable of killing and eating us, human brains have evolved to take sensory feedback very seriously. Along with this the brain is attracted to patterns. Rhythm in music provide the patterns and beats evoke sensory overload. Louder the music and harder the beat, better the sensory feedback.
Cavemen probably used loud noises to survive by hiding from mammoths or other large predators. Then at some point used drums to create loud noises to scare other silent predators like sabertooth tigers. Dance probably began by some of cavemen having to stay up all night banging drums to keep wildcats away. Mammoths are extinct and we don't have to bang drums all night to keep other predators away anymore. But somewhere along the way our subconscious mind learned to equate rhythmic beats as safe and silence (&amp; chaotic beats in some cases) as imminent danger.
When the beat drops, your body for a split second sub consciously believes that it's going to die. Hence you get the most uncontrollable urge to move your body to slightly rhythmic chaotic beats. And you fall into sitting sleep if the beat is too rhythmic like a white noise machine or the constant hum of something.</p>
