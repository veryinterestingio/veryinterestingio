		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends, not really a black and white answer. </p>
<p>For the most part, the antibodies that you form from getting vaccinated are the same kind of antibodies you would get from a natural infection. One difference is that certain types of vaccines only show the immune system part of the relevant virus. Because of that, the immune system doesnâ€™t form as many different types of antibodies as it would in the course of a natural infection. For example the Pfizer covid 19 mRNA vaccine, only a certain part of the viral protein is used to trigger a strong immune response.  So, someone who had naturally been infected with the virus might have some additional antibody types not found in someone who had been successfully vaccinated.</p>
<p>However not all antibodies produced by natural infection are effective. Genetic variability and age will also affect the quality of antibodies produced. Ideally, a specific vaccine is designed to trigger a strong response so in this case a vaccine might be more effective. Reverse can be true also from infection. We can't say for sure without long term data.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>a vaccination triggers a kind of antibodies (IgG) that are particularly effective at fighting the virus in the internal organs.</p>
<p>there is a different kind of antibody (IgA) that is present in the mucosa of the respiratory tract. a vaccination does not trigger a similarly effective response here</p>
<p>as a result, a vaccination might trigger an immune response that is good at preventing a severe multi-organ infection, but not good at preventing a lighter infection in the respiratory tract.</p>
<p>as a result, vaccinated people might still be able to contract a light infection that is harmless to themselves (a minor cold), but still very dangerous for those around them.</p>
<p>in case of covid, how strong that effect actually is, and how it develops over time remains to be seen. it's also possible that there are huge differences between the different vaccines that are currently being developed. </p>
<p>edit: this is obviously a massive simplification. don't quote me on it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
