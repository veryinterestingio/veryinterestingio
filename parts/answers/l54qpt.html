		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If dyes are liquid(eta: not solid particle suspensions) and well mixed, pigment molecules will be mixed at a scale that's too small for optical microscopes, so it should look greenish. At the detail levels you'd need for really resolving individual molecules, you need stuff like scanning electron microscopes, and those don't produce normal colour images.</p>
<p>You'd also need to press the mixed paint down very <em>very</em> thin on the microscope slide in order to not be looking at multiple yellow and blue molecules stacked vertically, and your paint might not have much opacity at all at when it's that thin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You might also be interested in what's known as halftoning. Printers don't mix the colors, they just leave small dots that from a distance, your brain blends together when it can't discern the individual dots anymore.</p>
<p>A blue dot and a yellow dot side by side will look like a green dot from enough distance. And it doesn't take much distance.</p>
<p>Screens do the same, but they create the light instead of returning it, so the combinations are backwards.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how thoroughly it's mixed. </p>
<p>If we put small dots together, it'll look green from a distance, but still blue and yellow up close. </p>
<p>If it's mixed well, then it'll be completely homogenous.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kinda springboarding off your question - it's important to know that the way paint mixes  is different from the way pixels on a screen mix to produce secondary colours. This is explained <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_mixing" target="_blank">here</a>. Which is why (counterintuitively) we may not be able to see the colours of the individual particles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
