		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR: Hand sanitizer kills bacteria and viruses but it doesn't wash it away, so it leaves the dead and living ones on your skin.</p>
<p>Soap and water are actually scientifically proven to be better at killing bacteria and viruses than hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>In addition to killing bacteria and viruses soap traps dirt and fragments of the destroyed virus in tiny bubbles called micelles, which wash away in water. In tandem, some soap molecules disrupt the chemical bonds that allow bacteria, viruses and grime to stick to surfaces, lifting them off the skin.</p>
<p>So while alcohol based hand sanitizers do kill bacteria by breaking down their exteriors, they don't do nearly as good a job at washing them away from your skin.</p>
<p>Hand sanitizer was invented to be used only when hand washing wasn't available. But due to it's popularity and convenience people make the mistake of assuming that it's better than washing your hands, which it's not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some good points, but I haven't seen this one come up yet. It's bad for your skin. </p>
<p>Your skin is <em>always</em> covered in germs and other microbes, which are beneficial (or ar least not bad) for you. In what ways our microbiome helps us exactly is still undergoing research, but at least they make it harder for &quot;bad&quot; germs to spread. Using hand sanitizer will kill them off, allowing nasty stuff to spread when you get in contact with it later.</p>
<p>Additionally, hand sanitizer is usually drying out the skin, causing tiny cracks, which potentially help bad germs to hide there or even get inside your body faster. </p>
<p>Only use it occasionally, for example when you are touching a wound. Otherwise soap is better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
