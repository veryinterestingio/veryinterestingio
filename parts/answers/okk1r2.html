		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Benefits: can mitigate risk of cancer, keeps your skin fresher.</p>
<p>Drawbacks: it’s annoying to apply, you need to reapply often for it to be effective, patchy coverage = patchy protection.</p>
<p>My take (as someone who got skin cancer, RIP me) is that wearing clothes instead can be easier and better. That said, my version of wearing clothes is covering up every scrap of skin - gloves, the whole nine yards. Supplement with Vitamin D unless you live in the tropics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, wearing sunscreen daily is good for keeping your skin healthy from early aging and skin cancer. The downside is finding a sunscreen that doesnt make you break out, in a form you'll apply, and is reef safe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are balding or have thin hair always wear a hat. I started to lose my hair in my 40s and was pretty good about wearing one. Now have no hair. When I went to see a dermatologist about a skin infection a few years ago, she said I had many precancerous growths on my scalp and removed them with liquid nitrogen. The scalp ones can be especially serious as they can become squamous cell carcinoma which has the potential to spread.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe this is a dumb question but: </p>
<p>Are there any ingredients in sunscreen that may cause other kind of issues long term? </p>
<p>Say, you’re pregnant, and/or have been using sunscreen daily for a long time. Will any of the  ingredients cause any long term issues in the body or be passed to the baby?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
