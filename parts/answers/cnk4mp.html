		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a question that may be only peripherally related...</p>
<p>When crops are specially bred to do well in substandard soil is there a danger of reducing their flavor or nutritional value?  </p>
<p>In the case of black beans, for example, I'm sure that the breeders would put a strong emphasis on maintaining their high protein content but does their flavor depend on trace elements that might not be present in the &quot;improved&quot; crop? Flavor, after all, is the usual reason given for the preference for black beans and, if it's not as good as, for example, pinto beans it might be of little benefit to the consumer...</p>
<p>The question is, as I said, peripheral to the question of soil management but I'm curious.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
