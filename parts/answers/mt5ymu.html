		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer the why, just look at Nikola Motors.</p>
<p>Almost the entire company was smoke and mirrors. The investment company that released the report that proved it paid off their research by shorting the stock.</p>
<p>By having a mechanism to make money off downward stock prices, it financially incentivizes entities that uncover malfeasance to release that information to the public.</p>
<p>Just because it can be abused doesn't mean it's always a bad thing... Misuse should certainly be much more harshly regulated, but shorting isn't inherently bad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good answers in this thread on the role of short selling and how it can benefit the market. I am going to take a slightly different angle to this: why would it not be a thing? There needs to be a reason for something to be disallowed.</p>
<p>A basic short sale consists of three transactions, all of which look pretty reasonable to me: </p>
<p>- If I want to have a share temporarily in my portfolio, and someone who has that share is willing to lend it to me for that time (for a fee we both agree on), why would we not be allowed to make that deal? </p>
<p>- If I have a share in my portfolio and I believe the company will go down, why would I not be allowed to sell it?</p>
<p>- If a share has recently dropped in value, and I now like it, or if I need to have that share to give back to a lender, why would I not be allowed to buy it?</p>
<p>Why would any of these transactions be disallowed? And if all three of them are allowed, that means short selling is possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not really borrowing money, it's more like borrowing the stock. You are essentially selling stock in the future that you haven't bought yet in the hope that, when you end up buying it, the value will be lower. Aside from the obvious personal benefit to the person doing it, when it works, there is also the general benefit of people being able to create more balanced portfolios of stocks that might go up even when the general market falls. A balanced portfolio might increase investments in it in general, and that can increase the longer term investments as well, that are not only speculative, benefitting the whole economy, at least in theory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Shorting, like speculating in general, has the valuable market function of putting pressure on stock prices to move toward their &quot;correct&quot; level. The process of shorting a stock involves selling it. Selling lots of shares of a stock reduces the stock price. If the people shorting the stock are correct about it being overvalued, then they will be helping it reach the lower, more correct price faster.</p>
<p>Also, there's no good reason for it to <em>not</em> be a thing. Shorting a stock won't cause a healthy business to fail, and the person who risks the most in the exchange is the person doing the short. There's no clear way in which the person shorting the stock is violating anybody else's property rights or causing undue harm to them. At worst, it'll cause an unhealthy business to lose investor confidence faster, but that's not a bad thing. And if the business is healthy, then it'll just help the people who have a better understanding of the company's value, who will be able to buy the stock more cheaply and make money when it goes up. </p>
<p>The GME situation demonstrates a desirable outcome: Funds that were shorting the stock lost money. They were duly punished for their poor foresight, a lot of smaller investors made a bunch of money, and Gamestop will continue to sink or swim based on whether it successfully transitions to a digital distribution platform.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
