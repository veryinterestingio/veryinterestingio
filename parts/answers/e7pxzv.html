		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Exfoliating is usually subtle, even pressure.  Scratching is usually firm and fairly sharp pressure.</p>
<p>Exfoliating is like using sandpaper and scratching is like using a saw.  In addition, the underside of your fingernails is usually not very clean and is a great place for bacteria to grow.  You're potentially breaking your skin (even if only slightly) and introducing bacteria.  Not ideal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whether exfoliating is &quot;good&quot; is a matter of opinion. It's supposed to evenly remove the outer layer of skin that is made up of dead skin cells. That always sounds so gross, but really they're tiny, interlocking keratin scales. They keep moisture in and skin oil on top, protect against damage, and keep bacteria out (where they belong, the usual skin flora is a protection against nastier germs, not gross either). </p>
<p>Remove the keratin and the skin feels smooth and sensitive, but it's also more vulnerable and dries out faster. For cosmetic reasons better be very gentle and not overdo it. You can exfoliate mechanically and chemically. Sugar scrub vs. urea f.ex. For some medical conditions like ichthyosis getting that keratin layer off is absolutely crucial. </p>
<p>Scratching lightly is no big deal. But scratching hard means dirty finger nails plough right through the whole skin, shredding cells, opening capillaries. It can introduce bacteria way deeper than they were ever meant to go, and the damaged area is a good breeding ground for them, a risk for infections. </p>
<p>Some exfoliating products also scratch. Something like ground apricot shells is way too hard and sharp-edged. Scrub too hard or overdo it with the chemical peels and you end up with abrasions/burns that are neither healthy nor attractive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some peoples skin cells just slough right off - those people don't really need to exfoliate much. Others don't - their skin cells are &quot;stickier&quot;, and when left on the skin with bacteria, oils, and the general dust and dirt that can accumulate over time, it can create a great environment for acne. Exfoliating helps get rid of these particularly sticky skin cells.</p>
<p>Interestingly, most of the responses in this thread seem to be somewhat against exfoliation, which I can understand. Most guys don't need to exfoliate as much as girls, and their hormones don't fluctuate nearly as much over the month - for example, women's skin typically produces more sebum at or around the day of ovulation. On top of that, with all the different physical and chemical exfoliators on the market, it can be easy to overexfoliate and irritate your skin. That being said, gentle exfoliation once a week, or more often, if you feel you need it, can definitely help improve the quality and overall texture of your skin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay here's it broken down. Scratching IS exfoliating, however it is a much more damaging form that can bruise and scrape off too many layers of epidermis causing irritation. Exfoliating in a proper way is more gentle and removes the later of dead cells and the surface closer to the new living cells. This being said over exfoliating is also bad, it takes them down too fast and weakens uv resistance and causes irritation. So think of it like Goldilocks and the 3 Bears; too little, too much, and just right.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Loufa in shower causes problems too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
