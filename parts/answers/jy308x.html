		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's less that they have a purpose, and more that they're inevitable.</p>
<p>When books are printed, they're printed on sheets called <em>signatures,</em> which are big sheets of paper with four, eight, sixteen, and sometimes other numbers of pages on them. These signatures are folded in such a way that the pages come out in order and right side up when you go to open the book.</p>
<p>As a consequence of this design, there will usually be blank pages either at the beginning or the end, because the number of printed pages won't often line up perfectly with how many pages there are to print.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Get an A4 sheet an fold it in half: You’ve just made a small four page book. If you only have three pages of content then you’re going to have to leave a blank in there. Same idea on larger books. If you get the blank sheet and trace the paper down to the spine, you’ll be able to find the other part of the sheet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="https://clearimageprinting.com/inc/2016/03/21/what-is-a-print-signature-an-imposition-and-a-spread/" target="_blank">https://clearimageprinting.com/inc/2016/03/21/what-is-a-print-signature-an-imposition-and-a-spread/</a>
That link has a diagram as an example (16-page signature)</p>
<p>They’ll print like 4, 8, 16, etc book pages on a giant sheet of paper. Then fold it 1, 2, 3, 4, etc times, cut the edges off and stitch/glue it into a book along with however many other signatures required to make up the book.</p>
<p>So, say you have a 4-page signature, then your book will have to have a page count that is a multiple of 4. So if you wrote a 201 page book, you’ll have 3 blank pages in there to hit 204. (Or 51 signatures). You can’t go smaller than 4, because if you take a single sheet of paper and fold it in half, you’ll have made 4 pages (2 on one side, 2 on the other).</p>
<p>Bigger signatures, possibly more blank pages.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
