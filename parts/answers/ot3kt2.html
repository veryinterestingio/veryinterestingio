		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rich people get richer because of two procedures called <strong>redistribution</strong> and <strong>printing</strong>.</p>
<p>Before I start of,</p>
<p>The term “rich” will refer to mega-businesses and their owners such as Amazon &amp; Jeff Bezos, Facebook &amp; Mark Zuckerburg.</p>
<p>The term “poor” will refer to people who are employed in labour &amp; service jobs such as the kitchen staff in McDonalds or the Software Developers at IBM.</p>
<p><strong>Redistribution</strong></p>
<p>Money is constantly flowing from the pockets of the rich to the bank accounts of the poor and back. This happens through many financial systems in society.</p>
<p>You buy a new new desk from Amazon and this money will go towards the pockets of the rich, however,<em> the same money</em> may then be transferred to the bank accounts of the employees in the <em>form of wages.</em> This is one example of money flowing from rich to poor and poor to rich.</p>
<p>Now, not all of the money is used to pay employee wages. Some of it, may be used to pay off debt or research new ways to improve the business so that they <strong>make even more money next year.</strong> </p>
<p>The rich get richer because some of that money will mean that the CEO may buy more assets which will produce more money for his or herself over time, but<em> it doesn’t mean</em> that your pay per hour will increase.</p>
<p>Your job will still pay you the federal minimum wage of $7.25 <strong>even if they make more money than they’ve ever had.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Printing</strong></p>
<p>Alternatively, rich people buy debt from the government (called bonds) and this allows the government to print more money up to the value of the debt.</p>
<p>When Amazon buys $6.8 billion of debt from the government, this gives the government permission to print $6.8 billion US dollars. The rich get richer because the government <strong>pays interest on those bonds.</strong></p>
<p>A user named u/PackageNo7986 mentioned a concept called trickle-down economics. This is an economic theory which was created to get poor people to favour economic policies that benefit the wealthy and makes them… even richer. <a href="https://www.oneillinois.com/stories/2020/9/22/daily-debunk-trickle-down-economics" target="_blank">It’s a cruel joke termed by a humorist called Will Rogers.</a></p>
<p>It’s the same economic view that lead to volatile economical moment such as <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaganomics" target="_blank">the period of Reagan tax cuts.</a></p>
<p>While it is true that rich people create jobs which the lower class can gain employment from, it does <strong>not make the lower class “richer”</strong>. </p>
<p>This is because of constant &amp; complex financial pressures which keep them people of a particular class from climbing to the next. Concepts such as un-equal taxation, long working hours, low wages, zero-hour contracts and more all destroy what little benefit ‘trickle-down’ economics provide.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If a comic book I own goes up in value from $5 to $10, that doesn't require an extra $5 bill to be printed and it certainly doesn't put cash in my pocket unless I actually sell. My net worth increases, but no actual currency changes hands. </p>
<p>The rich are accumulating assets and those assets are going up in value, but this doesn't involve having a Scrooge McDuck style money bin somewhere. </p>
<p>Actual bills and coins are coming from the mint and being distributed to banks, just like it has been since we went off the gold standard. The value of stock, bonds, real estate, and other investments isn't totally irrelevant to this process, but those transactions mostly don't happen on a cash basis and so don't soak up much currency.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rich people do not have a lot of &quot;money&quot;, at least not compared to the billions or millions attributed to them. They simply own assets that are VALUED at millions/billions of dollars. Usually this is in the form of company ownership or stocks. The &quot;billions&quot; that Bezos is worth is simply the amount of money he COULD have if he sold all his stocks, business interests, homes, bonds, etc... He does not actually have that money at his disposal.</p>
<p>So, that net value bounces around a lot because it's simply a guess at what that stuff might be worth. It's not a final solid number.</p>
<p>The point is that the billions don't need to come from anywhere or anyone. It's not money. It's just a hypothetical value.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Much it the money the rich accumulate isn't actual currency (Jeff Bezos doesn't have a Scrooge McDuck money bin full of coins and bills) its in stock, which rises and falls based on the value of the company.</p>
<p>Not rich people work for a salary, so that's why their pay stays relatively flat. That's also why people claim the rich don't pay their fair share of taxes, because their wealth comes from ownership of assets that go up in value (appreciate) and aren't taxed the same way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
