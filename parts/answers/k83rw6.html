<p>For example, in the Minkowski metric in the (-+++) convention, the metric is </p>
<p>ds^(2) = -c^(2)dt^(2) + dx^(2) + dy^(2) + dz^(2).</p>
<p>The dx, dy, and dz terms are all positive, while the dt term is negative. So t is a timelike coordinate while x, y, and z are spacelike coordinates.</p>
<p>The Schwarzschild metric is</p>
<p>ds^(2) = -(1 - 2M/r)dt^(2) + (1 - 2M/r)^(-1)dr^(2) + r^(2)dΩ^(2),</p>
<p>where I've used Ω as a shorthand for the angular part containing the two spherical angles.</p>
<p>Focus on the t and r terms. For r &gt; 2M (the Schwarzschild radius), (1 - 2M/r) &gt; 0, so the dt term is overall negative and the dr term is overall positive. That's the normal case, just like in Minkowski. The t coordinate is timelike and the r coordinate is spacelike.</p>
<p>But for r &lt; 2M, (1 - 2M/r) &lt; 0, and the signs flip. The Schwarzschild coordinate t becomes spacelike and the Schwarzschild r becomes timelike. Some people say that this means that &quot;space and time are switching places&quot; at the event horizon, but a more correct explanation is just that you chose bad coordinates. t looks like time and r looks like the radial coordinate from your typical spherical coordinates, but that's not quite true. This set of coordinates has a coordinate singularity at r = 2M. There are other sets of coordinates which behave perfectly fine at the horizon, so this bad behavior is just an artifact of the choice of coordinates.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
