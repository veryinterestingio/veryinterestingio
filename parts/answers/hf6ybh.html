		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The current doesn’t “know” what the most efficient path to ground is, it only knows what the resistance of the air is in the immediate vicinity.</p>
<p>The electrical arc will <a href="https://youtu.be/dukkO7c2eUE" target="_blank">randomly check multiple low-resistance paths</a> until it finds ground and discharges all the power through that channel.</p>
<p>Since it was sort of a trial-and-error pathfinding to get there, the path may be goofy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lightning follows the path of least resistance. It's much like water trickling down the side of your car. Some paths are dry, some are already wet so the water flows more freely  in some places than others. Lightning is much the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The common misconception is that electricity (or current) &quot;follows the path of least resistance.&quot; That is not really true.  More accurately, electricity follows all paths of conductivity, but the amount of current passed through any given path is inversely proportional to the resistance of that path. That explanation a little hand-wavy, but it should be close enough for ELI5.   </p>
<p>In the case of lightning, as the current travels through the air, the air heats up and ionizes (becomes electrically charged).  The ionized air is less resistive so more current flows through the path of ionized air.  This causes more air to ionize along the path which causes more current to flow that same path...you get the point.  </p>
<p>The lightning bolt that you see is not the only path that electricity is flowing, it just happens to be the path where the majority of the total current is flowing.  The air all around a lightning bolt will also become ionized.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
