Generally, elevated SST imply warmer average temperatures, but it's not 1:1 so this is an important clarification. Estimates of the temperature of the Northern Hemisphere more broadly during the Roman Warm Period put average temperatures more around the average temperature of the period between 1960-1990 (e.g., <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-0459.2010.00399.x" target="_blank">Ljungqvist 2010</a>), so significantly warmer than the periods before and after it, but still cooler than today and less consistently warm than the last few decades (e.g., <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/2/024001/meta" target="_blank">Luterbacher et al, 2016</a>).</p>
<p>The broader answer to the question though is that global scale proxy records (i.e., various chemical or isotopic records which we can estimate temperature from, often supplemented with global climate models) tend to suggest that most of climate anomalies in the last ~2000 years, whether they were anomalously warm (like the Roman Warm Period or Medieval Warm Period) or anomalously cold (like the Little Ice Age) were local/regional as opposed to global (e.g., <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1401-2" target="_blank">Neukom et al, 2019</a>). This is distinct from anthropogenic warming which is a consistent global phenomena. An additional, extremely problematic difference, between these local/regional warm (or cool periods) compared to the anthropogenically driven global warming we are seeing today, is the rate of change. This is highlighted in any number of papers, figures, etc, but is visualized nicely in Figure 3 of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0530-7" target="_blank">Kaufman et al, 2020</a>. The unprecedented rate of warming is arguably as, or perhaps even more, important than the magnitude of warming as this rate is, or will, likely outpace the rate at which ecosystems and human systems can effectively adapt (e.g., <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2552" target="_blank">Smith et al, 2015</a>).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
