		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different batteries have different voltages. And you don't want to try recharging a non-rechargeable cell.</p>
<p>Rechargable batteries generally have a voltage of 1.2 volts, compared to heavy duty or alkaline cells with 1.5. If you were to put a rechargable battery in parralell with an alkaline cell, the alkaline cell would discharge through the rechargable one, overcharging, overheating it and probably damaging it.</p>
<p>Batteries also have different capacities - so putting a cheap heavy duty in series with a fresh alkaline or rechargeable cell, or a partialy discharged cell with a fresh one, when the low capacity cell discharges the cells that still had capacity would force charge through the dead cell, charging it backwards. This will cause the discharged cell to leak.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So batteries are full of electricity that they want to give to the thing you put the batteries in. Electricity moves through metal but it only moves in a circuit, a continuous loop. That's why there is a little bit of metal on both ends of where you put a battery in. The battery is metal all the way through so the electricity can come out one end, go all the way through the device (Which makes the device go!), and then come back into the battery at the other end.</p>
<p>However, we lose a little bit of electricity when it goes around the circuit. Some of it kind of, rubs off, wears out. Like tires on a car, or your shoes when you've have them for a long time. Batteries run out too, because their charge of electricity wears out.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now when there's one battery putting electricity into a circuit, it just goes and goes until it gets worn out. But batteries can be different, and there can be problems when you mix them together. Some batteries are stronger- they put out more electricity, than other ones. They have a higher &quot;voltage&quot;.  When you use more than one battery, they all have to be part of the circuit that the electricity goes through. So the electricity goes through all of the batteries and then through the device. But if one battery is stronger than another battery, it will push its electricity too fast for the weaker battery to keep up with. The weaker battery won't be able to push its electricity out faster than its coming in. It will fill up with too much electricity and break. A few different things can happen when a battery breaks, it could get too hot and melt the parts around it, or it could break open and get bad burning liquid everywhere. This might hurt the device or even you.</p>
<p>Even with the same kind of batteries, they can get weaker or stronger based on how worn out they are. So you can have the same problem if use multiple batteries from the exact same box, but one has been used for a long time already, and one has never been used before. The older worn out one might not be able to keep up with the new one, and it can break. So this is why it's recommended to use only all new batteries  that are all the same when you need to switch out old ones. So they'll all be just as strong and fresh as each other, and can all work together on the same circuit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you think two batteries being two people in one large hamster wheel. The runners have energy and they run to turn the wheel. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The most effective way would be for both runners to have the same speed and same stamina. They will turn the wheel at the same speed and tire together. If both runners can run at the same speed, but one has been running for ages and is tired, the fit runner will be limited by the tired runner and could injure the tired runner. In this case, one battery has energy but the other doesn't, the one with more energy will discharge to the one with less, possibly causing damage to one or both batteries. The comedy picture is the slower runner falling down and spinning round with the wheel, whilst the fitter runner works really hard to power the wheel and move the tired runner round and round. He's not running efficiently now, and will tire quickly, possibly overheat from the exhaustion.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The same happens when you have one runner who is a lot faster than the other. The faster runner is trying to force the wheel up to his speed but the slower one is slowing him down, even if both have loads of stamina. Again, this can deplete the energy of both runners quickly and possibly cause damage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All of this is especially true with cells that can discharge very quickly, or don’t have a safe self discharge characteristic. </p>
<p>NiMH when overcharged will reasonably safely turn the extra charge into heat without releasing their entire stored capacity. They just get warm. </p>
<p>Lithium cells on the other hand do not have a “safe self discharge”, and may become unstable and fizz pop big fire, as they release their entire charge quickly through an internal short. That internal short happens because chemistry, and is supplied with high current because that’s something the rest of the cell is good at, because chemistry.
-&gt;The strengths of lithium cells make the consequences of their weaknesses worse.</p>
<p>For the same chemical reasons, Lithium based cells are also capable of supplying huge currents before their internal resistance limits them, so charge imbalance between healthy cells is a much bigger problem. The cell with a higher charge can dump it more quickly into the cell with lower charge, possibly vaporizing the wire in between.</p>
<p>The above is also coupled with lithium based cells simply holding more energy, which in case of failure is more to be suddenly released.</p>
<p>But lithium cells hold more energy in a smaller cell and can deliver it faster and we really want that. So we have to manage them. That’s why lithium batteries require a battery manager circuit, which is often built in and takes care of all these worries for you. The exception is hobby r/c batteries which are not managed and you can do very stupid things with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
