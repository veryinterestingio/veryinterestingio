		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is complicated - factors such as genes, cancer-specific physiology and the health of the patient come into play. But theoretically yes one would think the more cells you have, the higher chance something mutates.</p>
<p>However, interestingly some larger animals like elephants have significantly lower rates of cancer than humans do, and smaller animals like mice have significantly higher susceptibility to cancer. This is called Peto's paradox. Larger animals such as elephants and whales due to their enormous size have developed superior cancer-suppressing mechanisms to humans due to the demands of evolution. An example would be the TP53 gene - this gene is suppressed when humans have cancer, and we only have one copy. Elephants on the other hand have several copies of this gene.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
