		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Grapefruit juice contains unique compounds called furanocoumarins, specifically bergamottin, that completely, irreversibly breaks the liver/gut enzyme CYP3A4, as well as a lesser concern with breaking CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 enzymes.  </p>
<p>CYP3A4 is needed for clearing out about 50% of the drugs in the market.  With that metabolism broken, the drug just sticks around in the blood at the peak blood concentration for much longer than intended, doing whatever that drug does.  If you take the next dose on schedule, it will be like a double dose.  Double dosing can be a severe problem in the case of a drug with a low therapeutic index.  A single slow-release pill could peak at levels much higher than intended.</p>
<p>That's one case.  The other is some drugs need CYP3A4 to turn <em>into</em> the substance that has the prescribed effects, or require it to be absorbed in the intestine.  In that case the drug just fizzles and has no effect.</p>
<p>The mechanism is dramatic!  It doesn't matter how much grapefruit juice you have- one small serving will wipe out virtually all CYP3A4 enzyme in the body.  A large serving consumed in one sitting has no additional effect.   The body will continue to make more new enzyme once the grapefruit juice compound itself is metabolised out (fortunately not requiring CYP3A4).  </p>
<p>But making new CYP3A4 is slow- it takes 24 hrs to rebuild to 50% and 72 hrs to completely restore it.</p>
<p>People have strategically used grapefruit juice to potentiate drugs- it won't make the first original dosing period different, but the the drug's effects will generally will last notably longer.  As many drugs are expensive, there is some logic to it, however there are many complications with the apparently simple theory- sustained blood levels of a drug may be harmful, and the drug sticking around for an excessive period of time might theoretically end up being slowly broken down by a completely different enzyme into new metabolic byproducts, producing new, unstudied side effects.</p>
<p>Fun fact- the first grapefruit are an accidental crossbreed of sweet orange (C. sinensis) and pomelo (C. maxima).  However, the commercial cultivars like Ruby Red, Rio Star, Ruby-Sweet, and Star Ruby were all created by using radiation to accelerate random genetic mutations and then selectively breeding the more desirable ones that rarely resulted (presumably most were nonviable or produced terrible fruit).  This started in 1929.  However, of course the newly mutated fruits have no residual radioactivity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
