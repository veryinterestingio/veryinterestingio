<p>We'll ignore attenuation for now, and we'll go with a simple scenario: you shouting in the middle of a field, since we can ignore echos and suchlike. The sound levels at a given distance follow inverse square law, so if I move twice as far from you the sound will have a quarter of the energy levels. While the human auditory system does not work in this way and there are other factors like sound masking, it's easy to see that at some point you can't hear it over the background noise. And if we carried on with this and put you inside a large acoustic chamber, at some point the noise levels would be so low that the hairs in your ears are not stimulated enough to cause the nerves to fire. And even further still it would eventually disappear into noise that's undetectable from the random background collisions and movement of molecules. In the same way that the light of a star over enough distance would eventually become undetectable from cosmic background radiation, no matter how sensitive your equipment is.</p>
<p>Now the second part: attenuation. Or in layman's terms &quot;sound absorption&quot;. As I type this it is currently snowing outside. If you go outside on a snowy day you will no doubt notice how quiet things are, because snow is a good attenuator of sound. It's not going to particularly impact us if we're 6 feet away talking, but instead of bouncing around, all the general background noise gets attenuated.</p>
<p>In air sound is transmitted by air molecules vibrating, this obviously causes loss due to friction, heating the air slightly and causing the sound to lose energy.</p>
<p>Attenuation is also impacted by frequency used, with lower frequencies in most circumstances being attenuated less. You can observe this whether it's a far off rumbling bass, WiFi signals (5GHz has a lower range than 2.4GHz), or in telecommunications - in DSL the higher frequencies are attenuated more strongly, and since using more frequencies is how you get more bandwidth this is (one reason) why speeds get slower over distance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is eventually converted to heat. </p>
<p>The top comment is correct, but the direct answer is the sound is converted to heat. As you know sound is transferred through a medium. As the molecules of the medium vibrate they create friction against the other molecules and the energy is converted to heat... eventually.</p>
<p>The rate at which the sound disappears etc etc is what everyone else described.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>What happens to noise energy once you can no longer hear the noise?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It eventually becomes heat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does it just become very spread out noise that we can't hear,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure, that's one way of looking at it.</p>
<p>What you're hearing is changes in pressure, which you can think of as group motion of a large number of molecules of air.  A speaker physically moves air around, and since air is compressible, that movement bunches up the adjacent air molecules. These bang around each other initially, until they transfer that group energy to molecules further away, and so on, creating a wave of kinetic energy leaving the source of the sound.</p>
<p>At some point, through interference or just distance, the pressure wave spreads out so much that you can no longer sense it above other chaotic air motion, at which point all of that energy just becomes part of the chaotic motion of air molecules.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>or does it turn into something else like heat?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chaotic motion of air molecules is another way of saying heat, so yes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Noises/sounds are acoustic waves of energy with different frequencies in the air or whatever medium they're passing through. Their energy distribution is directly comparable to the effects of an earthquake but at a much smaller scale. The energy from the sound waves is absorbed by its environment in the same way the force of an earthquake is absorbed by the earth surrounding the epicenter. </p>
<p>All of the matter effected by the waves of energy in both scenarios is what is responsible for both the maximum spread of the earthquake and for how far a sound can travel. Both are waves of energy meeting resistance in whatever they are passing through. All matter has physical resistance to force, so when these waves pass through different substances, the physical resistance of the matter absorbs a percentage of the total energy from the sound waves that came from their source until it eventually loses the energy to continue spreading out into other matter.</p>
<p>That's why sounds travels differently through the air, water and solids. Each media has different resistance and transmittance capability of the energy being put into them. While air has little resistance to sound, the molecules are much more spread out, and this reduces the amount of medium for the energy to propagate through smoothly. This causes the sound to be spread out randomly and reduces the maximum distance sounds can travel. It is the opposite case for transmission through solid matter. The molecules are much more densely compacted together and static which increases the resistance/reduces the ability for the sound energy to pass through it.</p>
<p>Fluids are the best medium for sound to pass through along with energy in general. The physical structure of water allows whales to be able to communicate thousands of miles away from each other and is the reason why an earthquake can cause a tsunami over a similar distance. Water has a great combination of matter density and low physical resistance to be the best medium for energy transfer, with metal for electricity and heat as one of the few/only exceptions. </p>
<p>TL;DR sound is energy and its force is absorbed by the type matter the sound waves pass through as energy dissipation/heat in some way based on the resistance and fluidity of its environment</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
