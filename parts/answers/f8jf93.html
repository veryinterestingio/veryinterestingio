		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you send a picture or video cross-platform it has to send through MMS which typically has a limit of 1MB. Generally a photo is going to be around 3MB so it'll have to compress to a third of is size to reach that limit, a ten second 1080p video can fall around 30MB so it'll have to compress to being a thirtieth of it's size to hit that same limit.</p>
<p>(These file sizes I'm using aren't going to be exactly the same for every phone but are what I got from my phone and settings.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's probably more about protocol than device. For instance, when texting between iOS and Android, you have to go through SMS or MMS, and those systems probably compress images significantly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way around this (if sending from an Android phone) is to open Google Photos, find the file you want to share, click the share icon, and choose &quot;copy link&quot;.  Send that link via a text message.  </p>
<p>When the recipient receives the message they will get a link to a full resolution picture or video.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
