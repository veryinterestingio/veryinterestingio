<p>1/2 of 3/5. Half of 3/5. Obviously it's going to be smaller than 3/5</p>
<p>0.05 of 0.05, that's 5 percent of 0.05. You know 5 percent is a relatively small chunk of the original.</p>
<p>The problem may be you were taught only the abstract math rules, but it wasn't well tied into concrete example that would build the numerical understanding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You have a pizza cut it into five slices. You turn your back to get a beer and your brother eats two slices. Shit. </p>
<p>So now you have three fifths of a pizza. You're all set to eat it when your girlfriend comes in and says she wants half. </p>
<p>You have three-fifths of a pizza and you need to cut it in half. </p>
<p>The pizza started as 5 slices. Only three are left. So now your girlfriend gets one and a half slices and you get one and a half slices.</p>
<p>1/2 * 3/5 = 3/10 = 1.5/5</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have one (1/1 or 1.0) pie.  I cut it in half (0.5 or 1/2) and take that piece away.</p>
<p>You now have 1/2 of a pie.  I cut that piece in half (0.5) and take that piece away.</p>
<p>You now have 1/4 of the pie.   0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.   1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Another way to think of it is multiplying fractions is the same as dividing.  1/2 is another way of expressing 1 divided by 2</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It makes a little more sense if you think about what multiplying is doing in general: it’s sorting things into groups.</p>
<p>When you multiply 2 X 4 what you’re saying is “I want 2 groups of 4.” </p>
<p>So with your example of (1/2) X (3/5) you’re saying “I want half a group of 3/5.” And that’s why the answer (3/10) is smaller and than the original 3/5.</p>
<p>And bonus round: when you divide what you’re asking is “how many groups of one thing does it take to make another?”</p>
<p>So example, if you’re dividing 4 by 2, you’re asking how many groups of 2 are there in 4.</p>
<p>So if we’re dividing (1/2) by (1/4), we’re asking “how many groups of 1/4 does it take to make 1/2?” And this is why the answer is 2.</p>
<p>This is why fractions get smaller when you multiply and larger when you divide.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
