		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Brains like things to be <em>complete</em> so when you start thinking of a song and don't finish it, itll just loop that same section over again. Try thinking or singing the song all the way through. </p>
<p>Note: this will not work for Mulans &quot;a girl worth fighting for&quot;, as it trails off and doesnt end in a satisfying way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are called an earworm, sometimes referred to as stuck song in the head, or brainworm. Psychologists have studied the phenomenon, and it appears that 98% or people experience an earworm at one time or another. Earworms are usually popular music, and most people report are that earworms are usually 15 to 30 seconds in length. Neurological researchers have attempted to explain why earworms occur, and how the brain records bits of information about the tempo, rhythm,, lyrics, to store these bits of song.</p>
<p>When something cues a trigger in the brain to bring auditory memories of the song, the brain has an excited reaction which can start a 15 to 30 second portion of the song to loop. The why's and hows are very complex and outside easy non-psych explanations here.</p>
<p>Most questions abut earworms involve peopole trying to be rid of them. Researchers claim one method is as simple as chewing some gum.  Some studies suggest that chewing gum modifies the experience by which the brain hears music. Many people report that actually listening to the earworm song all the way through can help to eliminate having it stuck on a loop.  This works very well for me. By forcing your brain to listen to the song all the way through your earworm may disappear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the main reasons is repetition is a common principle in a song, especially nowadays. So it kinda gets stuck in your head. Its supposed to make a song catchy, but it also gets stuck in your head. This is even harder to forget if the end is repeating the line of lyrics. Its even worse if the last note of the song is the same last note of the repeated lyric.( particularly and literally on a end on a relatively low note)</p>
<p>The other part is you didn't finish the entire song. When you hear a song part way through, our brain loops around particularly on the most repetitive part, the chorus, in order to finish it. Try listening to the end of the song, or sing it(or simply recall it in you brain if you're embarrased for even knowing that song). You just kinda have to remember how it ends like if the song just kinda fades out or how the notes go down. Just remembering the lyrics doesn't always work. I've done it many times and it works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
