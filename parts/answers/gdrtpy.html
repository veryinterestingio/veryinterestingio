<p>European hornets have been present in the US since the 1800s and have long since well established themselves on the east coast. They are quite commonly mistaken for Asian hornets due to their similarities. While their diets and general behavior (though many-myself included-consider European hornets to be a fairly docile species) are somewhat similar, the giants have a penchant for feeding on other eusocial insects. Their large heads power strong muscles, allowing them to prey on other hard-shelled Hymenopterans. In their native range a large portion of their diet consists of bees and wasps. </p>
