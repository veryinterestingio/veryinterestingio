		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How are our emotions easily manipulated by music?</p>
<p>In movies, using the right musical cue could immediately signify what the feeling of the moment is and we actually feel for the characters/plot.</p>
<p>When in a downer mood, listening to an &quot;upbeat&quot; song can usually get you back on track.</p>
<p>Or, something more mind-boggling, when listening to certain music (usually classical ones, <em>Clair De Lune by Debussy</em> for me), makes us feel these emotions of non-materialistic origins (almost ethereal or metaphysical feelings).</p>
<p>Why is that? Thank you for doing this AMA.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I’m curious if there is any work in biotyping in music— as in, are there commonalities people might share who are musically gifted? If not, do you think there might be a reason for that (such as musical ability being linked more to acquisition period than bio type)?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a language learner at a military institute in Monterey California. I'm 6 months into an intensive study of Korean. I feel like my grasp of the language is not reflected in my poor test scores.</p>
<p>I've noticed other students here with musical backgrounds like me struggle, while good testers can't seem to speak well at all.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a difference between how a musical learner understands language and how languages might be taught in a traditional school?</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
