<p>( <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322120.php" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322120.php" target="_blank">https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322120.php</a></a> ) where your body is unable to process or absorb nutrients properly. Since the kidneys shut down first, your ability to balance electrolytes is severely impaired. </p>
<p>Typically small amounts of sugar water are given first, then later if the starving individual begins recovering, solid food can be reintroduced. </p>
