<p>Every piece of matter in the universe is attracted to every other piece of matter in the universe. And when wild things happen, like neutron stars merging, the hiccup in gravity you feel from them spiraling into each other at half the speed of light arrives in almost lockstep with the light from the explosion from the matter they fling off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you’re wondering why would gravity waves just so happen to have the same speed as light, even though they would not seem to have a direct relationship, it’s because the speed of light is not actually specifically about light; it’s about <em>causality.</em>  Calculations show that if any kind of information-bearing phenomenon whatsoever were to travel faster than this, causality would be violated.  Which would mean that consequences could precede their own causes — i.e. time travel.  </p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/msVuCEs8Ydo" target="_blank">This YouTube video</a> has an excellent explanation of this. </p>
<p>Light is what we normally refer to for this speed simply because it’s readily accessible/understandable, and is relatively easy to measure.  But in general, any wave in any massless field <em>must</em> propagate at the speed of light (causality); only phenomena that are associated with mass are ever able to travel slower than that.  </p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/gSKzgpt4HBU" target="_blank">This video</a>  from the same channel explains this part really well.</p>

<p>that aberration in general relativity is almost exactly canceled by velocity-dependent interactions, permitting
cg = c. This cancellation is dictated by conservation laws and the quadrupole nature of
gravitational radiation</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modern consensus is gravity moves at the speed of light. There is no distance limit except for distances so great that the accumulated expansion of space is moving things apart faster than light; but gravity gets weaker with distance, so for stuff very far away the effect is negligible.</p>
<p>When blackholes merge, the resulting gravity matches the sum of the two blackhole gravities almost exactly, but there is some loss of mass in the form of the gravitational waves emitted during the downspiral. There isn't a sudden change in the deformation, the gravity of multiple objects overlap, the distortions add up; so as blackholes get closer and closer, the overall deformation gradually transitions towards matching the end result.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
