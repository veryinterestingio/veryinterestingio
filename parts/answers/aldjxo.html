<p>At low temperatures (meaning below even many millions of Kelvin) nuclear physics becomes pretty insensitive to temperature. The thermal energy becomes far far less than the energy of a nuclear decay, so virtually all nuclear physics happening on earth (and even in most stars) is all effectively happening at zero temperature as far as the nucleus is concerned. </p>
<p>So for a radioactive nucleus there is a lower energy state available to the particles but there is also some barrier to reaching that state which gives you some tunneling probability. That probability, in turn, gives you an average lifetime (or half-life) for decay. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
