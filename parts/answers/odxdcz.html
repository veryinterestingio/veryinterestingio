		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Crossing fingers was commonly used as a sort of protective charm for warding off evil. This explains why people wishing you luck would cross their fingers, as well as why those breaking a promise would do it. Someone breaking an oath might often be swearing that oath by someone or something, with the implication that if they broke it some unspecified spiritual or karmic consequences would follow. By crossing their fingers they were symbolically attempting to ward off those consequences.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh my god this brings back good memories of nearly 8 years ago... I used to cross my fingers all the time for good luck back then. Never figured out if it worked tho.</p>
<p>I believe it was more of a superstition thing than anything, obviously. It was likely believed to ward off spirits. </p>
<p>When making a promise, it was probably meant to stop them from holding you to it. When trying for luck, it was probably to stop them from messing with your luck.</p>
<p>Personally, I always just believed it messed with life's RNG. That everything was luck based. To this day, I now know that while sometimes luck plays a massive role in life, sometimes you just can't change the outcome of something with luck. Same goes for superstitions. Sometimes evidence is needed before you can be sure it works.</p>
<p>Thank you stranger, for bringing back one my very few good memories. I bid you good day</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
