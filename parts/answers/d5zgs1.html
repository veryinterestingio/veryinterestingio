Pickled peppers are know as gauchitos or vinniepeps;
Pickled herring sometimes known as rollmops;
Pickled cabbage is sauerkraut;
The pickled relish known as chow-chow;
Pickled beets are inedible dogshit;
Pickled garbanzo beans are lurzjanni;

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit:  I realized my original comment did not explain the answer to the question, so I'm answering that in an edit here as well.</p>
<p>I'm not the only one to say this, but &quot;pickles&quot; is just short for &quot;pickled cucumbers&quot;.  Now we also use &quot;pickled [thing]&quot; so that we distinguish the pickled [thing] from the pickled [cucumbers].  (This is similar to r/le_petit_dejeuner's answer, like &quot;fries&quot; is short for &quot;french fried potatoes&quot;.</p>
<p>Original answer: This also has a language/cultural aspect.  In Russian, cucumber pickles are translated literally as &quot;salted cucumbers&quot; back into English.  In Indian cuisine, &quot;pickle&quot; is a whole other thing, basically a salted spiced mixture that contains oil as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
