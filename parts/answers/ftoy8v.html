		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>PhD in rabies here! Most warm blooded mammals share the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that rabies uses as its main entry receptor.</p>
<p>There are other entry receptors like NCAM and glutamate receptor.  Basically these factors are essential for a functional nervous system and rabies preferentially interacts with these factors to enter cells.    All warm blooded mammals need a functional nervous system.  Rabies does not infect cold blooded animals.</p>
<p>Another reason is the stealthy nature of rabies - it slowly replicates (1-3 months incubation period in humans) and is not expressed on plasma membranes. It is essentially hidden from the body by continuously internalizing its glycoprotein, making infected cells invisible to the immune system and infected cells burst a lot slower than what other viruses do.</p>
<p>A third reason is its ability to promote cell to cell spread by binding motor proteins and reorganizing infected cells to create cell surface projections.</p>
<p>Fourth reason is the simplicity of the virus - just five proteins and the virusâ€™s host binding partners are potentially not very specific - promiscuous binding as opposed to a lock-and-key binding.</p>
<p>There are many things we still do not understand but these points are what science reasoned so far.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that different types of viruses come with different host range. Rabies virus (RV) is a type of rhabdovirus, and many species from the rhabdoviridae family are associated with encephalitis infections (including rabies encephalitis) across extremely wide host range. We still don't fully understand how RV evolved into a notorious multi-host pathogen capable of infecting almost all mammals, but if you want to dig-in, I'd recommend check out this 2014 article on the role of viral evolution in RV host shifts and emergence:</p>
