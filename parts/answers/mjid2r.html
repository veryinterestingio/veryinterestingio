		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I was in Undergrad I took a 300 level microbiology lab, and one of the experiments that stuck with me more than anything was called: The Ubiquity of Microorganisms.</p>
<p>In short, we sectioned a cell-culture plate into 4 quarters. </p>
<p>For the first quarter we pressed a normal fingerprint. </p>
<p>For the second quarter we give our hands a normal 20 second wash with soap &amp; water.</p>
<p>For the 3rd we did a full 2 minute surgical scrub to the elbows.</p>
<p>For the 4th we dunked our fingers in 70% EtOH (alcohol) for 60 seconds.</p>
<p>The results: all four quarters cultured growth. There was a clear reduction in the amount of growth for each progressive sanitization step, but there was growth even after all that washing plus a soak in alcohol. Moral of the story is that sterility is functionally impossible in most practical circumstances that don't include an autoclave, the goal is sanitization.</p>
<p>As for creating a &quot;superbug&quot;. The short answer is no, because we don't use alcohol as a method to treat infections. The longer answer is yes, survival of the fittest says that some bacteria are more tolerant of harsh conditions (like a flood of alcohol) than others. The cells that survive the purge will pass on their tolerance, some will mutate to become more tolerant, and over successive cleansings tolerance is all but inevitable. Which is a long way of saying that well &quot;no&quot; it won't create a drug resistant superbug, it will become harder for hospital staff to maintain a sanitary environment which will cause hospital acquired infections to increase.</p>
<p>Wrapping the story back around, after that first microbio lab, over the subsequent weeks we isolated, cultured, and identified the bacteria colonies from our own thumbprints. Off the alcohol quarter I managed to culture Staph Aureus, which is common on most people's skin. We didn't test my sample for antibiotic resistance, but the most famous superbug is MRSA: Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to go against the majority here and say maybe. <a href="https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/452/eaar6115" target="_blank">Here's one study</a> that showed increasing resistance to hand sanitizer in <em>E.  faecium</em> over time in hospitals. There's also the existence of <em>C. difficile</em>, a notorious superbug that is not removed from your hands by hand sanitizer (or from surfaces by quaternary ammonium). Only soap and bleach work. <em>C. difficile</em> has been around longer than hand sanitizer, but I bring it up because its mere existence demonstrates a mechanism by which a bacteria can protect itself against hand sanitizer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If, somehow, a bacteria or virus gains some sort of advanced immunity or resistance to alcohol-based sanitizers, (which is unlikely, but let's say it's possible for the sake of argument), that doesn't mean it will become a &quot;superbug&quot;.</p>
<p>As was stated by another comment, alcohol disrupts cells in a different and kinda random way, whereas antibiotics typically specifically interfere with a specific chemical process a bacteria needs to survive.</p>
<p>I.e. one screws with the biomechanical structure of the cell, while the other works on a specific chemical reaction that the cell might be able to replace with something else.</p>
<p>To use a REALLY SIMPLIFIED analogy, it's the difference between a human being able to spontaneously evolve the ability to swim in lava uninjured, and spontaneously making the decision to not eat cake even though you like it, because eating cake has made all your buddies around you die.</p>
<p>Or, another analogy: Antibiotics make ONE PART of a machine not work, but you don't know if the machine will have a matching part.</p>
<p>Alcohol is like taking iron filings and pouring them into every gap of the machine, gumming up multiple things at once.</p>
<p><strong><em>Even if something did evolve immunities to alcohol, that doesn't mean that it will magically gain immunities or resistances to drugs that work in different ways</em></strong>.  Again, the best example is Malaria, which is now BASICALLY immune to the Quinine that was used to treat it, but is easily treated with antibiotics/antimalarials</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
