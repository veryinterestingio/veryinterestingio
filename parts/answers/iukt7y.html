		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is enough to determine that, with statistical relevance (2-3 standard deviations), that more people in the control group (placebo) contracted the virus than those in the test group.  With 30,000 participants, if 1% contracts COVID in a year, only 150 total participants can be expected to test positive in 6 months.  If half are in the control group and half are in the test group, then you can say with a measurable confidence that the vaccine is not effective.
The FDA has stated that 50% efficacy is required for certification.  If only 2 people in the control get COVID and 1 person in the test group does (say in the first few weeks of testing) this could mean 50% efficacy or it could just be a random chance based on many uncontrolled factors.  The more people you test and the more people contract your confidence of being correct goes up because it helps normalize the other variables (lifestyle, living conditions, etc.). If 60 people in the control group get COVID and only 2 people in the test group do, that would result in very high confidence that the vaccine is at least 50% effective.  If the vaccine is about 50-60% effective, it requires 151 cases (presumably 100+ in the control group and &lt;50 in the test group) to meet the confidence interval set by the FDA (which is not listed in the article).
The other option would be to test 100,000 people to speed up the analysis, but that increases risk of getting people sick with side effects on an untested vaccine- higher assumption of risk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because of how statistics works.</p>
<p>Obviously the best way to figure out percentages in a general population would be to do a study that involved literally everyone. But this is obviously impossible, and mathematically, turns out to not be necessary.</p>
<p>If you're not careful about how you select your sample size, then you're screwed. If you and your friends all love Cardi B, and you do a poll involving only your friends, you will incorrectly conclude that 100% of the country loves Cardi B. Which is a useless survey.</p>
<p>But if you truly randomly select 10 people from around the country, with no preference to location, gender, age, occupation, or anything, it turns out that your answer gets closer and closer to the actual answer you'd get if you had polled every last person.</p>
<p>For a population of 300 million people, you only need a sample size of about 1000 to be 95% confident that you are within 2-3% of the actual number. But this only works if your sample size is truly random within the population you are surveying for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's look at the expectation if the vaccine prevents 60% of the cases:</p>
<p>At the time there are 151 total COVID-19 cases you expect 151/1.4=108 cases in the control group and 0.4*108=43 cases in the group getting the vaccine. Most likely the real numbers won't be exactly 108 and 43, of course, but they will be somewhere around these two numbers. The chance to get 75 and 76 cases (&quot;no effect&quot;) by chance is really small. Even the risk to get numbers where you are not sure about the effect (let's say 80 and 70) is small. Where exactly they set the threshold is arbitrary and I guess it's written somewhere in their 135 page document, but with this threshold they need enough participants to expect 151 patients.</p>
<p>I don't know where exactly they do the tests. The US currently registers 35,000 new cases per day in a population of 340 million, or 1 per 10,000, let's say they sample them representatively. With 15,000 people in both groups you would expect at least 1.5 cases per day in the control group, most likely even more because that group will be monitored better than the population average. If that rate stays stable for 2 months they'll get ~100 cases in the control group and X cases in the vaccinated group. If it's 60% effective as they hope then we can expect ~40 cases in the vaccinated group, that's 140 in total, a bit short of the threshold. If the vaccine is better than 60% then it will be easier to demonstrate &quot;at least 60% reduction&quot;, even with fewer cases (e.g. 100 vs. 20 would be sufficient for conclusions). As an extreme case, if the vaccine is nearly 100% effective, then a single month of data-taking will give ~50 cases in the control group and ~0 cases in the vaccinated groups. You could be sure the vaccine is doing a great job (or someone fudged the numbers...) with way fewer than 150 cases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
