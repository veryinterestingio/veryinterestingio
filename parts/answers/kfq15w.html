		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just a correction: the AstraZeneca platform is NOT a &quot;classic&quot; vaccine platform. AstraZeneca (as are a number of others) are using a modified adenovirus platform and that platform has only been used in vaccine development for about a dozen years. It is highly unlikely that you or any significant number of people reading this have ever received an adenovirus-based vaccine.  Edit: here is a good review of the platform: <a href="https://www.intechopen.com/books/adenoviruses/adenoviral-vector-based-vaccines-and-gene-therapies-current-status-and-future-prospects" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.intechopen.com/books/adenoviruses/adenoviral-vector-based-vaccines-and-gene-therapies-current-status-and-future-prospects" target="_blank">https://www.intechopen.com/books/adenoviruses/adenoviral-vector-based-vaccines-and-gene-therapies-current-status-and-future-prospects</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There's also a level of risk present that many other vaccines don't necessarily face that could also factor into pricing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many reasons. </p>
<p>first of all, the time period for the development has been greatly shortened. Where we normally check if phase 1 works and than go to the next phase ect. We now have been testing several phases at the same time. This is very expensive because vaccines are made before we know if they work. Some of the vaccines did not work and are no longer in use. Those costs must be paid as well. Also our method changed. We use to adjust and weaken a virus to inject it in to ourself's. The adjusted virus is so weak that it wouldn't make us sick but our body would still make antibodies for the normal virus. Now we started with synthetic adjustments (artificially changing genetic codes in a lab) This also saves a lot of time.</p>
<p>Costs also often included fund's for studies in the future to keep the development going.</p>
<p>Methods of making, storing and processing medicines can also make a significant difference in price. A vaccine that needs to be kept at -20 is cheaper than a vaccine that should be kept at -70.</p>
<p>Also countries have already discussed agreements, contracts and offers with various supplier's. </p>
<p>And, policy matters a lot. AstraZeneka was developed by Oxford University and they have set the goal of making the vaccine suitable for everyone and supplying the vaccines at cost price. However, this is not a business structure that a regular company would survive.</p>
<p>The vaccines can be slightly different. One vaccine might work better on preventing people from getting sick, a other might work better on preventing contamination.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a rule, price of pharmaceuticals are not driven by the cost of goods sold. It is driven by the company's need to make money, in order to pay off early investors, hire an army of lawyers and lobbyists, and/or invest in future research and development.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>AstraZeneca priced its vaccine at $4 per dose, because they are distributing this vaccine at cost. They vowed not to make obscene profits from it. (Unfortunately, AstraZeneca's vaccine also appears to be the least efficacious, likely because they used a common cold virus to package the payload, and the recipient host's immune system will recognize the common cold virus envelope and clear the vaccine before the antigen therein gets presented by antigen presenting cells to the adaptive immune system.)</p>
<p>Pfizer priced its COVID-19 vaccine at $20 per dose, because this vaccine requires 2 doses, and influenza vaccines are traditionally priced at $40. Pfizer never got government funding for its vaccine development, so it is not under pressure to deliver the vaccine at cost. However, Pfizer is a vaccine veteran, and it is in this game for the long term, so it went with a justifiable price.</p>
<p>Moderna is floating different prices, depending on whom they talk to, and they have not been completely forthcoming. They had received substantial government funding. However, before their COVID-19 vaccine, they have been a struggling company with not much revenue. They are trying to maximize their vaccine price while remaining competitive. They probably figured that their vaccine is probably as effective as the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, and the distributors can save on transportation and logistics cost, so they can price their vaccine higher than the Pfizer vaccine while still remain price competitive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
