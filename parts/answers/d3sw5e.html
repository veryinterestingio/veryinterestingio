		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So your computer monitor is made up of square pixels. Trying to make round shapes out of square objects is going to give you jagged edges (thing about trying to build a circle in a game like minecraft). The jagged appearance of curved objects on a screen is called aliasing. </p>
<p>Anti-aliasing works to do the opposite of aliasing and make curved images look less jagged and smoother. It does this by adding a little blurred coloring in the pixels just outside edge of the curve, which makes the image seem smoother.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From the signal-processing perspective:</p>
<p>If you've watched a video of a car wheel or propellor spinning fast enough that it appears to spin backwards, due to it advancing more than a half-cycle per frame, you've seen something like aliasing - a high-frequency signal presenting itself as a low-frequency one.</p>
<p>(The half-cycle part also hints at why your sampling frequency must be more than twice your highest desired signal frequency - hence <del>60Hz monitors and</del> 44kHz audio sampling - sampling frequency being how often you record data. For more information, look up the Nyquist Sampling Theorem.)</p>
<p>In such a context, anti-aliasing is the practice of filtering out undesirable high-frequency signals before sampling, so that they don't appear as lower frequencies in the sampled data set (&quot;aliasing distortion&quot;).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of a screen like bricks on a wall. When your computer transfers a image onto those bricks, it has to fill a whole brick with color. This leaves a staircase-like jagged edge instead of a smooth looking one, this is called aliasing. Anti-aliasing takes those bricks along the edge, and mixes a bit of color information from those on either side to make the edge look smoother.</p>
<p>It's of course a bit more complex than that in practice, but that is the basic idea, to makes the edges of objects look smooth on a display.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, aliasing when a signal or image is changing too rapidly for how often you are sampling or displaying it.  So a tilted line on a computer screen might make you notice the “square pixels” forming a staircase. With audio it’s a weird effect where a pure high tone is muddled and generates lower frequencies that shouldn’t be there.</p>
<p>Anti-aliasing is when you smooth the signal first before sampling / displaying it.  In computer graphics that might create extra cost since you may need to generate points more densely than you output so you can get the best possible image after smoothing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a sheet of grid paper. Draw a circle by only filling in individual squares, no lines or curves, just fill in the squares. Looks pretty jagged right? Anti aliasing takes those jagged boxes and smooths them out to make a regular looking circle.</p>
<p>Different types of antialiasing use different techniques but they’re all trying to achieve a similar goal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
