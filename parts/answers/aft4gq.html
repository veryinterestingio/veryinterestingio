		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Drinking from a hole in the nipple where the stream and amount of liquid is regulated is much easier than drinking sips/gulps of water while lying down. When you drink water lying down, you are increasing the chance of aspirating water into your lungs, which increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia (serious for the elderly). Other risk factors are having the water go into your sinuses or Eustachian tube. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lay down, close your mouth and let spit collect in your mouth.  Swallow with your mouth closed and you don't have any problems.  </p>
<p>Sit up and drink from a glass while keeping your mouth open.  If you try swallowing with your mouth open you are going to have trouble doing so.  </p>
<p>It's not the position you are in that is the main problem.  It is whether you have air in your mouth.  Drinking from a bottle restricts air from getting into your mouth.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
