		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Delusions are heavily influenced by the surrounding culture. It is a disease of the mind, but the mind is shaped by experiences. </p>
<p>So if you grow up in a culture where, say, individual freedom is a central value, you're more likely to experience delusions about your personal freedom being violated. If you grow up in a highly religious community, you're more likely to have delusions around God and religion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Psychosis is a controversial topic within psychiatry, with different groups advocating for different theories of how it works. Some propose that it's a biological disorder and rooted in genetics and brain wiring, and others argue for a more socially oriented cause. A very high number of people with psychotic delusions have been shown to have experienced one or more forms of trauma in their life, with increasing trauma bringing higher chances of psychosis.

<p>The particulars of a person's traumas and experiences, and the way they're taught to relate to them and the resulting mental health issues may have a role in determining what the particulars of the delusion are. But it's still a debated topic.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey there, figured i’d thrown in my two cents.</p>
<p>To begin, i’m a high functioning schizophrenic and have been on an upward trend since age 12.</p>
<p>The problem in my eyes is the silent majority. Most everyone in and throughout my life have no idea because I’ve developed a series of coping mechanisms to blend into society for fear of being persecuted.
After a lifetime of searching for others like me, I’ve found a handful willing to share and they are much the same; just trying to get by with our heads down.</p>
<p>So that leads to the problem. Most people only have publicized or fictional representations of mental disease, like from popular cinema.</p>
<p>That documentary wouldn’t be half as interesting if the affected persons just stared at the corner of the room a bit longer than most people then went for a walk outside to “get away” from whatever they were experiencing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
