		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because trying to fall asleep intentionally requires that you pay attention to whether you are asleep yet or not.  Since you can't know whether you're asleep if you actually fall asleep, this means that you can't.  Eventually one of the contradictory actions will win out.  Either you will stop paying attention and fall asleep, or you will be unable to fall asleep because you can't stop thinking about it.</p>
<p>Sleeping unintentionally is far easier because sleep is a comparable process to breathing.  If you don't think about it, it just kinda happens automatically as needed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its probably because people put too much stress on themselves to fall asleep the exact moment they lay in bed. Most people find laying on the couch relaxing, and can thus sleep easier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
