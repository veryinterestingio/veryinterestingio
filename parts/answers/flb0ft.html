		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They certainly deplete the gut microbiome and in fact stomach issues are common with abx. Some bacteria escape due to a combination of factors, some are replenished from the appendix (turns out it is now thought to be a reservoir), and food. In bad enough cases some doctors even tell people have to eat probiotics (yogurt, live sauerkraut, otc high-dose).<br />
Sidenotes: the gut microbiome impacts us a lot, from mood to metabolism.  </p>
<p>Edit: I am getting several questions that relate to whether someone should take or not take or when to take probiotics. I ain't an MD and while I am a scientist with sufficient working knowledge on this subject given what I do (metabolism and chronobiology; yes, that involves the microbiome as well), my focus isn't probiotics. So I do not feel comfortable given any sort of advice.  </p>
<p>Edit 2:  Yes, there is debate about the efficacy of oral probiotics, I am well-aware, with a huge argument being survival of bacteria in the stomach being long enough to make it to the intestines. My understanding of this is that that is why most off-the-shelf probiotic cfu counts are too low to be effective, and why fecal transplants are a thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the antibiotics. For most of them, no they don't kill ALL gut bacteria, but still result in dysbiosis. You would need a very high dose of a very powerful antibiotics to delete all your microbiote. The body returns to normal through the alimentation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m doing my masters thesis on a related topic! I’m comparing the effect of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on C. difficile outcomes. C. difficile, or “deadly diarrhea”, is actually one of the most common healthcare-associated infection in the US and is responsible for over 200,000 infections and over 12,000 deaths per year. </p>
<p>A major risk factor for developing C. difficile infection (CDI) is prior use of antibiotics because they often do wipe out most, if not all, gut bacteria. The effect of this differs based on other risk factors as well (age, underlying conditions, recent hospitalization).</p>
<p>FMT takes the fecal matter of a donor with a healthy gut microbiome and use it to replenish the good gut bacteria in the CDI patient’s GI system. This can be done endoscopically or encapsulated. Some patients with severe CDI may need more than one FMT to resolve the infection. However, it does seem to be effective and is a relatively novel treatment in terms of a clinical timeline with lots of ongoing research.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably will get buried but I'm finishing my PhD and I study antimicrobial resistance in wastewater as a proxy for a community microbiome. I can talk a little bit about how the gut bacteria respond to antibiotics. This is such a cool topic, so great question! </p>
<p>TONS of studies exist in pretty much every species from earthworm to orangutan, with a lot of similar results. Essentially the gut microbiome is a super complex community of bacteria, some in competition and some working together. In the gut, and in most microbiomes, we see a thing called <strong>functional redundancy</strong>. This means that a lot of bacteria have the same metabolic functions - they use the same foods or produce the same products, but are not necessarily in competition. Higher gut diversity is protective.</p>
<p>When we take a broad-spectrum antibiotic, we have to take the whole course in order to <em>raise the concentration in our bodies up to a sufficient level for a sufficient amount of time</em>. With that first dose, we often don't reach the &quot;minimum inhibitory concentration&quot; of the drug, or the level that kills susceptible bacteria. Low levels of antibiotics can drive mutations for drug resistance. </p>
<p>So, we randomly push for mutations in ALL the bacteria, not just the harmful ones, but some have a better tendency to survive or are already inherently resistant... and this happens differently in every single person. Some bacteria survive antibiotic exposure, both the good and the bad, and these can repopulate the gut. </p>
<p>Now the gut has genes for antibiotic resistance, and the composition of the community is less diverse. Often the person doesn't experience negative side-effects because of the functional redundancy - all processes continue as normal, even if some species are entirely wiped out. The gut then can be repopulated overtime with the foods you consume (not just probiotics), the water you drink, and even the things you touch. </p>
<p>Sometimes, with reduced diversity your gut is more vulnerable - you no longer have the second string of bacteria that can help with essential processes. Other times too much gets wiped out and then the gut has trouble recovering essential functions of nutrient digestion and absorption. </p>
<p>Studies look at the impact of gut microbiome composition on obesity, depression, autism, mortality, cancer survival, bipolar, immune system strength, infants' growth rates, sleep quality, psoriasis, and more!</p>
<p>However, most studies suggest that above all, <strong>DIET MATTERS</strong>. Some studies show that eating foods high in alkaloids and inulin, in probiotic bacteria (like yogurt, kimchi, other fermented foods), and higher vegetable and fruit consumption, all promote gut diversity, which can restore gut health after antibiotics and can keep the gut healthy. </p>
<p>Sources: &quot;The influence of antibiotics and dietary components on gut microbiota&quot; Dudek-Wicher et al.; &quot;Distinct impact of antibiotics on the gut microbiome and resistome: a longitudinal multicenter cohort study&quot; Willmann et al.; &quot;Fecal microbial diversity and structure are associated with diet quality in the multiethnic cohort adiposity phenotype study&quot; Maskarinec et al.; &quot;Diet-microbiome-disease: investigating diet's influence on disease resistance through alteration of the gut microbiome&quot; Harris et al.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Diversity matters, diet matters. Eat more veggies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
