When you restart a PC, it does not shut down completely. </p>
<p>Someone used a metaphor for a chef so I'll use that too. Shutting down completely would be like if the chef cleaned up and went home. Holding the power button down to shut down faster would be like if the chef didn't clean up and just left a mess and went home. </p>
<p>Restarting the computer is telling the chef to clean up everything and then set everything back up without him leaving the building. So, it's not totally &quot;shut off&quot; in that sense because the chef is still there to set things back up, and he knew that was the plan in advance!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is additional story on software side of things.</p>
<p>For shutdown, Windows, for example, uses hibernation (save to disk) for a lot of kernel code instead of tearing it down, to speed-up next startup.</p>
<p>But for restart Windows makes complete teardown and rebuild of all kernel structures, because you usually request restart for updates and configurations, it's not a part of normal operation.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I understand how the physical power button works on old PC's to turn a computer on -- it actually made a physical connection to enable power. </p>
<p>But on a MacBook for example, you hold down the power key on the keyboard for a few seconds, which is totally different. </p>
<p>I assume that whenever the laptop is even slightly charged, or always when it's plugged in, some part of it is always on &quot;a little bit&quot; to detect pressing the power key?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, restart and shutdown are different and there are separate power level commands implemented by each. When restarting your computer doesn't shut down first.</p>
<p>When the computer is shutdown, the OS will send a shutdown command to the BIOS using the appropriate driver, the BIOS will then send a command to attached devices to place them in a safe working mode, hard drives will park their read write heads to avoid damage.</p>
<p>Once the devices report ready and everything is made safe the BIOS will send a signal to the power supply to terminate power to most attached devices and enter standby power mode.
Even when shutdown ATX and above will maintain a standby power to the motherboard when plugged in. This allows external devices to power on the machine.</p>
<p>Flicking the switch or removing the power cord will remove all power but the power supply itself remains charged with residual  current so never open it up.</p>
<p>During a restart devices such as the hard drive will not park and will continue to be active, certain POST operations may be skipped.</p>
<p>There is a special ATX power signal used to move from standby to full power. The cases switch is wired into a molex connector onto the motherboard, when you press the switch it operates the pins that generate this power signal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every CPU has a start up routine. Similar to a chef setting up his kitchen before he starts cooking (cleaning, placing the pots &amp; pans &amp; ingredients in the right location etc.) then he starts cooking.</p>
<p>The reset button just tells the CPU to start that routine. So to compare, let’s say the chef was in the middle of making pasta, but got a reset. He would clean his kitchen and start cooking from scratch again.</p>
<p>Well, what is the difference between an intitial boot and a reset? It is nothing. The list of activities that a CPU needs to do before it can start executing other programs is defined at a certain address. Let’s say $0000. When the computer is turned on, it is hardwired to start following instructions from address $0000 onwards. </p>
<p>During the execution of code, the processor keeps track where he is (same as following steps in a receipe) with a counter called a ‘program counter’. What the reset button is pressed, it writes $0000 to the program counter making the CPU think it was just turned on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
