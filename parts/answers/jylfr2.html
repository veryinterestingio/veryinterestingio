		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Audio for shows and movies isn't generally mixed for TV speakers. Movies especially. They're mixed initially for surround sound where dialog and main sounds get sent to a center channel, and effects and other noises come from other speakers around the room. If you watch a movie on a 5.1 surround sound system that's tuned for your room, you'll find you won't really deal with this issue anymore. </p>
<p>When re-mixing for a home release, they don't know what setup you're going to have, so they do what they can, but generally if you're using normal TV speakers, there's some software somewhere in the chain that's down-mixing the audio to just two (very shitty) speakers and it isn't doing a very good job. They aren't taking the time to go through the movie another 40 times listening to everything and manually adjusting volumes for a 7.1 mix, a 5.1 mix, a 4.1 mix, a 2.1 mix, a 2.0 mix, and a mono mix. They're just clicking a button in software to output a mix, and letting your (crappy) hardware at home deal with the mix. </p>
<p>There is also the fact that in many cases, audio engineers for a show are very rushed, and don't have time to give an ideal balance in volume to every channel before shipping the episode. </p>
<p>If you have some cash and feel like solving the problem, a mediocre AVR, a center channel speaker, and a L and R speaker will solve your issue almost entirely.</p>
<p>Some TVs also have software solutions that work okay, like volume normalization, or &quot;dynamic audio&quot; or something, but it will depend on the model of TV you have.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>dig thru TV/receiver settings for “dynamic volume” (receivers) or “reduce loud sounds” (apple TV, LG TVs). it’s called compression but goes by many other names; on a Denon receiver it was called “night mode” (low/medium/high) so you can look for that too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That specific thing isn't really an issue in the sense of being some kind of mistake.  By and large, it's their intent or artistic vision or whatever you want to call it.  If you set the volume so that the dialogue is at a comfortable level for you, then when there's gunfire or a car crash what you hear really is how loud they wanted the gunfire or car crash to be.</p>
<p>I don't particularly like it either, especially in theaters where the sound systems are powerful enough to make the loud parts downright oppressive.  But it's not a mistake or technical glitch; they're just making these movies for people who aren't you or me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like others have said it’s intentional to a certain degree but it also varies quite a bit depending on your set up as well as the medium of what you’re watching. Example: if you’re watching an older DVD the sound mix might be really poor, especially on modern equipment. Or if you are the type of person who uses their TV speaker for sound output, you’re not going to get a good sound experience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It can be that between the source of the video and your speakers, there is a miscommunication about what the final output is. The source of the video may see that what it is pushing sound to can accept 5.1 or more, but then the sound is decoded and pushed somewhere else as stereo or mono, but they only took the sound from the side speakers (explosions) and not the center front speaker (dialog).</p>
<p>I still get this from chromecast when it tells me that it's outputting 5.1, but I know that my tv has only stereo, though the TV seems to be able to handle it. Or the chromecast to my projector that is mono but I use the stereo out to a Bluetooth speaker.</p>
<p>It's hard to design to automatically account for all edge cases, but For some reason chromecast, and I guess others don't want to let users just choose mono or stereo audio out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
