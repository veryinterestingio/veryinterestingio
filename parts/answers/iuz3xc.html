		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is possible, there are actually bacteria and single felled organisms in extremely volatile places like vents on the bottom of the ocean that do survive using different chemical processes.</p>
<p>But when looking for life on other plants. We know life like us best, so we know what to start looking for.</p>
<p>Life that doesn’t function like we do, that’s completely foreign, is way harder to try to look for because we don’t know where to start looking</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's almost 900 degrees Fahrenheit or almost 500 degrees Celsius on the surface of Venus.  It would be difficult for chemicals of the complexity needed for life to stay together and not vibrate apart.  The temperature makes it unlikely to find life.</p>
<p>The huge temperatures are why few probes have been sent to the surface.  The Russians have been the only ones to successfully land on the surface with their Venera landers, although the longest any lander lasted on the surface was under 2 hours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't know any life that can survive at temperatures of 462 C.<br />
That's hot enough to melt lead, and is actually a minimum temperature on Venus's surface.<br />
The most we've ever seen life survive was 121 C.<br />
For now it makes more sense to check places we know life can survive first, then check the place we don't know if life can survive later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing no other commenters have touched on is energy availability. Oxygen is useful to us as organisms because it can react with other compounds to release energy, which we can then use. CO2 is basically oxygen that has already reacted and given energy off, so it's much harder to use for biological processes. Similarly, when you mix acid and water together energy is released as heat. This means that separating the water from the acid as any organism would need to do to survive (even the ones on earth that live in acid do this and filter out the acid) forces the organism to expend precious energy.</p>
<p>Basically, you can't just pick random chemicals and say you want to live off of them with clever new biochemistry. Oxygen will always be potentially useful to life because it can react with things; CO2 is quite unreactive and thus much less useful to biological systems. In a place like venus, the overall reactivity of things is much lower because it has already reacted or dissolved into the acid in the case of the atmosphere, so there is much less energy availabile. At the end of the day, you absolutely need energy to live as an organism, so venus is very inhospitable compared to earth. In research papers on speculative venusian biology, one way to work around this that has been suggested is photosynthesis. If organisms could use light for their energy, this makes the ambient chemical potential less relevant of a problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
