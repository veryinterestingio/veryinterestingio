		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a phenomenon called 'aliasing'. It happens when your brain can't keep track of which blade on the fan is which, or how far it had spun since your last perception of it. It also happens in film, when you would see spokes on wheels, or rotors on aircraft seem to spin at a much slower speed, or even backwards. In this case, it's due to the frame rate of the camera being close to some factor of the rpm of the wheel multiplied by the number of spokes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Itâ€™s a lot more prevalent in older movies as the cameras were slower. This also proves that we see things in a digital way, not analog or continuous.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't (usually) happen under natural or incandescent light.  It only happens in film/tv/monitors or with fluorescent/led light  (might be possible with flickering candles or fire,)  because they're on a frequency which shows (film) or lights a fan at such a rate that a blade is illuminated or shown closer to the other direction and we don't see the intervening frames.  Your brain fills in the motion as it's only seeing the frames.  </p>
<p>It's possible for you to see this under natural light as even your eyes/brain runs on a perception frequency somewhere around 60hz, though usually you just see a blur.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Artificial lights do not give out a constant stream of light. They actually pulse at about, in the United States, about 60 times a second. This is just an effect about how our electrical grids work, basically but regardless, the brightness of the element in the bulb that emits light will hit a bright point, gradually dim to its dimmest point, then gradually increase to its brightest point again, 60 times in one second, which is a rate we call 60 hertz, or hz. Human eyes actually can't detect pulses above, on average, 50hz, so to us it looks like one continuous stream of light.</p>
<p>Your fan blades also spin at some frequency which is not usually exactly 60hz. The manufacturer will generally set up the electronics to run at one of three speeds they rate as safe and effective for their device to run at. It almost doesn't need to be said, but if the fan were spinning at a rate of 60hz, that would be like running your car at 3600 RPM constantly. It would take a lot of energy, and be very loud, and probably wear out the device quickly. Fan blade rotation speed varies based on manufacturer or length, but in general it seems to be about 400 RPM for a small ceiling fan, or lower for larger ones. That's just below 7hz.</p>
<p>So now we have 3 different frequency rates involved. Light peaks at a rate of 60hz. The blades spin at 7hz. And your eyes see at approximately 50hz (but kind of smooth out what you see so that it's not completely sensical to account for what's going on JUST at that rate, but it doesn't mean it doesn't come into effect).</p>
<p>We have a sort of 60:7:50 ratio of what's going on. The pulse of the light has gone through just over 8 and a half cycles in the time it takes the fan blade to turn once, while the fan blade has made only 14% of its trip in the smallest amount of time your eye can detect, which is approximately a 50 degree rotation. But if all 5 blades are identical and spaced an even 72 degrees apart, it actually looks like in that time the fan has gone 22 degrees in the OTHER direction.</p>
<p>This is called aliasing. That's the name for any kind of effect where two or more patterns with different ratios cause weird effects at points where those ratios don't line up neatly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>reverse-rotation effect</p>
<p>Assume the positions 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</p>
<p>Now when the wheel rotates it goes from 1 to 2 then 3 and so on to 9 then back to position 1</p>
<p>Now if i am clear, we move on to next step where the wheel (at position 9) going fast enough takes the position 8 instead of position 1, from position 8 it goes to 7, 6 and so on back to 1 then again 9, 8 , 7 ,6 and so one</p>
<p>There comes a time when this effect just stols happening after a few rotations and the wheel goes back to going in the conventional direction of 1 2 3 4 ... 9</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
