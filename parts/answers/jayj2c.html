		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is Paleontology still a viable career choice for students of this generation? I guess what I'm asking is, how much more out there in the world is waiting to be discovered? Do those discoveries still require the skill set of a Paleontologist graduate, or are other fields able to do the same job?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there's a burning question I've wondered since about May.</p>
<p>How do you determine if you have all the bones of a particular species, and more importantly, decide what that species might look like?</p>
<p>I'm quite curious on the process, and I imagine it's a group effort.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cool thanks to all for doing this.</p>
<p>My question is regarding the recently unearthed Nodosaur that is almost complete and has flesh and skin.  </p>
<p>What do you think is the likely reason or series of events that allowed it to survive so intact?  Or why are most finds much more deteriorated than this one is?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay hereâ€™s a weird one for the sake of personal interest: When I die I want to be placed in an area or situation that would have the best chance to fossilize my body for future paleontologists (because why not). What burial conditions would be optimal for an attempt at fossilization?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
