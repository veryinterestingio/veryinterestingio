<p>Improvements in technology have vastly influenced thermometers but nothing really impacting weather station temperature measurements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: Back in 1843, Joule was able to measure temperatures with a precision of 1/200th of Fahrenheit degree (<a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rstl.1850.0004" target="_blank">source</a>). Such accuracy was not commonplace (nor needed) in weather stations, but technology was available for fractions of degrees.<br />
For the record, the gentleman needed extreme precision to measure the equivalence between work and heat. As the son of a brewer, he knew how to monitor and keep constant the temperature of a room, which allowed him to quantify the tiniest temperature elevation of water when work was applied to it. Just to hint at the awesomeness of the prowess, the dude providing the work had to be replaced regularly to ensure his body heat from the exercise wouldn't influence the water temperature meters away.<br />
One century later, scientists trying to reproduce his experiment had a lot of trouble reaching such precision (source: an epistemology lecture I took).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, a thermometer could be very well calibrated back then. </p>
<p>However the recording method was significantly less well “calibrated.” It was likely just a guy looking at a thermometer and writing it down by hand. The thermometer could be perfect, and human errors could still exist. </p>
<p>A human could misread the thermometer, or misread his own handwriting. Or you could just have 1 thermometer that was poorly calibrated by humans. </p>
<p>Today, the temperature is recorded by multiple thermometers that are constantly checked for calibration, and the results are recorded by computers, and cross checked against other readings where anomalies would be immediately apparent. </p>
<p>I’m not saying that the 1913 reading was wrong, necessarily. Just that there was more opportunity for errors back then, despite the fundamental reliability of the science behind thermometers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While not exactly what you are asking, there is another portion that needs to be considered, and that is the thermal mass of the cities. given the expanse of roads and buildings, and their ability to trap heat from the sun, that can also be giving us much different readings today than they would have had 100 years ago. we could also look at all the heat vented outside, from air conditioners running and find they have a non negligible temperature increase.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
