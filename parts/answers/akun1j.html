		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work A/V for athletics at my college - whenever we have a press conference we set up two mics for redundancy both ran to a press box (basically a splitter that all the news outlets can get a feed from). 90% they still want to put their mic at the podium and the camera op always says their boss requires them to get their mic flag in the shot (the flag is the box around the microphone that has station logos).</p>
<p>I'm sure for most other cases/events it is so that they have full control over their feed when a professional audio company isn't involved to reliably split the feed. i.e. you never see multiple mics at the presidential inauguration because there is a pro company there that splits the feed from several strategically placed podium microphones to about 50+ news outlet destinations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't always.  Sometimes there is a press box setup where the camera crews remove the radio transmitter from their microphone and insert it into a jack, and get a common feed.  This would be pretty typical of any large scale type press conference, and works out well since people can come and go when they want without going up to the podium.  If there's not a formal setup with something like that, then there's really not much of a choice but shoving a whole bunch of wireless mics up on the podium.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
