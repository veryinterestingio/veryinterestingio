		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An organized effort of people and resources to generate fake grassroots political movements. For example maybe I own a cheese cracker factory and I want to put my competitor out of business. Instead of competing with him fairly, I decide to pay a hundred people to start a website and digital marketing campaign accusing his company of using an illegal chemical to get the orange color in his crackers. The fact that he doesn't use this chemical at all is of no concern to me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Grassroots&quot; describes when the people in a community start a political movement by themselves, without any outside help, like the democratic or republican party for instance.  It describes a movement that has many small roots, like a field of grass, rather than one large source of power, like a tree.  Grassroots movements are somewhat rare, but can be very powerful.  Occupy Wall street and the Tea Party were both grassroots movements.  </p>
<p>AstroTurf is a brand of fake grass, so astroturfing is when someone tries to fake a grassroots movement.  A large political organization might buy fake twitter accounts to tweet their hashtag, organize &quot;local&quot; protests all across the country. The idea is to make their political position seems like it's popular with the general populace of the country, even when it's not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Makes that thing appear more popular than it actually is.</p>
<p>You'll often hear it used in politics to accuse one side of buying supporters to make their movement seem more genuine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
