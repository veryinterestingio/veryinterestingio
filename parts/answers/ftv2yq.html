		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they can be, though they aren't always. </p>
<p>Let's consider a department store like Macy's or Belk.  These stores do an enormous amount of business in November and December... right around the time a calendar year system would have them trying to close out their books.  Fiscal Year closing is a huge deal and having it happen during your busy times is a recipe for disaster. </p>
<p>At the same time, business dries up considerably for them by the end of January.  So in both cases they run a fiscal year that runs Feb 1 to January 31st.  Because that way they are closing out their books during a slow time AND they are capturing their biggest months for each fiscal year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of business is highly seasonal in a way that doesn't line up well with the calendar year. This is particularly true for public companies that need to report quarterly earnings. The ability to concentrate bad periods or spread them out as they see fit by simply moving the reporting period is why some companies do it.</p>
<p>The US government also has an interesting reason. It starts in the late fall to allow a newly seated Congress time to pass a budget but not so much time that that a Congress only gets to pass one (as it would if the fiscal year ended with the calendar year). A lot of federal contractors and state governments follow on because the federal government is important to their business.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A fiscal year for a company can either follow the calendar year or not. </p>
<p>For some companies, choosing a particular month as the end of a fiscal year makes sense because it is during a slow period, so people who spend many hours working to finalize yearly reports have extra time to do so.  </p>
<p>There are many other reasons to have a fiscal calendar that is different.  The point is that a fiscal calendar is purely a financial tool and there is no reason to have it match the calendar year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Side note that companies who use fiscal years (FY) use the same 12-month period every year (say July 1 through June 30).  So from year-to-year, you are comparing the same time period.  Important fact if there is a seasonality to the business.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
