The theory is that humans have different circadian rhythms and there was an evolutionary advantage for this as people who lived in groups and fell asleep at different times could keep watch at different times</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi there I did my PhD thesis on circadian rhythms and addiction. There are differing chronotypes (what time you naturally wake up) and this is now just becoming more understood genetically. There is strong evidence that chronotypes may be heritable from one or both parents. They are shown to be heritable in fruit flies so it's likely the understanding of mammals is coming soon enough (if not already I'm not current over the last 2 years). The difference in fruit flies is the length of a particular gene.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know the official answer, but I’m a neuroscience major and we recently learned that there are genes implicated in those who are “morning people” and those who are not. It has to do with their brain being more functional on less hours of sleep as opposed to those who needed to sleep longer to have the same functionality.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Body temperature and other physiological variables follow the day-night cycle of the earth. This phenomenon is called &quot;circadian cycles&quot;. Research has shown that human psychomotor and cognitive performance fluctuates with the circadian cycles.
There is a large variability between individuals regarding the peak performance moment of the day. Roughly, some people are morning birds and others are night owls, and everything between those two.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
