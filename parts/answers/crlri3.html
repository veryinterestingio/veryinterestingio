		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Lazy eye&quot; is sometimes used to describe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabismus" target="_blank">strabismus</a> (eyes target different points in space) and sometimes used to describe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblyopia" target="_blank">amblyopia</a> (both eyes can physically see but the brain only uses one of them). Amblyopia is that &quot;brain fixing it&quot; you're asking about, and it can often result from childhood strabismus. Adults who develop strabismus will often experience double vision instead (two offset views of the scene). This technically increases the field of vision, but it tends to be pretty confusing data that's hard for them to use.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My left eye is the lazy one, I have insane field of view on the left side however, I can only read with my right eye. My brain only learnt to really use the right when identifying things. When driving the &quot;off to the left&quot; view sometimes gets projected over my good vision, it's confusing - I will see cross traffic over my lane. The other downside of this side view is, let's say my left eye spots something moving like a fly, it might get projected onto what my right eye sees. So I see things that aren't actually in front of me but appear so. It sucks when you're looking for something, your left eye might see it but when you focus it's gone because it was off to one side. When I focus it comes right again. You do get a lot of headaches and you have no ability to see in 3d! and yes double vision is what you can describe a lot of this as.</p>
<p>edit: so no, you don't actually get a better field of view, great peripheral vision on one side for me, technically a smaller FOV.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can answer your question with something that happened to me yesterday. </p>
<p>My right eye is a lazy eye. I think my brain compensates for this by making my left eye my dominant eye. Meaning most of the time I see the field of view my left eye sees. My right eye view is more or less just peripheral vision. </p>
<p>Yesterday I was trying to look behind the sofa to see if a plug was fully connected to the outlet but the wall was in my way and I couldn't get my head far enough back to see the little gap between the sofa and the wall. I could just barely see the plug but not enough to see if it was plugged in. The right side of my head was against the wall so I closed my left eye. Then I was able to see my right eye's field of view which allowed me to see the plug clearly. It looked pretty much like if I had moved an inch or so to the right as if the wall wasn't in my way. </p>
<p>So yeah I have different fields of view between my eyes. My glasses mostly correct this but when I go for a bit without wearing them I get a weird kind of double vision that makes focusing on things and reading difficult.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had a bad lazy eye as a toddler... some muscle in my eye was surgically cut so that both of my eyes appear looking straight ahead.</p>
<p>I can control which eye I am using, but can really only effectively use one at a time. </p>
<p>I primarily use my right eye for everything.  When I consciously switch to my left eye, my right eye pulls in and is looking at my nose.... so essentially if I’m not using my right eye it goes to its default position as a lazy eye looking inwards.</p>
<p>I cannot see those infamous 3D posters from the early 90s (man I felt left out) and 3D movies today I can’t see, but with rapid switching between eyes I can get the gist “Oh, they made that snake jump out towards us”. </p>
<p>I do not have accurate depth perception, but learned that my brain is very good at using light/shadow, and nearby objects to determine distance. </p>
<p>Fun fact: When you get your drivers license and look into that device to test your vision... half the letters/numbers are displayed to one eye, the other half to the second eye. Thankfully it was habit by the time I was 16 to preemptively rapidly switch back and forth between each eyeball whenever I was facing any kind of vision test...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi,  I have both and can control my vision since birth.  Yes and no is the answer.  While I do have “lazy eye” in both eyes, I can control it (unless I’m really tired) and it actually does give me better peripheral vision.  My left eye floats up and left and my right floats right and down, but never at the same time.  I can switch between looking out through either eye, buy my right eye is dominant. (I always see the right side of my nose without looking). Which does leave me with a kind of blind spot that my brain makes up for.  </p>
<p>Also, as I age, I am loosing control but again, only when sleepy or the lighting is too low.  I have been told that it will only get worse for me until one day one eye finally takes over.  Most likely my right.</p>
<p>Now, while my eyes are lazy, they actually point in the same direction.  I have had 20/20 vision up until about six years ago (I’m 50 now) and since have used transition lenses for reading and using the computer.  I am far sighted now so I don’t need them for driving or watching TV.  </p>
<p>Any more questions, feel free to ask.</p>
<p>Edit:  One more thing, I have TERRIBLE depth perception because each eye fights for control.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
