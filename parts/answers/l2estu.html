		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, I'm not 100% sure on this. Generally, it's cephalopods, so like octopi, squid, cuddlefish, that have the largest learning capacity for invertebrates. But insects/arthropods aren't widely studied on this. I would think hymenoptera, specifically your social colony ants, bees, and wasps, would probably be at the top. They have a lot more information to constantly process and have been shown coordination for cooperative tasks, like when Japanese honey bees kill an intruding wasp. </p>
<p>Research also indicates that jumping spiders are fairly intelligent and have self recognition in mirrors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a hard question to answer. A good first guess might be: what arthropod has the largest volume? After all, the elephant has the most neurons among land animals.</p>
<p>The largest land arthropod is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconut_crab" target="_blank">coconut crab</a>. This paper estimates the neuron count of part of the brain (the protocerebrum and deutocerebrum): <a href="https://frontiersinzoology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-9994-7-25/tables/1" target="_blank">Brain architecture of the largest living land arthropod</a></p>
<p>That part alone has over 1M neurons.</p>
<p>One might ask: What about ocean arthropods? The largest is either the American lobster or the Japanese spider crab. As far as I can tell, these probably have O(100k) neurons, but why there is such a difference, I'm not sure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animals_by_number_of_neurons" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_animals\_by\_number\_of\_neurons" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_animals\_by\_number\_of\_neurons</a></a> , the octopus has 500,00,000;  this is almost as much as a dog.   Ant is about 250,000, honey bee is 960,000.   Jumping spiders have about 100,000 (according to <a href="https://www.livescience.com/48442-jumping-spider-brain-science.html" target="_blank">this</a>).</p>
<p>It seems reasonable that if not the highest, the octopus is up there.  However, by one count, 300,000,000 of them are in ganglia in the arms, so does that still count?  It appears so, based on behavior studies, but their brains are quite different from ours.</p>
<p>Edit:  As pointed out below, the octopus doesn't count because it's not an arthropod.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
