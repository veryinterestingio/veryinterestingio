		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The phone has either a small separate chip, or a tiny extra circuit inside one of its chips which is basically the same thing as a cheap digital watch - known as a Real Time Clock (RTC) and it's used purely to keep &quot;real&quot; time (in human terms) because computer chips use their own internal &quot;ticks&quot; which are millions of times faster and not necessarily synchronised with the &quot;wall clock&quot; time.</p>
<p>That little RTC will run either from the phone's battery or perhaps a tiny extra battery or super-capacitor, using a tiny amount of power to keep time even if the phone is off. Often, the RTC can also have its own internal alarms, for example to wake the phone's main chip up every so often to check the network or similar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
