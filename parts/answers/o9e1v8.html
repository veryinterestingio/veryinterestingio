<p>If your brain notices that &quot;nothing important happens right now&quot; it figures it's the perfect time for a nap. So especially long straight highways are very tiring.</p>
<p>For the driver some mental exhaustion of having to pay attention without breaks is added. Mental work can make you tired too</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our bodies are adapted to maintaining balance. When walking we are basically constantly falling with style, tipping over from one leg to fall in the direction we intend. Even while sitting our bodies are automatically processing our position and movement to keep from tipping over.</p>
<p>Normally when sitting this is pretty simple because we don't move. However when driving our bodies are continually being subjected to momentum which can sometimes be confusing. Our brains are processing those forces and directing our muscles to make micro-adjustments to compensate. All of this requires some level of ongoing attention and activation of our muscles which can be tiring even when we don't remember doing much at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>for drivers it can be 2 reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>monotony, which is explained in another reply.</p>
</li>
<li>busy traffic. When you're driving in busy traffic you get a lot of information input to respond to (aka a lot happens around you). Each car switching lanes, braking, accelerating, turning off or on to the road you are using generates an input for your brain to take care of. Your brain having to work that hard makes it grow tired which causes you to start to feel sleepy.</li>
