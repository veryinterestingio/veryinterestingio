The idea that they can drink contaminated water and not be affected is a myth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They really can’t though. Many animals do get sick but you don’t see that part. Also, not all muddy water is contaminated, believe it or not, sometimes it’s just muddy. </p>
<p>The fact that you have to deworm your dog so often but never have to deworm yourself tells you pretty much the whole story, yeah?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can only provide relevant anecdotes. </p>
<p>I live by a river and our dog drinks from the river and surrounding puddles and pools from time to time. Over the last 4 years he has gotten Giardia (a water-born parasite) twice. The vet says it is not very common but it happens. I can only describe it as super diarrhea that does not go away without treatment. If he had been a wild animal he would not have made it. </p>
<p>Our previous dog of 15 years. Had the same lifestyle and never had diagnosed Giardia. Both could be described as working/sporting dog mixes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It comes down to what threats our immune systems have 'learned' to handle.</p>
<p>The animals you see drinking dirty water have been drinking that water since day one. Their parents (and importantly their mothers) drank the water. This means their body was exposed to the bad bacteria in there, and 'recognises' it very quickly.</p>
<p>We have been brought up drinking clean water. Our bodies will be a little slower at fighting bad bacteria they don't recognise, which gives dangerous infection a chance to take hold.</p>
<p>More in depth:</p>
<p>The immune system works in two ways: first, there's a general defense - things like fever, sneezing, and inflammation - that works decently well at fighting off a lot of stuff. Then there's the targeted part of the immune system. When your body discovers a new bad bacteria or virus, it learns the shape of it, and can create specialist 'shock troopers' if you will, whose only job is to track that baddie down and kill it. These specialists can be ramped up really fast once they're trained. They're the reason why, for example, most people only get chicken pox once. </p>
<p>When a baby is born, they inherit some of the specialists shock troopers from their mother. These specialists are only temporary though. They're there to provide some protection while the baby's immune system gets trained up, and learns to make its own shock troopers.</p>
<p>So, if animals are running into the same bad bacteria as their parents, they've got protection enough to learn how to defend themselves. On the other hand, if a new bad bacteria appears in an area, or an animal finds itself somewhere with different bad bacteria, there's a good chance it will get very, very sick from dirty water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
