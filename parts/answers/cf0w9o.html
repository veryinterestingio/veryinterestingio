<p>But to add to that, if the lawn has actually been recently fertilized sometimes all it takes is one pee and you have a totally burned out section of grass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is nothing better for grass than urinating in the rain on it. </p>
<p>Male dogs cock their leg to pee, this is great for grass.</p>
<p>Bitches squat down, so the pee is concentrated, this is (initially) too much for the grass and it goes yellow but after a rain or two that grass will come back greener and more invigorated than ever.</p>
<p>If you watch a dog, how he is drawn to clumps of taller grass because they are a visual clue as well as a scent-clue, because that grass has been fed more nitrogen by many dogs peeing there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If it is spread out it is quite good for fertilizer, especially if you drink lots of water. If it is too concentrated, and you put it all in one spot, it's too harsh. That's why I piss walking backwards, while waving my hose back and forth...for the environment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
