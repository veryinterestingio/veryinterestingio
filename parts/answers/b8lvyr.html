The pilot(s) need to do everything in their power to arrest speed prior to impact with the ground. Fortunately, unless the rotors are completely wrecked, there is usually a lot that the pilot can do to minimize the impact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An ejection seat is perfectly possible on a helicopter.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamov_Ka-50" target="_blank">Russian KA-50</a> has an ejection seat.  It works by blowing the rotors off before ejecting the pilot.</p>
<p>Sikorsky has used a similar system in one of their experimental helicopters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I'm not mistaken some military helicopters do have the ability to block their rotors and use an ejector seat.</p>
<p>Not sure if it's widespread or still in use.</p>
<p>Other helicopters can autorotate (&quot;float&quot;) down.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Helicopters can autorotate, which means they use the big propeller on top to slow themselves down and land somewhat safely.  To do that, they switch the way the blades are facing so the air going by as they fall makes the blade rotate, then switch them back to make them lift the helicopter.</p>
<p>Some military helicopters, though, do actually have an ejection seat.  The same control that fires the ejector also fires explosive bolts that release the rotors, so they fly off before the pilot can hit them.  (I learned that from an Apache pilot at an air show.)  They try really hard not to use that system, but if they're too badly damaged to autorotate, it's better than just hitting the ground.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
