For example &quot;Parts of the United States have less rainfall on weekends, while Germany gets more rain at the end of the week.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wow this thread is a train wreck. Here's a straight forward answer from an atmospheric scientist. There aren't any global periodicities due to the work week simply because the Earth is big and a week is small. However, there absolutely are local periodicities due to the work week. Pretty much any pollutant (CO2, NOx, O3, etc.) is higher on weekdays than the weekends. Whether these variations in pollution affects other aspects of weather (rain and stuff), is contentious and probably unknowable. The problem is that there is already a very strong periodicity of 7-10 days that overwhelms whatever small affect we might have.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily in climate, but my town is on a hydroelectric tailwater. We have trout in the river and a state fisheries biologist theorized that the power generation releases, as they were being conducted, were limiting the trouts growth. The dam is a peak power generator so only produces electricity on weekdays when business requires it most. This biologist examined the otolith bones from the trouts heads that are very sensitive to growth conditions in how the bone there is deposited. This bone can be read like the rings on a tree. Under a microscope, you can see the generation schedule of the dam etched in the otolith bones of the trout from the river below it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not on a global scale. Though at work, we have instruments on our building that read trace gas column amounts in the atmosphere. They’re sensitive enough to show increases of nitrogen dioxide during the time when people generally drive in to, or out of work. But for it to affect the global climate, that’d require so many emissions to do that we’d suffocate ourselves pretty quickly</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
