		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>LSD is a molecule that is almost like seratonin, but not quite. Seratonin isn't just &quot;the happy hormone&quot;, it's a really common molecule used to communicate between neurons. LSD molecules bind to the same receptors in your brain, but because they're a little wrong, they cause your neurons to work kind of wrong, and it results in weird conscious experiences.</p>
<p>It can result in weird sensory hallucinations (visual and auditory), and that's what's usually depicted as trippy rainbow prism stuff. But it also affects other stuff in your brain (which can be positive, or negative). So you shouldn't take it expecting just a fun light show.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone that has done a number of different psychedelics hundreds of times over a twenty five year period, I can say that I've never had this happen or heard of this happening from anyone that I've talked to or tripped with.  I believe there is something individual about each experience/person, and it may just be how your body metabolizes psychedelics. </p>
<p>One thing that happens to me that I've never heard from anyone is the temperature of my nose drops to well below regular body temp.  Under the influence of LSD or mushrooms or MDMA, it's like ice.  It's how I can tell when things are kicking in. It feels so cold that I wonder how it's not dropping off my face and people honestly recoil in shock when they feel it.  I've never had a problem or complication from it that I know of.</p>
<p>Honestly it sounds like your description is taken straight from a 1970s anti-drug PSA, but if you insist that this is your experience (I am completely suspending any disbelief here and can understand that you could actually have this effect) then I would just chalk it up to the way your chemical makeup interacts with these compounds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_gating" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_gating</a></p>
<p>&quot;Sensory gating describes neurological processes of filtering out redundant or unnecessary stimuli in the brain from all possible environmental stimuli. Also referred to as gating or filtering, sensory gating prevents an overload of irrelevant information in the higher cortical centers of the brain.&quot;</p>
<p>my speculation:
the reason we don't see rainbows everywhere is because our eyes are attuned to be able to see light a certain way and filter out unnecessary information when your on something like LSD, the way your brain filters out information changes, also your pupils dilate which increases light sensitivity so the worlds lookin a bit different and your brain is just taking in all the data and trying to process it.</p>
<p>so like the lights there but just not at certain levels of perception.
the reason we see rainbows is due to increased humidity in the atmospere, the water in the air isn't creating a rainbow its magnifying and bringing it into focus. </p>
<p>or i could be completely wrong idk I dropped out of highscool</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>LSD more often than not does not make you &quot;see rainbows&quot;, movies and TV have dramatically skewed many peoples impression of the drug and what it does. The hallucinations produced by LSD more warp your perception of depth and shape as well as make colors more vivid and vibrant, imagine sitting calmly in nature and watching it breathe while the colors of your surroundings are more intense than usual.</p>
<p>Yes if you take a considerably large dose of LSD it can produce much more intense hallucinations, but standard doses that people who know what they're doing take will not make you think you're walking on Mario karts rainbow road.</p>
<p>A lot of confusion about this also comes from people who say &quot;well I/my friend took some acid and it was nuts and did all these crazy things&quot; and more often than not the &quot;acid&quot; they took is some off-brand research chemicals sold on paper as &quot;LSD&quot;. The majority of real, high quality LSD vanished from production in the 90s when a major lab was busted, now adays unless you're well connected you are not buying real LSD. Movies, TV, and research chemicals have now mislead many people about what LSD is like.</p>
<p>If you want an <em>ok</em> example from a movie of what real LSD is kind of like watch the tripping scene from Taking Woodstock (<a href="https://youtu.be/4XHySKsPa3M" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/4XHySKsPa3M</a>), take note of how at about 3:00 the images on the tapestry above them seem to shift shapes and colors but not in an overwhelming way.</p>
<p>I have a feeling this thread is going to lead to a lot of speculation and misinformation</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
