		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you start a car, the twist of a key actually automatically activates many separate systems. First it powers the electrical system to many critical components. Fuel pump. Engine control unit. Ignition system. Then if you continue twisting the key it engages the starter motor, and starts the engine. You release the key and all of the systems keep the engine running. </p>
<p>In an aircraft all of these critical flight systems are isolated on different switches, and often have multiple backups (fuel pumps, ignition systems, hydraulics, air pressure, different sources of power for the electrical system, totally separate electrical systems). There is a redundancy and level of safety here that lets a pilot troubleshoot and select or de-power systems individually in the event of a failure while in flight or on the ground. Hence the complexity of starting. It requires a certain order of operation to bring everything online to start a plane.</p>
<p>EDIT: Some seriously good discussion here about aircraft. A couple of points to make. Are we talking about starting the engines only, or taking an aircraft from cold and dark to ready to taxi? I agree that FADEC systems allow an automated start. But even then you still have to at least turn on the battery master. And even if the aircraft could be fully automated, that wouldn’t preclude the need to check and verify that everything is working and set appropriately. Also, automated systems are their own system  that needs to be monitored with the possibility of failure (MCAS). I’m not making an argument one way or another, thanks for the discussion.</p>
<p>EDIT 2- One final comment guys. Many people have said this, and I will agree. A fully automated, one touch button start aircraft, complete with systems integrity monitoring is technically possible. And in small drones you can actually find this technology today. The question is, is this acceptable, is this safe, and how can we determine the risk going forward. Commercial air travel is by far the safest method of travel in the world today. It’s a really really high bar to even meet. Getting technology to match that level could be coming in the future, but it’s going to be a long and slow implementation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Speaking from gliding plane experience which doesn't have an engine and yet I still have to do a 5 minute checklist.</p>
<p>Part of the check list is just checking if the damn button works. Does the rudder stick move fully in all directions? Do the flaps move when I move the rudder? Does the brake work? Does the cable release work? Do all the instruments do their job properly? Is it pointing north? Does the radio work?</p>
<p>I have to pull everything at least once. I have to put every instrument on zero, even if it's already on zero.</p>
<p>I really don't want to be 800m up in the air and learn I can't steer right or that my landing flaps don't work.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And gliding is easy compared to actually powered flight. Also I'm alone and not responsible for 200 people's lives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tldr: It's more or less a checklist to make sure all systems are working properly.</p>
<p>Some of it may include adjusting the instruments on the dash so the readings are correct based on weather conditions and compass readings from the ground. Radio check on all the radios. Listening to the weather forecast and writing it down. Depending on the aircraft, you may need to prime the engine, start it up, check and make sure it acts as expected when you adjust things. Make sure back up systems are working well. Make sure all the control surfaces, flaps, evelons, rudder is working. Check the exterior lights work. Check to make sure all the sensors, radars, and other equipment is working. Hydraulics and back up hydraulics. Cabbin compression, emergency equipment. Navigation equipment.</p>
<p>That's about all I can think of, but it's quite a lot.</p>
<p>Almost every thing on a commercial plane is going to have main systems and back up systems. You want to check it all out before flying.</p>
<p>Even after the plane starts moving you have to check a few other things, like the brakes and throttle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlR0mszVIng" target="_blank">Newer high-end airplanes</a> do have automated start sequences.  Technically it isn't too difficult, it's just that it requires a computerized sequencer to operate all the switches and valves based on inputs from other instruments.  When you have critical equipment run by a computer you have to go through a painful, long, expensive process to qualify the software and hardware.</p>
<p>I work in nuclear.  Software QA is similar -- usually easier to deal with ancient instrumentation than find something with acceptable software QA.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Airbus pilot here. We have 2 switches to start the airplane, the first is to tell the computer we want to start the engine and the second initiates the start sequence. I flew Boeing before and they have a more complicated sequence, but without going into too much detail the Airbus way is just better.</p>
