		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Metal and ice can get equally cold. They get as cold as the freezer they're in. Ice has a greater heat capacity than most metals, meaning it stays cold for longer, and there is a large latent heat when it melts, which means it absorbs a lot of heat from the ambient water without changing its own temperature as it melts. This allows it to cool down water by warming and melting more than the same size cube of metal could.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Besides the scientific reasons already mentioned there are plenty of practical reasons why a bar would not want to use metal ice cubes.</p>
<p>They need to buy them instead of making them, they need to keep a certain number of them (they will go missing) they need to be collected and cleaned (not easy to see if they're clean like ice or glass), they might add a bad taste to the drink, they might degrade over time, they present a health risk (choking, teeth chipping, ingestion) they are a safety risk (tripping, slipping, being thrown) and I'm sure there are some more I've not thought of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Melting is an endothermic phase transition, meaning it takes energy to turn the ice cube into water. Quite a bit of energy. Specifically, it takes about 2.4 Calories (capital C = kilocalories) to turn one ounce of frozen water into unfrozen water. To put that in perspective, it takes about 3 Calories to cool water from near boiling to near freezing. </p>
<p>See <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/phase.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/phase.html" target="_blank">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/phase.html</a></a> for a visual depiction of energy required for heating forms of water.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>With metal cubes, you don't get this advantage of phase transition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Yes they don‚Äôt stay as cold as long as other commenters have noted but also as OP says, they‚Äôre re-usable. It‚Äôs an option and people use them. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
