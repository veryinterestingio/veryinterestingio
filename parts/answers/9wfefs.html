		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Camp Fire already has 29 known fatalities and with 200+ people missing that number is probably going to get a lot worse.  But that tells you something.   Usually wildfire fatalities are a lot lower.   If you look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_California_wildfires" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_California_wildfires</a> you'll notice that only 10 wildfires in CA history have had more than 10 fatalities, and of those, 2 were so high because firefighters got killed.</p>
<p><em>Usually</em> most people evacuate and avoid being killed, with a few either taking unwise chances or just getting unlucky. </p>
<p>So why was the Paradise fire so deadly?  First, the timeline.  The fire started at 6:33 AM on Thursday.  By around 6:45 firemen were on the scene of the ignition and observed a rapidly spreading blaze.  Shortly after, an evacuation was called for Paradise.  So we are talking about an evacuation notice coming out at around 7am.  The fire spread incredibly rapidly, driven by hot, dry winds coming down from the mountains at speeds of 40mph.  At one point it was burning the equivalent of 80 football fields every minute.  It didn't take it long at all to cover the 7-8 miles to Paradise.  It was right on top of the town shortly after the evacuation notice went out, and some people would have missed it because they didn't, eg, happen to have the news on.  </p>
<p>At that point, we come to problem number two, which is that Paradise is kind of a remote community without a lot of ways in and out of town.  There's one main road and a few others. Everyone in town was trying to leave by these roads.  And of course the fire was coming towards the roads too.  It took people hours to make a drive of a few minutes thanks to bumper to bumper traffic, stalled cars on the road, etc.  And Paradise had a lot of old people who may not have even been able to drive.  At any rate there were a bunch of people who had to try to drive through the fire, and they didn't all make it.     </p>
<p>Finally, you've got the issue that the blaze swept right <em>through</em> town.  This is relatively rare.  Usually wildfires stay in the woods, but this has been changing lately.  Higher winds, dryer falls, more movement of people out of urban areas into the borders of woods, it all increases the odds of fires getting into inhabited areas.  And Paradise in particular used to have a lot of tree cover in town.  Lots of oak and deciduous trees with the leaves dry but still on because it hasn't rained yet.  Firefighters had to give up on stopping the blaze and just had to try to get people out as best they could.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People think that wildfires burn one tree down before setting fire to the next and so forth. However as soon as a tree catches fire the next one is about to get engulfed in the flames as well. So if a fire reaches a dry forest it can set the entire fores on fire in a matter of seconds. You might be able to drive in front of the fire if you have a smooth clear road. However if you are driving on the backroads or there is turns in the road or if the road does not lead directly away from the fire then you might have to drive like a rally driver to be able to get away from it. And all the time you are getting hit with the smoke and heat from the fire making it hard for you to breathe. A lot of people die in forest fires after their cars break down due to all the smoke and heat.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So people have the idea that they have time to evacuate. Even if the fire is just over the next hill it can move slowly and might not look like it will reach them. However the wind can change, the fire reaches somewhere with lots of dry tinder, going uphill, etc. So a fire that moves at yards per hour towards you can suddenly get up to 20 miles an hour as the crow flies. Unless you have a very carefully planned exit route that gets you quickly away from the fire you will not be able to outrun it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One day a group of friends and I were driving around in the wine country of Paso Robles. As were driving up and around winding hillsides we come to a clearing where a small fire had started. We go further, turn a bend, and the fires suddenly get more expansive and bigger. We can feel the flames from inside the car. We’re terrified but don’t know if it’s best to turn around or keep going. Before we can make the decision we drive out the other end of the fire and all is safe and clear. When you’re surrounded by fire it’s hard to tell which way is safe and there are often only a few options. Just thought my story might help. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people try to stay and defend their property or livestock because firefighters might not have the resources. In a small wildfire they often can with a powerful garden hose or a pump attached to water tank can knock down spot fires caused by floating embers. Wet down the roof, etc.</p>
<p>A big inferno, no it's time to leave and hope for lady luck. Unfortunately if you stay too long, escape routes might be cut off. Plus smoke and coughing will make escape even harder </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
