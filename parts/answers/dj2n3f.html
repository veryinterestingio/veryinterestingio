		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Paraffin wax only burns when it is a gas and mixes with air. To become a gas, it must first be a liquid. Liquid paraffin in bulk, like a puddle, conducts heat away from the surface too quickly to burn under normal conditions. Small flecks of it will burn, as they have more surface area compared to how quickly they lose heat through the bottom. The result is that as wax melts, the wick sucks it up. Then the fire boils it off of the wick, and it mixes with air and burns. The paraffin at the bottom, meanwhile, does not receive enough heat to boil. A little bit of it will evaporate, and may get sucked into the fire, but very minuscule amounts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>solids don't burn (at least in terms of producing flame). Fire only happens when a flammable gas is mixed with oxygen. </p>
<p>So, how does a solid candle burn?  If you heat wax hot enough, it chemically decomposes into flammable gasses and those burn.  The catch is that, to get wax that hot, it basically needs to be inside a flame already.</p>
<p>So, once you light the wick of the candle, the heat is enough to melt the wax around it, the liquid wax soaks up into the wick, and once it's inside the fire, it breaks down, forms flammable gasses, mixes with air, and burns, feeding the flame.  The properties of wax, therefore, make it easy to use for a slow, constant flame, which is the very basis of candles</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way better question is, why doesn't the wick burn?  </p>
<p>When a wick does burn down, it's usually after the fire has been extinguished and it's red hot.  </p>
<p>The bottom of a candle is relatively quite cool.  [The heated air then rises, pulling cool air in through the bottom.] (<a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xfQ_jk51FiI/TYWDUQuMWCI/AAAAAAAACx0/h4xU-Vq8k5g/s1600/fire+explianed.jpg" target="_blank">https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xfQ_jk51FiI/TYWDUQuMWCI/AAAAAAAACx0/h4xU-Vq8k5g/s1600/fire+explianed.jpg</a>)  The result is almost an air-conditioning of current for the wick, which can't char it down to ash until after the fire is out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As the flame burns, it draws air up the side of the candle.  This air cools the edge of the pool of the melting wax, making a solid edge like a cup. </p>
<p>This is why a birthday candle doesn't burn down immediately, even though you can see, for example, a pool of wax two inches wide on larger candles... the edges are made solid by cooler air rising to the flame.</p>
<p>The flame cannot burn down further or faster because there isn't enough oxygen available to burn the liquid wax.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
