<p>How different are brains to each other? How much learning said interface has to do to be use to us? Does this takes away the fear of human obsolescence?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! I was wondering what you think about what the construct of consciousness is? Is it perception of conscious thought and subconscious thought of knowledge and experience, or something else? And when would one describe an A.I. as a conscious being? Usually the Turing test is the most popular option, although it has the GÃ¶delian argument and Chinese Room argument is used against it's validity. How would you prove a strong A.I. as conscious to the degree of sapient? Is some level meta-cognitive thought inherently required to learn? And if so is there multiple levels to it through: consciousness, sentience, and sapience?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
