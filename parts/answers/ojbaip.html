<p>Dolphins have the half brain sleep bc they need to be awake enough to surface to breathe. We do not require any other physical activity to breathe so we do not need brain duality in sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dolphins employ Unihemispheric Slow-Wave Sleep. Meaning that when they do sleep one half of their brain goes to sleep and consequently half of their muscles are paralyzed - because they swim up and down they can continue to swim with only either the left or right half of their body while the other half has it's muscles inhibited.</p>
<p>So with humans it would be the same - not that there aren't potentially ways around it with bio engineering advances - when your left hemisphere is asleep you would be paralyzed on the right side of your body. And also it would be freaky as hell as you'd basically be 2 different people - your right brain and left brain - living in one body.</p>
<p>Sharks and fish can't employ unihemispheric sleep because they swim side to side which means that they must use both sides of their body in order to swim.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On land, BSWS predominates over USWS, but in water, the amount of USWS increases: USWS percentage on land is 41.6%, while in water, it is 66%. Seals revert to more USWS when water conditions render BSWS less convenient or feasible because of the need to breathe while sleeping. For the same reason, the amount of REM sleep in water is lower than that on land.  </p>
<p>In water, fur seals adopt a particular body posture during USWS, which allows them to sleep and breathe: they lie on one side keeping one of the front flippers in water paddling continuously, while the other three flippers are kept in air, probably for lowering heat loss; the nostrils are kept out of water for breathing. The hemisphere contralateral to the moving flipper tends to be awake (desynchronized EEG), thereby allowing the motor commands for paddling, while the other hemisphere is less desynchronized or in SWS. As soon as the seal falls into REM sleep, the flipper movement ceases and the seal’s head sinks. USWS is accompanied by unilateral eye closure.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a rare (and I do mean <em>rare</em>) brain disorder that leads to fatal insomnia.  Apparently a misshapen protein (prion) can affect the brain and cause insomnia that leads to dementia and death.   This is sorta like Jacobsen-Creutzfeldt syndrome, another rare prion disease.  Prions are the cause of Bovine Spongiform Encephalitis (Mad Cow) and Kuru (disorder seen in cannibals in Papua New Guinea)  </p>
<p>People who miss sleep for a week or more begin hallucinating and may appear to be in a stupor.</p>
<p>No one is 100% sure how sleep works but everyone agrees the brain doesn't work without it. Dreaming is an essential part of sleep.  Everyone dreams, not everyone remembers dreaming, but it is vital for the brain's health.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Best way to think about how vital sleep is is how we knock ourselves out for one third of the day, making us vulnerable to predators, parasites, competitors but evolution has said <em>Must sleep. Everything else second.</em></p>
<p>So whatever it does it must be fuckin’ important.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
