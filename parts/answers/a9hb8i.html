		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neuroscience researcher here. Believe it or not, the top answer should be “we don’t know.” We don’t even know why the drugs we use for headaches work, and we don’t even know why we sleep. </p>
<p>A lot of headaches can be somewhat chalked up to changes in your head/brain’s blood supply. Some headaches actually look more like seizures when you do a brain scan. Then there are tension headaches, which are due to abnormal muscle contraction. </p>
<p>So how does that resolve with sleep? Well to start we don’t even know why living things need sleep or what happens while we’re sleeping that’s so important to life. Recently, we found that the brain “cleans” itself while you’re asleep. Your heart rate and muscle tension reduce. But how does that relate to the mechanism of a headache? Your guess is as good as the pro’s. </p>
<p>It only gets weirder when you look at what other stuff is known to reduce headaches: sleep, anti inflammatory painkillers, caffeine, serotonin, oxygen, anti-seizure meds, Tylenol, muscle relaxants... it just don’t make no sense. There’s no overarching theme for how these drugs work</p>
<p>TLDR: no one knows </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For tension headaches, your muscles naturally relax when you're asleep so often it's enough to make the headache go away.</p>
<p>To expand a bit, tight muscles sometimes agitate neighboring nerves which causes pain in different areas around the head. Hence why muscular tension can cause headaches in the first place. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
