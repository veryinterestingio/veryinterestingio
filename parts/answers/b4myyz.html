		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can propagate a lot of plants by grafting a branch from the desired plant onto the trunk of a hardier, similar variety. I have a Japanese Maple in the back yard that you can clearly see where it was grafted onto the trunk of another variety- it doesn’t produce seeds.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two ways to do it. You can slice a piece off and plant it to get a clone, or you can breed a grape with four sets of chromosomes with a grape that has two, making one with three that will be seedless. Cloning is how most are propagated, making triploids is how the seeds for seedless grapes were originally created.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can make a clone, which is taking any live part of a plant and planting that; from which is will start to regrow roots downwards and stalks upwards. </p>
<p>Seeds just help with genetic diversity. You don't need them to regrow a plant. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most seedless plants are bred in a special way from two kinds of seeded parents - one normal parent plant with two sets of DNA and one specially bred to have FOUR sets of DNA. When these plants are mated, the first parent passed down one set of its DNA, and the second parent passes down two sets - each parent passes down half of its own dna, in other words. This produces a plant with three sets of DNA (“triploid”). </p>
<p>Since three is not evenly divisible by two, when the child plant tries to become a parent and divide its DNA to make its seeds, the process goes wonky and gets interrupted, producing tiny and infertile seeds, or none at all. </p>
<p>However, since the plant doesn’t divide its DNA in that way during normal growth and life, the triploid plant grows fruits just fine. </p>
<p>(It does divide its DNA in a different way to produce more cells, but the process does not end with half as much DNA in the daughter cells, so the process is not disturbed. )</p>
<p>As other folks have said, you can also clone a plant from another seedless plant, or selectively breed it over many generations, but producing a triploid plant is arguably the fastest way to do it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can also force a plant that would normally produce seeded fruit to not do so by inducing parthenocarpy. You can spray flowers with the plant hormones auxin, cytokinin, or gibberellin to have them produce seedless fruit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
