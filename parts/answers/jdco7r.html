		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, a washer is used when the material you're fastening is softer than the material you're fastening with... Eg a metal bolt on the wooden leg of a table, and its purpose is to spread the pressure of the bolt across a broader area, so you can tighten more without the bolt just sinking into the soft wood</p>
<p>Edit: you do also see rubber or plastic washers for metal on metal fastenings, this is usual to prevent vibration from loosening the bolt over time.</p>
<p>Edit 2: wow - thanks everyone! Many people have pointed out other reasons why washers are used in addition to the above including to prevent certain types of corrosion, to carry the wear for fastenings which are frequently used (like on access panels) and to seal against moisture. There have also been comments about the validity of the anti-vibration washers (both polymer and &quot;anti-lock&quot;) so I guess do your research if this is a concern for you! There are many many great links and comments in this thread.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few reasons for washers:</p>
<p>They spread the load of the screw/bolt head over more area - rather than just the inside rim of the bolt pushing down on the piece fixed, you have the much larger washer. This is especially important fixing softer materials, where something like wood could get crushed beneath a concentrated load.
You could just use a larger bolt head instead of a washer, but these are bulkier and more expensive, so a washer is preferable.</p>
<p>Washers also create a buffer and slip plane between the bolt and material - so when you tighten the bolt down, the bolt isn't twisting against a softer material and damaging it, but against the tough steel which will be fine.</p>
<p>You also get special use washers for specific jobs too - the funny washers with a kind of star shape pressed into the inside ring for example act as locking pieces and help to hold the bolt in place and prevent it unscrewing, as do certain types of nylon washers which purposely crush down and hold everything in place, or you can get things like rubber damping washers that will absorb vibrations, or rubber/nylon washers that isolate different types of metal (certain metal types can react when in contact with each other and oxidise or weld together, which is not always a good thing).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is actually a bunch of engineering theory behind washers.</p>
<p>For furniture, the most common use for them is to prevent the screw from sinking into the soft wood. The washer is stiff enough to spread the force on a larger area, so the pressure on the wood is lower. Same usually goes for anywhere where plastic is fastened to metal...</p>
<p>This is not eli5, but a little basic machine element engineering theory...:</p>
<p>Otherwise, properly torqued/tensioned screws on metal flanges also usually have washers. There is a lot of things to consider there - high clamping forces means the screw could also sink into the metal slightly over time, which would loosenvthe connection, and the (usually stamped sheet metal or rarely special milled/turned out of a solid) washers make that procedure a lot slower or less important. Another thing - the ratio between the screw diameter and the flange thickness tells you if the screw will unscrew by itself. A screw is self-locking a lot more, if the flange thickness is far greater than the screw diameter. This is why e.g. for engine cylinder head, you have relatively thin studs which are very long. If they were thicker, that effect would be much worse. Also, for sealing surfaces, if the distance between the screw head/nut to the sealing surface is longer, the pressure on the sealing surface is distributed over a greater area. Washers add up to that distance...</p>
<p>And lastly, there are countless standard variations for washers, most are of course just plain washers but you also have lots of lock-washers using different methods, usually based on increasing friction, to prevent the nut from unscrewing over time...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey, aviation mechanic here. Washers do a great number of things. </p>
<p>The washers you are probably thinking of are called plain washers, they look like a squashed donut. These plain washers are used as spacers, if the fastener is too long. They also help protect against rubbing that can happen from turning the fastener. Large plain washers, which are like a coin with a small hole in it, is used to apply clamping force to fragile materials. If you, say, took a tiny screw and tightened it down through some plastic, the plastic will probably break because the force is being applied over a small area. If you use a large plain washer, it &quot;clamps&quot; over a wider area, reducing the stress and potential for damage or cracking. Think of it like a needle vs a mallet, which is more likely to poke through your skin? </p>
<p>There are trim washers too. They are often also called grommets, but they are used to grab onto fabric. They look like half of a bagel, and are hollow inside with a sharp edge pointing down to dig into the fabric. </p>
<p>There is also lock washers. These come in many forms, from a &quot;c&quot; shaped bent washer to a washer that resembles a starfish, called star washers. These are meant to create friction between the fastener and whatever it is being fastened to, so as to make it harder for that fastener to loosen on its own. There are many, many types of lock washers, but the c-shaped and star-shaped are the most common I see in my work, but there is also spring washers, tab washers, flip washers, and many more. </p>
<p>There is also anti-corrosion washers. There is some complex chemistry involved, but to super simplify, some metals don't like other metals, and will corrode if they touch each other. This is primarily what plastic washers are for, to stop that touching. Another type of anti-corrosion washer is a sacrificial washer. These washers are made of a metal that really likes to corrode, that way the washer corrodes instead of the fastener/whatever being fastened. That's why they are called sacrificial washers. </p>
<p>There is one other washer, too. Phenolic washers. Phenolic is a fancy term for layered and compressed paper, and it is reasonably strong but really good at insulating against electricity. This is used for a lot of wiring stuff, if you don't want electricity to travel through the fastener. </p>
<p>Hope this helped, I tried to simplify this stuff best I could, but if I forgot to mention something or didn't simplify something enough, tell me!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming you're not talking about lock washers they effectively make the head of the screw larger (like snowshoes) helping to spread out the load of the screw to prevent damage to the surface you're screwing against and to hold more securely.  </p>
<p>If you're fastening metal they can help to prevent corrosion.</p>
<p>Some washers used in fluid containers, pumps, ect. are designed to deform and create a seal to prevent leaks.</p>
<p>There are washers used as spacers, or to stop vibration.</p>
<p>Most likely the first paragraph is the answeryou're looking for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
