		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am assuming you are talking about leather shoes. </p>
<p>The leather is a natural product, with time the atmosphere dries the leather out slowly (imagine like a piece of bread left on a counter top). The loss of moisture hardens the leather. When you use the shoes, you sweat into the them, this replaces some of the moisture,  this is also why you should be polishing your shoes regularly. The polish helps to protect the leather with wax and other products to keep it in a good condition and supple.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's just like dry rot from a tire.  It's not the use or lack of that causes damage, its mainly what happens between these periods. if kept in a climate controlled environment it will easily last years. I still wear shoes from high school and that was 2010</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ooh, I know this one (having had a head office job at a shoe company)!</p>
<p>This is due to hydrolysis in Polyurethane outsoles!</p>
<p>PU is made of specific molecules, a bit like making something out of Lego, but each building block is made of a bunch of individual Lego bricks. Water likes to steal atoms from the PU molecules, a bit like one of your friends coming over and taking every fifth Lego brick from something you’ve built. When enough bricks are stolen by your friend the structure falls apart. This is what happens in hydrolysis - water reacts with the polymers and breaks down the complex molecule.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
