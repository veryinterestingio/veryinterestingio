		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like no-one has really answered your question so far, especially in regards to the Revolver part of the question. I'll try my best as a former Beatles fanatic.</p>
<p>As you alluded to, Revolver was quite an experimental pop record, and it was the first album where the Beatles REALLY decided to use the studio as an instrument. The wild guitar solo in Taxman played the band's bassist, the backwards guitar in I'm Only Sleeping, the raga banger that is Love You To, and not to mention the psychedelic tape-looped masterpiece that is Tomorrow Never Knows. The Beatles threw brass and string instrumentation all on this thing as well, like in Eleanor Rigby and Got to Get You. Critics and Music Pundits understand the impact and importance Revolver brings forth, and many diehards will say Revolver is their favorite Beatles record. It certainly was mine for the longest time.</p>
<p>Sgt. Pepper, however, was a different beast. In my opinion, it wasn't as musically ambitious as Revolver. However, conceptually, it changed how the artform of the album was seen. Instead of a collection of songs, it was better taken as a whole. All the songs are thematically and musically connected (The Beatles didn't exactly /intend/ this, but intention isn't important), the album art was wildly unique and fed into the album's themes. It was the first REAL album, Pet Sounds be damned (I like Pet Sounds more than any Beatles' album, so hush). This album also came out after the Beatles retired from touring, and after the double masterpiece whammy that was Strawberry Fields Forever and Penny Lane. The hype was through the roof and the Beatles trumped even that. They also won AOTY at the Grammys, which was surreal.</p>
<p>It's a landmark of an album. Revolver is fantastic, and I like it way more than Sgt. Peppers, but it isn't a landmark. Not like Peppers.</p>
<p>EDIT: Umm, wow I was not expecting this sort of response! I wrote this up in about 5 minutes before I ran out to hang with friends, so I know it’s quick and dirty, lacking a ton of history of what lead up to Revolver/Sgt. Pepper’s. I just wanted shine light of that period, so it would easier to do future research! I did want to answer three questions I saw:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What do you mean “former Beatlemaniac”?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was OBSESSED with the Beatles years ago. They were all I listened to for years straight, and I pretty much read every single thing possible about them. Now, I’m way more chill, ha. Still love them to pieces.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You like Pet Sounds more than any Beatles album? Really?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep. The compositions and arrangements of Pet Sounds are transcendent, and the performances of each song are perfect. It’s a flawless album that hasn’t been touched since IMO</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zappa did it first/did it better/The Beatles suck</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zappa was a prolific avant-garde/experimental musician, and unlike the Beatles, he did not make music for popular consumption per se. He did not have the production/engineering chops of the Abbey Road team, and he did not prioritize making layered pop tunes. He made weird bops. He’s a great musician and composer, but he and The Beatles couldn’t be any more different. They affected very different circles. You can believe the Beatles suck if you want tho.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This was an album that brought a very different and original sonic landscape to people who were NOT used to it. Imagine waiting for months for the next Beatles album and listening to THIS. Just imagine waiting and lusting for the follow-up to Revolver with its black and white artwork and getting this colorful sleeve work that features the Beatles as you had never seen them before: long hair, moustaches, in those weird military band uniforms.   </p>
<p>And that's even <em>before</em> you put the stylus over the record...  </p>
<p>Flanger, echo, stereo imaging, distorted guitars, orchestra-driven tracks, tambouras and tablas, the whole this-is-not-the-Beatles concept, even the colorful gatefold sleeve with its who's-that trivia.  </p>
<p>Try to get a hold of a list of the singles and albums that Sgt Pepper was competing against in the famous Summer of Love and you'll understand what kind of departure it was.  </p>
<p>Jimi Hendrix and Beach Boys were giving the Beatles a run for their money, but this album was a huge step forward.  </p>
<p>Now, check the kind and size of influence this album had in the world by checking the kind of songs, artwork, fashion, words (slang even...&quot;turn you on...&quot;) that came AFTER Pepper.  </p>
<p>One of the things that will stick in my mind FOREVER is the use of the word &quot;clutching&quot;, in She's Leaving Home. Have you heard such an usual word in a song ever again?  </p>
<p>For me, personaly, the very first bars of A Day in the Life are hauntingly beautiful. Lennon's voice is just... different. He has such a eerie delivery never again heard or matched (by himself, I mean).  </p>
<p>If you play guitar, for instance (although bass, drums, piano, or singing certainly apply) and try to learn and play these songs, you will even find yet another layer of complexity and appreciation.  </p>
<p>Sometimes you need to tune your strings higher just to be able to match some solos, not to mention you will have a blast (and a hard time) trying to match the sounds you hear with the help of ready-to-go effects pedals, apps, etc, and it's then when you stop taking this music for granted and you start to understand the vital role that people like George Martin, Geoff Emerick (try to read about his recording techniques and his microphone positioning, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Send_tape_echo_echo_delay" target="_blank">Send tape echo echo delay</a>) and the engineers at EMI played in the Beatles' sonic development. Listen to the guitar sounds of the previous albums and compare them to these.  </p>
<p>The harmony work bestowed upon She's Leaving Home is beautiful, but of course you cannot appreciate it with just one listen. Find the main vocal, then try to follow John's harmonies and then George's.  </p>
<p>The cinematic lyrics of Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds leave nothing to chance. You are there, watching the newspaper taxies, no matter which taxis you're familiar with.  </p>
<p>The boldness of including a track comprised of indian instruments right in the middle of this so-called pop album.  </p>
<p>As you can see, I could go on and on. Hopefully, I have already transmitted you a fraction of what this record means to me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know that everyone would agree that Revolver was more experimental. One factor for Sgt. Pepper, is that the mind-bending &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; is (almost) the last music you're left with. I say &quot;almost&quot; because LP listeners back in the day were also treated to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaXnqw-Zv0Y" target="_blank">a chaotic repeating outro track</a>. That leaves an impression.</p>
<p>Add to that the &quot;concept&quot; album factor. While the final album isn't <em>as</em> thematically cohesive as originally intended — the way some of the songs blended into one another demanded that the listener not think of the album as a collection of songs, but as a piece of work in and of itself.</p>
<p>Add to that the presentation. Not only was the cover an explosion of color featuring a gamelike &quot;who's who&quot; of guest stars on the cover, but they really went all out. It opened into a <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-592262012-13bd204b-6f80-41c9-ae3b-c4909338ad1b.jpg" target="_blank">gatefold</a> (even though it wasn't a double album), and included <a href="https://www4.picturepush.com/photo/a/10599742/img/10599742.jpg" target="_blank">cutout badges and extras</a> that made the experience feel more than <em>just</em> a record.</p>
<hr />
<p>TLDR: While Revolver was definitely sonically adventurous, so to was Sgt. Pepper. But in addition to that, it incorporated a conceptual dimension to it and executed it beautifully.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
