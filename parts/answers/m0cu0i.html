		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: Yes</p>
<p>Long answer: Probably</p>
<p>When you get exposed to an antigen (by getting infected or by getting a vaccine), your body generates B cells (generate antibodies) and T cells (recognize and kill infected cells). </p>
<p>I'll focus on B cells: </p>
<p>First, there will be a B cell that, just by random chance, has some affinity for the antigen. That B cell will divide like gangbusters but, in doing so, will undergo something called &quot;somatic hyper mutation&quot;. This means that the DNA that codes for the &quot;recognition&quot; part of the B cell will be modified in countless ways. Invariably, some of these new B cells will be even better at recognizing the new antigen, and these will be selected for. In the end, you have a population of B cells producing antibodies that have been selected for their ability to bind the novel antigen really well.</p>
<p>Generally, these antibodies will also be good at binding other things that <em>look</em> a lot like the first antigen so small mutations in the virus won't be able to escape.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>A (silly) analogy:</p>
<p>Gang of criminals from London moves into your neighborhood and your crime-fighting robot AI generates anti-gang drones. Some recognize the tattoos of Big Ben that all the members have, some recognize the Union Jack, some listen for their specific slang words (&quot;Bloody hell!&quot;) or go after mini Coopers. The drones are, of course, tested first to make sure they don't accidentally recognize civilians (in the body this is called &quot;negative selection&quot;).</p>
<p>Obviously, if a brand new Viking gang moves in and they're from Norway and drive motorcycles and wear furry horn hats, your crime fighting drones will not be much help. If, on the other hand, another gang from London moves in, your current drones might work pretty well and require few adjustments.</p>
<p>A bit more of a stretch might be a gang from Australia. Some of your drones might recognize just enough aspects of the new guys to keep them at bay while a new batch of drones that goes after cans of Fosters and dudes with crocodile teeth sewn into their hats comes online.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would imagine it depends on the mutations that occur.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of &quot;variants&quot; since small microbes like viruses replicate so often. Mutations occur inevitably. I think its a matter of the spike protein of the virus and if that mutates.</p>
<p>Antibodies attach to the spike on the surfaces of viruses to stop them from attacking cells and signaling your immune system to kill them.</p>
<p>There must be a point where if there are enough mutations of the viral spike protein, that the antibodies no longer recognize the microbe and therefore do not attach and stop the virus. </p>
<p>One analogy for example, if you start with a human and slowly replace its physical features with a monkey. There must be a point in between where you cant call this &quot;thing&quot; a human and instead consider it a monkey.</p>
<p>This point I imagine this isnt a clear boundry and instead is a gray area.
So I would assume the gray area for antibodies means some fight the virus and some don't. Which means only some &quot;protection&quot;.</p>
<p>But these are just my thoughts.</p>
<p>Any other info to support or refute, or any feedback would be appreciated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The only real answer to this question is a firm, unambiguous “maybe”. </p>
<p>When developing vaccines we try to target important conserved regions of the protein(s) that the virus must maintain to function. Usually those regions can’t change so very much, allowing antibodies to still recognize them even if not optimally. And the protein should have many potential antibody recognition sites (epitopes) - some more effective than others - producing a library of antibodies in the response. So if you alter one beyond recognition there’s still others the immune system can see. But fewer, so weaker, and if you lose the “best” epitope you have a more substantial decline. </p>
<p>In the case of Spike, the desirable target is the receptor binding domain. Antibodies that stick there interfere with ACE receptor binding, and if the virus mutates to elude an antibody it may no longer be able to bind ACE. An antibody hanging off Spike’s left elbow can still trigger immune cells but it doesn’t compete with receptor binding (though it can still interfere with uptake) and it’s easier to shake off with a mutation. At some point, though, the virus may mutate enough that it’s effectively a new virus. Maybe that left elbow antibody is all they have in common. It’s hard to predict whether that will be enough to make a clinical difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
