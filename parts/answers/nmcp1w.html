		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The stuff that we're seeing in the distant past is also really far away.  To see something, say, a billion years ago, it has to be far enough away that its light traveled toward us for a billion years.  So we're not seeing our own past, we're seeing the past of other stuff.</p>
<p>We can't see our own past this way because the light from our past is moving away from us, so we'll never see it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the points everyone is making about being able to see Earth's past, I'd like to point out that we cannot technically see the big bang.  </p>
<p>We can see the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, which is from about 400,000 years after the big bang.  We can also see ripples in the CMB, which has implications about what existed before.  But the universe was opaque to light (not see-through) before that (approximate) time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you look at the moon, you're seeing how the moon looked 1.255 seconds ago; that's how long the light (which came from the sun and is bouncing off the moon) takes to reach us. So even looking at the moon is looking &quot;back in time&quot; - but you can't see how the earth looked 1.255 seconds ago unless you travel out to the same distance as the moon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>follow up questions. if the direction of light can be changed by gravity,  could light waves be bent back to us? could one of the galaxies we appear to see be an ancient version of our own galaxy?  does this impact why our galaxy appears to be the center of the universe?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
