		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there are a couple things that I havent seen posted yet. There are a lot of reasons this could be happening depending on whether the batteries are connected in series or parallel with the circuitry. Parallel batteries should be matched as best as possible by brand/capacity/etc, batteries that are in series are a bit different and the life impact of mismatching are less than parallel batteries. If you have a device using series-connected batteries and it dies, when you swap them you are changing which batteries are being discharged/charged more aggressively. Often times in systems that have 2 series batteries, they are referred to as &quot;upper&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; batteries in the strings. The &quot;upper&quot; battery is usually the one that dies faster, so switching the upper and lower batteries could definitely add &quot;life&quot; to your device by having the battery that was discharging less become the battery that will be discharged more aggressively. Hopefully this makes sense and helps. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two reasons:  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Removing and reinserting the batteries cleans some oxidation off the contacts, improving the connection.  </p>
</li>
<li>Handling the batteries heat them slightly. Household  batteries rely on chemical reactions that work slightly better at higher temperatures.   </li>
</ol>
<p>Switching doesn't do anything by itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>THe act of taking the batteries out and replacing them will improve the electrical connection because it abrades the ends of the batteries slightly. </p>
<p>Same principle behind taking out and putting in old game console catridges to make them play properly. The old blow on it part did nothing except maybe accelerate corrosion due to moisture in your breath; it was the physical scraping of the connections against one another that improved the connection and fixed things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
