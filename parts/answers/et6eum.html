<p>I like to imagine science fiction settings with large, enclosed volumes on the moon. Maybe in lava tube tunnels. Awesome athletic events would be possible.</p>
<p>I wonder if flying would be possible given attachments to the arms to increase surface area.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the skipping gate that we see in videos from the moon is partially influenced by difficulty walking normally in a space suit.</p>
<p>I think the real issue with walking on the moon is traction. Reduced gravity equals reduced traction. Trying to run in a straight line like on Earth would not be any faster on the moon. </p>
<p>skipping makes sense for us because we grew up on a planet with much higher gravity. We have super strong legs that are able to launch us in a huge bounds. </p>
<p>A species evolved in lower gravity would probably not walk like that. </p>
<p>Great question though It's really interesting. I'd never thought about it before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If my memory serves, they did test various ways to walk on the moon. Due to the inflation of the suit, hopping ended up being the most effective way to move around. You can't really &quot;walk&quot; in those suits, at least not without reducing the pressure a bit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I haven't found any research on quadruped locomotion in low gravity environments. Skipping is the preferred bipedal gait for three reasons: </p>
<ol>
<li>Space suits create great restraints to range of motion. Skipping requires less range if motion at the hip and knee than walking. </li>
<li>There are greater vertical and lesser horizontal ground reaction forces while skipping, reducing the likely hood of slipping</li>
<li>The combination of greater vertical ground reaction force and reduced force of gravity makes skipping more metabolically efficient. </li>
</ol>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: Yes</p>
<p>Longer answer: With the gravity effect being approximately 1/6th of Earth's gravity, astronauts on the moon found that jumping was more efficient than walking. You can see it in some popular video footage of moon walks. The astronauts that walked on the moon tried walking normally a bit, and found that hopping/jumping worked better.</p>
<p>For a quadruped, leaping with the rear legs would probably be equally more efficient.</p>
<p>The only problem is a lack of control during the jump. You cannot change direction or speed mid-jump. Not even a bit, because there is no atmosphere on the moon, so you can only change your shape, while the low gravity gradually changes your movement vector.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
