		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The barrel in general is above the hand, when the force is generated by the bullet being accelerated down the barrel the hand is GENERALLY acting like a pivot point, the force pushing the barrel pushes on the grip, the grip is pushing into the hand but the grip had force being applied to one end only and therefore the whole gun tries to pivot up in the hand as there is no force being applied to the other end of the grip there for it pivots.</p>
<p>There is an actual revolver (I would have to find the forgotten weapons video) that was designed to have the barrel inline with the hand not above it for this very reason.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some great answers here already regarding the ‘pivot point in relation to the barrel and the hand’ but I would just like to add something about human anatomy.</p>
<p>Up is the direction your elbow naturally wants to bend if you are holding a hand gun in the normal way.</p>
<p>Hold your arm out straight like you are holding a pistol and see what direction your elbow naturally wants to bend without rotating.</p>
<p>For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction, or, bullet goes forward, gun goes back.</p>
<p>If the gun moves back with enough force, your elbow will either flex, or break, the path of least resistance is to bend at the elbow, which naturally moves the forearm and hand, up.</p>
<p>In some films, you may see the bad guy hold a gun rotated sideways instead of upright, in this case the elbow can’t flex upwards.</p>
<p>If you were ever to fire a gun like this in real life, it would not go up, it would follow the bend in your elbow and probably smack you in the face, don’t try this at home, or anywhere lol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you’re hanging upside down holding a gun. If you fire it it will kickback in the downward direction (down relative to gravity; not to your feet).</p>
<p>This is a clue.</p>
<p>The direction of kick back is influenced by how you’re holding it.</p>
<p>Generally, you’re holding it on the bottom side of the gun, so the kickback, while generally equal in all directions on it’s own, is influenced by the force you’re applying to it by holding it on the bottom side. </p>
<p>If you had a rifle and, instead of using your hand to hold the bottom of the barrel, you put your hand on the top of the barrel, the kickback wouldn’t be as strong in the upward direction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the center of gravity of the gun is lower that the line of shot. Things wants to turn around its center of gravity. So its natural tendency is to turn upwards.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
