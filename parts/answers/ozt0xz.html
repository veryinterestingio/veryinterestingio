When you wash the skin, especially with hot soapy water you remove this protective layer or oil.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you've ever seen guardians of the Galaxy 2, there's a good point about skin in the opening. Skin is a barrier, the outside is waterproof. Applying water directly to it doesn't actually hydrate. Skin had to hydrated from the inside, by drinking water, and letting it essentially get distributed via the bloodstream for an oversimplification. Yes there's pores and yes you can moisturize from the outside but for true hydration, you have to drink water.
Hot water, soaps, and other chemicals remove the thin layer of oil that protects your skin, drying it from the outside.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water makes other things wet. Water itself is not wet in a traditional sense. </p>
<p>With that said, your skin produces an oily film called keratin that prevents outside water from getting inside. If you leave your skin in water for a long enough time, dead keratin cells absorb the water, but the outer layer of skin tries to keep its taut form and starts to wrinkle. </p>
<p>When you use soap and water, whether hot or cold, the soap will remove your keratin cells and you'll feel that sense of dryness that allows your skin to crack.</p>
<p>Now, the temperature of the water doesn't generally matter, but hot water, when too hot, can do twofold damage. One being that bar soaps of old used to need warmer waters to create a lather more readily, so this would be more effective. Another reason is that hot water tends to remove keratin on its own.</p>
