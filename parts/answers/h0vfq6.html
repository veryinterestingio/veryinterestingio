		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A bunch of reasons. Each of our “naive” B cells (these are the one that have never encountered their specific antigen/pathogen yet) has a unique antigen receptor on its cell surface, so the chances of any one B cell binding to a particular virus are about 1 in a billion.  So each of us has a few B cells in our bodies that can specifically bind the covid-19 virus - this was true even before the virus had infected a single human.  To find those few among the few billion B cells you have in your body is not easy - you would literally have to take ALL of a person’s blood to use in your in vitro assay, and then get really lucky.</p>
<p>Second, you need T cell help to initiate a novel immune response, so you’d also have to find the 1 in a billion T cell that also reacts with the same virus.  T cells (the other main type of lymphocyte) are even more complicated to activate than B cells are.  T cells don’t recognize antigens directly, like B cells do.  T cells require the right kind of specialized antigen presenting cell (APC) to chew up the virus and show the T cell little bits of.</p>
<p>I’ll just leave it at that, but you really need the structure of the entire immune system to induce a primary B or T cell response.  It’s much easier to restimulate the same cells later, which is why we often get immunity after we’ve been exposed to a virus once - we can make an overwhelming response very fast if we are infected with the same virus a second time, and usually beat it before it has a chance to replicate much.  But there are an insane number of checks and balances involved in initiating a novel immune response.  It has to be that way, because having the immune system go off when it shouldn’t can be as catastrophic as it not going off when it should.  Anaphylactic shock on the one hand, and death from the pathogen itself on the other.</p>
<p>My qualification for answering this question is a PhD in immunology from a very good school in Cambridge, Mass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ayyyyyy I'm a B cell immunologist!</p>
<p>The big reason is that most prototypical effective antibodies requires something complicated called a germinal centre reaction. </p>
<p>Basically think of the B cell as an industrial printer, but you need a building to house it in, electricity, people to feed it materials and stuff. If I just gave you an industrial printer with no effective power source, you'd have a hard time using it. And then asking you to print something on it (In this case, antibodies) would be nonsensical.</p>
<p>Basically you need all the supporting infrastructure to mount an effective antibody response. And it's very difficult to do that in vitro.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! Antibody engineer here! The top comment explains it perfectly. To add to this, a naive response is impossible to emulate in vitro. Common practices include inducing a response in animals, collecting those antibodies (or rather the genes that encode for them), mutagenizing randomly to create a repertoire of slightly different antibodies (minimum standard library size is 10^9), and then screening for binding properties. It’s a very slow process and there is no guarantee that an antibody that shows high binding to an antigen in vitro will be functional in Vivo; there is also research to support that high binding (I.e. trying to find an antibody with the lowest possible dissociation constant) is not always the best candidate.</p>
<p>TL;DR the body does an immaculate job at affinity maturation and property selection that rivals any in vitro antibody engineering process in terms of throughput and identifying viable candidates</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're ironically proposing basically how the convalescent plasma treatment works, by exposing a host and transfusing the antibodies.  The big difference being there really arent any lab controlled infections, our current (and probably long future) ethics wont allow it.</p>
<p>Also unclear if treatments like this are extremely effective.  So far the data is pretty good that it is, but it's hard to scale this stuff up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
