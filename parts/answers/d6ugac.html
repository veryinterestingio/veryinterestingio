		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the answer to your question is a definitive yes. Their genetics dictate how and when they grow, but the input that guides this is the weather conditions. You can take a seed from north to south of the equator, or vice versa (or use a greenhouse) and the plant will grow according to the season it's experiencing. Plants don't know what season it is. They're programmed by their genetics to respond to the prevailing weather conditions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Abundant foliage (whether evergreen or deciduous) has two main drawbacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>it &quot;costs&quot; the tree energy to keep alive. During summer months, the energy cost of having leaves is more than balanced by the energy from photosynthesis with sunlight (or artificial lights etc) and so provides a net benefit. However during winter, blight, drought etc the leaves are more a drain than a benefit. </p>
</li>
<li>thick leaves/needles etc also provide a larger sail area, which during heavy winter winds can cause the tree to be uprooted.</li>
</ol>
<p>Way back in evolutionary history, a freak plant* had a weird mutation that let it reduce its leafage (or lose it entirely in deciduous varieties) - luckily enough, this proved beneficial and the plant survived through more winters, allowing it to drop more seeds and multiply, sharing this mutation with its offspring. As plants with this mutation proved more able to survive than other plants, they rapidly grew to dominate the plant world. </p>
<p>Today, the hormone auxin has been identified as the trigger for plants to lose their leaves in autumn, which they then stop producing in spring, and starting the regrowth.</p>
<p>This mutation also has an energy cost, so plants whose environments <em>don't</em> change substantially between seasons are less likely to exhibit this behaviour than plants that are native to higher latitudes.</p>
<p>*more than one probably, not sure there is a tree version of adam and eve!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a number of hypothesis. My preferred is that during photosynthesis the plant produces waste products and  store this in leaves, As this reaches a certain level the leaf is no longer viable and withers. I would also suggest the fact that temp drops or light levels reduce would also be a factor as would any seeds setting - i.e. job done, need to drop the seeds.</p>
<p>Basically will be a combination of factors, triggered by heat, light and hormones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They start to get less light.  And light is required for them for food.</p>
<p>That being said, a bonsai oak tree can be evergreen if kept in the right conditions.  However if it ever starts the cycle of shedding it's leaves in autumn then it will remain in this cycle even if the conditions are perfect, and the tree beside it remains evergreen.</p>
<p>So there must be something programmed into the genes that causes it to do this, but something also had to trigger it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
