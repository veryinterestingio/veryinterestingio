		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electrons obey quantum mechanics, and if you have a quantum system confined to some finite region of space (for example, atoms, or lattice sites in a crystal), there are quantized energy levels. That means that the electrons can only exist at certain discrete energies. So if you want to excite an electron from one state to another, you have to provide just the right energy to reach that higher state.</p>
<p>In reality since the system is constantly interacting with external electromagnetic fields, it’s not really a closed system, and it can be shown rigorously how that leads to energy levels not being infinitely sharp. There is some natural linewidth associated with each energy level, so if you supply the atom with 0.99E rather than E, where E is the energy required for some given transition, you may still observe the transition anyway. But that’s just a technicality, the important thing is that bound quantum systems have discrete energy levels.</p>
<p>Now if you take a macroscopic piece of material with several 10^(23) atoms in it, the levels get smeared out, and what you end up with is some continuous absorption spectrum, but you can still see remnants of the microscopic quantum structure in resonances in the absorption spectrum. While the material still absorbs light off-resonance, the absorption might go up by orders of magnitude on the resonance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The previous explanations are good so I’ll try to just add a little to them. Electrons are bound to nuclei and exist as a sort of standing wave around a particular nuclei (in some situations... don’t worry about it for now). An analogy I like is the vibrations of a wine glass. If you were to look at a vibrating wine glass, you’d be able to count the number of nodes and antinodes. You’d see 0, 1, 2, etc. There are no “in between” vibrations. You can’t have 1.5 crests... the standing wave has to “come back” to itself. A particular vibrational mode with some number of nodes/antinodes corresponds to a certain frequency. As such, when you sweep the frequency of your voice, you find <em>certain</em> frequencies where the wine glass starts vibrating, and that’s where the modes are.</p>
<p>An electromagnetic wave that does couple to the electron that is sufficiently powerful and energetic could just knock an electron off the nucleus so it’s now flying. So yeah, if you whallop it hard enough you can get it to fly. However, if you want to measure the chance of moving from one bound state to another bound state given a certain frequency of applied radiation, you do find a spectrum with peaks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These are all great responses in regards to the quantized nature of electron orbital energy levels, but I'd like to add a few comments that I think more directly addresses your question.</p>
<p>There are a number of factors that contribute to light interacting with matter: Compton scattering; the photoelectric effect (most relevant here); etc that all culminate into an overall radiation-matter interaction cross section. This interaction cross section is a probabilistic representation of the amount of incident radiation that interacts with the material in question and as you can intuitively imagine, varies with the type of incident radiation and state and kind of matter. Electrons (e.g. in a TEM) interact more strongly with matter than photons which interact more strongly than neutrons. So it is true that many photons simply do not interact with the electric field of the electrons in a material, due to probability.</p>
<p>But your instinct is also correct: no, electrons near the Fermi level in a material do not “ignore” the electric field component of interacting incident photons. For the small fraction of photons that do interact and are not in resonance with the energy levels of an electronic transition, they simply get excited to non-existent &quot;virtual&quot; energy levels and immediately decay back to their original ground states. This is called Rayleigh scattering. Rayleigh scattering is an electronic transition absorption that is ignored when using Raman Spectroscopy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think what is missing from the answers so far - sorry if I missed it! - is a description of the quantization of <em>light</em> (as the answers focus on the electrons) and I am not sure if OP is aware of that, especially because they presented light as EM waves. The key point is that light delivers energy in specific batches (quanta, photons) and the energy of the elementary batch is proportional to the frequency of the light. So light of given frequency gives energy to electrons in specific units - if there is no &quot;allowed&quot; state for the electron with an energy that is one unit above his current energy, he can't take it. It is actually possible to take two units at once, from two photons, it's just so unlikely that it is irrelevant to any situation I can think of (not claiming that one does not exist, am not a material scientist). This is also the reason, why photoelectric effect - kicking out of an electron from a material by shining on it - has a lower bound in frequency that cannot be overcome by intensity: no matter how strong you shine on the material, if your individual photons aren't strong enough, you are not getting the electron out. This explanation is what Einstein got his Nobel for (not General Relativity, interestingly) and this was the cornerstone of understanding the quantum nature of the world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
