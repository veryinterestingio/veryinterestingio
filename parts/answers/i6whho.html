<p>No other species cognisantly artificially selects another species for their own purposes, like modern humans do*. However, through close mutualistic interaction and co-evolution, some animals present what could be argued as akin to 'domestication' - sometimes even to an extreme co-dependency. [Myrmecophily](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrmecophily#:~:text=Myrmecophily%20(%2Fm%C9%9C%CB%90rm%C9%99,%2C%20other%20arthropods%2C%20and%20fungi" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrmecophily#:~:text=Myrmecophily%20(%2Fm%C9%9C%CB%90rm%C9%99,%2C%20other%20arthropods%2C%20and%20fungi</a>.) (&quot;ant-love&quot;), for example, describes the close mutualistic relationship many ant species have with other organisms, including other animals, plants, and fungi.</p>
<p>Take the humble aphid, for example. Aphids are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemiptera" target="_blank">hemipteran insects</a> (&quot;true bugs&quot;) that sit around on plant stems, sucking out sugary sap via their piercing mouthparts. As they feed in this way, aphids produce large amounts of excess sugary fluid (called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeydew_(secretion\)" target="_blank">'honeydew'</a>) which they frequently and regularly excrete from their bottoms. This is literal <em>manna</em> from heaven for a foraging ant, and some ant species deliberately tend to 'flocks' of aphids in order to take advantage of this opportunity. In return for this abundant food source, ants will effectively defend aphid groups from would-be predators and parasitoids. Over evolutionary time, this has led some aphid species to reduce investment in their own defensive capabilities, along with other behavioural changes (e.g. instinctively and preferentially releasing honeydew when an ant 'herder' 'milks' them; by a wee tickling of the aphids' abdomen). </p>
<p>Along with aphids, ant species also form similar mutualisms with other honeydew-producing hemipteran insects, including assorted mealybugs and scale insects. In some instances, these mutualisms are taken to some remarkable extremes. Some ant species store and tend hemipteran eggs inside their nests over winter, ensuring an accessible herd of newly-hatched bugs come Spring. <em>Tetraponera binghami</em> queen ants will even carry a mealybug in her mandibles during her nuptial flight from her parent nest, in order to seed a mealybug herd at her new starter colony. Instead of undertaking normal foraging activities alongside their 'agricultural' ones, as in most of these species, a few specialist ant species (e.g. some <em>Pseudolasius</em> and <em>Camponotus</em> spp.) focus solely on rearing their hemipteran charges - either living as nomads following the wandering herds, or building their entire nests around hemiptera feeding spots; in either case, exclusively feeding on honeydew, and not being able to survive without their precious flocks.</p>
<p>Beyond honeydew-eatin', <em>Melissotarsus</em> ants are also hypothesised to deliberately raise scale insects for meat; the ants rear them but apparently lack the ability to digest honeydew, instead likely eating the 'waxy shell' scale insects typically produce instead [1].</p>
<p>Ants form similar extreme mutualisms with assorted plants and fungi too, but that's beyond the scope of this wee comment.</p>
<p><strong>In short:</strong> Many different ant species have co-evolved with many different hemipterans to present varying degrees of mutual association. You could therefore argue some ants have 'domesticated' aphids. I guess you could also say some aphids 'domesticated' ants too. In any case, they're interesting examples of non-human livestock-associated 'agricultural societies'.</p>
<hr />
<p>* Well, there's increasing evidence some ants also selectively manipulate the reproduction of aphids too, perhaps implying some 'artificial' selection [2].</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In some ways, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeyguide" target="_blank">honeyguides</a> have kind of trained humans? They'll lead humans to bee colonies, so that they can eat the grubs and beeswax once humans have harvested the honey. Wild birds have been shown to understand humans, as some people make a specific call when they want to &quot;summon&quot; a honeyguides and get led to honey. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>We show experimentally that a specialized vocal sound made by Mozambican honey-hunters seeking bees' nests elicits elevated cooperative behavior from honeyguides. The production of this sound increased the probability of being guided by a honeyguide from about 33% to 66%, and the overall probability of thus finding a beesâ€™ nest from 17% to 54%, as compared to other animal or human sounds of similar amplitude. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just a general point of interest; humans may not have domesticated animals.
As in it wasn't this active process we thought we were carrying out.
There is a reasonable theory that animals that were less afraid of humans  had a advantage as they got more scraps when our camp moved on. Thinking of dogs here but sane could be true for aurochs getting straw or chaff left over from harvests. This created a selection for animals with less fear in humans. Or a selection for animals with an interest in humans.
It's been shown (siberian fox experiment) that over a short number of generations selection for lack of fear of or interest in humans can lead to domestication.
This tackles one interpretation of the word domestication; interest in humans
Another is it's implication of docility, kindness and cooperation. Some species appear to have self domesticated. Ourselves and Bonobos are the exaplmples that spring to mind.
Those that are better at cooperating gain advantage and thus those genes spread.
I think I've read that it's been shown that human skeletons have been undergoing &quot;gracification&quot; (becoming finer and more graceful) over time. This phenomenon has been observed in most domesticated species.
Maybe I'm being a but somantic about the term domesticating. Sorry but I find this a very interestibg topic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
