		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to some recent reports noted in <a href="https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=7839500" target="_blank">ProMED</a>, there have already been cases of both symptomatic and asymptomatic reinfections identified, but only a few have been reported so it is difficult to estimate if this is a common occurrence or not. </p>
<p>Also, I have not actually read the studies (I saw them in passing and this question reminded me), but it may be possible that there are other factors that may have predisposed these people, like if they were on immunosuppressants, for example.</p>
<p>Edit: For those interested in the current variation of the Sars-CoV-2 genome, have a play around on this cool <a href="https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global" target="_blank">website</a></p>
<p>Edit 2: One of the devs from <a href="https://covidcg.org/" target="_blank">COVID CG</a> contacted me. It is a similar site to the one linked above allowing comparison of SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Please share these tools to increase their exposure for researchers. Also, if you are able to, please contribute (responsibly) to the projects on GitHub to keep them up to date so that they can continue to be used for invaluable research.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something worth mentioning that hasn't been mentioned yet in this thread is that immunity isn't some physical barrier that keeps an infection out. Your immune system just knows what it is and can fight it off more quickly and effectively. </p>
<p>That said, it's possible that in some people the immune system goes overboard and does more harm than good. Like an allergic reaction.</p>
<p>Point is, though there probably is some immunity, one should still take all precautions to prevent reinfection. It's possible the second time could be worse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are currently <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/01/seattle-patient-third-in-world-to-be-reinfected-with-covid-19/" target="_blank">three known instances</a> of that happening.</p>
<p>Taking into consideration the amount of testing that's going on and how many people have been infected so far, there are most likely more. But we can safely assume that it is not very common right now. We can expect the number of reinfections to rise in the upcoming months.</p>
<p>If we consider our current knowledge about covid-19 and other similar diseases, it seems that you gain (partial) immunity for at least several weeks, more probably months. That doesn't mean you will not be able to contract the disease again but the odds are much lower and they increase as the time passes. And if you contract it again, it will generally not be as severe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People may <em>very easily</em> be able to <em>shed</em> covid-19 more than once.</p>
<p>It's critical to ask whether you are talking about getting sick twice (immunity against disease, which is what most people on this thread are talking about; as they say, cases of repeated disease are extremely rare), or getting the virus into your system twice and transmitting it to other people (&quot;sterilizing immunity&quot; with no possible repeated shedding is actually fairly rare for any disease).</p>
<p>For other human coronaviruses, we know that it's very common to get sick once, but then pick up the virus again a few months later and shed it and infect other people, even without getting sick a second time.</p>
<p>So, if someone says they are safe because they had covid already... No.  No, they are not safe.  We do not know that.  They may very well be capable of getting the virus again, becoming infectious again, and being a danger to other people again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are cases of &quot;long covid&quot;.. where symptoms never really disappear or simple re-surge afterwards.</p>
<p>It might be the case that people rarely test positive twice, but have lasting effects or a resurgence of effects from the disease.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
