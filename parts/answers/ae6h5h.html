		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sea ice is visibly different from an ice cap on land, any Arctic explorers would notice that.</p>
<p>Robert Peary claimed to have reached the North Pole in 1909, though whether he actually got there is unclear. There were numerous other expeditions on the ice around that time.</p>
<p>An airship flew over the North Pole in 1926. The view from the air would &quot;seal the deal&quot; as it were I reckon, any large landmass would be noticeable.</p>
<p>Military submarines were travelling under the Arctic ice, and sometimes even surfacing through it, in the late 50s.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fridtjolf Nansen was a Norwegian scientist who made the discovery in the late 1800s. He had long theorized it, and had a special ship made: The “Fram”. The Fram was made with a 2 meter thick hull, and Nansen took it during the Spring melt in Siberia, let it freeze in the Arctic waters, and he and his crew let his theorized east-west Arctic currents take them to the other side. Nansen himself, and a colleague left the ship with dogsleds in an attempt to go to the pole, and were later rescued, not making it to the pole but making a new latitude record. Nansen was a really interesting guy, and I absolutely recommend learning about him.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The distance from Greenland to Siberia is just a little bigger than the <strong>shortest distance</strong> across Australia (both ~2k km). An Australian sized landmass on the North Pole would be visible, or overlap with, many places in the Artic circle. So people knew there wasn't anything like that there for a very long time, at least the people who lived there did.</p>
<p>Early European maps just guessed. Some had land but more had water. By the 1700s they generally all had water because people really wanted there to be a northwest passage. </p>
<p>It was certainly obvious there wasn't a continent there by the mid-1800s, and even a large island would have been seen. In fact for a while there was a search for a patch of open ocean in the cap that some explorers had claimed to see, but never actually existed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ice is only a few meters thick, you can drill through it with even primative technology. In addition it is very flat, if there were a continent underneath you would expect some hills or mountains or something. The areas with land protrude much higher. The ice cap over Greenland is over 3000 meters thick in places.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nansen's Fram expedition, 1893-1896, didn't reach the pole, but it set a new 'furthest north' and established conclusively that the are between Noth America and Eurasia was a frozen sea. Indeed, the whole premise of the expedition was to use polar drift, the movement of sea ice, to bring the vessel Fram within striking distance of the Pole. The expedition laid the foundations for the science of oceanography and the study of sea currents.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
