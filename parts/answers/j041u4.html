One of the means we have considered analyzing exo-planets for signs of life is to spectroscopically look for free oxygen in their atmospheres. If a planet has a significant oxygen content in its atmosphere, it has something unusual going on chemically there that could indicate life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oxygen is unstable and reactive. If photosynthesising plants didn't keep replenishing it, we'd pretty quickly lose our oxygen to fires, aerobic respiration and so on. Our current equilibrium is around 21%, whereas back in the carboniferous the abundance of green plants and warmer temperatures would've lifted that balancing point to 35%.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A place to start is with the recognition that there is a reasonable level of disagreement with regards to the exact concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere through time and specifically the behavior of oxygen levels around the Carboniferous-Permian-Triassic interval. Specifically, <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/287/5458/1630.abstract" target="_blank">Berner et al, 2000</a> used isotopic proxies and mass balance calculations to suggest that there was relatively rapid spike in oxygen levels up to ~35% during the Carboninerous and then a relatively quick drop down &lt;20%, where as <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1354-1013.2001.00429.x" target="_blank">Lenton, 2001</a> suggests that it likely maxed out ~24% in the Carboniferous, and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo923" target="_blank">Glasspool &amp; Scott, 2010</a> argue for concentrations ~30% for much of the late Paleozoic and into the Mesozoic but with more frequent oscillations in values. All of this is just to make sure we are all starting out with the right level of scrutiny of the numbers.</p>
<p>Most sources (those above, and others) agree that the rise in oxygen levels leading up to the Carboniferous is likely related to the large scale establishment of land plants. The controls on the decrease of oxygen (or even more generally, the relative roles of different biogeochemical processes on regulating oxygen concentrations in the atmosphere) are less clear. Processes that appear to be important in removing oxygen from the atmosphere are (1) oxidation of formerly buried organic matter, (2) reactions following thermal breakdown of buried organic matter, (3) the oxidation of pyrite (and other sulfur compounds) during weathering (see <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.earth.31.100901.141329" target="_blank">Berner et al, 2003</a> for a summary) and (4) a whole littany of other cycles that get more and more nuanced (e.g. Lenton, 2001 goes into these with a focus on the role of phosphorous cycling and Berer et al, 2003 runs through several as well). Generally, many of these appear to act as negative feedbacks, i.e. increasing oxygen concentrations drive some of these mechanisms to become more efficient at removing oxygen from the atmosphere, thus as far as I can tell from my reading, there is no single cause, but that generally a variety of biogeochemical processes (which are always active) would serve to bring oxygen levels back down after a spike. I'll happily be corrected by someone with more experience in these matters and who hopefully has some non contradictory sources.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While there are several factors related to it, there are a few things to consider.</p>
<p>There were millions of trees during the carboniferous period that produced O2 from CO2, and  used the carbon to make lignin, which is a very complex organic molecule that is a major component in wood, and is what makes it rigid and durable. At this point, there were no organisms capable of breaking down lignin, so when trees died they just piled up, sometimes sinking in swamps, and eventually formed coal deposits. This took the carbon out of the cycle but the oxygen built up in the atmosphere. After a while though, fungi developed enzymes that could break down lignin and use the carbon for their own biomass growth (most fungi use oxygen for respiration, like animals, and release CO2). The fungi released the CO2 back into the atmosphere and the food chain, and because there was such a large amount of lignin lying around as a useful food source, they had plenty of food to get through. Eventually because no more carbon was getting permanently locked up in coal (until humans started to burn it lol), an equilibrium was reached. It is important to remember that oxygen is also a component of CO2 and lignin, so oxygen was also going to those sources. Also when talking about the percentage composition of the atmosphere, it is relative to the other components. So oxygen levels of 30% vs 21% do not necessarily mean that 9% of oxygen was lost, it could just be that other components increased, making the relative amount of oxygen lower.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
