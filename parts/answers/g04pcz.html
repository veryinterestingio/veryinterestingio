		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are different ways to create a vaccine.  One is to creat a “dead” virus. Another is to find and create a strand of RNA that triggers antigens.  The dead virus method is slower and isn’t always effective.  The RNA method has multiple different variations that are likely to work so you narrow it down to the antigen creating strands, test to see which create the right amount of antigens, and also figure out which will work without too many side effects, etc.  they are doing both RNA and dead virus versions simultaneously to save time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two Polio vaccines named after their creators. The Sabin vaccine and the Salk Vaccine. The Sabin vaccine is live Polio virus strains that have been weakened by getting them to adapt to non human animals. The Salk vaccine is an inactivated virus vaccine. You grow viruses in culture. Then use something (formaldehyde I think in the Salk vaccine case) to smash the viruses to pieces and inject the pieces. The Sabin vaccine has a benefit that it actually spreads in the community also spreading immunity, but without causing the poliomyelitis (the paralysis) that human Polio strains are famous for. But you have a very small chance of the Sabin vaccine reverting to being dangerous. These days there are actually more people infected by reverted Sabin vaccine than from the old wild strains. This is causing quite a debate in the eradication community. Because the Sabin vaccine is much, much, much easier to administer as it's just a few drops of liquid on your tongue. The Salk vaccine has to be injected into a muscle, and so requires a lot more training and equipment to distribute safely. Using the Sabin vaccine was probably the right choice when wild Polio was prevalent, but it's getting harder to justify it's use.</p>
<p>For Coronavirus most of the vaccines are targeting the &quot;spike&quot; protein that is on the outside of the virus. But there are a lot of choices, like what part of the spike, what concentrations, adjuvants (other stuff you add to the vaccine to make it work better), and manufacturing methods are being tried out. There are some very new types of vaccines called DNA vaccines that are being tried also. If one of those work out I believe it'll be the first DNA vaccine to be licensed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most attempts to make a vaccine don’t work out. An untested vaccine might be useful, but not effective enough to stop the spread (e.g., the current flu vaccine is only borderline effective).  They might have unwanted side effects (there was a flu vaccine in the 70s that was associated with a small uptick in a rare autoimmune disorder). Sometimes untested vaccines can actually make you more susceptible to the disease.</p>
<p>It takes a long time to do trials of vaccines to prove that they are both safe and effective. So, many research organizations around the world are working on it for coronavirus. Maybe 10 of them will create a promising candidate, and maybe 2 of those pass the trials and be approved.</p>
<p>Also, this is what these experts have spent their whole life working for. This is their moment. Of course they’re all gonna step up now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interesting question. Vaccines work by introducing your body to viral material, usually protein. Basically any method that gives your body the exposure to produce chemicals that attack viral proteins. For coronavirus there are some different ideas on how to best do this, which is why there are teams with different vaccine projects</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the companies aren’t actually creating vaccines. Companies like Gilead and Sanofi are using drugs they already made and trying it on covid patients and it turns out to work. I follow markets closely and it looks like gilead sciences has a good treatment option</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
