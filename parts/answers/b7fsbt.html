		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a sociological perspective, it's not so much about the &quot;credibility&quot; of the scriptures as it is about the people who practice them.  There are very, very few people who observe the rites and rituals of the ancient Egyptians, Romans, or Greeks; and there are billions who observe those of Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, or Hinduism.  </p>
<p>A religion becomes mythology when there isn't a significant community that really believes it anymore.</p>
<p>From an objective perspective, the body of the myths are just as powerful (or just as ridiculous) as the scriptures.  There is tremendous beauty in any religious text, but you're more likely to feel compelled by a particular text if you were raised in a culture that appreciates it and uses it as a frame of reference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Question: Is Hinduism considered mythology? It’s been practiced FAR longer than all the other mainstream religions.</p>
<p>Also Not an answer but, In 2000 years there might be a new widespread religion that overtakes the Abrahamic ones and cast them into the realm of Mythology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mythology is the beliefs and stories, and Religion is the rites, rituals, and practices that living people today participate in. </p>
<p>Christianity/Islam/Judaism DO have mythologies, they just also have living people to do the rites, rituals, and practices that make up their religion. Terms like &quot;Real&quot; religion are emotion-based words that aren't logical nor factual, and wouldn't be useful in an actual discussion of this subject, btw.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, mythology is part of a religion. </p>
<p>The mythology is the writings that are the basis of the religion, religions have many more components than just the mythology. They have rituals (Praying 5 times a day towards Mecca, Communion, the observance of the Passover), the mythology, and the believers. </p>
<p>The confusion comes from the fact that we commonly only study the mythology of these ancient religions- because they're the only things left- and this has led to the word colloquially referring to those whole religions, and used to demean religions as a whole or other religions that you want to insult. </p>
<p>If you study just the stories, you study the mythology. If you study how these stories affected the lives of people in ancient Egypt, then you're studying the religion. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
