		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Psychologist here! We distinguish between intrinsic motivation, which is self-driven motivation that you naturally already have, and extrinsic motivation, which comes from something that is not you. This could be money or, in OP’s example, social recognition for doing what you’re told. </p>
<p>There’s a phenomenon known as <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation_crowding_theory" target="_blank">“crowding out”</a> where adding extrinsic motivation crowds out (displaces) intrinsic motivation. </p>
<p>A famous study found that kids spend less time drawing if you tell them that they’ll get a good student award for drawing a good picture, compared to if you just let them draw without telling them anything. The hypothesis is that the kids lose motivation when it moves from “I’m drawing because I like it and it’s fun” to “I’m drawing because someone told me to, so that I can win a prize.”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Psychology this is known as 'Reactance' It's a state of mind you get when your free will is under threat. If someone tells you to do something you were already going to do, it removes the element of free will. You feel you're no longer making the decision to carry out the task, and thus not wanting to conform, no longer want to perform said task.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you were going to do it on your own, not only were you going to accomplish the task, but you were going to do it unprompted.  You didn't just do the thing, you did it of your own accord.  </p>
<p>As soon as you're told to do it, now you're just doing what someone else told you.  It's no longer a nice thing that you're doing for someone else, now you're just following orders and they &quot;had&quot; to remind you to do it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of great comments already, but I wanted to add a reason I haven't seen yet: obeying someone sets a precedent.</p>
<p>If someone tells me to do something and then I do it, I might be showing them that their judgment is better than mine, their preferences or comfort is more important than mine, and that I can be counted on to set my own desires aside in favor of theirs.  Sometimes NOT doing that is more important than whatever made me want to do the task in the first place.</p>
<p>Obviously this way of thinking shouldn't influence every interpersonal decision you make, and constantly acting out in defiance is a miserable way to live.  Still, it is important to assert yourself to some extent, so this feeling can be strong.  After all, you teach people how to treat you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
