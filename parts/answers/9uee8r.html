		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You've got a bazillion answers here. There's the ELI5:</p>
<p>Yes, there is a speed for every car that is the most fuel efficient.</p>
<p>Then, there's the rest:</p>
<p>It's a sweet spot that is different for every car, but is a combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engine design - Every engine has a sweet spot, both in RPMs and in <em>temperature</em>, of both the engine and the incoming air. There's a certain engine speed that makes the most power for the least amount of throttle application. At this point, you're getting the most energy possible out of each measured explosion. </li>
<li>Transmission design &amp; associated gear ratios. These are chosen to either give you good acceleration, good fuel mileage, or an attempt at both. Transmissions like the modern &quot;CVT&quot; can play games to give you both. </li>
<li>Wheel &amp; tire design. Tread design, tire inflation, rubber compound. Tires will heat &amp; soften at higher sustained speeds, increasing rolling resistance. Different tires have different behaviors with regard to increased speeds and ambient temperatures. </li>
<li>Aerodynamics. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Of this entire list, aerodynamics will be the most dominant. When you double your speed, you quadruple the wind resistance. It is the only parameter in this list that increases in this fashion.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there is. It's called the &quot;cruising speed&quot;, and it varies between engine designs (i.e. Ford's ecocharger<em> 6 cylinder engine can have a different cruising speed than Ferrari's turboguzzler</em> 6 cylinder engine). It's the optimal balance between speed and fuel consumption. </p>
<p>Jets, ships, helicopters, etc. all also have a cruising speed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mechanical engineer here, there's a lot of confusion going around this subject. and testing something  yourself is almost useless, unless you can strictly control all variables which is close to impossible.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>there are 2 things that have a major impact on  your fuel efficiency,</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>1: Wind drag and other losses, assuming you'll be going faster then grandma picking up the kids at school, wind drag becomes the dominant factor. ( <a href="https://www.withouthotair.com/cA/figure321.png" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.withouthotair.com/cA/figure321.png" target="_blank">https://www.withouthotair.com/cA/figure321.png</a></a> ) . so for all cases, the lower the speed the more fuel efficient with regards to drag and frictional loses. (not very useful info here) </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>2: Engine efficiency, this is a big one that almost everybody gets wrong. The main thing here is called BSFC (Brake specific fuel consumption), this is the amount of fuel required to produce 1 hp (amount of fuel per hp). the lower the number, the more efficient your running the engine.  and this says that an engine at its maximum load will be the most efficient, at an rpm range of 1/3 to 2/3 its max rpm.  this is for a normal engine (not turbo or supercharger) , for those its actually better to be at \~125% engine load (above 100% is only possible with a turbo or supercharger) .</p>
<p>they way to identify this load % is easiest achieved with a vacuum or vacuum/boost gauge.  0 vacuum = 100% load.</p>
<p>( <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316530475/figure/fig4/AS:495842618089478@1495229500689/BSFC-map-of-the-engine-7-BSFC-brake-specific-fuel-consumption-rpm-r-min-Max-maximum.png" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316530475/figure/fig4/AS:495842618089478@1495229500689/BSFC-map-of-the-engine-7-BSFC-brake-specific-fuel-consumption-rpm-r-min-Max-maximum.png" target="_blank">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316530475/figure/fig4/AS:495842618089478@1495229500689/BSFC-map-of-the-engine-7-BSFC-brake-specific-fuel-consumption-rpm-r-min-Max-maximum.png</a></a> )</p>
<p>i have a 1.8t (1.8L turbo), i found almost a 50% increase in fuel efficiency by trying to hit 0 vacuum all the time while staying between 2500-3500 RPM. it requires you to think ahead a lot and occasionally speed.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I hope this helps some people with this very confusing subject.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
