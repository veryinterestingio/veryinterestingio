		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For those of you tuning into the Earthquake Megathread, I thought I'd provide a litle bit of detail on the event and some tectonic context. The <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/ci38443183/executive" target="_blank">main earthquake had a magnitude of Mw 6.4</a>, was a <del>right-lateral</del> (see Edit below) strike slip event, and appears to have occurred within the <a href="http://scedc.caltech.edu/significant/airport.html" target="_blank">Airport Lake Fault Zone</a> (though which fault strand the main shock occurred on is unclear at the moment). The main shock was actually preceded by a <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/ci38443095/executive" target="_blank">Mw 4.0 foreshock about 30 minutes prior</a>. As a reminder, designation of an earthquake as a foreshock happens <strong>after</strong> the main event occurs, i.e. when this Mw 4.0 earthquake happened, there was no way of knowing it was a foreshock. There have already been a lot of aftershocks, e.g. <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/#%7B%22autoUpdate%22%3A%5B%22autoUpdate%22%5D%2C%22basemap%22%3A%22grayscale%22%2C%22feed%22%3A%221day_m25%22%2C%22listFormat%22%3A%22default%22%2C%22mapposition%22%3A%5B%5B35.31960740586162%2C-118.17169189453125%5D%2C%5B36.01800375871416%2C-116.90414428710936%5D%5D%2C%22overlays%22%3A%5B%22plates%22%5D%2C%22restrictListToMap%22%3A%5B%22restrictListToMap%22%5D%2C%22search%22%3Anull%2C%22sort%22%3A%22newest%22%2C%22timezone%22%3A%22utc%22%2C%22viewModes%22%3A%5B%22list%22%2C%22map%22%5D%2C%22event%22%3Anull%7D" target="_blank">this map</a> (this link isn't static, so if you're viewing this after the day of, it probably won't be relevant, so as a stand in, <a href="https://i.redd.it/4dxuywg93c831.jpg" target="_blank">here's</a> a screenshot someone posted earlier of the aftershocks within a few hours of the main shock) mostly on the Airport Lake Fault Zone, but also on the <a href="http://scedc.caltech.edu/significant/littlelake.html" target="_blank">Little Lake Fault Zone</a>. The high number of foreshocks is not unexpected, generally the frequency of foreshocks after an earthquake is greatest shortly after the event and decrease through time as described by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftershock#Omori's_law" target="_blank">Omori's law</a>. This <a href="https://twitter.com/USGS/status/1146885873163821082" target="_blank">USGS twitter thread</a> provides a lot of good detail on what we generally expect for sizes of aftershocks and the probability that this earthquake itself would lead to a larger event (it is not likely).</p>
<p>On a <a href="http://scedc.caltech.edu/significant/basin.html" target="_blank">map</a>, the Airport Lake fault Zone is the little white bunch of discontinuous faults and the orange ones are the Little Lake Fault Zone (near the bottom of the map, by the town of Ridgecrest). These fault zones are part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_Lane" target="_blank">Walker Lane / Eastern California Shear Zone</a>, which is a diffuse network of faults that run along the eastern edge of the Sierra Nevada mountains and, along with the San Andreas system, separate the Sierra Nevada into a 'microplate'. In detail, it's been argued that the Walker Lane / ECSZ is progessively shunting more deformation off of the San Andreas and is gradually becoming the new North America - Pacific plate boundary, <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/books/book/919/chapter/4816651/active-tectonics-of-the-eastern-california-shear" target="_blank">e.g. thie field guide</a>.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> <a href="http://temblor.net/earthquake-insights/southern-california-m-6-4-earthquake-stressed-by-two-large-historic-ruptures-8976/" target="_blank">Temblor.net</a> just posted a great little article about some previous historic earthquakes in the region and their relation to this event, along with a quick calculation of the stress changes this earthquake may have induced on neighboring faults.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> July 5, some geologists have found surface rupture and various offsets which suggest that the rupture was likely a left-lateral rupture on a fault oriented NE-SW. The focal mechanism on the USGS page is consistent with either a right-lateral on a NW-SE fault, or a left-lateral on a NE-SW fault and as this earthquake occurred in a dominantly right-lateral system (i.e. the ECSZ), I assumed the right-lateral option was more likely, but field evidence trumps assumptions!</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 3:</strong> With the more recent <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/ci38457511/executive" target="_blank">Mw 7.1 event</a>, the original Mw 6.4 appears to have been a foreshock. The location and focal mechanism of this new event seems pretty similar to the July 4th earthquake.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 4:</strong> <a href="http://temblor.net/earthquake-insights/magnitude-7-1-earthquake-rips-northwest-from-the-m6-4-just-34-hours-later-9041/" target="_blank">Temblor.net</a> has posted another update with more info on the new 7.1 and how it relates to the previous 6.4 event.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, this was pretty neat. I live in San Diego but I'm currently in Chicago conducting an x-ray experiment at the synchrotron at Argonne lab. Shortly after we received news of the magnitude 7.1 earthquake in Southern California this evening, the control operator announced that there was movement in the x-ray beam due to an earthquake. We thought it was odd that Chicago would have an earthquake so close to California; because, there's no way we could feel the California earthquake all the way here in Chicago, right?</p>
<p>We promptly checked the internet for news of the Chicago earthquake but couldn't find anything. We kept waiting and checking, but no news appeared. Maybe the beam movement was due to the California quake, after all. Using a distance of 2,000 km between Bakersfield and Chicago and a sound velocity in earth of 7 km/s, a back-of-the-envelope calculation for time delay between the earthquake and the beam movement came out to ~7.5 minutes, which actually matched up with the two events pretty well.</p>
<p>The timing checks out, but does it seem sensible for the beam to feel the earthquake so far away? Does anyone know the r-dependence for the amplitude of an earthquake wave? I know there are P- and S-type body waves, as well as surface waves. I would guess that the body waves decay ~1/r2 , since they are 3-dimensional, and the surface waves drop off ~1/r, as they're 2-dimensional? Or maybe the translation of the faults resembles something akin to a dipole, which would drop off more slowly?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
