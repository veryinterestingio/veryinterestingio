		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Advanced rocket engines usually use <em>regenerative cooling</em>. The cold propellant is passed through tubing in the nozzle and combustion chamber to provide cooling.</p>
<p>You can see this quite clearly in the F-1 engine that powered the Saturn V. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/F-1_Engine_at_INFINITY_Science_Center.jpg" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/F-1_Engine_at_INFINITY_Science_Center.jpg</a></p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Recovered_F-1_Engine_parts_.jpg" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Recovered_F-1_Engine_parts_.jpg</a></p>
<p>Zoom in to these pictures (the first is a complete engine, the second is a damaged one) and you can see that the front part of the nozzle is <em>made</em> of a whole bunch of tubes running lengthwise, with metal rings around them like the hoops of a barrel. Indeed the combustion chamber itself is made of those same tubes. Inside them the cool fuel flows before it reaches the combustion chamber.</p>
<p>The rear part of the nozzle is cooled by using the not as hot gas from the gas generator (that powers the engine's fuel pumps). The large duct halfway down the nozzle is what takes the gas generator exhaust and feeds it to the inner nozzle walls.</p>
<p>The RL10 engine also shows the idea beautifully, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/RL-10_rocket_engine_%2830432256313%29.jpg" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/RL-10_rocket_engine_%2830432256313%29.jpg</a> And the RL10 takes it a step further. It's an <em>expander cycle</em> engine. As the fuel, liquid hydrogen in this case, passes within the nozzle walls to cool the engine the fuel is heated and expands, and this expansion is actually what drives the rocket's fuel pumps to keep pumping more fuel in in a self-sustaining cycle. It's a relatively simple and efficient approach, but only works for comparatively small engines.</p>
<p>There is an alternative much simpler approach: <em>ablative cooling</em>. Just make the nozzle from something that's OK to slowly burn away, usually something based on graphite. The RS-68 used on the Delta IV rocket takes this approach. This is only good for single-use engines; the reusable RS-25 on the Space Shuttle and Merlin 1D on the Falcon 9 need to use the more complex regenerative cooling to be able to handle multiple flights.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Liquid rocket engines have cooling systems, just like your car engine.</p>
<p>What the RS-25 (space shuttle main engine) did was send liquid hydrogen (2nd coldest liquid, only liquid helium is colder) through cooling channels in the nozzle before sending it to the combustion chamber. It might have also sent the liquid oxygen through cooling channels as well, but not 100% sure.</p>
<p>I believe the Merlin 1D does the same thing with whatever fuel it uses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the vacuum version, most of the nozzle is cooled from blackbody radiation: It gets so hot that it glows visibly and emits a lot of infrared radiation. That is sufficient to cool it. That part of the nozzle is quite simple, too, so it is acceptable if it gets hot. And the vacuum engine doesn't have to be reusable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answers here are all right so far but they are also all missing a couple of key parts:</p>
<p>Abrasion or ablation</p>
<p>The black smoke you see coming from a rocket isn't actually just the fuel being burnt it's the surface of the nozzle being burnt away and it's not an accident it's designed to be burnt away as when it does it bleeds away the hot surface of the material.</p>
<p>Radiation</p>
<p>Often the nozzles have materials in them that glow when hot, this again isn't by accident, the glow emits heat in the form of radiation, again helping to cool the engine</p>
<p>Here's a really short video I found, its basic but explains everything really well <a href="https://youtu.be/BtRX0rNt9EI" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/BtRX0rNt9EI</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
