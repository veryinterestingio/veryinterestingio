		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your eyes don't perceive images, they are receptors for the light falling in. The lens in your eyes will indeed project the images upside down, but they are not perceived upsides down.</p>
<p>The first weeks of your life are very interesting, you are with an empty sheet of experiences and all these things which are attached to you and all these impulses coming to you. You will find out that there is a feedback on everything you randomly do and you will learn how to interpret them. Then you will learn how to use that new knowledge to do other random stuff and get the feedback on them and learn other things.</p>
<p>One of the things is vision and you will learn that if you move your head (once you have mastered your neck muscles) that if you move your head in a certain direction that the vision also moves in a certain direction: Some action, feedback, interpretation.</p>
<p>This is not that your brain flips the image, this is how to brain learns to match feedback against actions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The etymology of &quot;camera&quot; is &quot;chamber&quot;. It's a necessary consequence of how old box-like cameras worked that when their image went through their pinhole onto their little projection screen, it would come out flipped in both the X and Y directions.</p>
<pre><code>bb
\/___ pinhole is here
/\___ projection screen with film
qq</code></pre>
<p>And everything in between is a &quot;chamber&quot;, and the chamber used to be bigger, but there is still <em>something</em> comparable to a chamber in even the smallest camera today.</p>
<p>Be careful what you mean when you say &quot;upside down&quot;.  &quot;bb&quot; upside down is &quot;pp&quot; but that's not what the eye chamber projects on the retina: rather, it's &quot;qq&quot;.</p>
<p>A disparity between what we know we see and what acts on our retina: it could be corrected by a 180 degree rotation. Or, by both a horizontal and vertical flip. The fascinating thing about the matter is that we haven't actually found any neurological or other anatomical structure that actually definitely checks-off for either one.</p>
<p>You know, up probably isn't down. But without cutting into eyes and brains and pointing, there's no way to definitively prove that left is left and right is right. The correction from our retinas might just have been the vertical flip, and everything else might just be backwards.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is complicated but basically it comes to this; whenever you project an image (which is what is happening) the image is upside down because of the way light works using a camera obscura. Your eyes and regular cameras are a form of camera obscura where light is restricted through an opening and the flat surface on the other side of the opening is where the projection rests. Your pupil does the same function as a cameras aperture opening. Your nervous system rights the image for you, with film you turn it upside down, a digital camera turns it upside down (right side up for our perspective) in software.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the eye and brain don't need to actively flip the view. </p>
<p>Just put the light sensors where you expect the light to hit. For the &quot;bottom of the scene,&quot; put light sensors at the top-back of the eye. And for the &quot;top of the scene,&quot; light sensors should go in the bottom-back part of the eye.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter what happens between the lens of the eye and the back of the eye, because those parts of the eye are not wired in, are not sensing, or interpreting, or sending any info in electrical signals to the brain. Only the light sensor cells in the back send info off to the brain.</p>
<p>The brain isn't getting an electrical signal from the lens (like it gets from the light sensors in the back), so I would reckon the brain doesn't know or care that the &quot;flip&quot; even occurs (between the lens and the retina).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Where did you learn this? I have never heard of this before</p>
<p>Babies are extremely near sighted when they are born, over time their far vision and color vision develop.</p>
<p>Also, all images that reach the brain are upside down and your brain flips them. I think this occurs in all ages, including babies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
