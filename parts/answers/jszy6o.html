You keep the tree planted in shallow soil, occasionally trim the roots, and train the branches to grow in interesting ways using wire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bonsai is basically two kanji meaning tree or plant and tray or pot. Any woody barked tree can have bonsai techniques applied. The goal is to give the tree a sense of age, and this is done by developing the root structure (nebari) the trunk, and ramification in the foliage. </p>
<p>To achieve this shape, techniques of wiring, pruning, and defoliation are used. One also wants to build the soil nutrition in the pot and promote beneficial bacteria and mycorrhiza. </p>
<p>In short, bonsai trees work just like their full sized counterparts but they are kept compact due to the restriction of the pot and the techniques applied. In fact, if I took a younger tree in a bonsai pot, and put it into the ground, it would grow to be a full sized tree.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
