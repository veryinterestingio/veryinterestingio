If they have a joey in the pouch, it will defecate in there, so the mom has to clean it. I imagine it still smells kind of bad after cleaning.
Not sure about other marsupials, but I guess they do the same thing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Opossums also clean their pouches by licking. Something worth noting is that, during certain months of the year, there is a dark orange/dark red colored discharge present in the pouch, at least in the tropical species <em>Didelphis Aurita</em>. Usually during or soon after the female's reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm unsure -why- exactly it happens, or even if there's a purpose for the discharge at all, but the good news is that the discharge is almost entirely odorless. It might be sort of a &quot;self-cleaning&quot; fluid to prepare the pouch for babies somehow, sort of how human lady-bits do loads of fluid exchange along the cycle.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As someone who regularly rescues opossum (and cares permanently for a disabled female), I must say (clean) opossum smell is quite pleasant and reminds me of that soft, comfortable smell that most clean cats have. Even their pouches smell perfectly fine :) Wild opossums sometimes get a bit dirty due to being a perianthropic species, but they're still very tidy animals who frequently bathe themselves like felines and rodents do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, they pick them clean. They can’t be too dirty, though, as a kangaroo pouch is essentially a second uterus. Iirc, the joey is the size of a raisin when they first enter the pouch, meaning if it’s too dirty it could die of infection. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
