		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of great comments on here and this will probably get buried in the discussion, but I think your question is only half answered.</p>
<p>A lot of Comments provided great explanations for why the amount of sleep you get doesn’t always match how you feel when you wake up (feeling rested or tired). One part of your question that hasn’t been answered is why you may only feel like you’ve been asleep for a few seconds.</p>
<p>You actually have a few internal clocks in your brain that keep track of time. Some of them rely on chemical changes within cells that help track your circadian rhythm. You also receive a tremendous amount of external input that impacts your circadian rhythm and sense of time  throughout the day as well. Obviously when you’re asleep, you receive little to no external input, so you’re in a state where your internal clocks are already being limited.</p>
<p>There are actually different systems your brain uses when it estimates time on a scale of minutes or hours. One part of your brain called the striatum helps judge time when you’re trying to pay attention to how much time is passing. When you’re asleep, this part of the brain functions rhythmically with sleep cycles and thus your sense of time might be affected based on its activity when you wake up.</p>
<p>More importantly, we’ve learned that our brain’s time estimation heavily utilizes short-term memory. One of the most important functions of sleep is processing short term memories. When our brain shuffles and sorts short term memories, the ‘time stamps’ probably get jumbled with them. This can mean that when you wake up, your brain sacrificed keeping track of time and will judge how long you’ve been asleep based on the ‘time stamp’ of the memory it was shuffling. It’s a crude analogy, but hopefully makes sense.</p>
<p>I hope this helps answer part of your question, or at least you found it interesting!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sleeping for a longer time (8-9 hours) isn't as important as quality of sleep. Sleep cycles are around 1.5 hours, and take about the same amount of time to fall into REM sleep - where all the good rebuilding and restoring happens. </p>
<p>If you wake in the middle of one of these cycles, say at 8 hours, you're going to feel groggy and tired because your body wasn't in a great place to wake up yet. Sleeping for a super short time, like a 20 minute power nap, allows us to rest and shut down briefly without falling into that heavy sleep that's hard to wake from.</p>
<p>You can help this be more predictable by keeping a consistent sleep schedule and shooting for 90 minute intervals. Plan to get 4.5, 6, or 7.5 hours, (leaving time to fall asleep of course,) and base your alarm off of that. It's very tempting to milk every minute of sleep you can by snoozing your alarm or going back to sleep after you've woken up naturally just because you have the time to. Don't do that, trust me, it never helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This has to do with sleep cycles.</p>
<p>There is a point where your body start to do deep repair and turns everything 'off.' This is about ~15 minutes into your sleep cycle. If you get up after this point, but before your sleep cycle has entered the period where you are turning everything back 'on,'(around the 1 1/2 hour point) you will wake up fatigued and groggy.  </p>
<p>These numbers have some variability, of course.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: The more complete answer to your question is a combination of the biological sleep cycles, etc that everyone else has mentioned, along with psychological factors as well. </p>
<p>There are many factors that contribute to this. Lots of mentions of biological cycles here, which are indeed valid, but little mention of psychological factors.
Stress, mood, even diet and many more things can have different effects on different sleep periods.
When you are asleep, the subconscious mind is in full control. The concept of time is very different during this. I've had dreams that felt like minutes, hours, or days, and almost never correspond to the actual real world time that has passed.  I once fell asleep at my desk for what turned out to be about 5 minutes, but the dream I had definitely was a 20 or 30 minute adventure. </p>
<ul>
<li>The point of saying that is to highlight that actual time, measured by a clock, does not always correspond to or equate to sleep time as measured by the mind.. </li>
</ul>
<p>Sleep is equally important to the mind as it is to the body, and has as much effect on the mind as it does the body. It is a period for the conscious mind to relax, and the subconscious mind to, basically, perform maintenance - just like the physical body. </p>
<p>It is easily conceivable that during a short sleep time, your mind could get exactly the refresh it needed. This can have a direct effect on the physical feeling.
The opposite can happen as well; say you're in a period of life stress, or you were having a particularly strong or intense dream, or any number of other things that your  subconscious mind needs more time to work out. If the sleep ends before the subconscious is satisfied, this can adversely effect physical feeling as well; even if more than enough time has passed for the body to get the amount of sleep it needed.</p>
<p>It is well established that mental and emotional things have direct effects on the physical body; this also includes sleep. These psychological factors are difficult to measure, and can vary wildly from day to day, can even vary wildly within a single day.
And since sleep is the time for the subconscious mind, these factors might not always be apparent to your waking mind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
