		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's complicated. A gas giant, by modern definitions, is a planet composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium - you could consider it a failed star, if you want. However, that doesn't mean it is entirely gaseous. As pressure increases - which it does as you move towards the centre of the planet - molecules are forced to change state. First, there's sufficient pressure that the hydrogen starts behaving like a liquid. Then, further down, there's sufficient pressure that it starts behaving like a solid. There <em>is</em> a solid surface to the gas giants, it's just buried deep, deep within them, and if you were to try and stand on it (and could somehow counter pressure on yourself) you would eventually become buoyant long before you touch any solid material, as you would reach a point where the pressure of the hydrogen around you is enough that it becomes too dense for you to continue falling. At this point, the hydrogen would actually still by a gas, but you'd be buoyant in it anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The planet may have a solid molten core, but is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium.</p>
<p>Gas giants are often thought of as stars that missed the cut-off to become heavy enough to ”ignite” and sustain nuclear fusion.</p>
<p>Compare these types of planets to gaseous planets made of heavier molecules and elements or planets which are rocky.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly what they mean.</p>
<p>Jupiter and the other gas giants do not have a solid surface the way a rocky planet like Earth does. They're huge balls of gas that may have a solid core under many thousands of miles of dense gas atmosphere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a bit of a misnomer.</p>
<p>Any thing in space is going to, eventually, over time, separate into bands based on density. The more dense stuff will work it's way towards the center (down) and the less dense still will work it's way towards the outside (up).</p>
<p>A planet is just a big thing in space that meets an arbitrary size/orbit requirement.</p>
<p>A planet, then, will eventually separate into bands of density. The dense stuff, like rocks, will end up in the center. The less dense stuff, like gasses, will end up on the outer edge. And all through the middle will be bands of gradually increasing density working inwards.</p>
<p>These density bands are really easy to see where it transitions from gas to liquid to solid.</p>
<p>We can see this with our own planet. Contrary to a popular misconception, the planet starts at the air, not at the dirt. Working from the outside in, our planet starts with some very thin air, then gradually the air gets thicker, then you hit some water, then some rocks (the bands aren't perfect, in some areas the rocks are above the water), then some denser rocks, then some rocks so dense they're liquid, and so on.</p>
<p>We actually live inside the planet, right at the transition between two bands (rocks and air). Other forms of life live deeper, at the transition between rocks and liquid. </p>
<p>A &quot;gas giant&quot; is just a planet with a lot more gas than liquid or rock. We call it that because it's a giant and it's got a lot of gas. It does still have liquid and rock.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
