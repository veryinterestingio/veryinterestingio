		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body produces 2 chemicals that help regulate your sleep wake cycle: cortisol and melatonin. Cortisol is the &quot;awake&quot; hormone and melatonin is the &quot;sleep&quot; hormone. At night, your melatonin level rises and triggers sleep while cortisol levels decrease. In the morning, the opposite happens.</p>
<p>Your body gets accustomed to these hormone levels changing at a certain time. One of the biggest factors for this is light. Light triggers the body to stop producing melatonin (which is why you should stay off electronics and dim your lights before going to bed). Other triggers such as temperature and pressure changes can potentially cause the swap.</p>
<p>Edit: To expand a little bit, pretty much all of these changes are centered around a part of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) which is often referred to as the circadian clock. It takes in external stimuli (mostly light) and then triggers neural and hormonal changes and described above. How exactly this all occurs and the process of sleep is still not very well understood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All biological clocks work on basically the same principle (regardless of human, plant or microbes). It just consist on a set of compounds which have an activation/repression mechanism between themselves, and the relative ammounts of such compounds will then activate/deactivate other functions such as sleep/activity or many other things. I'll put an example of molecular clock which works on 2 components, but they are usually more complex).</p>
<p>The cell has genes encoding for 2 compounds: A and B, where the compound A activates the gene for B, and B represses the gene for A. The way it goes is the following: from the initial state (none of the compounds have been produced), gene A is active and the cell produces compound A, which starts to accumulate. As concentration of A increases, it will start activating the B gene, hence B's concentration will increase as well. As B accumulates, it will start supressing A until its production completely stops. That will cause A's concentration to decrease, and as it does so, gene B won't be activated anymore, so gene B will decrease its activity and it's product starts decaying as well. Once compound B's amount is low enough, gene A will be activated again, restarting the cycle. </p>
<p>This process results in a molecular dynamic which can be interpreted as coordinated waves with a constant length or duration, which can then be further adjusted by external factors via cortisol/melatonin as other comments already explained.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know the excuse &quot;Sorry I'm late Boss, my alarm didn't go off.&quot;
It's a common excuse for a reason. Many people in fact do NOT wake up by themselves. (Even if they go to bed at a reasonable hour.)</p>
<p>While a good amount of us do have a working biological clock, there are many of us who use an alarm clock for a reason.  </p>
<p>That being said, i tell my body, listen punk, tomorrow we are waking up at X:YZ Time and if you dont I will punch you in the gut!</p>
<p>Tough Lough works! I used to punch myself in the gut all the time, and now I almost never have to.. I can go to sleep at  11pm and if i have to wake up at 4am the next day, my body will do it for fear of my threats.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
