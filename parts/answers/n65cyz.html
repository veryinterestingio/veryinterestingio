		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The bedrocks in Canada (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Shield" target="_blank">the Canadian Shield</a>) and Fennoscandia (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Shield" target="_blank">the Baltic Shield</a>) constitute some of the most ancient and well-preserved rock on Earth's surface, their formation dating back to literally billions of years ago! They have had a <em>lot</em> of time to collect records of meteorite impacts. These old and stable areas of the lithosphere are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craton" target="_blank">cratons</a>, and they have survived cycles of continental merging and rifting relatively unchanged.</p>
<p>The ancient bedrock, however, would still be covered in a thick layer of soil and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regolith" target="_blank">regolith</a>, but in these areas the most recent glaciation has conveniently stripped off a lot of soil and exposed the bare rock underneath.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Likely due to glacier retreat. There's much less land in the south that is near the pole (excepting antarctica, which is one big frozen thing).</p>
<p>As glaciers retreat they leave their carved shape in the landscape which is hilly and obviously not level, leading to lakes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The question you might want to answer is why are there more lakes/water in these regions in general. That's probably the majority of the answer, the rest would be looking into if there is a different distribution of circular impact craters or not, and if so, why.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
