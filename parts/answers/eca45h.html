(at first this wasn't the case but they redesigned them, article on the subject:  <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/aerospace/satellites/spacex-claims-to-have-redesigned-its-starlink-satellites-to-eliminate-casualty-risks" target="_blank"><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/aerospace/satellites/spacex-claims-to-have-redesigned-its-starlink-satellites-to-eliminate-casualty-risks" target="_blank">https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/aerospace/satellites/spacex-claims-to-have-redesigned-its-starlink-satellites-to-eliminate-casualty-risks</a></a> )</p>
<p>I have no idea about the second question though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am an amateur astrophotographer, I catch satellites in my photos often, here is an example of two satellites in one frame I took this August (note this is from unprocessed raw image):
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/pef30PU.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/pef30PU.png</a>
BTW these were not caused by airplanes because airplanes have multiple navigation lights and strobe light, so they would cause multiple lines and some dotted lines.  </p>
<p>I can deal with this kind of issue by taking multiple pictures of the same object then use software to process these out by rejecting outliers in the images.  </p>
<p>However for professionals, their telescope time is much more expensive, so taking more pictures may not be an option.  So yes it is going to be a problem, how bad is still hard to say, at least it will increase the telescope time needed by astronomers to a certain degree.  On the other hand, I got news recently that SpaceX is talking to NSF about ways mitigate this, so we may hear more from them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It isn't possible to say at the moment, since it remains to be seen if their passive deorbiting mechanism works reliably as intended. We know that the collision avoidance algorithm failed to perform in at least <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-esa-satellite-collision-avoidance.html" target="_blank">one occasion</a>. As for astronomical observation, <a href="https://spacenews.com/spacex-working-on-fix-for-starlink-satellites-so-they-dont-disrupt-astronomy/" target="_blank">they are reportedly working on a coating</a>  to make them less reflective although there's no way to tell at this stage if it will work without causing additional issues (thermal management for example).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To put it simply: Every professional astronomical society has statements of varying levels of condemnation on starlink. Nearly everyone I know that does ground-based astronomy (and even a couple of astrophotographers) think the statements aren't strong enough and want the project stopped dead/large tax placed on these swarms.</p>
<p>Once fully implemented, there's essentially a 100% chance of satellites turning up in long exposures and it will be tons of added work trying to remove them (and realistically, the output will drop drastically). Optically, it's possible to get around them (but not in the current starlink plan) with more work/resources than professional astronomers have, but those working in non-visible light wavelengths are not so lucky. Radio astronomy will be dead as a field, SETI project dead, infrared will be a mess, exoplanet hunting dead, asteroid detection dead.</p>
<p>Basically, we will be forced to use space telescopes only... Of which there are very few and the competitiveness of proposals will be through the roof. Given the high priority of space based telescopes, there aren't many &quot;exploratory&quot; type niche projects that can be carried out on low-interest targets, so we'll be really limited about what we're allowed to study as well. Considering most of us already work on shoestring budgets, I expect to see many people leaving the field to go become &quot;data scientists&quot; for consulting firms. </p>
<p>Don't believe the SpaceX press releases, real astronomers are horrified at what this means for our research.</p>
<p>Tldr; it's the end of ground-based astronomy and the resources to transition to space-based astronomy don't exist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
