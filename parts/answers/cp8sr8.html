<p>Melatonin affects your &quot;internal clock.&quot; That time in the evening when you start to yawn every time, at the same time (if you go to bed on schedule).  It doesn't make you sleep, those are other chemicals being released at different intervals based on that clock. </p>
<p>Taking melatonin at a drastically different time is not effective as your internal clock can't shift that fast.  Instead, you start taking melatonin several days before your adjustment, usually 1 hour earlier before bedtime and keep taking it 1 hour earlier and earlier the next nights until the target bedtime.</p>
<p>In an extreme example, if you are flying from CA to Moscow, that's about a 12 hour difference.  Say you go to bed at 9pm normally in CA, and also want to go bed at 9pm in Moscow.  So you'd want to start 6 or 7 days before and take it at 8, then 7, 6 and so on and strictly stay to that schedule over the next 5 days in Moscow (from 2am, then 1am, 12am, etc).  </p>
<p>There are plenty of online calculators/schedulers that you can fill out and print to take with you that work well.  IMO, stay away from the ones that skip 2 hours a night - stick to 1 hour adjustments (I'm an old man).  However, the young may be able to skip 2 hours a night.</p>
<p>Last bits of advice: don't keep taking it past 2 or 3 days after your target nights: your body can become reliant on the doses to start the sleep cycle.  And lastly, use as small dosage as possible.  Even if you don't think it's working, it is.  I cut up the over the counter stuff as it's way too strong according to online dosage charts and it works well.</p>
<p>Source: I use to fly overseas a lot and have really hard times sleeping.  Once I figured out this schedule, I've had no problems over many years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
