		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a wide range of psychological and physical reasons why someone might be described as “mute”, ranging from shyness in children to conditions like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akinetic_mutism" target="_blank">akinetic mutism</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphonia" target="_blank">aphonia</a> </p>
<p>So the answer to your question depends on the condition of the person.  A shy child can make whatever noises they want, but a person with aphonia lacks the physical ability to create phonemes. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have mentioned, it varies. Some types of brain injury can get the wires crossed, so to speak. The person intends to say a word, but something else comes out or just unintelligible sounds.</p>
<p>I knew one guy who was more or less mute due to some congenital problem. He could say yes and no, more or less understandably, and was fairly expressive in his body language. Bizarrely, he could say numbers and was very good at math- just couldn't form words. We used to play darts at a local pub, he'd keep track of the score and could tell you how many points you had but had to use crude sign language when ordering beer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't always the cause for mutism but there is something called Broca's aphasia in which the brain cannot parse thoughts into language, due to damage/interruption to Broca's area in the brain. </p>
<p>Affected individuals cannot form words and have extreme difficulty writing. Language comprehension is unaffected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A variety of conditions can cause people to be nonverbal or partially nonverbal. In child development, you have motor coordination issues such as Childhood Apraxia of Speech, which is essentially difficulty in coordinating your articulation muscles to form the sound you want to make. Children on the autism spectrum can also be nonverbal, however this is more rooted in language delay and not speech. Interestingly, there is a higher comorbidity of CAS and ASD. Other reasons for children to be nonverbal also include language delays, psychiatric related issues (selective mutism for example), or brain injury.</p>
<p>In adults, speech and language can both be affected by a variety of issues including stroke (location of stroke impacting what type of impairment), brain injury, degenerative disease (ALS and Parkinson’s for example), etc. Depending on the severity, these folks can use Augmented Alternative Communication devices to communicate if their cognition is relatively still in tact.</p>
<p>Edit: Forgot to add that there is also a variety of dysarthrias (voice-related conditions) that can impact speech significantly. Few will make you totally nonverbal, but they can certainly impact quality of verbal communication. </p>
<p>Hope this helps. (Source: Speech Pathologist)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
