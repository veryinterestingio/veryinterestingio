As an example, chimpanzees gestate for about the same time but their babies are much more physically able than humans. Is this only due to head size?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi all you awesome Evolutionary Experts! Ok, over the last decade or so Epigenetics has been becoming more talked about where inherited traits and expression are concerned. Is this just a case of pop-science or is Epigenetics legitimately being found to be increasingly important in terms of evolutionary genetic expression?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello, thank you for joining us! I have a few questions, if that's okay.</p>
<p>For the invasive species folks: It seems like it's really hard to get ahead of a highly invasive species, and that removal methods may not be enough. What sort of research can be done to get ahead of that and possibly improve the odds of eradication? What sort of management strategies and decisions need to be made when eradication isn't possible?</p>
<p>For Amy Luo: The evolution of bird song traits sounds absolutely fascinating, and I would love to know more about that. Do you need to quantify specific aspects of the songs, for example? How do you do that?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
