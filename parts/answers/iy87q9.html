		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't thinkcthese are shared habits. More on the side of boredom (say whilst in class or sitting for long periods) and needing to fullfill the time. If you have the 2 items needed to do some of these things it will only be a matter of time before it happens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People, you included, are much more similar to one another than you probably think. </p>
<p>There are no original people. Not really, anyway. </p>
<p>It only makes sense that the conclusions and habits you reach, especially with such limited possible outcomes, would be the same as many other people.</p>
<p>That being said, for every person that stabs their eraser or rolls up bag straps, there's a person who does not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Where these aren't simply obvious things for a bored person to do (which I'm sure many of them are), what you're describing is &quot;cultural&quot; behaviour. Basically, we have an innate tendency to imitate, to some degree, at least, the behaviour of those around us whom we perceive as in some way part of &quot;our&quot; group. It doesn't have to be useful behaviour.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
