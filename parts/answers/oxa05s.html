		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Credit cards are the first common 2 factor authentication.</p>
<p>You need physical possession of the card <em>as well as</em> the 4 digit PIN. A thief may get the card, but won't have the PIN. If you follow security.</p>
<p>Yes, a 4 digit PIN seems unsecure by modern standards. But it is an old standard. The main security is physical possession of the card, or card details. Which is why it's a huge deal when websites have a breach and leak thousands or 10s of thousands if card details.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
