		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No you don't.</p>
<p>We often reset the heart in ED using medication or electric shocks if people have SVT - basically a super fast heart beat.</p>
<p>When taking the injection the heart stops for a couple of seconds - sometimes more - and when it restarts it often goes back to normal.</p>
<p>People do not go unconscious during the effects of the injection but they will always feel absolutely awful until the heart starts again.</p>
<p>So no. We do not go unconscious as soon as our heart stops.</p>
<p>We will go unconscious as soon as there isn't enough oxygen in the brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can actually chime in on this. I had a cardiac arrest in 2018  and was rescued by a passer by. I dropped because my heart stop, but I started Agonal breathing. Your brain stem senses the lack of blood and sends out pulses I believe. My savior did CPR for 18 minutes and then I was shocked in the ambulance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You pass out pretty quick but the death part is not necessarily as instantaneous as you might think. Your body actually has several minutes worth of oxygen stored up (which is why a few minutes of hands-only or compression-only CPR done before rescuers with equipment arrive actually helps)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yeh exactly it depends what you mean by death. We used to think of it as a single event, and now more so as a process, as we discovered ways to bring people back from what we used to think of as ‘dead’.
So if you get shot in the head, we say death is instantaneous. It seems obvious, but unless the bullet hits a specific part of the brain, the heart will beat for a little longer afterwards, your liver might not notice for a while etc, but we have no way currently to save someone who’s brain has stopped working due to bullet damage. </p>
<p>If your heart stops (let’s say from cardiac arrest instead of a bullet for this one) then the clock continues for the rest of the body (I say continue as they say we’re only ever a few minutes away from death, but each time we breathe this resets the clock). Each minute your heart is not pumping (either by itself or by CPR or something) increases your chances of dying by 10% I believe, so your body still has oxygen in it, this is quickly used up, and you’re not replenishing it, then your cells and organs start to die due to lack of oxygen. At some point (and this is an ever moving point) there will be a stage where our current medical capabilities will not be able to reverse the damage that has been done, and that point we call death. </p>
<p>But that’s what’s important, not the time, usually it’s a matter of minutes, but if you you have a cardiac arrest and fall into a frozen lake, breaking the ice and being surrounded by near freezing water for example, it could be a matter of hours, as the rate at which your cells die in that situation slows dramatically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
