		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The photo is misleading - the apparent size of the atom is not representative of its true size. Normally you see things because you bounce light off of them, so the amount you get bounced is related to the size of the thing. In this case, they are making the atom emit light while the surrounding ones do not. </p>
<p>There are lots of other atoms between the camera and the one visible - it's just that the one atom is emitting visible light.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm guessing you're talking about <a href="https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/02/singleatomhead-800x800.jpg" target="_blank">this picture</a>, which recently got some publicity when it won a science photo contest. I cross referenced the person who won the award on Google scholar and found <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms11218" target="_blank">this paper</a> describing a recent similar setup to isolate a single ion to probe single-qubit dynamics. The &quot;Experimental implementation&quot; section describes the details of the setup, but the summary is that lasers are used to create a spatial potential well which traps laser-cooled ions in place while electrodes are used to further adjust the field, transporting the ion in the trap. The dot visible in that picture is fluorescence from an atomic transition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>this article gives a good outline of how it's done.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>They would only take a picture of a single individual molecule  and they would get it by tracing the molecule with a smaller molecule(Carbon monoxide) and then rendering it as a picture.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a straight line from the atom to the camera's sensor, there would be:</p>
<ol>
<li>The atom</li>
<li>Mostly vacuum, to reduce the chance of interference, or some gas that won't obstruct whatever is used to image the atom (photons in photos, electrons in a SEM, other stuff in a LHC, etc.)</li>
<li>Some kind of lens, maybe more than one. Maybe a piece of glass or similar in the port of a vacuum chamber.</li>
<li>More of the same as in step 2</li>
<li>The camera sensor</li>
</ol>
<p>Across that vacuum/gas, there would also be the probability wave of whatever you're using (photons, electrons, etc), traveling from the atom to the sensor. There might also be some external fields (magnetic, electric) applied to modify the path of travel and act as a lens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
