		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its kind of a reddit joke that every month or two an article goes up on one of the big subreddits with details on a new battery design that will change everything or a cancer cure that will save millions of lives. Then you read the comments and for one reason or another there is usually good cause to doubt the original article. </p>
<p>So my question is: Can you give any tips to help readers readers sort out the clickbait?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like a big issue in science journalism is overhyping, making every incremental advancement of an established research program seem like a world-shaking Einstein-in-the-patent-office discovery. How should journalists under the pressures of the online advertisement economy properly put their writing in context?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today. What an interesting job!</p>
<p>Why do you think so few publications bother to employ face checkers? Can you share with us some examples of the least factual articles you've had to check and how you go about recommending fixes?</p>
<p>Thank you again!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off, I didn’t even know professional fact-checker was a thing but I love that it is and it sounds like something I’d love doing. </p>
<p>So my first question is, how did you or how does one get into being a pro fact-checker? Additionally, what does being a science editor entail? Like what would a quick day-to-day schedule be like?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
