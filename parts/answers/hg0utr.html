		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The food you eat. Sugars, fats, carbohydrates, they are pretty much just variations of long carbon/hydrogen based molecules.</p>
<p>Inside your body you react them (basically set them in fire without the flame) and they break down into CO2, water, and heat/energy. That heat/energy keeps you alive and moving, the water keeps you alive (and you eventually pee or sweat it out, and the CO2 you breath out.</p>
<p>There are a lot of mini steps along the way but thats the gist of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not that breathing directly turns oxygen into CO2, that process happens all around your body. </p>
<p>Each cell takes nutrients and other things which you have eaten and converts them into energy. These nutrients are often organic molecules which are chains of carbon with some other atoms mixed in. The cell takes those carbon atoms and bonds them with oxygen to release the other more useful atoms like phosphorus, magnesium, iron, etc. It just so happens that one of the most stable bonds is one oxygen and 2 carbons. Then the red blood cells take that waste to the lungs where it is expelled.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Breathing is you metabolizing (breaking down) glucose for energy. Oxygen is needed for the reaction so you breathe in. That oxygen travels in your blood to the working organ/muscle and the cells use it to rip apart glucose (C6H12O6). Once that happens youâ€™re left with CO2, H2O and energy.</p>
<p>The carbon comes from Glucose</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It comes from the food you eat. The parts of food that we can turn into energy are mostly made of hydrogen and carbon, which are combined with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water. Your body uses the extra energy from those chemical reactions to stay alive, and all the water and CO2 you produce is either exhaled or urinated</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Breathing itself doesn't change oxygen into CO2, it exchanges oxygen for CO2. Your red blood cells arrive at your lungs loaded with CO2. They offload the CO2 into the alveoli of your lungs. This makes room for the oxygen in the air you have inhaled to climb aboard the red blood cells. The oxygen is then transported all around the body to the cells, which use oxygen for fuel. Oxygen hops off the red blood cells, and CO2 hops in in its place. Then back to the lungs to start again. </p>
<p>Other comments have explained how the cells produce CO2.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
