		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the cold, our body dilates blood vessels in your nose to help warm and humidify the air before it reaches the sensitive tissues of your lungs.  The result of the increased blood flow is a runny nose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are hot and wet on the inside. The air you exhale has a lot of water in it. Normally, that water stays evaporated.</p>
<p>When it's cold outside, the water in the air you exhale starts to condense back down into liquid. This is why you can see &quot;steam&quot; when you exhale in the cold.</p>
<p>Your nose holes are a bit less hot than the inside of your body because they are close to the outside air. If it's cold enough outside, your nose holes can cool down enough to let that exhaled water condense inside the nose rather. This makes your nose have water in it, which eventually runs out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
