		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure how ELI5 friendly this will be, but there's a difference between the technical truth and the practical application.</p>
<p>Yes, <em>technically</em> the probability distribution of any quantum system extends through all of space, often with nonzero value.</p>
<p>However, what you find is that the probability is usually only meaningfully large in a small region of space, like near the atom in your example, and falls off exponentially outside of that region.</p>
<p>What does that mean? &quot;Exponential&quot; is one of those terms that people and the media love to use to just mean  &quot;a lot&quot;, when its really more specific than that. An exponential function falls off in such a way that it decreases by half after a certain scale (this is where the term &quot;half-life&quot; for radioactive atoms comes from).</p>
<p>Coming back to your example, lets say that the typical scale is the size of the atom itself. 2 atomic radii away, and it would be half as likely to measure the electron there. Go another atomic radius away, and now its 1/4 as likely. If you're 5 atoms away, or 10 atomic radii (because a radius is half a diameter) then the probibility of finding your electron there is 1/2^10 or around 0.01%. That's only 10 atoms away, around 1 nanometer. </p>
<p>I think you can see where this is going. Pull out your calculator, enter a &quot;1&quot;, and then tell it to divide by 2 and just hit enter a bunch of times. You can only do this less than 100 times for most calculators before you get a decimal so small that the calculator can't store it and just rounds down to zero. </p>
<p>In our example, that would mean you were only 50 atoms away before the probability was too small for a calculator to even represent. That's around the thickness of a single transistor in the most cutting edge computer processors.</p>
<p>It only gets worse from there. By the time you're any macroscopic distance away the probability of finding an electron from an atom across the room is for all intents and purposes negligible, even if it might be <em>technically</em> nonzero.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In successful modern Quantum Field Theory (QFT), the word/concept &quot;particle&quot; has been redefined to refer to energy excitations in non-physical fully-space-occupying fundamental fields.  There's a lot to unpack in the meanings of those words.</p>
<p>In that sense, you're not representing the &quot;whereabouts&quot; of a classical &quot;particle&quot; like a tiny &quot;speck&quot; of matter, but rather representing the non-physical field.  For an electron, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermionic_field" target="_blank">Fermionic field</a></p>
<p>In the math of QFT, it's not possible to reduce the math to include only a description of an electron -- the math description <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_spinor#Orthogonality" target="_blank">is linked to</a> the math description of the anti-particle.</p>
<p>And it turns out that's the key point.</p>
<p>QFT textbooks show mathematically that the &quot;electron&quot; part of the math description does indeed have non-zero values that <em>would appear at first blush</em> to violate laws of causality and would appear to allow faster-than-light transport across the universe...</p>
<p>...BUT when the <em>entire</em> solution of the fundamental field (including the anti-particle description) is considered, it turns out that ALL faster-than-light transport and information-transfer have an exactly ZERO probability.  After all....</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically yes, to everything you said. But those non-zero probabilities are so close to zero that it doesn't affect anything.</p>
<p>It might be helpful to consider those &quot;extremely low chances of being halfway across the universe&quot; as &quot;<em>being</em> halfway across the universe, for extremely short time intervals&quot;.</p>
<p>So like, if one electron in one molecule is somewhere in the Crab Nebula for 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 seconds every 100000000000000000000000 years... so what?</p>
<p>Hell, even if your entire desk were to teleport out to the Kuiper belt all together at once for 0.000000000000000000000000000000001 seconds, the effect would be...nothing. It would be gone for a million times less than the fastest reaction or process that could be affected by its absence.</p>
<p>We have equations for electron density at radius r from the nucleus of all the different orbitals, so you can calculate the chances of an electron being at any given distance yourself! They drop off FAST, but you're right, never exactly zero at any distance. Science!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
