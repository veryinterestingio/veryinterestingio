		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So almost everyone here sucks at answering your question.</p>
<p>For general populace It generally started with censuses that required more precise population tallies. Nobles would usually have a second name or title attached to their name. China and Rome started super early with censuses but Rome fell. European countries started censuses, and last names, in the 1500s but even Western Europe only wrapped up the practice with the Napoleonic conquest as at least the Netherlands were forced to pick names. From European Colonial powers everywhere else followed suit because Europe conquered everywhere with the posted exceptions.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think anyone really answered your question.  I know that surnames became common in Europe for census purposes, in the 1500s.  There is a good description of this in the book “From Dawn to Decadence”.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another variation is that the last name was usually where a person was from. Like Catherine de Sevilla. Drop the “de” and Sevilla just becomes a last name. Although I do know some who still keep “de” as apart of their last name.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The second name was usually used as a job description, rather than an actual name, but you’d still have differentiate between them, thus first names. Over the time those jobs formed the last names.
I.e.: “John the Smith” became “John Smith”</p>
