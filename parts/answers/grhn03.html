		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In years past, I've heard people talk about &quot;atmospheric scrubbing&quot; in a way similar to the process you describe for removing CO2 from the air, but I've never understood it. Could you give a layman's explanation of how Climeworks' process harvests CO2 from the air, and what happens to the CO2 afterwards? Is this an economical process in terms of cost/benefit?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I have heard that seaweed/kelp is the major plant ridding our environment of carbon. Is it theoretically possible to make an aquaponics style farm based on the cultivation of seaweed?
If so why has it not been tested?
