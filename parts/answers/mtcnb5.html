		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gas giants are weird.</p>
<p>If you tried to land on a gas giant, you'll first encounter an atmosphere, similar to what you would expect on earth. </p>
<p>It would start very very thin and becomes more substantial as you go down.</p>
<p>As you get deeper the pressure would increase to very high levels, the temperature would rise, then the gas would turn into liquid.</p>
<p>Unlike earth, where the transition between the atmosphere and the ground happens at a very defined point, gas giants transition smoothly. So the atmosphere would become thicker, then soupy-er, until it's basically a liquid.</p>
<p>You would be very dead long before this point, but if you somehow continue to dive deeper, you would encounter another smooth transition, from the liquid mantle made of mostly hydrogen to the solid and rocky core. </p>

<p>and like poke my finger through?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not really. The atmosphere doesn't start at a set altitude. Vacuum just become less and less void as you get closer to the planet, and there is no point where the change is abrupt enough that it would feel like poking something.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>[edit]</strong> Many people are asking why we can see gas giants so sharply if their atmospheres doesn't have a clearly defined boundary. This happens because the transition zone from hard vacuum to dense atmosphere, while being several hundred kilometers in height, is very small compared to the overall planet (like a fraction of a % of the radius). The decrease in pressure is also exponential, so only the very lower layers are dense enough to see. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_width_feature/public/thumbnails/image/pia23445.jpg" target="_blank">You can actually see the fuzzyness in some close up photos.</a> <a href="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.h5A_ipnNExM-HRgJxB7k0AHaE7%26pid%3DApi&amp;f=1" target="_blank">The same is true for earth's atmophere.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They have a very large gas atmosphere - if you were to fall through this it would start out a fairly sparse atmosphere similar to earth that you’d fall through like earths, then it would get denser and denser, with pressures increasing as you go deeper into the atmosphere, while also getting hotter and hotter. You’d fairly quickly get to a point where you would be crushed by the gas pressure and/or burned to a crisp.</p>
<p>Eventually the pressures get enough that they force th gasses into a liquid state, albeit a very very hot one, and if you keep going deeper they eventually force them into a solid state.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
