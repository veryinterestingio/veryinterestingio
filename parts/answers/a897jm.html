<p>You'd be adding cost and sacrificing efficiency for no real gain. </p>
<p>Oh yeah and it's one more place for ice to form from where icicles might destroy engines, so that's bad. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You would just end up with either a bird stuck in the grill until it does get sucked though, or the grill would break and end up in the engine. It would be one more failure point for ice related issues, and it would make the maintainers life harder as it would mean having to remove the grill before doing an engine crawl after flights.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The MiG 29 Fulcrum has these doors on the jet inlets that close during taxi and takeoff. They open up when the aircraft leaves the ground. This is possible because there are inlets on the top of the wing where the jet cowling meets up with the wing, to allow air to feed the actual jet and thus generate thrust. The purpose of this system is that many Russian combat aircraft are designed to operate from improvised airfields, roads, fields, etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You need a really strong grill to withstand a hit from a 15 pound goose at a couple hundred miles per hour. A strong grill is a heavy grill which will also restrict airflow and hurt engine efficiency which will cost millions of pounds of fuel per year. If the bird breaks the grill and sends metal into the engine then you've made things worse.</p>
<p>Planes are designed to be as light as possible, it's really hard to give a plane enough armor to matter if you want it to still have good performance.</p>
<p>A grill would always hurt performance but only maybe help with a bird strike but occasionally also make it wayyy worse.</p>
<p>We've gotten good enough at avoiding birds with airliners that the math doesn't indicate that a grill would add more value than it takes away</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
