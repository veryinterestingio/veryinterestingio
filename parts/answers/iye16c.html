So people who got standing desks at work should also not stand all day. The key is that the body was meant to move, not be in any one position for long periods of time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotal but here is my take.</p>
<p>I've worked from home for about 6 years. I get up every hour or so and stretch/take a walk.</p>
<p>I'm 28 now and I started feeling like absolute SHIT because I've used a $60 dollar office chair for the last 6 years and it caught up with me.</p>
<p>recently bought a refurbished steel case chair for about $500 and after 2 weeks of sitting on it, I feel brand fucking new.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Buy a good chair if you sit all day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Prolonged sitting is associated with all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality risk - and u can't make up for it by exercising later.  Try to break up sitting time as much as possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
