		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello Professor, thanks for doing this. </p>
<p>I'm old enough to remember the internet before algorithms started determining everything and I lament the loss of that spontaneity. </p>
<p>For a brief time, there used to be a sense of adventure in surfing the net, and a genuine chance of stumbling across completely random things that you didn't realize you were interested in until you found them. </p>
<p>Nowadays I feel more like a prisoner being dragged from targeted ad to targeted ad. Do you foresee any future where algorithms become advanced enough to recapture some of that early spontaneity? What do you think about the possibility of people being able to customize their level of exposure to algorithms? A pipe dream? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the example of self-driving cars, even with accidents, we can start to prevent these in the future by improving the underlying algorithms. At some point, if self-driving cars take off, then we're giving more control to algorithms to run a big aspect of our lives. However, it is quite likely that the total number of accidents gets reduced compared to having human-only drivers. How do we then approach this ethical dilemma, giving up control to a &quot;black box&quot; (black box for most people who don't know what's gone into it), and potentially hurting individuals in exchange for improving the lives of people in general? I would naively argue it's worth convincing society that this is okay because it will save lives, but really is it?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello Professor Hosangar. I have some questions regarding the safety of General AI.</p>
<p>First off, what are your thoughts about the future of General AI? Are you generally skeptical of the demise of humanity like Steven Pinker? Or are you quite concerned for the human race like Elon Musk or Sam Harris? </p>
<p>If youâ€™re concerned for the human race, what would be your biggest concern? And how could that concern escalate and become a reality? </p>
<p>Would love to hear your response!
Thanks for your time!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
