		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just a warning for OP: like most questions about the interpretation of quantum mechanics, this thread is currently standing at about an even mix of informative and useful info, unhelpful pop-science analogies, and outright wrong answers.  I don't teach this branch of physics so I don't have the expertise to fix the situation, but I know it well enough to say &quot;here there be dragons.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.&quot; -- Richard Feynman</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ll try to make this ELI5ish:</p>
<p>If I ask you now where the ISS is, can you tell me exactly without checking? Probably not.</p>
<p>You can however estimate how far from earth it is most likely based on some simple physics calculations and averages. Same thing for how fast it is going. Given that we know a probable speed and location, we can calculate a pretty good approximation of angular momentum (rotation speed of sorts).</p>
<p>This is what we do for electrons. The difference is that while the ISS is definitely somewhere at space right now, electrons don’t really have a definite location or momentum before we observe them. So it’s kind of hard to say they are moving if they didn’t have a specific location to begin with. So for imagination sake, it is useful to think of them as spinning around the orbit, but in our current understanding, what is spinning is their “probability current”: the “map” that tells us how likely they are to be at a given point in space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An electron in an orbital is a standing wave in the electric field the way a note on a guitar string is a standing wave when it’s plucked. </p>
<p>Asking “where the electron is” is like asking where the energy is when you hold onto a guitar pick and pluck a guitar string. Sure, it’s all in the momentum of the pick at first. Then it’s all deposited into the string getting stretched. But then when the string vibrates, it’s hard to say where it is at any given moment. </p>
<p>The string vibrates really fast so the energy could be anywhere around that blurry standing wave in the string. You could slam your finger down to grab the string and there’s some probability that you’d hit it. If you did, well then the energy <em>was</em> there. But it isn’t anymore since you’ve now muted the note. </p>
<p>So while it’s ringing out a note, it’s distributed throughout the string as a wave. Electrons are similar in orbitals but mathematically, they’re even faster and harder to pin down than a guitar string—so hard that it would be literally impossible to say for sure where it is at any given time. And if that’s the case, does it even make sense to say it’s at any given location? The math actually definitively tells us “no”. So we don’t talk in those terms. We talk about waves. Because it really isn’t “matter” like a guitar string or an electron anymore. It’s a standing wave in the electric field.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electrons don't exist in one location until they interact with something. The location they appear at when they do interact is random, with a probablility described by an equation similar to a standing wave (like a plucked guitar string, but in three dimensions instead of one).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simplest way I imagine it, electrons buzz around around the nucleus, without a specific path or orbit.</p>
<p>We also don't exactly know where they are, but we can use math to know in what area they most likely are. Visually, this area would look like a &quot;cloud&quot; around the nucleus.</p>
