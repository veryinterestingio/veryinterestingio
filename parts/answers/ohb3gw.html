		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When extinguishing a regular fire, water does two things: It cools down the burning substance and it smothers it, depriving it of oxygen. Both of these things work well because the water forms a thin layer on the surface of the burning object / substance.</p>
<p>But when you throw water on burning grease or oil, something else happens. Since oil/grease is hydrophobic and less dense than water, the water will pass through the oil and sink to the bottom. You then have the water trapped by a layer of burning oil that is hotter than the boiling point of water. The water is rapidly brought to boil and when that happens it expands to well above 1000 times its volume as it turns into a gas.</p>
<p>This rapid expansion quickly pushes the oil away, breaking it up into tiny droplets. In the form of droplets, the oil has far more surface area than what it had before, giving it much better access to the oxygen in the air and therefore speeding up the rate of combustion.</p>
<p>So instead of a contained volume of burning liquid with limited surface area exposed to the air, you suddenly have a cloud of burning droplets, which are burning much more intensely than before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main question has a good answer already. There is another type of fire where water can make things worse: Metal fires. They can be really hot, and in some cases there is enough energy to split water into oxygen and hydrogen. The oxygen can then react with the metal. Splashing water onto such a fire is giving it a concentrated oxygen source, making things worse. You are also producing hydrogen gas which can react with more oxygen. In extreme cases you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqMN3y8k9So" target="_blank">start a fire</a> just by putting the metal into contact with water (e.g. elementary potassium as in the video) - but that's not something you will encounter randomly.</p>
<p>In both cases - oil-like substances and metals - it's better to avoid water. For fire of electrical systems... yeah, I guess that's self-explanatory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simple explanation?</p>
<p>Take gasoline and put it in a spray bottle.</p>
<p>Set the nozzle to shoot a jet and not mist into a flame.</p>
<p>Now set the nozzle to mist and do the same thing and see the difference.</p>
<p>Now, you take a hot burning pool of oil and put droplets of water that will sink into it and then turn to steam which expands rapidly.</p>
<p>You now have that spray bottle mist puff times those thousands of droplets of water blowing up out of the oil.</p>
<p><em>disclaimer</em> Don't actually do this and burn down your house/yard then blame me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a regular fire, you have something carbon based that became ignited and continued going due to the presence of more oxygen. Putting it out with water, dampens the carbon based material while also smothering the fire to the point of being unable to continue getting oxygen, thus cutting off it's two main sources of &quot;sustenance&quot;.</p>
<p>A grease fire is the same, but the grease itself cant be dampened by water (because it literally repels water) and cant be smothered by it because it just rises above it.</p>
<p>If you cant put it out with one or noth ways, itll just continue to burn until all the oil is spent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oil floats on water. Oil also heats way past the boiling temperature of water before burning/boiling. When you put water on an oil fire it will sink and almost immediately boil spraying the burning oil everywhere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
