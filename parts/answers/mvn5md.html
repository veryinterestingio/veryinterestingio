		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pfizer's official response was that they have only tested 21 days between doses and that is what is approved. That makes it seem foolish to delay the second dose but they are saying what they need to legally. </p>
<p>Dr. Supriya Sharma,  chief medical adviser for Health Canada, the country’s regulator, told  the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in a time of limited supply they  are starting to have greater comfort with the idea of waiting for the  second dose after seeing real world data versus the strict  interpretation of the clinical trials. </p>
<p>“In  the real world we’re starting to see evidence from other countries that  have delayed that second dose ‘Oh, it looks like they still have a  really good effectiveness.’ We have lab studies that show it’s unlikely  that immune response will drop off,” Sharma said. </p>

<p>The last figures I saw indicated a first dose effectiveness at stopping covid infection of around 75%, but effectiveness at stopping serious effects such as hospitalisation as almost 100%.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I want to clarify that a big goal of that second shot is to activate what is called the secondary immune response. I'm sure its not the only reason why (and clearly three are vaccines that were 1 and done) but that second exposure triggers the adaptive immune response that was set up with the first shot to do its thing. It's a bit like a trial run of what happens if you run into corona irl. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The research appears to suggest you may have slightly lower protection after the first month or so, until the second dose.  The difference is about between 92% and 95% - minimal.</p>
<p>If every country did this, only offered the first dose, they would probably reach herd immunity much quicker, now that we know how efficacious the first dose is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
