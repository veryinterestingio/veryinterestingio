		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your skin has a few different layers. The top layer is the epidermis, which is composed of both dead cells (the very top part) and living cells that constantly divide and replace the ones on top. The layer under that is the dermis, and it contains living cells but is mostly a kind of web of structural proteins--mainly collagen.
See here for a simple illustration: <a href="https://www.skininstitute.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/shutterstock_layers-of-skin_blog-post.jpg" target="_blank">https://www.skininstitute.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/shutterstock_layers-of-skin_blog-post.jpg</a></p>
<p>If you have an injury to your epidermis, you don't form a scar because the living cells at the bottom of the epidermis reproduce and replace the lost cells quite easily.</p>
<p>Scars are what happens when you get damage to the underlying connective tissue. Your bodies response to that is (simplified) to recruit a bunch of collagen producing cells to the area after the immune cells have finished cleaning up any debris and/or pathogens. These cells produce tons of collagen, but produce it in a stiffer, more regular pattern partially because this helps to pull the two sides of the wound closer together.</p>
<p>Although u/TheGentlemanDM is correct that initially you get a big growth of blood vessels into the damaged area to supply all the &quot;repair/cleanup&quot; cells with nutrients and provide them with a way to get to the area, after a couple weeks those new vessels die off and you're left with a big area that's mostly collagen. </p>
<p>For a metaphor, imagine you have a house and a tree falls and crushes part of the roof and one room. It's not a big problem to just  rebuild those walls/windows/roof, because the rest of the house is still standing fine. A scar is like if the whole house gets destroyed by a tornado, and after cleaning up all the debris, they decide to just pave it over with concrete because it's cheaper/easier than rebuilding the whole thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Scars form at any injury site that takes more than three or four weeks to heal. The body produces collagen fibres in a criss-cross pattern. The normal shedding process of skin doesn't affect scars because it only involves the migration of the epithelial cells from the base of the epithelium to the surface.&quot; Quoted from BBC Science Focus Magazine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a nutshell: scars don't have many cells so they aren't replaced easily. There is a much greater density of connecting molecules instead of cells, which isn't replaced and causes the white look. </p>
<p>More in depth: the white look of scars is due to the dense fibrous connective tissue used to bridge the original wound. This tissue has a much lower density of actual cells and so looks more white, like cartilage. The progeny of nearby skin stem cells have to spread through this fibrous, dense area over time and replace it instead of simply rising up to the surface of the skin like normal (called remodelling). This means scars DO fade over time, which is why you don't see every tiny little scratch you've ever had on your body.  It is just the smaller scars from scratches had less volume for the new cells to penetrate through. Not only this, the new cells have to break down the old fibrous tissue in addition to just perfusing though it. This process can take so long for large scars that they will never completely fade before you die.</p>
<p>Scars are very vascularized while they are forming so that the cells making the fibrous tissue can have plenty of nutrients, which is why new scars look very pink and turn white when poked (they're blood filled). However, this vasularization is quickly replaced by whiter fibrous tissue over the course of roughly a month (or more for large injuries). So the vascularization isn't why scars don't fade.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
