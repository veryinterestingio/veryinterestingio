<p>Grab a ball or an orange. Your fingers are splayed around it to spread your grip around its surface.</p>
<p>Now, pretend you're holding onto a broomstick, or a chin up bar, the handle of a knife, or something of that shape. Notice that your fingers all now line up nicely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One theory is that different finger length and size enables us to make a fist.</p>
<p>Hold your hand in front of you, palm facing you. Then bend your fingers over, towards you. Now the ends are aligned. When you make a fist, your fingers tuck cleanly into the palm. If our fingers were the same length when outstretched, they wouldn't fit so precisely into the palm and some minor (mid-finger) knuckles would stick out, raising the likeliness of injury when punching.</p>
<p>Of course, this is just a theory, but it sounds much more plausible to me than the grasping theory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ratio of a man's ring finger to his pointer finger is proportional to the amount of testosterone received in the womb.  The longer the ring to the pointer, the more test.</p>
<p>A researcher was able to calculate ratios and use this information to accurately predict who would win in a short foot race between healthy males of similar age.</p>
<p>Edit: I find it funny all of the short ring fingered folks coming out defending themselves. :P</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
