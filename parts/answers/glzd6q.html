		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello, I might not be awake when the AMA starts so I'm posting my comment now.</p>
<p>Nice to meet you! I'm a geologist from the Philippines. I'm currently studying igneous petrology and geochemistry, but I'm deeply interested in volcanoes as well. I've been to some famous volcanoes in the Philippines which you might have heard of: Pinatubo, Mayon and Taal.</p>
<p>The eruption of Mt. St. Helens in 1980 paved the way for the deposition of classic debris avalanche deposits (DADs) as well as carving up a well-developed amphitheater along the flanks of Mt. St. Helens. Did the same eruption also deposit ignimbrite? Considering the volume of displaced material along with pyroclastic density currents, were you also able to see different layers depicting an ignimbrite deposit (e.g. thinly bedded layer, surge, massive base)?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
