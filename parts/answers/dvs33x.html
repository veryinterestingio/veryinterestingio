		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes you are right you can try and avoid it. </p>
<p>The issue with forts and castles is that it's a hideout for men. You could ignore it but you then have a group of highly armed and trained men you can nip out, attack your supply chains and retreat back into the safety of the fort. </p>
<p>Forts are often built in higher places giving a larger radius of fire meaning you would have to go a very long way around to avoid them. This would often be through terrain so would slow troops down and maybe impossible for carts to traverse. Rivers with bridges or fords were a commonplace to build forts near as defending troops can snipe, enemies, trying to use the crossing. </p>
<p>If you went past the fort you'd have real problems supplying or even having your frontline troops retreating. Runners were needed for communication so messages could be hindered or intercepted.</p>
<p>Finally, it's hard to prove to the populace that you're their new ruler if they're old ruler is still down the road looting your supply convoys.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a pretty famous fort, the <a href="https://img1.10bestmedia.com/Images/Photos/81894/el-morro-castillo-de-san-felipe-del-morro_54_990x660_201406011431.jpg" target="_blank">Castle San Filipe del Morro</a> in San Juan Puerto Rico. </p>
<p>The fort wasn't built to protect the town from the native Puerto Ricans, it was built to control access to San Juan's large natural harbor.  It's built into one bank of the harbor access, and had plenty space for cannon to sink a ship attempting to access the harbor.  The fort doesn't stop unauthorized ships from sailing further away from Puerto Rico, but harbors are really important for trade (then and now) so the fort protected that.  </p>
<p>Like San Juan's Castle del Morro, many other forts were built to control access to something important to travel (like a mountain pass or a point where a river might be easy to cross or a good well in dry country), the goal isn't to prevent all movement, it's to prevent access to a very important point (the mountains or rest of the river or your thirst can greatly reduce the other movement).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They donâ€™t just stay inside the fort.  They do patrols, security, protect supply lines. They may even had camps outside the walls. </p>
<p>You could be only looking at 1/4 the remaining fort. </p>
<p>A small fort could easily protect 20 miles or so of land.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of a fort as a base of operations. Defense of an area relies on being supplied with weapons, food, and a secure area to hold a defensive position in the event of appearance of a greater threat. Forts can be set up to have cannon firing positions on important water pathways. Even an early simple wooden palisade structure can provide protection and a defensive position. They were not designed to be inpenetrable, or to prevent the movement of standing armies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Forts are generally placed in strategic locations like a harbor entrance, along a navigable river, overlooking a valley, or guarding a city. They would have cannons that let them engage enemies from quite a distance</p>
<p>You could just evade the fort and the soldiers inside, but then they'll just sit back and shell you while you try to take the city. You need to deal with the troops and their cannons before you can secure the area they're guarding</p>
<p>Forts and natural terrain were often used to force troops to approach from a certain area. If I've got tons of forts around the harbor then you can't land troops in there, and the rocky cliffs mean you can't land nearby so you'll have to land a ways down and then funnel across a narrow strip of land to get to the forts. Oh, and the forts already have their cannons dialed in to hit that little strip of land so have fun with that!</p>
<p>Most early cities were set up in defensible spots so that the fort could cover the only approaches. You can't go around the blockhouse if the other side is a mountain or fast river</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
