<blockquote>
<p>Moles are basically a tumor. The unusual cell cluster pushes on the follicle, making it grow hair faster than usual. (...)if your mole grows hair that's a sign it's not cancerous.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m not sure if I can add on to a question, and sorry if this is stupid, but is there a reason why someone wouldn’t remove the hairs? (other than preference of course). </p>
<p>I’ve seen a few people with moles that have an extremely long hair growing from it, like 2-3cm. Just curious after seeing multiple people with this if there’s any medical reason behind leaving it? Is it extra painful to pluck compared to normal? Or more likely just the person’s preference? </p>
<p>I’ve never had hair grow out of a mole  so I really don’t know!</p>
<p>Edit: interesting replies thank you!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
