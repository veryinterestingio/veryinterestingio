<p>When trauma to the brain occurs, several things can happen.</p>
<p>The direct injury to the brain is called a <em>coup</em> injury. This is damage to the brain at the point of impact (the trauma to the head causes the brain to impact the skull).</p>
<p>You can also get a <em>contrecoup</em> injury - this is when the opposite side of the brain then bounces against the back of the skull.</p>
<p>Either of these injuries can damage brain tissue. This can be in the form of swelling of the tissue or of something called &quot;diffuse axonal injury&quot; - micro-shearing of nerve cells.</p>
<p>In any event , the injury to the central nervous system more or less &quot;overloads&quot; the system and higher level functions - like consciousness - shut down.</p>
<p>There's more to it than this, but this suffices as a basic explanation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First I suggest reading the response by u/deecaf, it explains the impact related knockout. </p>
<p>There are also nerve-related effects depending on the location of the strike. Impact stimulation of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigeminal_nerve" target="_blank">trigeminal nerve</a> (see link for location in the face) can cause a drop in heart rate and changes in blood vessel constriction that cause fainting—and when you faint after getting punched, that’s a knockout. </p>
<p>This second effect is related to how the rear naked choke or triangle choke of MMA can cause a fighter to “go to sleep”. The target there is the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagus_nerve" target="_blank">vagus nerve</a> and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotid_sinus" target="_blank">carotid sinus</a> in the neck.  The reflex effect of dropping the heart rate is the same, and combined with constriction of the neck — where blood is trying to get in and out of the head — is what causes the knockout.</p>
<p>Edit: Forgot to mention that disruption of the inner ear from impact is another cause of knockout.</p>
<p>Edit: Fixed u/deecaf’s user name. It’s a new decade and autocorrect still manages to mess me up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
