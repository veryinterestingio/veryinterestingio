		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People who score high on measures of introversion tend to have fight-or-flight systems that are more finely tuned toward social interactions. Cortisol and adrenaline, the body’s “GET READY TO FREAK OUT!” chemical messengers, trigger hugely resource-intense processes in the body, using more glucose and oxygen and leaving cellular waste (lactic acid/CO2 and their friends) in their wake. Your body works hard to maintain homeostasis, or the state of being chemically balanced, so when there’s too much cellular waste, your brain pumps out new messages that make you feel physically tired and want to rest. This gives your systems time to clean out those leftovers and get back to neutral. </p>
<p>ETA tl;dr: Things that make you feel stress (which include social interactions for introverts) are tiring for your body on a cellular level. That cellular fatigue also translates into whole-body fatigue.</p>
<p>ETA again: Thanks to everyone who has pointed out that introversion =/= social anxiety. True and important. The two are related, but not equivalent. The sympathetic nervous system response (adrenaline &amp; its buddies) is just one part of what’s happening for introverts in social settings—there’s also typically heightened sensory sensitivity; introverts usually score higher on measures of empathy; etc. These processes are energy-intensive on cellular levels, too. </p>
<p>For everyone asking about the correlation for extroverts: It’s a separate system. Evolution has programmed us humans to get dopamine snacks for positive social interactions. Extroverts are apparently more finely-tuned to those dopamine rewards.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The anxiety explanation definitely makes sense, you will expend much more energy if you are anxious and activate your fight/flight.</p>
<p>In addition there has been some interesting research into the ARAS (Ascending Reticular Activating System), a pathway of your brain that is stimulatd by social interaction. It shows that introverted people's ARAS is stimulated at rest, whereas Extraverted people's is not. So extraverted people seek out social interaction. </p>
<p>The brain takes a huge amount of energy to run.</p>
<p>It could be that social interaction just takes a bigger toll on introverted people because they have to deal with the increased demands of the brain being over stimulated. Whereas extrverted people dont.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Right so we’re not 100% sure but a few years back there was research indicating a specific amino acid in the brain that was correlated with focused attention. Basically doing anything you don’t do by default such as focusing on a math problem, talking to people as an introvert, etc. As that amino acid depletes the ability to forcefully do something against your default state declined. It’s a correlation that they think is causative, but i dont recall if it ever panned out.</p>
<p>A simpler explanation is you have a default state and anything to change that takes energy. Anything that takes energy can tire you out. Its like standing still is fine but moving and running takes energy. Same. Sitting there not talking to someone is fine, but a long convo as an introvert is like running. You have to expend energy to go from doing nothing to doing something and the further from your default state you go the more energy it takes. So it makes sense it tired you out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot that goes into a social interaction - a lot verbally on the phone but even more in person (with facial expressions, micro-expressions, body language etc)</p>
<p>Introverts tend to be, by definition, more anxious with either prolonged, unfamiliar, or group social interactions. They seek smaller groups and/or shorter interactions, they prefer more time alone or with closer friends, and seek more control over interactions and lengths e.g. being suddenly thrust into a group setting you cannot walk away from would be horrible.</p>
<p>Imagine showing up to a job interview only to be told you would be interviewing as a group for 3 hours, for instance.</p>
<p>Thus, it will exert more energy and create more anxiety. I presume this anxiety and energy is lessened or increased based on the aforementioned factors I.e. knowing such social contact (phone call, meeting, whatever) will happen in advance, length of time (2 minute call vs 60 minutes) and familiarity with the person (e.g a parent calling vs a stranger)</p>
<p>An introvert, and / or anxious person, will spend more time and energy through analysing the interaction in real time. </p>
<p>Where an extrovert may feel comfortable and not &quot;care&quot; so much about their perception and image, often an introvert is keenly aware of their tone, their word choices, how they are perceived etc, all in real time.</p>
<p>This can get very taxing. Think - how often do you forget people's names when first meeting?! Extroverts too! Before you are comfortable with someone, you are often thinking (consciously or not): &quot;are we going to shake hands? What greeting to use? Am I looking natural? Am I smiling? Okay, maintain eye contact. Not too much though! Okay what response now?&quot;</p>
<p>Obviously that's heightened for an introvert. Anxiety produces cortisol, stress hormone, and adrenaline. This is taxing after the interaction and adrenaline fades. Think the &quot;fight or flight&quot; response.</p>
<p>It can be exhausting to try to a) listen intently to someone b) think about your responses c) monitor your tone d) think &quot;do I sound natural or weird? Am I sounding confident?&quot; e) have appropriate responses e.g. &quot;ok nod your head..  not too long! Smile.. but not too much,don't be creepy... eye contact.. but don't stare! Laugh.. make &quot;mmhmm&quot;, &quot;uh huh&quot;, &quot;yeah&quot; noises&quot; f) and so on</p>
<p>Different on phone vs in person, but there are many micro interactions we do instead of just talking in words.</p>
<p>Anyway, I could go on, but generally extroverts are more comfortable with social interactions and tend to feel buzzed or happy after, whereas introverts can tend to feel more drained. Often more hyper-aware of everything which then uses energy but they ALSO have to be aware not to miss real-time cues and sentiments as they are using this meta-cognition. </p>
<p>In sum, one is not better than the other. Introverts and extroverts both have strengths and weaknesses. People should learn to find a balance and also empathise with people. Everyone is different and has their own struggles and strengths.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
