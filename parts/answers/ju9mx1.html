		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most owners (not all, sadly) notice when something is different. The animal limps, stops eating, pees too much, acts weird.</p>
<p>The vet examines the animal carefully and notes what isn’t right. Heart rate and sounds, temperature, how the body feels under their hands, etc.</p>
<p>Then testing is recommended based on the vet’s education, experience, and the clues the vet has from the history and examination. Bloodwork, imaging like x-rays, and more specialized stuff.</p>
<p>Animals don’t necessarily talk to vets, but owners do, and the body speaks for itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing some people might not realize, but should be aware of, is that some pets will try to hide all pain to the point of making a show of how healthy/strong they are - even if feeling awful.  </p>
<p>I had a llama gallop over to me one morning for his food.  He normally would walk over calmly, but there he was bucking and being silly.  The next day he couldn’t even stand up.  We had the vet come.  Poor guy had pneumonia and died within hours.  </p>
<p>Some animals don’t want to look weak or vulnerable because that makes them a target for prey or lowers them in the pecking order.  Most cats and dogs will show pain but not all will.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>To add to the above points (we rely a lot on physical exam findings, we run tests, we try to &quot;tune in&quot; to our patients) but we probably don't even know about certain conditions in pets because they can't vocalise. I've never seen a dog with a migraine - because how the hell would you know? What about restless leg syndrome- it could explain those kelpie that never stop running. These are diagnoses that won't be apparent on physical examination and for which there is no testing. </p>
<p>Overall however, we just have to be more thorough with a physical, run tests where findings are equivocal, and always have a back up plan if plan a fails :) thankfully for us, besides being super cute, pets are tough and tend to have amazing attitudes when it comes to coping with illness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With my farm vet it's a team effort and she's one helluva leader. She's done bloodwork on all my animals to establish baselines and what is their normal in case she needs that info for diagnostic purposes in the future. When I call or text her with an issue she always asks questions to help determine if the situation is emergent or can wait till her appointments are over. When she treats an animal, she leaves specific instructions for ongoing care and has me journal everything- time meds are administered, recovery progress, temperature, how well the animal is eating/drinking/pooping, lameness etc. She's usually spot on with her diagnosis but a few times we've caught problems that could have blown up into something big through close observation and communication.</p>
<p>I remember one time I had a horse come in from pasture with the right side of her face paralyzed. I though she may have gotten stung or eaten something poisonous so I called my vet and told her as much. She asked me one question- can she move her ear? The mare couldn't. My vet knew immediately we were likely looking at something neurological and very serious. She booked it over immediately, administered meds and got me a referral to a clinic with an equine neurologist (luckily I live close to one of the top equine clinics in country). She suspected temporohyoid osteoarthropathy(sp?). While she wasn't correct she was darn close, somehow this mare had fractured her temporohyoid bone with no outside sign of trauma and had a massive hematoma in her guttural pouch that was pressing against the cranial nerve. The damage was revealed through x-rays, ultrasound and scope. She knew just with one question we were most likely dealing with a life threatening problem. Mare made a full recovery with no lasting effects except a lingering derp lip. Those specialists we saw especially the equine neurologist I dunno how to explain their skills except maybe they are wizards? It was wild watching them work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a veterinarian of ten years. Observant owners will give me (a very likely) answer based off their history within the first few minutes of most consultations. </p>
<p>From there it's a physical exam to pinpoint an issue or narrow down the tests I need to perform, and gaining evidence to support my initial gut feeling, or discover something new.</p>
<p>Think of it as a series of flow diagrams that you would follow. If this clinical sign (symptom) is present, then I check x, y and z next either confirm or rule out a diagnosis.</p>
<p>Edit: after you see thousands of animals in your career you get a very spooky gut feeling about little changes in appearance and behaviour.</p>
<p>Some dogs just have a &quot;cancer&quot; look about them for example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
