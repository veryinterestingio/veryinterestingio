		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think in this case the “asymptomatic” part might need to be defined as well. A recent Swedish study found that more or less everyone had symptoms either at the time of a positive COVID test or develop symptoms soon afterwards (though note that “displaying symptoms” and “feeling sick” isn’t always the same thing).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not really accurate to say people are &quot;carriers&quot; of COVID, implying some kind of long term equilibrium state.  The human immune system will always fight covid and the battle will be won or lost.</p>
<p>The spectrum of symptoms will be determined by a lot of factors.  Some may have had previous exposure to a similar virus.  Some people will just not recognize the symptoms on top of their normal bronchitis, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine what happens when a small number of viruses enter your body. They begin to multiplicate and what used to be 5 are now 1000, not enough to make you sick but enough that you could spread them througj the air to other people around you. If your body is able to contain the virus inside your body before it gets out od hand then you didnt show symptoms but you could habe probably spread it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
