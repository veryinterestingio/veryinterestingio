		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Warm air can hold the moisture indefinitely, but when it collides with a mass of cold air the moisture falls as rain.</p>
<p>Some places do have a near-constant mixture of warm humid air and cold dry air that will produce long, slow rain systems.</p>
<p>Most of the rest of the world will only experience this periodically - you’ll either be under the humid air or under the cold air, not directly under the boundary where the storms are.</p>
<p>These boundaries can persist for days and sweep across entire continents as one air mass overpowers another, but they’ll only be over any particular location for a few hours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pacific Northwest checking in on this...</p>
<p>We (PNW) will during our fall, winter and spring, get cold fronts coming down out of the gulf of Alaska. </p>
<p>These cold fronts will be wide and deep and laden with cold, wet air.</p>
<p>The result when they hit land, and orographic lifting takes effect, is that the rainfall seems to go on for days on end.   </p>
<p>It's not usually a heavy rain.  Typically we get an inconsistent series of rain types that will last for days on end.  The sky is grey and goes from misty to rain to spritzes to sprinkles and showers, sometimes downpour, but mostly just a cold, constant drip.</p>
<p>Natives don't own or use an umbrella.   Likely you will own several types of North Face or similar rain jackets that range from Light weight for warm rain, moderate for fall rain, and a heavier rain coat for winter rain.   </p>
<p>You will intuitively know, and be able to explain, the difference between waterproof and water resistant, and how long you can stay outside in each.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
