<p>But anyway, it seems like you're imagining nucleons as looking something like <a href="https://media.sciencephoto.com/image/c0382742/800wm" target="_blank">this</a>, as three discrete quarks with well-defined positions in space. But nucleons are quantum systems, and you can't think about them in that way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have mentioned, the short answer is that they are not spheres.</p>
<p>However this depends at what energy scales you are trying to probe the nucleon at! At low energies, if you throw an electron at a proton, it will scatter elastically (Rutherford scattering) as if the proton were a point source. </p>
<p>As you move to higher energies, you are able to probe more details of the structure of the nucleon and will eventually see that not only is the nucleon made up of three valence quarks, but that half of the momentum of the nucleon is actually contained in the gluons which hold the nucleon together (as described by QCD). See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_inelastic_scattering?wprov=sfti1" target="_blank">deep inelastic scattering</a> for some details.</p>
<p>What we think of as the picture of a proton (as u/RobusEtCeleritas showed) is incomplete and highly simplified.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Consider a helium atom: It has a nucleus and two electrons. It's spherical. How? Both electrons have a spherically symmetric wave function centered at the nucleus. Thinking of particles as classical objects that fly around or even take up space is not working when quantum mechanics is relevant.</p>
<p>Protons and neutrons are more complicated but the basic idea is the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
