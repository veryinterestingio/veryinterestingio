		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At least part of this likely comes down to how the sound is mastered and mixed; some shows/services just generally master their baseline volume to be louder than others.</p>
<p>Sometimes this is due to thematic vs practical concerns; an action movie is likely to have a sound mix with louder vocal levels than some other shows, because the voices need to be heard over or in contrast to gunfire and explosions without the explosions being too loud, so if an explosion is too loud at volume 30, then the voice of the audio will be mixed to be clearly audible at that same volume level.</p>
<p>Contrast to a highly suspenseful horror or drama where the juxtaposition of people whispering to jump scares or emotional scenes with people loudly yelling or crying, and the volume becomes more dynamic, but at the cost of needing to turn up the volume to hear the whisper-y bits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
