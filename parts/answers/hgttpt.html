		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those seemingly unrelated symptoms are actually all connected by a common biochemical pathway. NSAIDs work by inhibiting an cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX1 + COX2) that convert arachidonic acid into a variety of molecules including prostaglandins, thromboxanes, prostacyclin and more. The functions of these molecules are incredibly diverse and cause a variety of effects but include \~promoting\~ inflammation and pain perception (all the symptoms you listed). Prostaglandin E2 is generally considered one of the main types of eicosanoids involved in that.</p>
<p>But these molecules do so much more! One of the side effects of long-term NSAID use is increased risk for stomach ulcers. That may seem unrelated and even counter-intuitive (why would an anti-inflammatory cause inflammation??). However, prostaglandin E1 plays an important role in maintaining your stomach lining and the production of PGE1 is reduced with COX inhibition.</p>
<p>I think the UpToDate article &quot;NSAIDs: Pharmacology and mechanism of action&quot; really gives a good concise explanation of the medically relevant bits but if you don't have access to UpToDate, this free PMC paper has a lot of good information on eicosanoid signalling.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4606863/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4606863/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4606863/</a></a></p>
<p>All that being said, acetaminophin is NOT a NSAID and supposedly works on a different pathway which is not well understood. But that makes it an important drug for when patients cannot take NSAIDs as it does not have the same side effects.</p>
<p>Edit: fixed some wording</p>
<p>Edit2:<br />
<strong>More information about NSAIDs, acetaminophen (paracetamol) and COX enzymes:</strong></p>
<p>NSAIDs exert their effect by inhibition of COX enzymes which produce a variety of arachidonic acid derivatives that have different roles depending on type and localization. The main physiological effects of NSAIDs are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3081099/" target="_blank">anti-inflammatory</a>, antipyretic (fever reducing), analgesic (pain reducing), <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7034481" target="_blank">anti-platelet aggregation</a> (blood thinning), reduction of <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00004.2008" target="_blank">gastric epithelium protection</a> (stomach ulcers) and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3894486" target="_blank">constriction of afferent arterioles in the kidney</a>. There are two main types of COX enzymes:</p>
<p>COX1 – platelet aggregation via thromboxanes and gastric epithelium protection via PGE2 and prostacyclin (present throughout the body)</p>
<p>COX2 – Inflammatory via PGE2 (as well as pain + fever) (mainly in immune cells + inflamed tissue)</p>
<p>Most NSAIDs are nonspecific COX inhibitors which means they inhibit both COX1 and COX2. These include ibuprofen and naproxen</p>
<p><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2017.00261/full" target="_blank">Aspirin</a> is different from other NSAIDs in that it is an irreversible inhibitor meaning that cells must generate new COX enzymes before being able to produce arachidonic acid derivatives. This becomes especially important in platelets because they require thromboxane to help clot blood AND they are not able to synthesize new proteins. This means entirely new platelets need to be made for blood to clot. These unique properties make aspirin a very useful blood thinner.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Celecoxib#section=MeSH-Pharmacological-Classification" target="_blank">Celecoxib</a> is a newer NSAID that is a selective COX2 inhibitor. It was generated with the hope of creating a NSAID with anti-inflammatory, analgesic and anti-pyretic effects without the negative effects of other NSAIDs. Unfortunately, it seems like COX2 inhibitors increase the risk for certain cardiovascular events which has limited their clinical use.</p>
<p>Acetaminophen (paracetamol) as mentioned before is NOT a NSAID. It is used as an analgesic and antipyretic but does not have anti-inflammatory or blood thinning effects that are seen in NSAIDs. The mechanism has been debated for over 100 years (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/art.20424" target="_blank">literally</a>) but remains elusive. <a href="https://cen.acs.org/articles/92/i29/Does-Acetaminophen-Work-Researchers-Still.html" target="_blank">Research</a> suggests that it has a selective COX2 inhibition in the central nervous system while not having an effect peripherally (eg gastric epithelium, inflamed tissue, kidneys). Additional <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2749259/" target="_blank">studies</a> have investigated alternative pathways including cannabinoid receptors, serotonin receptors, NO signaling and more.</p>
<p>I also want to reiterate that none of this is medical advice! Please talk to your physician if you're concerned about your medications and/or adverse effects</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They work by inhibiting an enzyme called COX 2, which is an enzyme that makes prostaglandins used in inflammation. Side note- they also inhibit COX 1- which is a housekeeping enzyme and is used to make protective mucus in the stomach. This is why you take a PPI when you also are in long term ibuprofen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One way of looking at it is through the lens of systems biology. Under this assumption, the symptoms would not really unrelated and while it works better when one thinks of a genetic condition, the idea general enough. Say disease A, we tend to think that there is this unique point of failure that needs to go wrong in order for disease A to come about. While this might (<em>might</em>) be true in some cases, we tend to think more about complex things going wrong, and these things going wrong tend to be located in a &quot;disease module&quot;. </p>
<p>So, the idea would imply that you have a system for aches, involving proteins and enzymes,  interactions between proteins, etc. Different drugs might affect a specific part of the system, but they all have the effect of reducing pain.</p>
<p>There's this great paper by Barabasi (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2918" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2918" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2918</a></a>) that would most definitely do a better job explaining than I did.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
