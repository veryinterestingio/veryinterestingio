		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I routinely prescribe fentanyl in the emergency department.  The answer to your question is very precise dosing.  A normal dose of fentanyl is 25-100 micrograms, which is an incredibly tiny amount.  At that dose you may feel a bit drowsy but it's very unlikely anything bad will happen.</p>
<p>It's easy to reliably give the right dose when you have drugs that are manufactured to strict standards and tested at multiple steps during production.  When you're mixing up drugs for street distribution, quality control gets pretty loose.  A variation of a few milligrams (a few thousand micrograms) one way or another is no big deal for many drugs, but would be lethal with fentanyl.</p>
<p>Another important factor is that patients receiving IV opioids are generally in a monitored setting so we know if their breathing slows down too much and can give them oxygen or even narcan.  If you're using recreational drugs alone or with a group of similarly intoxicated people, nobody will know you overdosed until too late.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

That kind of precision may not be used when people cut other drugs with fentanyl. A lot of people don’t even know there’s fentanyl in the drug they are taking, so they take too much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So speaking from some experience, an old friend used to stomp his heroin with fentanyl purchased as a &quot;research drug&quot; from China and shipped to a drop house. He was 100% an addict and the reason he was cutting was he was taking his &quot;pure&quot; heroin he received, holding a large percentage back for his own use, and selling the stomped on product as &quot;pure.&quot; </p>
<p>Problem was his supplier had the same ideas and used <strong>carfentanil</strong> to cut it before passing it down to be sold. My friend does his usual and shoots up a hero dose and the rest is in the obituary. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/drk74iJ" target="_blank">Picture</a> reference for how small of an amount of these synthetic opioids is considered a lethal dose.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Because jesus, didn't expect this to blow up.
To clarify, friend in question was my half brother, who unfortunately got me on drugs in the first place. I've personally been clean since 92.  He started off slinging pot for the mexican mafia back in the late 70's and branched off to coke and speed in the 80's. The wake up call (for me) was when he got shot in the head during a bad deal and managed to live. (The bullet skidded off his skull and bounced around in his sinus cavity before exiting by his eye.)</p>
<p>I'd like to say he turned his life around at that point, but he didn't. We fell out after he started using what he was supposed to sell. (Found this out when people showed up at my moms house and held a gun to her during a family dinner.) He pops up every 5-6 years &quot;clean&quot; and we catch-up just for him to disappear again. Last time he popped up around 2013 was when he tried to recruit me into his scheme and basically laid it all out. He was dead within the year.</p>
<p>Edit#2: As mentioned his H was white, he didn't sling black tar or that brown shit from the middle east, his words; &quot;My shits pure, I get it from the Asians.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The dosage of fentanyl is extremely small. It’s measured in micrograms. To give you perspective, there are 1000 micrograms in a milligram. Think of an regular strength Tylenol. It’s usually 200 milligrams of acetametaphine.  The normal dose of fentanyl is like 25-100 micrograms. </p>
<p>The margin of error for such a small amount of medication is incredibly small.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A typical dose of fentanyl in the hospital is 0.000025 g. That is an unfathomably small amount. When actual drug companies are making pills or patches, they have the right equipment, quality control, and \~100% pure fentanyl to start with, to produce doses that are like 0.000025 +- 0.000005 g. </p>
<p>When drug dealers are adding fentanyl to spike their product, there is no way in hell they can measure quantities that accurately, mix them thoroughly enough, or even know the purity of the fentanyl they're adding to begin with. </p>
<p>Like, I worked in a lab with a digital scale that cost like $8,000 and it <em>might</em> have been accurate enough. It weighed to 4 decimal places (+-0.0001 g) so the lightest amount of fent it could weigh would be enough for hundreds of doses, so you'd have to mix them all up together in a big bowl. So you're adding hundreds of desired-doses worth of fentanyl (aka dozens of fatal doses) into a bowl, then stirring or using a kitchen mixer, then scooping it into baggies or pressing into pills and just hoping you've mixed enough that no single baggie / pill has more than 0.00001 g or whatever. It's essentially impossible to mix well enough. Oh and you're guessing at the purity of the fent you're adding to start with. If you assume 100%, then your stuff is weak, because odds are it's not. Guess the starting fent strength too low and now <em>lots</em> of your baggies have lethal doses. </p>
<p>The difference between a fent dose you can barely feel and a dose that kills you is barely visible. People have died from traces left on a scale used to weigh fent before the thing they weighed. Hospitals and drug companies are equipped to handle chemicals with that level of precision, illegal drug labs (even very very good ones) are not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
