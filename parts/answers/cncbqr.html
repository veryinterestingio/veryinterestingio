<blockquote>
<p>Other proposals involving modifying gravity to diverge from the general relativity. These proposals face the hurdle that the results of observations and experiments so far have tended to be extremely consistent with general relativity and the ΛCDM model, and inconsistent with thus-far proposed modifications. In addition, some of the proposals are arguably incomplete, because they solve the &quot;new&quot; cosmological constant problem by proposing that the actual cosmological constant is exactly zero rather than a tiny number, but fail to solve the &quot;old&quot; cosmological constant problem of why quantum fluctuations seem to fail to produce substantial vacuum energy in the first place. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, many physicists argue that, due in part to a lack of better alternatives, proposals to modify gravity should be considered &quot;one of the most promising routes to tackling&quot; the cosmological constant problem.[11]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So they really have no idea. And what's more the only potentially viable idea they have requires them to break their existing model and understanding of physics itself. </p>
<p>That sounds like quite the hurdle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a big open question in physics and active area of theoretical research.</p>
<p>Probably the most popular answer that isn't &quot;We have no idea&quot; is that that our universe is one of many in a multiverse, and in those universes there can be different values of this constant. The fact that we exist, and therefore live a universe which has conditions which allow life to be possible, implies the cosmological constant needs to be roughly the right value for what it is. This was actually <a href="https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.61.1" target="_blank">argued by Weinberg</a> a decade before we even measured the constant and is called the anthropic principle. </p>
<p>But this is of course extremely controversial in physics, because:</p>
<p>a. The theories that predict these multiverses, (eternal inflation, the string landscape) are themselves controversial and we have no direct evidence for them.</p>
<p>b. In order to really talk about this sort of coincidence of why our value is so small properly you need to be able to define a probability distribution over possible universes which is also controversial. </p>
<p>c. Even if this was the correct explanation we may never get direct experimental evidence that it was correct. </p>
<p>So I would say &lt; 20% of physicists who work on these sorts of things are satisfied with the anthropic argument but the problem is that there aren't very good alternatives. There are many theories in which dark energy actually changes over time (so it would not be a cosmological constant), this is called quintessence. So far the thing really looks like a constant though, but perhaps with more precise future experiments we will be able to see deviations. But if dark energy isn't really a constant and is something else, you would still have to explain why the vacuum energy of the universe (aka the thing we try to calculate as the cosmological constant) is zero, but maybe this is somehow easier? Its possible there is some deep symmetry we don't understand that makes it zero, its harder to postulate there is some deep reason its this random number. </p>
<p>Some recent attempts to explain it without quintessence or multiverses are <a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/1720817" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12293" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
<p>Interestingly there is also an under talked about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.00012" target="_blank">cosmological non-constant problem</a> that suggests anthropic explanations may not even be enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think there are two things involved here that get somewhat conflated:</p>
<p>1.) Albert Einstein referred to the cosmological constant as his &quot;biggest blunder.&quot; He had assumed that the universe was static, neither expanding nor shrinking, but the application of general relativity to the universe on the largest scales showed that it would pull itself inward and shrink because of gravity.  To solve this problem, he added a constant to the formula, an arbitrary number that would cancel out the inward pull of gravity and keep the universe steady. </p>
<p>The problem there was that the theory didn't need a cosmological constant - his assumption that the universe was static was simply wrong, and he added the constant not to match any experimental or observational evidence, but to fit the model to his prior beliefs. </p>
<p>Subsequent to Einstein's formulation, Hubble first found evidence that not only is the universe not static, it's not shrinking either (as Einstein would have predicted without the CC), but actually expanding! That created two problems for Einstein: a.) the universe wasn't stable, which means the cosmological constant would be needed, but b.) his calculations with or without the constant wouldn't  model the expanding universe. The immediate solution was to address some of the assumptions about the matter and energy in the universe, and for a while, there was a consistent model of an expanding universe, with no cosmological constant.</p>
<p>But in the 80s and 90s a new problem emerged: the universe was not only expanding, the expansion seemed to be increasing, rather than slowing down as the CC-less model would predict. The simplest solution was the presence of a uniform, non-zero energy density of empty space, generally called dark energy. That's strange because all other energy gets diluted as space expands, but a given volume would always have to contain the same amount of dark energy, now and forever. Mathematically, this works almost exactly like the cosmological constant, and so it can be reintroduced.</p>
<p>That's the story of the first error.</p>
<p>2.) The problem that now emerges is - what the hell is dark energy? Why does it have a constant density in expanding space? It's apparently being created as space expands, which is not how the universe is supposed to work.</p>
<p>One proposal comes from quantum field theory: the underlying quantum fields of the universe, for every elemental particle and fundamental force, exist everywhere in the universe at the same time. They have different values at different points, depending on what's going on, but the field itself exists everywhere. In a pure vacuum, the easy interpretation is that they all have a value of 0, but maybe that's not true, rather, there's a little bit of energy there no matter what.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the mathematics of QFT give an energy density is not small. To account for dark energy, it'd have to be about 10\^-9 joules/cubic meter. The theoretical prediction here is 10\^113 joules/cubic meter. Something has gone terrible wrong, because this is more or less the biggest discrepancy between theory and observation that's ever been recorded - though you don't even need dark energy to spot the problem, because that energy density means that a cubic meter has more energy than the entire universe. In fact, each cell in your body would get there.</p>
<p>So, we're stuck at the moment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Speaking as someone who's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05937" target="_blank">thought a bit</a> about this problem, I can confidently say that... we have no idea. This is as intractable a mystery as there is in physics today.</p>
<p>Probably the most plausible explanation is the anthropic one. If the cosmological constant were even an order of magnitude larger than it is, we wouldn't be around to remark on it - the Universe would have started accelerating so early, galaxies wouldn't have been able to form. (In fact, this was used to &quot;predict&quot; the value of the CC in the 80s, a decade before we found observational evidence for it!)</p>
<p>Now imagine our Universe is just one pocket of a much larger multiverse, and the CC takes on different values in different regions of this multiverse. Even though regions with a tiny CC like ours are extremely unlikely, we'll only ever find ourselves in such regions. And since even smaller values are even more unlikely, we would expect to live in a universe where the CC takes on (roughly) the largest value which still allows intelligent life to develop. Sure enough, that's precisely the value we observe. This isn't the most satisfying explanation in the world, but it's certainly suggestive.</p>
<p>Other more speculative solutions have been proposed, like the idea of modifying gravity so that it doesn't respond to a cosmological constant as strongly as we'd expect (that's the gist of the paper I linked to above), but I don't think any of the currently proposed solutions is especially compelling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
