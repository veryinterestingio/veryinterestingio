<p>Absentee ballots are a very small percentage of the total votes cast so it's not a big problem considering they are returned over multiple days/weeks.   Many places have started early voting and that makes things much easier.   I highly recommend it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on where you are, but where I live, the machines just read the ballots. Kind of like when you were in school and the teacher used a ScanTron machine to quickly grade the multiple choice tests where you filled in the bubbles with pencil.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While it varies widely from state to state and county to county, absentee ballots primarily use a technology called optical scan. Much like the tests you used to take in high school. They feed them through a large machine once they arrive and that tabulates the results. The machine spits out any irregularities for an eyes-on look. </p>
<p>For physical polling places, again varies widely depending on your location. Some counties tabulate right then and there via a similar optical scan while some are still punchcard systems that get collected and tabulated later by elections officials. Counties with high budgets go to the new computerized systems at polling places. All depends on the budget. </p>
<p>Ultimately it comes down to your county election office and what they are budgeted for. Elections are insanely expensive. Your average rural county can sometimes spend millions per year to maintain an election department and run multiple elections per year. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
