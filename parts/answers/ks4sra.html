		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If a mass extinction occurs over, say, 100 years, there are probably actually fewer deaths during that century than in the previous century. Over the course of any given century, pretty well every animal living at the start will have died. In a stable population, these will be replaced by new births and there will be many generations of roughly consistent deaths and births. But if species are dying out, then halfway through the century, there will have been fewer births to contribute to additional deaths later in the century so by the end of the century there will have been fewer deaths than average, despite every member of the species dying.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Consider that fossilization is rare, so such finds will be rare, but it only takes one to comprise &quot;an excessive amount of fossils&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the comment about there being less things to die as the extinction loomed nearer, it would still require the right conditions for fossils to be formed.  Scavenger animals still survived as the big things died, etc etc.  </p>
<p>We owe much of what fossils we do have typically to pits full of something that consumes them, volcanic blasts, stuff like that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am suprised that nobody posted the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanis_(fossil_site)" target="_blank">Tanis fossil site</a>. Especially as it was covered excessively by the media two years ago. This is the exact site of fossils that OP is asking, but it is still a really rare find because with any fossil site several factors have to come together:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right initial conditions for fossilization. Even at a mass extinct event this is still very hard to come by.</li>
<li>No erosion of the side over the last 60M year that would make it unrecognizable</li>
<li>A scientist or at least someone educated enough has to find it and see it for what it is.</li>
</ol>
<p>The fact that this is also from a really small point in time considering the whole geological record makes it even harder to find the right place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Consider the megafauna humanity has driven to the brink of extinction. Species like the African elephant, rhinoceros, tigers, etc. It's not like, one day, 90% of the members of those species died. The number of individuals representing the species is decreasing, yes, but it's not because the death rate has skyrocketed. It's because, a while ago, the death rate surpassed the birth rate, causing the population to decline. That slow decline means you actually end up with <em>less</em> fossils near mass extinction events. The death rate of a particular species is higher than normal during a mass extinction, but the mass extinction happens so slowly that the lower population size decreases the number of fossils by more than the increased death rate increases the number of fossils.</p>
<p>Now, the Holocene extinction (the one happening right now) might be a different story. Mass extinctions already happen quite fast on geologically relevant timescales, and speaking in those terms, humanity moves at the speed of light. Some animal populations may have actually died off so rapidly there's a noticeable increase in their fossils at the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
