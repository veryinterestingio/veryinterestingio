		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception" target="_blank">Proprioception</a></p>
<p>Basically, your brain knows where the parts of your body are, even when it can't see them. There are special nerves just for this function. That's why you can close your eyes and move your arms around (or even let someone else move them) and still know where your hands are.</p>
<p>This still helps even when your eyes are open. Your brain is aware of the tiny movements your arms and hands are making and can correct for them much faster than they can for your friend's movements, which have to be processed visually.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The brain is very good at adapting to different circumstances to function optimally.</p>
<p>Part of this adaptation is syncing movements of the eyes with subtle movements of the hands. So even though the image is moving it appears still, allowing you to read.</p>
<p>When you aren't holding it, it becomes more difficult for the eyes to sync with the movement of the page so the words appear blurry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
