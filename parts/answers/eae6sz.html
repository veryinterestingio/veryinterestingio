		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually studied selenium phytoremediation during grad school. Selenium is primarily found as selenate in the soil (but can also exist as selenite and other forms). Selenate is taken up through sulfate transporters due to its chemical similarity. Once taken up by the plant, selenium is converted into different forms including the amino acids seleno-cysteine and seleno-methionine, as well as other organics. Brazil nut trees may have a sulfate transporter in the roots (SULTR1;1 or SULTR1;2) that has a higher specificity for selenate over sulfate, or may have other enzymes in the selenium metabolism pathway that show up-regulation compared to other plants, allowing it to pull more selenium out of the soil.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is: we’re not entirely sure.</p>
<p>A study on selenium uptake in Brazil nuts from the soil found an inverse correlation between the acidity of the soil and the selenium content in Brazil nuts. </p>
<p>They found that soil with high selenium also grew Brazil nuts with high selenium content. They also found that the selenium content in the Brazil nuts also decreased when the soil was more acidic. When the soil is not acidic (alkaline), selenium in the soil exists in the form of selenate, which is water soluble. Since it’s water soluble, it gets taken up by the Brazil nut tree and gets excreted in the nuts (no pun intended). If the soil is acidic, selenium can form a ferric selenite complex with iron in the soil, which has a low solubility in water. This means that the selenium in the acidic soil does not get taken along with the water by the the Brazil nut tree.
That being said, the soil in the Amazon is very acidic. However, the soil itself is also highly rich in selenium, so I think it’s concentration will just overload the Brazil nut tree. There is still so much we don’t know about the Amazon; maybe South American soil also has a property that breaks up these ferric selenite complexes, allowing the selenium to be consumed by the tree.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While I can't answer as to the mechanism of action for how selenium uptake occurs in Brazil nut trees, one key aspect of Brazil nuts that some tend to overlook is that their selenium content is tied to how much selenium is in the soil they are planted. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28923728" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28923728</a> (abstract only, sorry)</p>
<p>There can actually be wide variation in the selenium content of brazil nuts, which is directly impacted by the soil. Some trees in selenium poor soil may not actually transfer all that much to their nuts, while other trees in selenium rich areas will have high quantities of selenium in theirs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
