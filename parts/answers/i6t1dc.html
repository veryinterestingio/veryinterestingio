<p>Your body doesn't wanna move when it's hot so it doesn't move.  </p>
<p>'doze off' is the operative term there - actual good sleep is hard to come by.  </p>
<p>Sittin' around barely awake doin' nothin'... that's about right in hot weather</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our bodies need to drop below a certain temperature at night in order to “sleep” and reset.  This is one reason why countries that aren’t used to heat waves often have so many deaths during one: it doesn’t drop cool enough at night and people don’t have air conditioning or other means to contend with the heat.  </p>
<p>IOW: sleeping during the day is not the same kind of sleep as sleeping at night. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When it's warm your body doesn't want to heat yourself why further, so it keeps you still, but to sleep your body needs to lower you body temperature to lower metabolism and that is harder to do when it's hot</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people naturally gets sleepy in the afternoon, I forget what sleep scientist call that. But it is a thing. And maybe you're sleep deprived from your restless nights... In our area, the nights are more humid (isn't that true of most places?), while the daytime hours are not. And in hot weather we are usually sluggish all day, the decreased physical activity probably makes us more restless at night? It's a vicious cycle it seems... As well as the other reasons people have given.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
