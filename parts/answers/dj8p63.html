		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a cold plasma, there are three electromagnetic ion waves: the shear Alfvén wave, the compressional Alfvén wave, and the ion acoustic wave.</p>
<p>The ion acoustic wave is effectively just a sound wave, with corrections to account for the effect of the magnetic field on the oscillating ions. So without a magnetic field, it's just an electrostatic sound wave [1]. </p>
<p>The shear Alfvén wave is an oscillation between ion kinetic energy and the tension in a magnetic field line. Clearly without a magnetic field, there is no tension. Therefore, without a magnetic field, there is no restoring force and the wave can not exist. </p>
<p>The compressional Alfvén wave is an oscillation between ion kinetic energy and the magnetic pressure. Again, without a magnetic field, there is no magnetic pressure and no restoring force.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guiding_center" target="_blank">particle drifts</a>, we can underline this point by considering how the electric field continues to oscillate [2]. In a shear Alfvén wave, the higher mass of the ions causes them to lag behind the electrons as the electric field fluctuates. This causes a polarisation drift (proportional to the rate of change of the electric field) in the direction of the electric field. Therefore, the polarisation drift causes a current in the direction of the electric field. The JxB force on this current acts perpendicular to the electric field and equilibrium magnetic field, and is out of phase with the ExB drift velocity. Therefore the acceleration is out of phase with the velocity, and is the returning force. No magnetic field, no JxB force, no returning force.</p>
<p>[1] Section 5.2 of <a href="http://www.physics.sfsu.edu/~lea/courses/oldgrad/grad/plaswav.PDF" target="_blank">these notes</a> works through the case of an ion acoustic wave without a magnetic field.</p>
<p>[2] A good reference for this is Akira Hasegawa, &quot;The Alfvén wave&quot;, DOE critical review series, 1982.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
