<p>The overall size, robustness, thick and strong supraorbital tori, large mastoid processes, and salient temporal lines of the Harbin cranium suggest that it probably represents a male individual.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since no one else has mentioned it yet, it's worth pointing out that there is a fossil female that has been found from the same lineage as the Harbin skull. This is the so-called <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/103/10/3552" target="_blank">Jinniushan woman</a>.</p>
<p>It doesn't really help answer your question, though, because it was the pelvic bones that allowed the identification of the Jinniushan woman's sex. The Jinniushan cranium is actually very robust and was thought to be from a male before the analysis of the pelvic bones. It was only afterwards that anyone noticed that the cranium was in fact slightly more gracile than others from this lineage, even though it's larger and more robust than most male skulls from other human lineages.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Homo longi may be a different species, but the primary morphological markers anthropologists use to identify between male and female skulls are fairly consistent across the Homo genus. This is especially apparent in later species of the Homo genus like <em>Homo longi</em>, which may indeed be our closest relative though there is still plenty of doubt in that regard. </p>
<p>See the other comments for a more detailed explanation of the differences, I just wanted to clarify that these markers exist across the Homo genus despite being different species since you asked about that. Thus, anthropologists can be fairly confident in assigning the remains a sex.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>do we have any evidence-based estimates of the female-male ratio on those populations?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Male to female ratio in nearly all sexually reproducing species with distinct sexes is 1:1, due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_principle" target="_blank">Fisher's Principle</a>, there are exceptions but it's quite unlikely a hominid would be one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
