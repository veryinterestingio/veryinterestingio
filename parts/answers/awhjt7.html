<p>At lot of those 15 reviews will go over the same data over and over.  So they can take the weight of only 1-2 reviews in your mind.  If you've read 16 reviews about the product, you're looking for that negative information to get a full view of the product.</p>
<p>Or if they're written in a suspiously similar or commercialized fashion, it's really easy to suspect astroturfing.  Then you go looking for a review that doesn't sound like they're lying to you.  And that means when you find that negative review, it can wash away the incorrect-looking ones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Humans are hard wired this way. In our species evolution (and that of many others) we need to be able to respond to things quickly and have a rule set that will allow to deal with negative situations quickly. This is all hard wired (and able to be altered through nurture) in our <strong>amygdalae.</strong> There's not really any big evolutionary upside to overreact to positive stimuli but there is potential huge downside to not overreact to negative stimuli.</p>
<p>So essentially our brains are hardwired to give more weight to negative stimuli, because this overreaction could save us in some situations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
