		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body contains a series of proteins that make up two major histocompatibility (MHC) complexes. MHC I presents peptides from inside the cell on the cell surface. Immune cells recognize these MHC-presented peptides to distinguish self from non-self. </p>
<p>The reason it would be quite challenging to make a universal organ is that nearly everybody has different MHC alleles. When your immune cells recognize the peptide, they aren’t recognizing only the peptide, but the whole MHC peptide complex. Therefore MHC genes that weren’t native to the body will be seen as foreign.  This is the challenge in finding a suitable organ donor; you have to find someone whose MHC proteins are somewhat similar. </p>
<p>You might think about removing MHC entirely, but the immune system reacts strongly to cells lacking MHC I. </p>
<p>The goal then, isn’t to make a universal organ, but a system that would universally allow you to make organs specific to each recipient. This might be able to be done by harvesting stem cells and using them to make an organ, or by engineering an animal like a pig to have the recipients MHC genes and then harvesting their organs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, universal donor is kind of relative. Blood nowadays is separated into different components. At the basic level Red blood cells (RBC) and plasma (FFP). O- RBCs are universal, but O- FFP is not (as it can contain anti-A and anti-B and anti-Rho (what makes your blood +/-) antigens). On the other hand AB+ FFP has none of those antigens can can be considered universal in that regard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi biomedical engineer here. One of my colleagues actually does really interesting work in this area called “stem cell cloaking.” Since we haven’t quite figured out exactly how to grow whole organs yet, this groups exact goal is what you mentioned. Engineer stem cells so they don’t initiate an immune response when transplanted for the repair of tissues. Of course on obvious issue with this is what if the cell becomes cancerous, how would the immune system detect it and destroy it if it’s been cloaked? Well they’ve actually managed to engineer a “kill switch” where if the cell begins to divide controllably they begin to express a lethal gene and kill all the mutated cells. It’s a very interesting and newly growing field as it would help greatly in developing off-the-shelf cell therapies. Here are some cool papers:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not really plausible for a couple reasons.</p>
<p>1) Blood types aren't the only or main thing that has to be matched.  (And even then the ABO blood antigen groups are not the only antigenic proteins on red blood cells - you can look <a href="https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Non-ABO_Blood_Groups" target="_blank">here</a> for other non-ABO blood types).</p>
<p>2). In addition to the proteins that can be mismatched on red blood cells, all the other nucleated cells in your body also expression these family of related proteins.  In humans these are called HLA proteins, not MHC, though the concept is the same, but if you want to learn more that is what you would look up.  This is tissue typing.  More about HLA typing <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/transplant/html/hla.html" target="_blank">here</a>.  But at least 50-60 different proteins and in many combinations, so manipulating all of these would be very tough indeed.</p>
<p>Which is why you have to be on drugs to suppress your immune system FOREVER if you get an organ transplant.</p>
<p>Growing an organ from your own cells would be best (also not possible right now).</p>
<p>This might not even be theoretically possible, at least not entirely, because each stage of development of the cells in any given organ require signals from other tissues to develop a proper structure and anatomy, which is needed for them to work.  And you don't really have a lot of pluripotent stem cells anymore (cells that can grow into anything) now that you aren't a fetus.</p>
<p>So you would need supply of really primordial stem cells, you would need to be able to grow all the tissues (connective tissue, all the different types of cells in that organ, blood vessels) in the right anatomy, and you would have to be able to manipulate all the HLA antigens so that the right ones were expressed in the right pattern.</p>
<p>In biology, you always pay something for whatever you get.  So if you want cool organs that are specialized to do something specific, like filter blood in the kidney, then you pay for that specificity with a lack of  ability to regenerate.</p>
<p>There are some amazing examples to the contrary, but as a basic rule of thumb that is true.</p>
<p>Some organs are more easy to &quot;grow&quot; (i.e. liver vs brain)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even in blood transfusions, a universal donor actually isnt. If you're literally bleeding to death, and have moments to live, sure you could get a few units of O neg and possibly survive. </p>
<p>However there are hundreds of secondary blood group antigens which still have to potential to cause anything from a pesky allergic reaction to full organ failure. In the above scenario, that risk is acceptable because you would have died anyways. </p>
<p>When you receive a blood product in a manner that is planned, as in for surgery or chronic disease treatment, the compatibility of your blood and the donor blood is rigorously checked to ensure no unexpected reactions can take place. Even still your body can recognize the cells as non self after the fact and begin mounting a response that could again lead to allergic reaction or worse. </p>
<p>Now with blood and blood products, your body cycles through the donated material within 1-3 months. negative effects from the transfusion can be mitigated and accounted for over that time. When you've put a heart in someone, that tissue will never turn over and become your cells. It will continue to be a vessel of 'non self' tissue the body will mount a response against. The only way to ensure the body will not eventually fight the tissue is if it is 100% identical to its host tissue. </p>
<p>Really even then, the documentation and study of idiopathic autoimmune disorders is ever expanding. You could literally wake up tomorrow and your body can just turn in itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
