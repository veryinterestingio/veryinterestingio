		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some characters in Chinese have similar sounds because they share some common &quot;strokes&quot; and one can always try to guess the sound of a character one hasn't learned before (or even forgot). But most of the times if you can't recognize a character, you gotta use a dictionary or ask someone else how to read it and pronounce it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They use small versions of the syllable characters beside uncommon characters, unusual readings, or in teaching materials to show how to pronounce them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since people have covered Chinese and Japanese, I'll also point out that written English is not very phonetic. A quick google and you'll find examples like though, through, cough, rough, plough, ought, borough. With or without an alphabet, you hear other people say it, and you just memorize what the correct sound is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They can be composed smaller symbols that the reader does know. Kind of like our compound words.</p>
<p>Some languages that look like ideograms are actually an alphabet or syllabary. Japanese makes use of come Chinese characters (kangi?) But their commonly used written words are made by symbols with assigned sounds. </p>
<p>Similarly, Korean (hangul) is the one written language that is easiest to learn how to read due to the efforts of Sejeong the great - one of the previous kings of Korean. You can learn the phonetic assignments to their alphabet in minutes and read/pronounce the written language within the day. But learning the grammar and vocabulary comes separately.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For Chinese, you can't. </p>
<p>You can guess, but if you don't know the character, you probably won't know how to say it or understand it.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Chinese is tonal (i.e. the inflection).  Different tones for the same sound can have different meanings. So not only do you need to know what sound the character is, but also the tone. Looking at a character may give clues, but there is no way to know exactly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
