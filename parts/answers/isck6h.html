This is great for fitting in all of your friends from just arm's length.  It's also absolutely awful at capturing things at a distance, since such a tremendously large area is in-frame.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Camera focal lengths can effect this, however I suspect what you are really referencing is the Moon Illusion.</p>
<p>The illusion that the Moon looks bigger when it is low on the horizon but small when it is above.</p>
<p>If you take a picture of it on the horizon, it will appear small in the image but large to your eyes.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_illusion#:~:text=The%20Moon%20illusion%20is%20an,this%20illusion%20is%20still%20debated" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon\_illusion#:\~:text=The%20Moon%20illusion%20is%20an,this%20illusion%20is%20still%20debated" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon\_illusion#:\~:text=The%20Moon%20illusion%20is%20an,this%20illusion%20is%20still%20debated</a></a>.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There are various methods to prove that the large moon is an Illusion:</p>
<ol>
<li>use a camera</li>
<li>Hold your arm out and block the moon with your thumb while it is low and while it is high, you will see it is the same size when compared to your outstretched thumb</li>
<li>While looking at the large moon, bend over and look at upside down, through your legs, the illusion will break.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The really fun thing is, we don't really know why our brain plays this trick on us.  There are several theories, none proven.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of good answers here, most of which are right.</p>
<p>I’ll just add the term ‘size constancy’, which is a thing our brain does with things we see. When something big like a truck is close to us we see it as a certain size. If that truck was instead far away <em>we can still tell</em> that it’s a big truck, even though it looks tiny because of the distance. Our brain takes into account the distance of the truck when figuring out the truck’s size. It does this mostly using binocular cues (how much our eyes need to move to join each eye’s image together) plus some other visual cues.</p>
<p>For the moon, we can tell it is very far away and we can also sense its size <em>in spite of its distance.</em> The moon is indeed real big, so our brains go all “damn that’s a huge bitch” which kinda warps what we feel about the thing we are seeing, which in reality is a rather small circle.</p>
<p>Photos don’t let our brains do this size constancy thing as much, so they show us the moon more as it really is. Luckily you can trick your brain into not doing size constancy. Try holding out your hand and ‘grabbing’ the moon between your finger and thumb. Then look at how much stuff is not in that little gap. You should suddenly be aware of the tinyness of the moon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s an illusion of perspective. When you look up at the moon, your eyes focus on it and your brain decides that everything around it is background. When you take a photo, the device decides that the entire image is important and doesn’t seperate the moon from the sky.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
