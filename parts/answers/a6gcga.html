		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don't generally really forget important stuff, you just don't remember it at the correct time. Its rare that if you forgot a meeting, that you have absolutely no clue you should have been in it, after someone reminds you. Once you get triggered, you remember.</p>
<p>Now in case of movie spoilers, you always get triggered to remember it at the worst time. The moment you go see the movie. Giving the impression you never forget a spoiler, but always forget a important meeting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reasons listed are great but another that no one has mentioned is that memories attached with emotion are easier to remember. </p>
<p>You were probably rather mad/sad or any other emotion when the spoilers were told to you. Therefore you remember it more.</p>
<p>STUDY TIP: associate things with emotions to remember things on a test better. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You remember things better if you can make logical connections to other things you know, or if you get an emotional reaction to the fact. </p>
<p>Movie spoilers often happen after you’ve heard preliminary info about the movie. Hearing the spoiler connects the dots in your head, it’s like dropping something onto a single strand of spiderweb or onto a full net—the net connects in more ways and the spoiler “sticks” better. </p>
<p>Plus, you’re pissed that someone spoiled it for you. That emotional reaction helps you remember. </p>
<p>Compare this to, “There’s a budget meeting next Tuesday and we need those numbers by Monday.”  Good luck remembering that dry data—unless of course it fills you with fear, of course. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Contextual memory is a bitch.</p>
<p>You remember the spoiler because you're watching the movie.</p>
<p>Just like how you remember lyrics when the song is playing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>u/oaden’s answer is a good one.  However, you should also note that intentionally trying not to think about something  (as  we often do with spoilers) will actually make it more memorable and more likely to come to mind unintentionally.
