		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very few diseases are candidates for eradication.</p>
<p>Mostly because they need to be exclusive of humans. If they have an animal reservoir (some species that also gets sick and can infect us) then there is no way to make it disappear.</p>
<p>Most flu/cold viruses circulate among animals as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The real answer here is that it is unlikely for the reasons mentioned but we don't actually know what impact this is going to have on other pathogens.  This is a new situation that the modern world has never found itself in before.  There are some priceless data being generated at the moment that scientists are going to be using for decades to come to determine how infections spread.  Economists are also going to have an amazing set of data that will uncover new and interesting insights into human behaviour based on the externality that this virus represents.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reduced for sure, eliminated it's difficult. Syndromic surveillance for flu has reported a decrease from 8% in the 13th week of 2020 to 1% in the 14th week of 2020 in Germany, roughly when isolation measures began.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The folks who make that internet-connected thermometer have reported that where social distancing has been practiced, flu incidence has dropped too. So the essential answer to your question is that social distancing is effective at reducing incidence of the flu, for the same reason it reduces incidence of covid-19. But it's never going to be eliminated for the reasons already stated by other posters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
