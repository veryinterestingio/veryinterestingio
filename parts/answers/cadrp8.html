		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A factor I'm not seeing anyone else mention: great white sharks don't really understand walls. The Monterey Bay Aquarium holds the record for keeping a great white captive the longest, but they no longer consider it ethical because the shark will beat itself up pretty bad running into the enclosure walls. These sharks expect to have a huge territory, and to be able to swim in any direction basically forever. As they get larger, this gets worse, and eventually they'll die from blunt trauma.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to everything posited already, I thought I read something years ago about electrical signals. Great White sharks are highly sensitive to electical signals and living in an aquarium for them would be like you living in the middle of an active airport.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically speaking, you can tie a human down to a bed and feed him intravenously and supply him with a heavy dose of antibiotics to ward off sickness.  There's minimal bodily waste due to the intravenous feeding.</p>
<p>Just keep him in that bed indefinitely.  </p>
<p>You could theoretically keep him alive for a long while, but what sort of condition would he be in?</p>
<p>Those sharks aren't built for being in small spaces anymore than humans are made to be tied down to a bed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
