		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a hand tremor and the neurologist I spoke to as a child of about 6 or 7 explained it like this:</p>
<p>In your brain there's a faucet that controls your hands. If you're still it's off and if you need to move your hands your brain turns on the appropriate amount of hot and cold water to get that perfect mix to do what you want. Well if the faucet gets a leak then a little bit of water drips all the time and your hands take that as a command for a little movement. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s when your brain misfires signals to the muscles that they should move. It is made worse through anxiety and other states that would make you more tense. This is why certain anti-anxiety and anti-depressants can double as treatments for motor tics and Tourette’s. If you have excessive anxiety it’ll make your motor tics more prevalent.</p>
<p>A large amount of the population has motor tics of some form, but they’re usually not very noticeable if you don’t know what you’re looking for. Most non severe cases will appear in youth and become far less prevalent when you finish puberty.</p>
<p>I was diagnosed with a mild form of Tourette’s and was treated with a combination of two medicines. One of which was an anti-anxiety/anti-depressant. I had various tics that were very noticeable, but after I reached my early-mid 20s most of them stopped with only the occasional heavy blink.</p>
<p>Interestingly, you’re more prone to have motor tics if you have a curvature in the spine like scoliosis. I have a very slight curvature.</p>
<p>Edit: lots of folks asking, but I had a prescription of Orap (used for motor tics) and Citalopram (treats anxiety and depression). However, this probably won’t work for severe Tourette’s because it can only be taken in very low dosages together. I had to get an  MRI once a year because I’m higher dosages those two medicines combined can harm your heart. I went through lots of different medicine that never really worked or the side effects were worse than the treatment but those two worked perfectly.</p>
<p>If you have motor tics that interrupt your daily life you should see a neurologist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as TS tics, they are 100% voluntary.  Strange, but true. </p>
<p>ELI5?  It's like an itch. Drives you crazy till you scratch it.  And you might scratch even if your skin is raw. </p>
<p>I have TS and if I snap my head back, clear my throat, or over-extend my leg, I'm doing it on purpose. </p>
<p>Tics are the result of compulsion. Lots of folks with OCD have Tourette's, and lots of folks with Tourette's have OCD. What doctors are starting to learn is that OCD, TS, picking disorders, hair eating, ect... all fall into an obsessive compulsive spectrum. Some people have none, one, two, even five different symptoms. </p>
<p>When I feel the urge to do a tic, I have an overwhelming compulsion to do so. Even if my tongue is bleeding, I will still bite it. Because as much as it hurts, the pain is still less than the torment of not doing it. </p>
<p>Sometimes it passes on its own.  Most time it takes 5 or more times &quot;doing&quot; a tic before it passes. The thing is, the urge is I overwhelming. It almost always wins. </p>
<p>Nicotine really helps. It was a wonder drug for me. </p>
<p>To add to the confusion, someone else with TS might read this and think &quot;WTF? TS is nothing like that!&quot;  Thats because tics are a symptom not a disease. Both the flu and lung cancer cause you to cough, but they are quite different. </p>
<p>For some people tics MIGHT be involuntarily, but they are still diagnosed with TS. </p>
<p>For being relatively common, it is,surprisingly not well understood. This is because it doesn't kill you and most people can manage without treatment. So there is little interest or $$$ devoted towards studying it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
