		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a quick Google search that lead to a Smithsonian Magazine article &quot; Tonic immobility is what researchers call &quot;a  fear-potentiated response” to being restrained. In other words, the  chicken (or any other animal that exhibits this response) is convinced  that it is going to die and goes into a kind of cationic state.  According to Beredimas, farmers have known about this trick at least  since 1646, when Athanasius Kircher published <em>&quot;Mirabile Experimentum de Imaginatione Gallinae.”</em> The  reaction seems to be most commonly reported in domesticated birds like  chickens and quail, but other species seem to demonstrate tonic  immobility as well. <a href="http://jgp.rupress.org/content/11/6/715.abstract" target="_blank">One study from 1928</a> looked at the response in lizards. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0031938471902356" target="_blank">Another watched the brains of rabbits</a> during movement, rest, sleep and tonic immobility. &quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Snakes eat chickens. Snakes look like lines. Snakes don't like dead things. </p>
<p>If you had a hundred chickens play dead in front of a snake, and a hundred chickens try to run or fight a snake, there would be more play dead chickens alive than the others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've seen this work by making repeated circular gestures around the chicken's face as well.  When I announce that I'm going to hypnotize a chicken as a stunt (this is rare but it happens), I make a series of five to ten circles with my index finger in front of the chicken's face of a width just slightly larger than it's head before using that finger to draw the imaginary line starting right in front of it's face and moving away from the chicken.  I've experimented a bit and found that this method has the highest rate of success.  I know this isn't an answer to your question but I hope it helps further this chicken hypnosis discussion in some way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
