		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok let's take this in three parts:</p>
<p>Pressure sensitive adhesives such as tape are a mixture of rubber (like your tires) and a type of liquid that is very slow to move but still liquid.  When these are pressed against a surface, they squish themselves into the cracks of the material.  The liquid material will allow you to compress it and it actually moves better when squished than it does just sitting there meaning it is now stuck in the cracks.  From there, it actually resists being pulled on like a Chinese finger trap.  This is what we perceived as being sticky.</p>
<p>There are also chemical reaction based adhesives.  These don't have to be crazy things like vulcanizing rubbers, etc.  This can be something as simple as honey coming in contact with your fingers.  The structure of honey allows it to absorb water into its system.  This means that as it contacts your finger it takes a liking to the water on your finger and gets bound to it.  The only way to get it out is to overwhelm the matrix with more water (aka licking your fingers).</p>
<p>Finally, when it comes to smooth surfaces (no surface is actually smooth) we go back to the first type of adhesive.  The idea for smooth surfaces is to not only fill the cracks, but to make a uniform surface of adhesives that can use the small gaps in the surface to anchor it to the smooth material.  For the rest of the area, it is more like a suction cup than like the tape adhesive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other people have commented on how adhesives are made to fill in the gaps between rough surfaces. Now, the reason they actually make things stick together is that basically <em>everything</em> sticks together. It is a fundamental property of all matter that if you put it very close to each other, it sticks together (the exact reasons have to do with atoms and electrons and that opposite charges attract).</p>
<p>Normally when you, say, put your hand on a wall, parts of your hand will stick to parts of the wall but the effect is so tiny that you don't even notice. The reason for that is that both the wall and the surface of your hand are still very rough at a microscopic level, so only very few points are actually touching and there is still a lot of air left in between. When adhesives fill out these empty spaces between two objects they make more atoms be closer together, and therefore amplify this fundamental &quot;sticking force&quot; (called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Waals_force" target="_blank">van der Waals force</a>) to the point where it has a macroscopic effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So adhesive on tape sort of turns into a liquid, then it flows into the nooks and crannies of the thing you’re sticking it to, then it sort of turns back solid again and then hangs on to the thing you’re sticking it to like legos.</p>
<p>There’s two primary forces going on here. The first is pretty easy to visualize. The adhesive on tape is what you call viscoelastic, meaning it behaves sort of like a liquid even though it’s solid, and it’s stretchy. So it “flows” into all the  oils and crannies of a surface then hangs on tight. A surface may look smooth to you, but chances are it has many pits and pores and mountains under a microscope. </p>
<p>The second is a little harder to visualize. All molecules are made of atoms which have electrons, which are negatively charged, and protons, which are positively charged. If an atom has the same number of electrons and protons, it is neutrally charged overall. Some neutral molecules still are negatively charged on one side and positively charged on another side, because some atoms in the molecule are greedy for electrons and pull the electrons in tight. So in these molecules, like the ones in tape adhesive, you get positive parts where the electrons went away and negative parts where the electrons got pulled in tight. Positive likes negative and sticks to it like legos, and the adhesive on tape similarly behaves almost like legos like with the surface of the material you stick it to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In science terms, &quot;sticky&quot; is called adhesion. Imagine how water sticks to the surface of glass. The same principle is used in tape and other such sticky things.</p>
<p>Then, we also need to take a look at smooth surfaces. Let's take glass for example. If you feel it, it doesnt seem like there are any cracks or crevices, which, for the most part is true. If you look really closely, like through a microscope, you can sometimes find little cracks and crevices, but that's not too important for the concept of tape sticking to it.</p>
<p>The sticky part of the tape wraps itsself over the surface of the glass as best as it can, and since the adhesion helps it stick, the more that its touching, the stronger it sticks to the surface. You can actually test this, if you take a piece of glass and put a little flour on it to get between the glass and the tape it hardly sticks at all. Or if you get some tape and put it on the thin side of a piece of paper, it hardly sticks at all. This is because all the sticky parts of the tape not only stick to the surface, but they also stick to eachother, which is called &quot;cohesion&quot;</p>
<p>Cohesion is actually a lot stronger than adhesion, so if you take water on glass as an example, its pretty easy to shake a drop of water off the glass, but try to make the water drop split in two. It's possible, but it's a lot harder. The same applies to tape, it's usually a lot easier to take tape off of something than it is to take the sticky stuff off of the tape.</p>
<p>So the adhesion sticks to the surface, and the cohesion makes it so that when you try to take it off, all the sticky stuff works together to prevent it from falling off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
