		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The UN generally defines indigenous peoples as &quot;The descendants - according to a common definition - of those who inhabited a country or a geographical region at the time when people of different cultures or ethnic origins arrived. The new arrivals later became dominant through conquest, occupation, settlement or other means.&quot;</p>
<p>The UN has a wider statement about their definition that you can read here. <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/5session_factsheet1.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/5session_factsheet1.pdf</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The trouble is you are asking a question that is answered by social science, not biological science (r/science). </p>
<p>We don't have a genetic test for &quot;indigenous&quot; ancestry, really... We have comparative records that can say you appear to be descendent of people died/were buried in this area at this time. </p>
<p>An indigenous group in the social science sense is defined by the UN, as another redditor commented. It refers to people who have undergone a sort of conquering, suffering exploitation at the hands of colonists. Nobody really is the &quot;first&quot; group of people to inhabit a land mass, people migrated a lot, and one area could host many groups over the course of geologic time. Indigenous as a label is a social construct, not a biological fact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An indigenous population has had many generations across the same landmass. </p>
<p>Generally indigenous populations have less technological development and do not fare well against invaders/visitors, due to disease and mal-intent. </p>
<p>Indigenous populations also are usually not aware of travelling to their location except through stories passed down through word of mouth. Papua New Guinea has a museum in Port Moresby showing a recreation of the arrival ships their ancestors used to arrive, as their travel ships are essentially just l very large outrigger canoes. </p>
<p>Kontiki, a movie about testing Polynesian myths of sailing directly from the east, using only historically accurate materials and construction. Thought impossible until accomplished again in our time, proving their word of mouth was true. </p>
<p>An indigenous population predates any other known populations in the location but has also been occupying the land and accumulated local knowledge of plants, herbs, food and water sources that allow them to survive and thrive at much lower technological levels. The isolation also causes distinct (although often very similar) belief systems, laws and stories. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
