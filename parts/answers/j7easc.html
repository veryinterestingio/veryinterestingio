		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cognitive load is how many things you're keeping in your head at one time. As you put more and more things on your mind, it gets harder to address whatever is already in there.</p>
<p>Let's say you're cooking and have the cognitive loads of stovetop cooking, baking, and cleanup at the same time. Your partner comes up to you and asks if they could help. Now, you have to add &quot;figure out what they can help with&quot; to your list of 3 things. It takes some time for you to come up with &quot;help load the dishwasher.&quot;</p>
<p>Your partner starts loading the dishwasher but once in a while asks you a question of where to put things or how to fit it, adding additional things to your cognitive load while you're trying to manage the stove and oven. Then the dishwasher starts and makes weird noises, making you concerned. Water starts leaking and now you're thinking you need to call a plumber and start looking through your contacts and the internet. While you're doing that, do you smell smoke?</p>
<p>The cognitive load, also called mental load, handled by people can go unnoticed until something goes wrong.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I will use an education example since some fellow teachers are terrible at this. In education, the cognitive load theory explains that if you try to do more than one complicated thing at the same time, students will not be able to do either one well, let alone learn it. Let’s say you have a teacher who wants to teach you how to use a new technology tool and also a new concept at the same time. Your brain cannot handle both of those and you would struggle to learn either one well. Your cognitive load or the material your brain has to work through is too high. It is simply too much to think about. A better way to ensure your brain can handle all that work is to first have a fun activity where you experience the technology tool by itself and you can just think about that one thing. Once you get good with the tool, the teacher can add in the concept. Now you can only think about the concept and learn/understand/remember/use it better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
