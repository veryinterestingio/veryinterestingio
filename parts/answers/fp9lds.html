		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi I used your app from Hong Kong!  In using your app I know that some species the exact locations are hidden because they are threatened.  </p>
<p>Some species here are not labelled as threatened but are sought after by people to eat or use in other ways.  Trapping (for example fresh water turtles) or cutting (for example incence trees) do damage our biodiversity and ecosystems.</p>
<p>How do you asses which species am should be shown exactly on a map and which should not be?</p>
<p>More broadly- How do you balance the value of creating interest and education in biodiversity and allowing data on its location available to all?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If I keep posting every time I get a picture of a deer is that actually helpful or is one a year all that really is needed?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
