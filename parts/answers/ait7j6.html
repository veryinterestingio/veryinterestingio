		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dopamine is actually injected medically, as a treatment for very low blood pressure.</p>
<p>However, naturally occurring neurotransmitters are rarely usable drugs (the exception I can think of are dopamine, adrenaline/noradrenaline and oxytocin... there might be others). The reason for this is because the body already has mechanisms to break these compounds down. It needs to, otherwise when adrenaline, for instance, was released, your heart would keep beating at an increased rate forever. The body needs these signals to only act for a while, and to achieve this, it has enzymes to break these hormones and neurotransmitters down. Because of this, dopamine and adrenaline, when injected, only have a half life of a minute or so.</p>
<p>There is another, more important, reason why dopamine isn't used recreationally (and this goes for using serotonin instead of MDMA too). Neurotransmitters and hormones are nearly always water soluble and fat insoluble, and fat insoluble compounds can't pass into the brain. All of the blood vessels in the brain are specially designed to make it very hard for foreign compounds to get into the brain. This is because animals want to be able to eat things, and not worry about compounds in the food changing the way their brain behaves. This principle is refereed to as the &quot;blood brain barrier&quot;. So dopamine can't diffuse from the blood into the brain, because it is water soluble. This rule isn't 100% accurate, but generally speaking, drugs that wont dissolve in fats can't get into the brain. This is how the made &quot;non drowsy antihistamines&quot;... they made them more water soluble, and hence they don't get into the brain to make you sleepy.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that even if dopamine didn't get broken down so fast, and it was able to get into the brain, it still probably wouldn't be a good drug of abuse. Drugs which activate dopamine receptors directly usually cause vomiting. Remember, the brain isn't just a biochemical soup. The timing and location of neurotransmitter release matters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The half-life is ridiculously short, on the <a href="https://www.drugs.com/pro/dopamine-injection.html" target="_blank">order of two minutes</a>, not unlike an 'adrenaline rush'.  Much more effective to get the body to produce it automatically than try to add it synthetically.  As others have pointed out, it struggles to pass the blood-brain barrier; however this point is kinda moot if it can be delivered as a suitable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrug" target="_blank">prodrug</a>, or even administered to the brain directly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dopamine doesn't cross the blood brain barrier. Parkinson's disease is a condition where there is insufficient dopamine release and it is often treated with Leva-dopa which is a precursor to dopamine which can cross the barrier. </p>
<p>Like most neurotransmitters which naturally exist in the body, dopamine affects many systems. Thus, if you use an external dose you often have unforeseen and catastrophic side effects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
