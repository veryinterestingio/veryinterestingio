		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The analytical process takes about 1 hour - at least it did for the PCR tests from several months ago, and I don't see how that would change.  The process involves &quot;amplification&quot; where the temperature of a sample is ramped up and then cooled down a few dozen times.  One procedure calls for 50 cycles at about 45 seconds per cycle, plus some other steps that take another 15 minutes.</p>
<p>But there's overhead time and queue time:</p>
<ol>
<li>The swabs often are mailed to a lab, which typically takes overnight.  </li>
<li>Your sample may be received early in the day along with a thousand others, so it may not be processed for several hours</li>
<li>The data have to be reviewed and signed off by a couple of people, so that can be another hour or more of delay.</li>
<li>I think (but haven't confirmed) that even if your sample is the first one processed that day, they won't release the result until the end of the day (or at least the end of the shift) because they have to check the machinery calibration and proper operation before AND after your sample.  If those checks are once/shift, then that means up to another 8 hours.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, it probably takes up to a few hours for the results to be transferred to a system that will then notify you.</p>
<p>So even if they process the sample on site, it'll be maybe 10 hours at least before you get a result.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Uhhh, I think I'm supposed to say &quot;Thank you, kind strangers&quot;?  I've been on reddit for years but this one post doubled my karma.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as PCR testing, First it has to get to the lab which is actually doing the testing and depending on when you get it done and when delivery is (can be upto an added 12hrs), then it is put on a batch roughly 94 samples at a time. We need to transfer from the collection tube to a smaller personally labeled tube. Then after that we take a part of that sample and extract it for Rna, so from receiving in the lab until we have RNA, it's about 3 hours. </p>
<p>Then we need to run that RNA through PCR, and that process from start to results is about 2 hours. So if your sample is on the first batch of the day, and there are zero interruptions or troubleshooting, it will be in your chart after 5hrs. Positive results are called immediately, and I believe negative results are notified once the nurse or doctor releases the result to the patient's viewable chart. </p>
<p>However, labs are getting several thousand samples a day so that creates back up, and because labs are so understaffed since people forget we exist, there are only so many hands that are available to process samples. But on average our turnaround time is 24hrs (as long as it isn't a quest or labcorp lab)</p>

<p>The test at my lab takes 4 hours once it's on the instrument. It's PCR, but it's a little slower because it can take more samples at once compared to the faster ones. But your test is one of 300-600 I have to work on I'm on covid testing that day. Needless to say I can't get those all done myself in the evening when they all come in, so some are worked on the next morning.</p>
<p>Before that, the sample has to get from the doctor's office to my lab via courier who picks up at certain times. Once here it goes through data entry and processing with the rest of the samples (which of course includes many kinds of tests that we do that all have to be entered and sorted by the processing department). Once it gets to me, I pipette it into another tube for lysis and load it on the instrument. Hand fatigue is a real problem manually pipetting all the samples. At the same time I have to manage supplies that the instrument uses, clean the racks and work areas, empty waste, run QC, and mix test reagents. It's a lot to do to keep the instrument happy and running. Then we go through the results one by one to record them and report them to your doctor. </p>
<p>It's a combination of being swamped and being limited by our instrumentation, for my lab, but we still get results to our clients in less than 48 hours (usually less than 24 from the time we received it in the lab). We're just killing ourselves to do it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on your center and what kind of test you are doing.</p>
<p>The golden standard right now is pcr test. This has been elaborated a lot here, it may take between 1-5 hours depending on multiple reasons.</p>
<p>There is rapid test for antigen, which will take about 30 minutes to 1 hour.</p>
<p>There is rapid test for antibody, which will take between 30 minutes to 1 hour as well.</p>
<p>But rapid test for antigen and antibody has many down sides, not readily available everywhere, false negatives and false positive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You‘re probably not going to see this.</p>
<p>I‘m still in university but I work part-time in a PCR laboratory where we do Corona tests, so I thought I could answer. Now the PCR in itself doesn‘t take that long, maybe an hour or so. Problem is the amount of tests and machines. Let me run you through the process the company I work with has:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The doctor takes a sample and puts it in a container. Every container can hold 96 samples which is the same amount of samples that can be processed with every PCR. So let‘s say you‘re number 33. In an hour or two the doctor will have enough samples to send them to the laboratory. Depending on the location it can take an hour for the samples to reach the facility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The samples don‘t go to the PCR department immediately. They have to be labeled and the patients name will be entered into a system where we also enter the result once we have it. This takes another hour or so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once it reaches us in the PCR. We have to write down every name into a list. Each sample is given a number and every number is associated with a certain name. This is necessary because the samples will be put in tiny plastic tubes (Eppendorfgefäße). In order to be able to find out which sample it belongs to if there ever was a mistake we need to put small number-letter-combination on the plastic tubes. For example B7 would be u/alexnpark. The would be on the list. We also write the results on the list before entering them into the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The samples will be prepared and then the PCR will be started. Problem is that we get about 2.000 tests a day and we have 3 PCR machines. Even if we take only the time spent during the PCR and the preparation in our department (about 2.5h), we have to work 16h a  (which we do) to get through all the tests.</p>
</li>
<li>Results aren‘t always that clear. Basically during PCR you get a certain number for every sample as a result and there is also another number. Any sample that is equal to or higher than that number, will be positive for Corona. Problem is the following: Let‘s say the result is 17.2 and you need to have 17.3  for a positive result. This is when the result will be delayed further. Because the result is too close, the higher ups will take a look at it. It takes quite long. We are only allowed to announce the results to the patients if we get an ok from the higher ups.</li>
