		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, intestinal bacteria can synthesize and consume neurotransmitters such as serotonin and gamma-aminobutyrate. See:</p>
<p>Serotonin: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25078296" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25078296</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is also substantial overlap between behaviours influenced by the gut microbiota and those which rely on intact serotonergic neurotransmission . . .The mechanisms underpinning this crosstalk require further elaboration but may be related to the ability of the gut microbiota to control host tryptophan metabolism along the kynurenine pathway, thereby simultaneously reducing the fraction available for serotonin synthesis and increasing the production of neuroactive metabolites. The enzymes of this pathway are immune and stress-responsive, both systems which buttress the brain-gut axis. In addition, there are neural processes in the gastrointestinal tract which can be influenced by local alterations in serotonin concentrations with subsequent relay of signals along the scaffolding of the brain-gut axis to influence CNS neurotransmission.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The gut microbiota affects many important host functions, including the immune response and the nervous system. . . . Bioassay-driven purification of B. fragilis supernatant led to the isolation of the growth factor, which, surprisingly, is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid). GABA was the only tested nutrient that supported the growth of KLE1738, and a genome analysis supported a GABA-dependent metabolism mechanism. Using growth of KLE1738 as an indicator, we isolated a variety of GABA-producing bacteria, and found that Bacteroides ssp. produced large quantities of GABA. Genome-based metabolic modelling of the human gut microbiota revealed multiple genera with the predicted capability to produce or consume GABA. A transcriptome analysis of human stool samples from healthy individuals showed that GABA-producing pathways are actively expressed by Bacteroides, Parabacteroides and Escherichia species. By coupling 16S ribosmal RNA sequencing with functional magentic resonance imaging in patients with major depressive disorder, a disease associated with an altered GABA-mediated response, we found that the relative abundance levels of faecal Bacteroides are negatively correlated with brain signatures associated with depression.</p>

<p>These can affect nearby nerves (in particular the vagus nerve) which might have some effects on the brain. The paper linked in the top post is a study showing that SSRIs (which inhibit serotonin reuptake) increase vagal nerve activity. Gut-synthesized neurotransmitters generally can't make it all the way into the brain because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier" target="_blank">blood-brain barrier</a> (a layer of cells which keeps them out).</p>
<p>There are many <em>correlational</em> studies showing a link between the gut microbiome and depresssion (example: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00483-5" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00483-5</a>), but showing causation is much trickier (for example, depression might cause changes in diet which alter the microbiome). Still, I think based on the neurotransmitter studies there's some good evidence for a role. The immune system also might be involved (some microbes could cause inflammation, and there's some evidence for a role of inflammation in depression: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30368652" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30368652</a>).</p>
<p>Finally, intestinal bacteria can break down medications (<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6445/eaau6323" target="_blank">for example, levodopa</a> for Parkinson's) and indirectly affect brain function.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here’s some recent research suggesting a link between diet and depression:</p>
<p>Long story short, researchers showed that when individuals switch to a Mediterranean diet, they reported lower levels of depression. </p>
<p>What is interesting about this is that these individuals did not experience lower levels of anxiety. The researchers hypothesized that if the benefits the depression were the result of people taking positive action in their lives, i.e. changing their diet, then anxiety would also go down. </p>
<p>As this was not the case, the researchers suggest that there is a deep connection between diet and mood that we do not fully understand. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the book &quot;How Emotions are Made&quot; a neuroscientist proposes that emotions have more to do with the brains monitoring of the body's health and accuracy in making predictions about the world it interacts with. Depression is very unlikely to have a universal cause or single mechanism. More like a check engine light where 50 different things turn it on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
