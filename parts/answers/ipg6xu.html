		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its easy to send something into orbit around the sun. Its hard to send something INTO the sun. This is because anything that is launched from the earth is already orbiting the sun. To send something into the sun it has to be accelerated in the opposite direction we're orbiting which is about 67000 miles per hour. That takes a lot of energy and fuel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Earth is moving at about 67,000 miles per hour. When you launch an object from Earth, it starts off with that same speed.</p>
<p>That speed is why the planet, and any other object, stays in orbit. In order to get closer, you have to reduce the speed. To get to the sun, you have to reduce that speed to almost 0.</p>
<p>The escape velocity from the sun at Earth's distance is 94,000 miles per hour. So to launch an object out of the solar system, you only need to change its speed by 27,000 miles per hour.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you're in a car travelling at 30mph.  (Obviously you're in a kid's seat because you're 5.)  You open the window and drop a ball.  You might expect the ball to fall straight down.  What will actually happen is that the ball will fall, but in an arc.  This is because it's already going forwards at 30mph, and its momentum carries it forwards.  To make it fall straight down, you'd actually need to throw it backwards at 30mph to cancel the speed of the car.
Probes are the same.  If you launch one from Earth, it'll want to orbit the Sun along with Earth.  To make it head right for the Sun, we need to throw it 'backwards'.
Now you might think we could just fire it at the Sun.  But that's like throwing the ball down.  It will keep going forward, but will bounce higher.  Similarly, firing the probe at the Sun will still make it miss, but it'll end up in an even bigger orbit!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes this is true. For any kind of higher orbit you need more speed and lesser orbits less speed. If youâ€™re already going fast, you have to spend energy to slow down.</p>
