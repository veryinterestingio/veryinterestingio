		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your browser caches pages and will save it to your device to speed loading. That cache will periodically get cleared and require the entire site to be loaded again. Ads add a lot of overhead as well with images, animations, video etc. If those change it will impact loading time. Plus there are a lot of libraries that may need to get loaded behind the scenes. Again, ads may call different libraries that also need to be loaded. Then there's the time of day you visit. There may be higher traffic at certain times of day. There might be issues with a server somewhere along the line. There are tons of issues that can come up that will slow things down but ads are mostly to blame.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ALOT of factors.  You wouldn't believe how many</p>
<p>Modern sites don't load from 1 location.  It's not just NFL's servers.  It's content deliver networks.  It's possibly Amazon's or Microsoft's or Google's or some other cloud company.  It's third party libraries hosted on yet another set of servers.  </p>
<p>Each of those contents from hundreds of different locations are being loaded.  Each of those servers has to serve thousands to millions of requests each second.   Your request is a drop in the bucket.</p>
<p>Each request runs thru 10-30 hops on the internet to get to you.  Each of those hops is a network device that serves thousands to millions of data requests a second.   Your data is a drop in the bucket.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's ignore browser caching and wifi network congestion and focus on distance. Imagine your connection is like a water pipe and a server is a big holding tank with a valve at the other end. A 20MB connection is like a wide pipe, it can send a lot of water at once and fill your water bottle very quickly. However, when you're overseas it's like you have a very long pipe. So while it may still be wide, it takes a long time for the water to get all the way down the pipe to you.</p>
<p>The 20MB is the capacity of the connection, how much data can be sent at once. The actual &quot;speed&quot; of the network is usually what people call the &quot;ping&quot;, how quickly can a request be sent to a server and back again. Ping is greatly affected by physical proximity to the server because the further you go, the more servers you need in between to pass your request along.</p>
<p>Also, to mitigate this issue, international sites will use Content Delivery Networks (CDN) to create duplicates of their pages and/or data so that a copy of that data is as close to you as possible. When you watch a YouTube video in the US, you're pulling it from a nearby US CDN, when you're watching in Europe, you're pulling from a nearby European CDN.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine the internet like a pipe system. Some pipes are big and can carry lots of data, others are smaller and can carry less data. Some pipes are pretty much straight from the server you're accessing to your computer with little in the way, others will twist and turn, maybe even go to multiple other cities until they reach you. That impacts latency. Some pipes can also be leaky and when your data &quot;leaks&quot; the server might need to send the data again. This is known as packet loss.</p>
<p>What the speed your internet provider tells you is just how big the pipe coming into your home is and the speed of the internet your computer reports is how big the pipe coming into it is. That has nothing to do with the distances the data has to travel (latency) or the leakage of the pipes (packet loss) and all 3 of these impact how fast a website is loaded.</p>
<p>Also, as you said, on crowded WiFi networks things get a bit more complicated. Imagine the WiFi router as a boss that orders a waiter (the antenna) to fetch and send orders from/to clients (the devices). What you might notice is that if there's a single antenna there's only a single waiter that has to serve multiple devices. So if you start doing a speed test which measures how fast a big file can get to your device the waiter will do a few trips to your client with very big orders. But a meal(website) may have many many small plates instead. So in order to receive all of them you'll have to wait for the waiter to complete the other clients' orders multiple times before your entire meal (the website) is at your table.</p>
<p>There are other things like caching (in the meal analogy, imagine you have a fancy 3D printer for meals so if you feel like eating the same thing you've already had you can make it again without having the waiter serve you), fancier routers with more antennae (i.e. more waiters), ad-blocking (either telling the waiter &quot;don't bring me anything containing gluten(an ad)&quot; or the waiter bringing you something containing gluten but you throw it in the trash immediately), etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It could be a number of factors, but most likely it's due to the number of people using that website. For most parts of the internet, you can think of it like a hose. The more people trying to use it (a website, the internet in your house/location, the internet in your neighborhood), the slower it's gonna be because its trying to deal with more &quot;water&quot; for the same size hose, so what ends happening is it forcibly slows down each person's usage, so each person gets less &quot;water&quot; from the hose but everybody still gets some. In this case, because you're getting 10 Mb speed I'm the cafe, it's most likely due to the amount of people using the website. If it were due to the amount of people in the cafe, a speedtest would show you a lower download speed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
