		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It does get diluted, but the stomach walls just add more concentrated acid back in. Even if you weren't drinking anything, purely solid food is mixed with the acidic liquid-y contents of the stomach and sent on to the small intestine together, so you &quot;lose&quot; acid over time regardless. The stomach would lose its function very, very quickly if it couldn't maintain its contents' proper acidity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a kooky friend who swears alkaline water is healthy because it “helps the liver remove toxins.” I told her I assumed alkaline water simply neutralizes in the stomach.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, proton pumps! The cells lining the stomach contains many proton pumps which can actively sense their environment (say fluctuations in ph) which then respond by increasing the export of H+ ions and eventually restoring the proper ph.</p>
<p>Edit: export not influx</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
