		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, superconductors have a critical current density above which they do not superconduct. The simplest way to think of this is that the current produces a magnetic field, and a strong enough magnetic field shuts down superconductivity, so eventually the current will be strong enough to kill itself.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The is a current density in a superconductor that cannot be exceeded without it losing it's superconducting properties. The current passing through the superconductor generates a magnetic field, but superconductors expel magnetic fields, so you end up with a very strong magnetic field surrounding the superconductor. However the superconductor can only take so much of an external magnetic field, once that field gets strong enough, the superconductor will stop acting as a superconductor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
