		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nope! The Moon is pulling both you and the water equally, so it makes no difference to how you float.</p>
<p>Tides work because gravity drops off with distance. The near-side of the Earth is pulled by the Moon more than the far side. So the water tends to be pulled away from the middle, and piles up on the near side, and falls away to the far side (edit: just to repeat, that's <em>to</em> the far side, ie there are high tides on both opposite ends) - although the exact level of this and the timing of this depends a lot on the local geography. Over thousands of kilometres the difference in the Moon's gravity is big enough that there's a net difference in force, and that makes the water flow.</p>
<p>But if you're <em>in</em> the water, you and the water are in pretty much the same place, feeling pretty much the same force. So you don't really experience any extra force relative to the water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced. Not the mass, the <em>weight</em>, which is the mass times the local gravitational acceleration.</p>
<p>When the moon is locally opposing the earth's gravity, your weight is slightly reduced, as the value of <strong>g</strong> is slightly less than the textbook -9.8 m/s^2. However, the weight of the water your body displaces will also be reduced by the same amount because the same net gravitational acceleration applies to it. </p>
<p>In other words, although the total buoyant <em>force</em> on objects changes depending on the local gravitational field, the total height they float in the water column does not. You would float to the surface more <em>slowly</em>, but reach the same equilibrium height.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The tides are frequently misunderstood. </p>
<p>A glass of water doesn’t rise when it’s a full moon. Tides are caused by the water from a huge portion of the planet being very slightly pulled toward the moon radially. This slight pull leads to the observed tides but only occurs in large bodies of water because the effect only occurs if there’s lots of water slightly effected. </p>
<p>I’m doing a crap job explaining it, but this explains it VERY well. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Floating is a matter of buoyancy.</p>
<p>The moon slightly reduces the gravity along the line between the earth and moon.</p>
<p>Therefore this is a question of how the forces in buoyancy change depending on the strength of gravity</p>
<p>When an object floats, the buoyant force balances the force of gravity.</p>
<p>When gravity changes, the relative weight of everything changes proportionally. </p>
<p>If it is half as strong, you floating in the water weigh half as much, but so does the water you are floating in. </p>
<p>Therefore the buoyancy does not change regardless of the gravity.</p>
<hr />
<p>An interesting thought experiment along this line is to imagine a swimming pool on the Moon, or Mars. Given enough time and development, a hundred or two hundred years from now this will be a reality.</p>
<p>What would it look like, and how would it be different than on earth?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>And difference is going to be negligible. From a technical standpoint, the problem is more complicated than it looks. You'd have several forces working on you:</p>
<ol>
<li>The earth's gravity pulling you down</li>
<li>The moon's gravity pulling you up</li>
<li>Water bouyancy pushing you upwards.</li>
<li>Air bouyancy, for completeness sake.</li>
</ol>
<p>4 is tiny and going to be swamped by any other effects. 3 won't change significantly as the your density and the waters won't be different.</p>
<p>Where things get interesting is the change in gravity. First with the moon above you, you'll be floating at high tide, several metres above low tide. This will have a double impact: You'll be further away from the Earth, lessening it's downward pull, and closer to the moon, raising its upward pull. The moon effect would be much lower, it's a smaller body further away, but both are making you immeasurably more bouyant.</p>
<p>That assumes, in classical physics terminology a perfectly spherical earth (which it isn't) with uniform density (which it isn't - this impacts local gravity). It also assumes perfectly even air pressure - high pressure depresses the sea. Oh and the effect would be bigger ( assuming I'm correct, which is a big assumption) if a solar eclipse was happening overheard at the moon's nearest point, with the earth at perihelion to the sun.</p>
<p>I should point out again,I doubt the difference would be measureable in any practical sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
