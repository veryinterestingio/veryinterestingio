		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Street vendors used to sell popcorn outside theaters during the Great Depression. It was dirt cheap to make and sold for only 5 cents a bag - which made it one of the few treats that cash-strapped people could afford. Eventually, theaters started selling popcorn themselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am not sure about other countries but in Myanmar, popcorn is not the standard movie meal but sunflower seeds are! You can’t hear people popping sunflower seeds until a scene in the movie goes quiet but it’s pretty hilarious hearing all the cracking noises when a theater goes silent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't crunch when you eat it, so it's a nice quiet snack to enjoy without disturbing other viewers. Also they can sell it for more than it costs to buy and pop it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Theaters make most of their money from concessions. Popcorn is very, very cheap for them to buy. It stores for a long time. A handful of kernels fills a whole bag when popped. A lot less messy to clean up than some other snack foods.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
