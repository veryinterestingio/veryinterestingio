		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s because of the hormone cortisol. Your body releases more cortisol than usual when under stress. When you don’t sleep, your body releases cortisol to deal with the tiredness, so you still maintain mental clarity and can get through your day. Cortisol effects last the entire day, about 12 hours, and can make you moody, hungry and anxious. It can disrupt your sleep cycle and mood for days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people have a sleep cycle that is around 90 min long. When you sleep in a multiple of 90 min you get complete cycles and feel rested. If you sleep outside of a multiple of 90 min you will be waking up mid cycle and that can make you feel drowsy and groggy. So multiples of 90 min are 90 min, 3 hours, 4.5 hours, 6 hours, 7.5 hours, 9 hours, etc which means that sleeping 8 hours means you do not have a complete cycle in the last cycle and so is bad. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It could be because of when you are waking up. Sleep is controlled by two systems, the sleep-wake homeostasis and the circadian rhythm. The sleep-wake is pretty simple the longer you have been awake the sleeper you get and the longer you have been asleep the less sleep you get. The circadian rhythm uses hormones to keep you awake when you start to get sleepy because you have been awake too long and it keeps you asleep when you have been sleeping too long. </p>
<p>Generally, a typical rhythm has adults being most sleep between 2 am and 4 am and 3pm to 4pm. If you are an early bird/night owl subtract/add an hour or so (only about 20% of people are true night owls or early birds). If you are a young adult or teenager then your sleepiest times are longer and later too.  </p>
<p>If you woke up during these sleepy times that can make you groggy but that should go away after a hour or two. If it doesn't then you probably aren't getting enough sleep over all or you might have an underlying issue like a thyroid issue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I got this, so when you get 8 hours you get your full sleep cycles (all 5 stages multiple times) however there is a high probability you can wake in the deeper stage of sleep if you aren't consistent as your body makes up for lost sleep, increasing activity during stage 5 (REM), you get a full night's rest. Since you went through all those stages,zero your body is filled with &quot;tiring  chemicals&quot; and doesn't have enough time to return to normal. If are consistent, your body will adapt to even wake naturally after 8 hours.</p>
<p>If you sleep 3 hours or 15 mins, your body does not go fully into stage 4 and 5 or cycles through them already. You are in stage 1-3 (light sleep). We are naturally evolved to become alert when woken early. Your brain releases norephinepherine and inhibits other neurotransmitters that slow bodily functions. It prepares to get deeper sleep the next night.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
