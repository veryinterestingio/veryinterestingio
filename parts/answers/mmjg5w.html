<p>You need 16 percent oxygen to sustain fire, which means we didn't hit that in the atmosphere until about 400-600 Ma ago.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the period when there wasn't enough oxygen to burn there also weren't plants on land so nothing to burn fuel wise. The first land plants appeared 470 million yeas ago, maybe as far back as 500 million for fungi. Free oxygen became common before that, it was the oxygen produced by plankton from the oceans that allowed land plants to develop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not just uncommon, but fire as we know it (a high-temperature reaction between a fuel and oxygen) is relatively young in terms of the age of the Earth.</p>
<p>While the Earth is about 4.5 billion years old, and the first oxygen on Earth about 3.5 billion years old, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/003101829190180Y" target="_blank">oxygen levels in the air had to reach 13%</a> (today it is 21%) before plants would catch fire, which didn't happen until about 450 million years ago. This makes fire about half the age of plants, and younger than many early species of animals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fire, as we know it, didn't exist until early forms of life had increased the amount of oxygen in the air to the necessary level. Can't remember exactly, but it's over 5% I think.
Cool to think that if we're the only planet in our solar system with life, we're also the only planet where fire can exist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
