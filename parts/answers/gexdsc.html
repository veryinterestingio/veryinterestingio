		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most food animals are raised in feed lots which run at 100% capacity and are constantly cycling in new animals as old animals are slaughtered.</p>
<p>You can't really stop the new animals from coming in unless you want to give every animal in your heard an abortion.  So your only option is to just continue slaughtering them as normal.</p>
<p>You can't donate the meat because you don't have the facilities to process the meat.  Its not like meat comes premade as hamburgers or steaks.  It takes a huge amount of work <em>and specialized equipment</em> to turn a cow into a hamburger or a pig into a strip of bacon.  Unless you have the machinery to lift a 1500 pound cow you're not going to get very far just having a cow carcass out in a field somewhere. </p>
<p>There are only a handful of meat processing plants in the country that can actually turn a dead animal into useful cuts of meat.  If those close - which some have - then there literally is no one who can use the meat so you just have to dump it in a ditch somewhere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The long and short of it is that the feed lots are full, and <em>the butcher plants are shut down</em>.  So where do those cattle go?  You can't keep them as the lots are full.</p>
<p>Industrialized meat relies on feed lots, slaughter houses and butchers.  It's the butchers that are about down so they have no place to go after they are killed.</p>
<p>Ideally they could be sent to smaller local butchers but the volume is so large they can't handle the capacity anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are not slaughtering the animal because that implies that they are used for food.  They are euthanize/killed and not used for food.</p>
<p>The problem is not there is no demand meat but that the slaughter and meat processing that would handle the animals is shut down because of ill employees and the risk of spreading the virus. So there are not the people that turn an animal into food.</p>
<p>It cost money to keep animal alive you need to feed them and have the staff to do that. They also have limited facilities and when they up they would need large space and it is not available for pigs, chickens, and another animal that lives in barns.  </p>
<p>The statement of &quot;their&quot; animals it not exactly correct because in many farms raise animals on contract to large companies that slaughter and sell them. They are not allowed to sell them to anyone and are instructed to euthanize them because there is no way to turn them to a product you can sell.</p>
<p>Even if you could give them away it would be a complete animal that is not bunched, intestine skin etc are not removed, etc. I suspect that there is legal health regulation that limits how you can sell the animals and the requirement of training and facilities to turn a living animal into the part you can sell to a consumer. Most farmers do not have the equipment or training to do that according to the laws.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have butchered large animals, not cows but bison and elk.</p>
<p>Getting the animal to a location to start processing is difficult.  We used a front end loader.</p>
<p>Hoisting a creature that is 1,500 lbs or more is a real chore, and without a decent hoist, it is all but impossible.</p>
<p>So, let's say you have your cow up and hanging.  You skin it.  What are your plans with the skin?  Is there a tannery close that could use it?</p>
<p>Now comes the fun part.  You have all sorts of parts - head and the brain, hooves and the offal - lungs, heart, liver, kidneys and the like.  Edible, but highly unlikely anyone would want.  This, btw, accounts for about 40-60 percent of the carcass.</p>
<p>What to do with this?</p>
<p>Okay.  So now we have a hanging carcass.  You need to split it.  Industrial processors use specialized heavy duty chainsaws.  More than likely, you may have a sawsall, and this is not big enough.</p>
<p>Well, we got the carcass split.  Now is not the time to break it down.  It needs to hang for a while - we went two weeks.  Do you have a cooler large enough?</p>
<p>If you cannot see the issues by now, consider one more thing: Even if you manage to get the carcass ready to butcher, you cannot sell any of the meat.  It has not been processed in a USDA approved facility.</p>
<p>TL;DR - Breaking down a cow for steaks is much more involved than most think.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This Tyson facility in Pasco, Washington, processes enough beef to feed 4 MILLION people a day. The article doesn't say how the math is calculated (how many dead beeves does it take to feed a million people)? Is that a 4oz burger or a 12oz steak? Any way you slice it, It's still a mind-blowing number.</p>
