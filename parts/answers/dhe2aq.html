		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a security measure.</p>
<p>Coins used to be a specific amount of precious metal, gold, silver, or copper usually.  People used to &quot;clip&quot; coins, shave off a little bit of the metal to keep then try to spend the coin at its full value.  You do that enough times and all those little slivers can add up.  </p>
<p>Circular coins make this harder to do, as the round shape makes clipping more obvious and you can only take a small amount.  Later, ridges called <em>milling</em> were placed on the edge of the coin to make clipping every more apparent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot; I have founded the society because I believe our Queen is insulted by this heptagonal monstrosity. It is an insult to our sovereign, whose image it bears.&quot;   </p>
