Pain serves a very important function: <strong>&quot;There is something seriously wrong here!&quot;</strong>, and, by extension via operant conditioning: <strong>Better not do that again!/Better stop doing that!&quot;</strong>.  </p>
<p>From an evolutionary perspective you could say that pain responses increase fitness, as they have a higher change of getting passed to the next generation. A human without pain responses will quickly leave the gene pool.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, depending on the scenario, the brain can issue instructions to various glands to secrete things like adrenaline and other powerful chemicals, to dull pain for a period of time, but this is usually a temporary thing, and it kind of has to be. The brain issues pain signals because it believes, as a result of information it gets from the nerves, that your body is in danger of serious and irreparable harm, unless you STOP MOVING AND GET HELP! </p>
<p>For example, if you bruise your arm trying to elbow strike a tree, but your body lets you ignore that pain easily, theres nothing stopping your stupid, idiot self, from continuing to smack on that tree until your arm breaks. Similarly, there is nothing stopping a person with a cut making their situation worse by opening the skin wider, except PAIN. Pain will stop you doing things when your reasoning mind won't, which makes it really effective at keeping people alive. </p>
<p>The problem comes when the brain cannot tell the difference between a pain signal from a healthy nerve that is urgent and incredibly important, and a false positive from a dead nerve, or an unfortunate but unavoidable real signal from a trapped nerve. The reason people have trouble with this part, is that they don't understand the relationship between nerves and the brain well enough. That's not to say you have to be a neurologist to understand this stuff to a useful degree, but you do have to abandon certain preconceived notions. </p>
<p>The brain does not have control over the nerves in the body. Any of them. For any reason. The brain receives information from the nerves in the body, deciphers that information, and sends out chemical and electrical impulses to the various parts of the body, muscles, glands, organs, IN RESPONSE to information from the nerves. The brain cannot, independently and under its normal operation, &quot;create&quot; or &quot;prevent&quot; pain signals being sent by the nerve, OR prevent itself responding to those signals. The brain is often referred to as the control centre for your body, but it really, REALLY isn't. All it does is collect, decode, process, react to and store information that the body provides it with, about its circumstances. All the conscious stuff, the ability to know that this pain is to do with a dead nerve cluster, but that other pain is from a coffee table you just walked into, NONE of that happens in the autonomous brain. That is all CONSCIOUS mind stuff, and your conscious mind has absolutely no ability to hijack the autonomic systems of the body, to switch individual nerve clusters off. None at all. You cannot tell your brain to stop telling you about the pain from the dead nerve cluster, and your brain won't figure it out for itself, because absent the conscious intelligence you have, its just a bag of damp meat in a fluid filled space in your head, that can perform some impressive functions automatically. </p>
<p>If people could just decide that this particular pain is a bug or a glitch in the system, and shut that channel off, it would be great in some situations, and in others, would result in things like people just ignoring pain from rapidly growing tumours, thinking they are just trapped wind or something stupid. That's why the brain doesn't have an override switch, and why you have to go the medical technological intervention route, when dealing with trapped nerves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my mind, that would be like taking the batteries out of your smoke detector because you donâ€™t like the sound it makes when thereâ€™s a fire. Itâ€™s a warning and a call to action - just like pain is. I donâ€™t think it would be wise to turn it off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pain is important, it tells you something is wrong. It makes you care for that area, if you dont feel pain when you are cut there is nothing making you keeping that area safe. In the wilsd this may mean you dig in the ground with your cut, or touch other things. Constantly tearing it open, and introducing bacteria. If you are unlucky you die from that.</p>
<p>Basically, back in the wild people who didnt feel pain would have suffered a higher risk of death due to infection/not healing. If they suffered a higher death risk they would not survive long enough to have a child. If they do not survive long enough to have a child, the genes that &quot;turn off&quot; the pain could not be passed on, so now most people feel pain, since that was a survival requirement, except some few with a condition.</p>
<p>Nowadays however we dont really &quot;need&quot; it all that much, assuming we keep our stuff clean, and dont exert pressure on our wounds. But pain is an indicator something is wrong, and needs to be fixed, and a wound hurting when you touch it is good to indicate that touching/pressuring it will increase the time it takes to heal. This is also why we dislike pain, since if we enjoyed it and actively sought it our survival chances would be lower, leading to those genes responsible for us liking pain not being passed on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
