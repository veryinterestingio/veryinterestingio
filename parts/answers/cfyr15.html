		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Birthmarks have been a little bit of a mystey to us, but we've finally narrowed it down to two main causes.</p>
<ol>
<li>Vascular birthmarks: </li>
</ol>
<p>These are caused when your blood vessels grow in a weird way in the womb, and usually don't last to adulthood. However, if the blood vessels keep growing in that way throughout your childhood, they have the possibility to retain their color.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pigmented birthmarks: </li>
</ol>
<p>Have you ever wondered why you get tan? This is due to a compound called melanin, which has UV protecting properties. This darkens your skin, and also is why darker skin toned people are found closer to the equator--it's evolution's way of protecting you from UV rays.. Now, when you're growing in the womb, melanin can still be made, like freckles. But, instead of being little dots, it's a big patch.</p>
<p>EDIT: Sorry but I turned off notifications for this comment because I simply don't have the time to answer all your questions. I'm really busy rn. Maybe I'll answer more tonight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All the cells/tissues in the body are derived from three germ layers (endoderm, ectoderm and mesoderm) formed when we were inside the womb, which move and migrate to where they should be in a biologically programmed mechanism. However, sometimes this process fails. </p>
<p>In people with birthmarks, a subset of embryonic cells called the neural crest cells fail to migrate to where they should be and remain concentrated in a certain area where they differentiate into melanocytes (or cells that give the skin their color).  This in turn gives these people their “marks”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
