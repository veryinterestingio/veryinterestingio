		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Naloxone is absorbed through the mucous membranes in your nose, if you give it intranasally. At a basic level, it has a higher affinity for opioid receptors than the opioids themselves, but has no action when it binds - it’s a classic antagonist. Because of its high affinity, it takes very low concentrations to achieve its effect in the presence of exogenous opioids. You don’t have to be breathing to get naloxone <em>per se,</em> since circulation is not dependent on respiration, but you do have to have circulation to absorb the drug from the mucosa and perfuse the brain. </p>
<p>If you don’t have circulation, you have much larger problems on your hands, and we’re in the middle of coding you, hopefully. But opiates affect respiratory drive significantly more than they affect cardiac physiology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Naloxone is administered either directly into a vein via a peripheral intravenous line or through the nose via an atomization device where it is absorbed into the bloodstream by the mucous membranes that line the nasal cavity. On paper, the onset of action for most drugs that are delivered via the intranasal route is 1-2 minuets. In my experience administering this drug, a more realistic onset time is closer to five minuets when administered via the intranasal route - there are a variety of factors that account for this, but I won’t dive into that right now. As for the intravenous route, the onset of action is almost immediate, with respiratory drive improving within 30 seconds and the patient regaining consciousness within 60 seconds. So, to answer your question, yes, a complete reversal of symptoms can be quite quick, but it’s not as fast as TV would lead you to believe, especially when administered through the nose, as is often depicted. </p>
<p>As for the second part of your question: why does this even work when the respiratory and cardiovascular systems are so depressed? First, it’s important to understand that drugs like heroin and fentanyl exert much greater effects on the respiratory system than they do the cardiovascular system. A patient who has overdosed on opiates, while nearly apneic, typically  maintains perfectly adequate circulation. The second thing to understand is that the drug itself, even when administered via the intranasal route, is not dependent on respiratory drive for absorption. Unlike medications that are nebulized and absorbed through the lungs, naloxone is atomized into a fine mist which coats and is absorbed through the very vascular mucous membranes that line the nasal cavity. Thus, the patient does not need to breath to get the medication where it needs to be and since the circulatory system remains largely intact, the medication is readily absorbed and delivered to the opiate receptors.</p>
<p>As for how the drug itself works, naloxone is a true opiate receptor antagonist. This means that it is capable of binding to an opiate receptor without actually stimulating it. In simple terms, naloxone blocks opiates from exerting their effects. It also happens that opiate receptors have a much greater affinity for naloxone than they do for opiates. As such, naloxone molecules are able to freely bind to opiate receptors even in the presence of other opiates. So, when the drug is administered in sufficient doses, it blocks the effects of the offending opiates and leads to a once apneic and unconscious patient to become fully conscious and breathing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Naloxone has a higher affinity for opioid receptors so it effectively kicks out the opioid from the receptor and replaces it, reversing the high and respiratory depression. It doesn’t last that long though so you may have to administer multiple doses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bear in mind that it's effect is shorter timewise than heroin (and other opioids), so even if patient seems perfectly fine after a dose of naloxone, they still need to go to a hospital if overdosed. Naloxone effect will wear off and opioid will kick back and this can be dangerous. After initial dose there should be an iv drip to keep levels in blood for longer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
