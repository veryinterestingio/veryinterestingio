		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>[EDIT2] This got a little more complicated the more I did research. So for a 5 year old:</strong></p>
<p>The space station doesn't run out of air because NASA got really really good at recycling the things they already have on the station. They have some magic machines up there that can turn water into air. So then where do they get the water, you ask? From the astronauts pee, from their showers, from their sweat, from the humidity in the air. They turn that gross, weird water into drinkable / air-making-able water. BUT eventually they'll run out. SO they send up a fun little gas called hydrogen (which is a thing that's in water, but way way lighter than water and therefore cheaper and easier to send up) and they combine that with the stuff the astronauts breathe out (CO2) using yet another magic machine that makes water.</p>
<p><strong>Full explanation:</strong></p>
<p>Electrolysis of water (H2O) is the main method to generate oxygen aboard the ISS. Water is split into oxygen (O2) and hydrogen (H2). The oxygen is vented into the breathable cabin air system, known as the Oxygen Generation System, while the explosive hydrogen is vented externally. [EDIT1] Check the edit below, it seems like they don't vent the hydrogen anymore and instead reuse it to make more water.</p>
<p>The station’s football-field-sized solar arrays are the power source to electrolyse the water. Each day the OGS continuously provides between 2.3 and 9kg (5 to 20lbs) of oxygen. The OGS is a component of the ISS life support system, known as ECLSS or Environmental Control and Life Support System, located in the US Destiny module. The Elektron system aboard the Russian Zvezda service module performs the same vital electrolysis service for the ISS crew. The Electron system was also used aboard the Russian Mir Space Station.</p>
<p>Pressurized oxygen storage tanks replenished by visiting unmanned cargo ships provide a backup to the electrolysis method. Finally, the crew can also generate oxygen chemically by igniting Solid Fuel Oxygen Generation (SFOG) canisters comprised of lithium perchlorate. Each canister provides the oxygen needed to support one crew member for one day.</p>

<p>As for where the water comes from, after reading an article on NASA.org, it's mostly recycled. They have systems that efficiently gather all the water. This includes moisture in the air, sweat, urine, and shower water that was unused. <del>There's also apparently another Russian space station that has a large stock pile.</del> They don't usually ship more water from earth because it's so expensive but they can and do sometimes.</p>
<p>The NASA article: <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2000/ast02nov_1" target="_blank"><a href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2000/ast02nov\_1" target="_blank">https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2000/ast02nov\_1</a></a></p>
<p><strong>[EDIT1]</strong> I think the idea is the recycling is hyper optimal and also the water that is recycled is all drinkable. I just read some other article (which I closed out of) which mentioned the water tastes like bottled water, although it came from urine.</p>
<p>Also /u/ubik2 just posted a good explanation of how the system kind of feeds into itself and how they can get around needing to ship up heavy water to the space station.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since 2010, they’ve also been using the Sabatier reaction. That consumes the hydrogen from electrolysis and the CO2 from breathing, producing methane and water (which can then go back into electrolysis). This means you don’t have to keep shipping up a bunch of water. Unfortunately, that reaction needs more H2 than it frees (to make the methane), so we still ship that up. Fortunately, hydrogen is very light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for &quot;where does the nitrogen come from&quot; which is necessary for the air, it seems like they ship that up there (couldn't find any magic processes that produce it).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One system is to have oxygen delivered from <a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geophysics/earth.htm" target="_blank">Earth</a> via spacecraft. This oxygen is stored in external tanks; similarly, these spacecraft deliver <a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/chemistry-channel.htm" target="_blank">nitrogen</a> gas, which makes the ISS air supply.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From <a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/international-space-station2.htm" target="_blank"><a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/international-space-station2.htm" target="_blank">https://science.howstuffworks.com/international-space-station2.htm</a></a></p>
<p>BUT it seems like you don't actually need that for breathing. Super interesting!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nitrogen, a gas that makes up 78 percent of breathable air on Earth, is inert and can therefore be safely stored onboard spacecraft. Despite its high concentration within ambient air, nitrogen serves no particular physiological benefit to humans and only serves to keep the Space Station pressure at 1 atmosphere (14.7 psia). Prior to extra vehicular activities (EVA or space walking), astronauts purge nitrogen from their blood supply to prevent decompression sickness (“the bends”). It is neither important nor practical to reclaim this nitrogen.</p>

<p><strong>[EDIT3]</strong> From /u/acorz on how often they fly out the resupplies (unchecked source but they mention that work at the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/home/index.html" target="_blank">Johnson Space Center</a> aka NASA).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We fly N2 and O2 tanks 2 or 3 times a year. We fly most of our water once a year on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-II_Transfer_Vehicle" target="_blank">HTV</a>. In 4 years, I've only seen small hydrogen tanks for a science experiments, not resupply.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>[EDIT4]</strong> /u/sharfpang has a really <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/b2505l/eli5_how_does_the_iss_never_run_out_of_fresh_air/eiso5j9/?context=3" target="_blank">awesome comment</a> explaining how the Sabatier process isn't actually <em>currently</em> used and that they do actually ship the water up. I'm actually not totally sure this is true but they sounded confident (and <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2010/oct/HQ_10-275_Sabatier.html" target="_blank">this article</a> suggests Sabatier is used). BUT their comment goes into detail with the potential problems that come out of the Sabatier process and some other cool science stuff, so it's worth checking out.</p>
<p><strong>[EDIT5]</strong> Just a funny tidbit in this research is the Russian side of the ISS doesn't actually use their urine in the recycling process, but the US side does. I feel like I read it in a more credible source, but here's just a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/aug/26/us-astronauts-recycled-urine-international-space-station" target="_blank">random article</a> I Googled that says the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>[EDIT6]</strong> Alright back to business. So the plot thickens, /u/sharfpang sourced an <a href="https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/30269/does-iss-get-a-surplus-of-oxygen-or-water#comment90086_30269" target="_blank">exchange thread</a> comment that makes it sound like Sabatier was a &quot;success&quot; which was actually a failure they silently decommissioned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Since I have nothing else to add, here's a fun fact:</p>
<p>You have to heat the venting nozzles before venting otherwise the ice crystals from the rapid change in pressure (i.e. not a vacuum to totally the vacuum of space) will clog them.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
