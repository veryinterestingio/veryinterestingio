		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You cannot grow back <em>nerve cells</em>. Nerve cells have very unique morphology (size and shape), which would be very difficult to recreate. There is a small area in the brain where new nerve cells appear, but it has nothing to do with damage.</p>
<p>However, you can actually grow back <em>nerves</em>. Nerves are not cells, but rather protrusions from cells (called axons). They regenerate after damage. But if the damage is too severe, the nerve will not be able to reconnect with the cell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You actually can. It is a fairly new discovery but neurogenesis is 100% a real thing. It is a very slow process that can be sped up by things like exercise but it happens every single day. The plasticity of the human body is incredible and this extends into the nervous system. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are limited examples of regrowing lost nerve cells. The process is called neurogenesis, and it’s worth a google. The primary difficulty with neurogensis is that cells divide by cutting themselves in half (“binary fission”), and neurons are extremely asymmetric and polarized, so division is impossible. However, some stem cells can mature into neurons, and these stem cells can freely divide before maturation. The exact frequency of neurogenesis remains a matter of intense debate among neuroscientists.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
