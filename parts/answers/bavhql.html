		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a bunch of technologies that will continue to push performance forward for a while:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_circuit" target="_blank">Asynchronous logic</a>. You know how CPUs are clocked, e.g., 3 GHz (3 billion cycles/second)? Using a clock makes it much easier to synchronize and schedule the work the processor is doing. Unfortunately, the clock itself takes power and needs to get routed around the chip, and all of the work the CPU does has to get chopped up into chunks that can get done within one clock cycle. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/401226/its-time-for-clockless-chips/" target="_blank">In 1997, Intel developed an asynchronous, Pentium-compatible test chip that ran three times as fast, on half the power, as its synchronous equivalent,</a> but didn't commercialize it because designing asynchronous logic is much harder.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_photonics" target="_blank">Photonic interconnects</a> would eliminate the propagation delay of signals across the chip.</li>
<li>Exotic semiconductors like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium_arsenide#GaAs_advantages" target="_blank">Gallium arsenide</a>, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/nanoclast/semiconductors/materials/carbon-nanotubes-outperform-siliconbased-transistors-at-the-same-scale" target="_blank">Carbon nanotubes</a>, and even <a href="https://electronics360.globalspec.com/article/11910/high-performance-diamond-semiconductor-devices-coming-soon-akhan-s-miraj-diamond-technology-granted-key-patents-and-trademarks" target="_blank">diamond</a> can be clocked higher than silicon. Silicon has the advantage of being cheap, easy to manufacture, easy to purify, easy to manipulate with &quot;dopants&quot; to change its electrical properties, easy to insulate (SiO2), and being very well understood.</li>
<li>Widespread use of programmable hardware (FPGAs). The CPUs we use today are general-purpose. They are optimized to handle a wide variety of tasks, but truly excel at none of them. Nowadays a computer has lots of fixed, specialized hardware that you use only some of the time to decode video, render 3d graphics, decrypt data, and so on. If instead most of a computer's hardware was reconfigurable, it's as if entirely different chips, optimized to do different functions, can be swapped in and out on the fly.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few avenues available once we can no longer brute Force our way with simply more calculations.</p>
<p>1) more efficient coding.  Figuring out the elegant solutions to problems rather than simply doing tons of small approximations.</p>
<p>Or if you have to approximate (quite common in many situations) you do it with methods that require fewer overall steps.</p>
<p>2) dedicated chips designed to do a specific type of calculations.  We already do this.  Graphics cards are optimized on a hardware level to do certain calculations very efficiently.  Newer ones even have specific &quot;physics&quot; chips to take some tasks away from the main PC to figure out things like light paths, smoke, and fabric blowing in wind.  This can apply to more tasks.</p>
<p>3) parallel processing hardware and software design.  Break a task up to different chips so they all do one small part.  Then organize and deliver it as a whole when they're all done.</p>
<p>Wierd solutions: use radio signals to connect parts of the chips or motherboard rather than wires.  It takes time for an answer to skip from one side of a chip to the other for further communication.  So simply broadcast it wirelessly to use the fastest thing we can: light.</p>
<p>Optical circuits that don't use electricity, but instead use light.  This takes very different materials and processes to make, and it will be some time before it comes to complete with modern CPU on speed, cost and size.  But theoretically much faster.</p>
<p>Moving away from binary coding.  Having only on or off in each piece of information is limiting if simple to engineer and code.  Moving to a system that had more states (trinary with off, on and kind of on) can help with processing speed if done properly.  But also not easily integrated into our current system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few things that can be done. First, architectural improvements. Processors have individual steps they can do called instructions. As time goes on, these instructions tended to be able to executed in fewer clock cycles on average. You can also add new specialized instructions that are useful for certain cases. Intel and AMD processors use the x86 architecture, which provides instructions to do operations such as addition on multiple numbers at once, which can greatly speed up things where many values are operated on the same way. Second, we can add more cores. This can be done by using multiple processor dies or by enlarging the dies to hold more cores. This is what makes a super computer better than a normal computer in basic terms: they use a whole lot of cores which can do many calculations in parallel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a way that is already reached. The clock speed increase a lot slower today the it did in the past so the result was that you started to add more and more cores</p>
<p>Look at  <a href="https://www.karlrupp.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/40-years-processor-trend-625x409.png" target="_blank">40 years microprocessors trend data</a>  and notice how the frequency have remand relative stable since \~2005 Single thread performance have still increased because the designs get better and better .</p>
<p>So when you can't create smaller transistors the rate of speed increase will slow down but you can still improve the speed by changing the design to more do it more efficient.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
