<p>It's called semantic satiation. I don't think we know the real answer, but there are some ideas. One is that repeatedly activating whatever neural patterns represent a word causes the brain to inhibit that pattern. This could happen to the sound itself (the recognition of the sound of the word) OR the actual meaning of the word in the brain. But yeah, I don't think we have conclusive answers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are all sorts of things that happen in your brain to connect a word to its sound, meaning, or an object that you see; these all activate different pathways in your brain. When there are more serious things that go wrong (like brain injury / damage), you can get various forms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphasia" target="_blank">aphasia</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_verbal_agnosia" target="_blank">verbal agnosia</a>. Sometimes focusing on one aspect of a word (like its sound or spelling) makes it hard to activate another aspect of a word (like its meaning or an object it represents), because they emphasize those different neural pathways- it's like trying to consciously pat your head and rub your belly at the same time, when you would normally do these things automatically and unconsciously.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Words are ultimately arbitrary, there's no particular reason for any given word to have a given meaning other than at some point, enough people agreed on it.</p>
<p>Onomatopoeia are somewhat of an exception, but most words have no intrinsic meaning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
