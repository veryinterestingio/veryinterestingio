		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Deltas are formed by the sediment that the river carries with it. This is sand, dirt and mud that is carried down stream with the water. When the water slows down, like it would when it reaches the ocean, the sediment is deposited. Over time this builds up to the point where it starts restricting the river, whereby the flow and pressure builds up to break through part of it. This is a constant balance act between sediment buildup and water pressure/flow. This process keeps continuously repeating everywhere in the delta, resulting in a bunch of smaller flows that will keep changing shape and places over time.</p>
<p>If you for example dug a big canal through the delta, most the water would flow that way. But over time this now fills up with sediment until the water flows out into smaller and easier paths.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a river scientist.  It's called a distributary (as opposed to tributary) system.  Wikipedia does a good job:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributary" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributary" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributary</a></a></p>
<p>Here is a video I made showing how they form.  <a href="https://youtu.be/kiOTvvTWW3o" target="_blank"><a href="https://youtu.be/kiOTvvTWW3o" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/kiOTvvTWW3o</a></a>  It also shows the effect of &quot;base level&quot; control, in this case a drain pipe end the end of the model; in real world this could be lake or ocean level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Mississippi river also splits, forming a large, navigable river called the Atchafalaya, which then runs about 140 miles to empty into the Gulf of Mexico a good distance westward of the New Orleans exit. Over history, the main flow oscillates between the two channels as sediments build up and trigger the switch.</p>
<p>It has been a decades-long project of the Corps of Engineers to maintain the flow in the old, New Orleans channel, through something called the Old River Control Structure. This is becoming harder to do as time progresses, and there might be a day in the future when the mighty Mississippi will be captured by the Atchafalaya. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atchafalaya_River" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atchafalaya_River</a></p>
<p>John McPhee has written an excellent article about the efforts of the Corps to re-shape the planet, in “The Control of Nature”.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
