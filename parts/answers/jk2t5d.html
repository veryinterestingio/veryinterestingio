		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The measles virus can infect memory T-cell and B-cells in the lymph nodes, which erases the &quot;memories&quot; of previous infections. This is called immune amnesia.</p>
<p>However, the lymphoid stem cells are still present in the bone marrow, and they continually produce new T-cells and B-cells. Everybody has T-cells and B-cells that want to attack their own tissues, as well as allergens (like peanuts).</p>
<p>Usually, these T-cells and B-cells are suppressed through a number of mechanisms: thymus selection, clonal deletion, immune checkpoints, Bregs and Tregs. When these mechanisms fail, you get autoimmune disorders. Measles does not correct these mechanisms, so it doesn't cure autoimmune disorders.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
