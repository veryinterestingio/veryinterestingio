		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't apply this to all air fresheners, but one of the more well known ones is Febreeze.</p>
<p>It uses Cyclodextrins that bond to odor causing molecules in the air, and trap those molecules. </p>
<p>This prevents them from triggering odor receptors in your nose.</p>
<p>Below is a link to a Washington Post article that describes it in better detail, and has links to other sources.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes.</p>
<p>Cyclodextrins are cyclical sugars with a hydrophilic exterior and hydrophobic interior cavity. That cavity is attractive to hydrophobic compounds and they will partition to it (forming a complex that is overall water soluble)</p>
<p>My knowledge is based on environmental remediation applications where Cyclodextrins can be used to increase the solubility of compounds 1000â€™s of times, potentially leading to more efficient removal from contaminated soil.    </p>
<p>So the ability to bind with other molecules is indeed a real phenomena that the active ingredient in Febreez possesses. My assumption would be that in the context of odors the binding limits volatilization of Oder causing compounds thus leading to a reduced smell (I.e, neutralizing them). </p>
<p>But someone with commercial product or pharmaceutical experience might be better suited to answer that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are also ozone sprays (ie. Ozium).  Which is 3 oxygen atoms in a molecule. The molecule is highly reactive because of the extra oxygen atom.  This extra atom will bind to the aromatic molecules destroying the odor and the remaining 2 are in a stable bond like the oxygen we breathe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
