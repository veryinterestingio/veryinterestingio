The force of the fall causes arms to swing out and engage with the rails of the elevator shaft and will stop you. It will be a bit of a bump but you won't be harmed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As best as I can find, the last time someone in the US died as a result of elevator failure was 9/11 WTC.  But I think we can agree there was a pretty significant external contributor.</p>
<p>Elevator injuries and deaths are not zero.  but they are relegated primarily to elevator installers/technicians, and for users, its mostly about falling into exposed elevator shafts or somehow getting your body trapped between the car and the shaft.  Much easier to do in old style elevators with gated doors that you have to close yourself.</p>
<p>more likely to trip and fall down the stairs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Firstly there are multiple sets of redundant cables. So if one fails the elevator will just stop where it is at, the failed cable will get replaced, and whomever inspected it last will get fired for not noticing. Even if all cables were to fail the cables are connected to brakes which grab on to rails on either side of the elevator shaft. So as long as the cables are pulling the car these brakes will be disengages but if the cables stop pulling the car upwards the brakes will engage and stop the car in place. Even if this fails there is a buffer at the bottom of the elevator shaft which will stop the car even if going full speed so that people inside the elevator will not get killed. All these systems are inspected and tested regularly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other people have mentioned cable elevators, but most buildings &lt; 5 stories have hydraulic elevators. They are raised by a large piston. Every time they go down they are free falling, but the rate the oil can leave the hydraulic cylinder controls their descent rate. So there is no possible way they can fall any faster.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
