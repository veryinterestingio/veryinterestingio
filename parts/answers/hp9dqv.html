		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It means that the current open positions in derivatives all added together amounts to 687 trillion.  </p>
<p>Derivatives are financial instruments whose value is fully based on the value of something else.  Let's start off where this stuff all really started:  commodities.</p>
<p>In my example I am a pig farmer.  I raise pigs.  It's what I do.  When the pigs are grown I want to sell them for their meat because that is how I make money.   </p>
<p>You are a hot dog maker.  You take pig meat and whatever else goes into your hot dogs and you make hot dogs.  You sell hot dogs for more than it costs you to make them, that's how you make money.</p>
<p>Now we both have an inherent risk.  I will have grown pigs in 3 months.  I do not know what the price will be for my pigs in 3 months.  It could go up.  It could go down.  You will need to buy pigs in 3 months to keep making hot dogs.  You also don't know how much that will cost you.  Maybe the price will go up?  Maybe it will go down?  </p>
<p>So we make a deal today.  You will buy 40K pound of pig meat from me at the end of October for (quick lookup of current price) 49.75K dollar.  No matter what happens between now and then I will owe you 40K pound of pig meat then and YOU will owe me 49.75K dollar.  What we've done is we've both eliminated price risk.  We know in advance what we will get for/pay for that pork.</p>
<p>Now I'm going to skip options as they won't really help in answering the questions...</p>
<p>So now that these contracts exist where people trade commodities (also happens to oil, coffee, wheat, etc.) we want to do this efficiently so we make an exchange for it where people can indicate they want to buy or sell pigs at some point in the future and deals are made automatically.  Great market efficiency!  Good for all!</p>
<p>And then some bankers notice that there is a flourishing trade of pork going on and although they do not have any swine to sell nor do they want 40K pounds of pork on their doorstep, if there is a flourishing trade market somewhere they'll want to make some money from it.  So our intrepid banker at Goldman Lynch or Merryll Brothers or Lehman Stanley or Morgan Sachs or any of them thinks that pork prices will go up by the end of the October because he's heard rumours that Oktoberfest will become a hype in the USA this year and with Oktoberfest comes Bratwurst and Bratwurst is made of pork.  So he goes out and buys a contract for 40K pounds of pork at the end of October.  His buddy at the bank across the street thinks that NO pork prices will plummet because he's read an article in the Lancet that indicates pork is unhealthier than we thought and when this becomes public knowledge pork sales will decline and so the price will as well and he SELLS a future for 40K pounds of pork.</p>
<p>Now at this point there are 2 open contracts for 40K pounds of pork meat at the end of October which means we have 2x49.75K dollar or just under 99.50K dollar in open pork contracts.  Nevermind that only 40K pounds or 49.75K dollar worth of pork is being produced, by me.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you want an actual ELI5, it means that the basis for the math of the derivatives market is $687 trillion  (what is known as the &quot;<strong>notional</strong>&quot;), but what's important to know is that the <strong>actual value</strong> of those derivatives contracts is far less than their <strong>notional value</strong> of $687 trillion, and so the derivatives market is not actually worth (or putting at risk) $687 trillion.</p>
<p>Let's say a banana is worth $1 today - anyone can walk into a market and buy or sell a banana for $1. If today I agree to buy a banana from you tomorrow for $1, then we could say we have $1 of &quot;banana derivatives&quot; in place. However, we've both agreed that a banana is worth $1, so if tomorrow one of us backs out, neither of us cares unless the value of a banana has changed. If it hasn't changed then I can buy a banana for $1 somewhere else, because that's the price of bananas. Similarly, if it hasn't changed then you can go sell a banana for $1 somewhere else. There's no actual value to our contract, despite the fact that we had $1 in banana derivatives (notional value) in place. Not only is our contract not worth its $1 notional value, it's literally worthless to either of us entirely. The $1 is the expected actual value of the banana on the maturity date (and the expected actual value of the dollar itself on the maturity date, technically speaking), but the actual value of the derivative <em>contract</em> is $0.</p>
<p>Our contract gains an actual value if the price of bananas changes over time. If tomorrow the price of bananas is $1.05, then suddenly the contract is worth $.05 to me because it saves me $.05 when I buy the banana. Similarly, it is worth -$.05 to you because it costs you that much to sell it to me for $1 if you could have sold it for $1.05 to someone else that day. So our $1 in banana derivatives is now worth a nickel, instead of nothing.</p>
<p>This plays out across the market. The $687 trillion in &quot;currency and credit derivatives&quot; is the same as the $1 in banana derivatives that we had. In theory, those $687 trillion in derivatives could represent $0 in actual value in those contracts. This is not the case - there have obviously been changes in market values since those derivatives were agreed - but it goes to show that $687 trillion is just a number used for the math. It does not represent the actual value of the contracts themselves, just the number used for math. The contracts will be worth a very small fraction of that $687 trillion.</p>
<p>Edit: Two additional points in a &quot;think about it like you're 10&quot; spirit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parties will enter into derivatives contracts based on what they <strong>expect</strong> the actual value of the underlying thing (here, the banana) will be when the contract matures. So if bananas are worth $1 today but we think they'll be worth $1.02 on our future date, then we'll enter into a contract to buy/sell the banana at $1.02, even though the current price of bananas is only $1. Interestingly enough, this means that the actual value of all derivatives contracts on day 1 is <strong>$0</strong>, regardless of their notional, because the parties expect the price to be the price they've set. Doesn't matter how big the notional value is, on day 1 the parties would say the actual value of the derivatives contract is $0.</li>
<li>The notional value that gets cited does not take into account overall (&quot;net&quot;) position across the market. So let's say we enter into our original $1 banana derivative where you're selling me a banana for $1, but then you separately agree to buy a banana from someone else for $1 in the same way. Now you have agreed to both buy and sell a banana for $1 each on the same day with two different people. There are $2 in notional now, but in reality all that's happening is you're buying a banana from someone for $1 and then immediately selling it to me for $1. Now we have $2 in banana derivatives, but the situation is no different than when we had only $1 in banana derivatives, all that's changed is there's a middle man between me and the original seller. And, again, the actual value of these contracts is $0 until the price of bananas unexpectedly changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I hope it's clear that the notional value of a derivatives market is a VERY misleading way of thinking about what is going on in the market.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you lend someone money, you get money back, because if they let if grow they'll have to pay back even more later, but if there's no &quot;collateral&quot;, something they give you if they can't pay it back, there's a risk that they won't pay it back at all and you'll get almost nothing.</p>
<p>So if you're worried about that, you might get insurance, where you pay someone else some small amount of money, and in return they'll give you money if the person you're lending money to gives up on their debt, so at least you're a bit safer.</p>
<p>And then <em>they</em> might get insurance themselves, from someone else, and someone else might start betting on whether the insurance company will have to pay out, and maybe someone changes their mind about insuring someone and sells the job of insuring them to someone else..</p>
<p>And it creates a huge mass of people making contracts and betting and saying they'll do particular things if some combination of other things happens with the original money that was being lent out.</p>
<p>And that huge mass of contracts are credit derivatives of one kind or another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ha, these answers are so, so far beyond an ELI5.</p>
<p>You can buy a bunch of pigs. Or, go one level higher and buy part of a pig company. Or, go one level higher and buy something that tracks the value of all pig companies. </p>
<p>That last one is an example of a derivative*. If you feel like stopping there, that's all you really need for an ELI5. But if you'd like other examples...</p>
<p>You can buy a plane. Or, buy stock in an airplane making company. Or, buy a derivative that tracks the value of the entire airplane making industry.</p>
<p>Those examples use stocks. Derivatives also work for other things, like debt:</p>
<p>Buy a government bond (that is, lend a government some of your own money and the government pays it back later, with some extra). Or, go one level higher and buy part of somebody's collection of a bunch of different bonds. That's the derivative.</p>
<p>And, to your question, derivatives also work for currency. Currency &quot;markets&quot; would need their own ELI5. But it's the same basic idea. You can have a Japanese yen in your pocket. Or, you can bet on the future value of the yen. Or, you can bet on the future value of a thing that includes every Asian currency. That last thing is the derivative.</p>
<p>*Technically the &quot;buy part of a pig company&quot;/&quot;buy stock&quot; step is also a derivative, but not how the term is commonly used.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A true ELI5: this means that people have created bets on the value of a dollar (or other currency) or the value of a debt. The total of those bets that haven't been settled is 687 thousand thousand million dollars.</p>
<p>A derivative is a bet on the future price of a thing, but is not the actual <em>price</em> of a thing.</p>
<p>The number of things and their value (price) is vastly outnumbered by the total value of the bets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
