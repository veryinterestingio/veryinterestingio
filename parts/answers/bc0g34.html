		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think this needs to be split up into two:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why do plastic wrappers make noise?  </li>
<li>Why do chip bags (and similar) in particular make <em>so much</em> noise?</li>
</ol>
<p>The answer to the first is that the plastics may be smooth, but they're not very soft.  When they're not soft, rather than the material bending when you deform it, it tends to buckle.  That buckling is not a gradual process.. e.g. you can be pushing on the wrapper and nothing happens until you apply just enough pressure that the plastic buckles and very quickly 'snaps' to a new position.<br />
That buckling 'snap' is what you hear.  Worse is that when one part snaps, it may release stress in other areas and those now snap as well, so you get a whole cascade of snaps.</p>
<p>Chip bag manufacturers in particular have been deemed to deliberately make their plastic bags <em>especially</em> prone to this buckling behavior by varying plastics, the thickness of the sheet, etc.  They purportedly do this because a crispy bag connects you psychologically to crispy chips.</p>
<p>Bonus comment content: The rustle/crumpling/snapping associated with these materials is so iconic that people have written algorithms to synthesize them based on simulations of computer generated 3D models <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gue12UjXd5U" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gue12UjXd5U</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Sun Chips released a bag design that had a 95 decibel opening noise. </p>
<p>Reference, an alarm is ~85.</p>
<p>90 is a squeeze toy/subway car</p>
<p>100 is handheld drill/motorcycle riding</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
