		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I like the other answers, but they don't answer this interesting question; &quot;how deep could you dig a canyon on Earth before it collapses?&quot; This is similar to the popular question &quot;what's the highest possible mountain?,&quot; answered very well by /u/CrustalTrudger <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2salhs/is_it_possible_that_a_mountain_taller_than_the/cno29hw/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Let's imagine an idealized canyon with a narrow bottom and vertical walls, like the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/averycarlton/8754834729" target="_blank">Zion Narrows</a>. This canyon cannot be infinitely deep. The further you go underground, the hotter the temperature and higher the pressure. This makes rocks more fluid, so they will squeeze into any convenient void. At a certain depth, they will squeeze the canyon walls until you no longer have a canyon. Hopefully you're not there when this happens.</p>
<p>At what depth do the rocks start deforming? Our deepest drill hole, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Superdeep_Borehole" target="_blank">Kola Superdeep Borehole</a> in Russia, made it to ~12 km before the (unexpectedly) hot rocks made the well sides collapse inwards. The Kola site was chosen for its cold, ancient shield rocks- in most places, the collapse will happen at much more shallow depths.</p>
<p>In general, rock deformation <a href="https://australianmuseum.net.au/learn/minerals/shaping-earth/types-of-metamorphism/" target="_blank">starts at about 5 km below the surface</a>. All metamorphic rocks come from deeper than this. Given that a canyon is a lot bigger than a borehole and thus less stable, 5 km is a good estimate for the depth limit. Add a couple km if you dig it in old shield continental crust, or subtract a couple if you dig in oceanic crust, where 5 km would almost take you to the mantle! If you're digging underwater, add another ~1.5 km for buoyancy. In total, given the right location and an endless budget, you could probably dig an underwater canyon ~8.5 km deep.</p>
<p>To check my work, how does a 5 km aboveground limit compare to the deepest canyons on Earth? Surprisingly similar! Yarlung Tsangpo Canyon in Tibet, sometimes called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canyon#Largest_canyons" target="_blank">deepest canyon in the world</a>, is 5.1 km deep. This canyon doesn't have vertical walls, so it could still be deeper and stay stable. In general, the limit to natural canyon depth on Earth is not rock deformation but sediment deposition. The deeper the canyon, the more rocks and sand will deposit there- making it shallower. Weird tectonic circumstances eons ago might have made a canyon so deep that deformation <em>was</em> the limiting factor to that canyon's depth, but we don't see any of those today.</p>
<p>If you want an 8.5 km underwater canyon, ya gotta dig it yourself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming this is a canyon cut by a river, no more below sea level than the base level of the river (i.e. the elevation of the body of water the river flows into). Rivers tend toward an equilibrium condition referred to as a 'graded profile'. Here is a <a href="https://877792843598943391.weebly.com/uploads/3/7/2/2/37225869/2791268.jpg?581" target="_blank">graphical representation</a> and a classic paper describing the idea of the <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/gsabulletin/article/59/5/463/4217/CONCEPT-OF-THE-GRADED-RIVER" target="_blank">graded profile in detail</a>. What this really means is that on average, a river tends toward a state where it erodes down at the same rate the rocks beneath it are moving up (and/or it moves as much sediment as it deposits in any given place for rivers in more passive landscapes) and the slope that develops at any point along the river is the slope necessary to maintain this erosion rate, given the amount of water (which varies as a function of position within a river system, less at the headwaters and progressively more downstream as the accumulation area increases). What this implies is that a river will not erode below its base level*. So, the only way you would get a canyon below sea level is if the base level of the river that cut that canyon was below sea level (e.g. an internally drained basin that lies below sea level).</p>
<p>*Because AskScience readers love technicalities, the technical exception to this statement would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine_canyon" target="_blank">submarine canyons</a>, which are canyons below the surface of the ocean cut into the continental shelf and typically form down slope of the mouth of a subaerial river (and thus by definition are canyons below sea level). However, it is important to note that these features are primarily formed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbidity_current" target="_blank">turbidity currents</a> and thus represent a very different erosional process than a subaerial river and it's not really correct to consider these as canyons occupied by rivers in any formal sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
