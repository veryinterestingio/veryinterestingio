		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The gorillas Koko and Michael were well known to communicate with each other and their human keepers. They were both originally taught American Sign Language, but as they grew up and signed with each other they adapted the language into Gorilla Sign Language (GSL)

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, it's not true that any ape has ever learned sign language.  Some apes have learned to mimick a limited lexicon of signs, but that would be like you learning 200 words of Spanish and saying you knew the language even though you didn't know what order the words go in or any of the morphology or syntax of Spanish.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even the ability to repeat a limited set of signs is disputed in the case of Koko, as only her keeper could interpret the signs and she never published peer reviewed research.</p>
<p>There are bonobos that have learned impressive numbers of symbols and signs, but again they do not know sign language.  They are unable to combine signs into sentences, or learn morphology or syntax or any number of other characteristics of language.  Other primates seem simply to not have the capacity to acquire human language.  </p>
<p>In all cases, it's pretty difficult to know or prove that apes actually know what the signs they do learn mean in the same way that humans know what words mean.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Only one record of a parrot called Grey (and this is still disputed) exists. He asked &quot;what colour?&quot; when looking at his own plumage in the mirror.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
