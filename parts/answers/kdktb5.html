		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the sensory nerves in the damaged area are still intact and able to transmit signals. </p>
<p>At the same time there's a huge amount of cellular construction work going on as your tissues regenerate, and sometimes a nerve gets triggered by all the activity nearby enough to send a signal to the brain. </p>
<p>It's like living in an apartment where the units above, below, and on either side of you are undergoing renovation. It might go mostly unnoticed, but every now and then someone will drop a hammer or leave a table saw running.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Scabs also itch for a <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/why-do-scabs-itch#causes" target="_blank">reason</a></p>
<p>New skin growth can also cause itchiness. As collagen cells expand and new skin begins to grow on the wound, it results in a scab. When a scab is dry and crusty, it stimulates an itchy sensation.</p>
<p>These  messages of itchiness from your brain are ones that you should ignore.  Scratching a wounded area or picking at a scab can tear new skin cells  that your body is producing to heal the wound. Scratching the itch can reinjure the wound and set back the healing process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
