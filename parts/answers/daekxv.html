		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do you feel students in the UK (as well as the US, if you’re knowledgeable on our coursework) receive an adequate maths education? </p>
<p>How do you think maths educations need to be changed or improved, if at all? </p>
<p>What kinds of projects are you working on with respect to mathematical biology? Are there any projects on the horizon that you’re interested in? </p>
<p>Given the current public distrust of science/scientists (at least in the States, but also abroad as far as I can tell; US source: <a href="https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/state-of-science-index-survey/about-2019-survey/" target="_blank">https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/state-of-science-index-survey/about-2019-survey/</a>) , do you worry that the results of your research, even if they’re groundbreaking, will go unused and mistrusted? </p>
<p>Thanks for doing this AMA!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
