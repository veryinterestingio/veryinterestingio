		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple theories but the most accepted one is that it allows the song to travel farther. The morning air is cooler and drier, meaning sound can travel at a higher range.</p>
<p>As for why they are singing it's likely male birds establishing their territory and warning other males away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the morning, birds often sing to establish their presence. There are many species of birds that are considered “nest parasites” and will literally steal viable nests when the nests original inhabitants aren’t present. This often happens  at nighttime, so in the morning birds often call and sing as though to say “I’m still here!!! This is still mine!!! My shit wasn’t stolen last night!!!”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes a bright moon will rouse them. Also, astronomical twilight can be an hour and a half before actual sunrise.</p>
<p>All it takes is a wee bit of light and birds want to get busy. </p>
<p>If the weather is cold they usually wait until later, though.</p>
<p>Could also be a predator is after them. If a group of birds get raucous, it could be there's a hawk in the vicinity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
