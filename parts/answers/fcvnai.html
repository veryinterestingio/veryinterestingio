It can't tell you the global shape of the field in a single measurement. A compass needle doesn't know whether it's in a field generated by a monopole, a dipole, a quadrapole, or whatever moment you want to pick. It just says &quot;the field line right here points this way&quot;. To tell the global shape of the field, you would need to <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/BIj5Ec4lDE06TvDFkgEVBBCKsPVnsu3eHxoQV2X8uELQD9AaNyAW12mQkFVRfLkOEdjp3IEWA_kC0LpepSMkmr2iBuR8G3yxKBX58VKV1qoklsV32lC6xgCQ8RO_eA" target="_blank">take several such measurements in different places</a>, at which point you would be able to tell if you had a monopole or a dipole by the curvature of field lines.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that magnetic monopoles that you could walk around with a compass to measure field lines don't exist in nature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
