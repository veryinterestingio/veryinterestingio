		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your idea (although good) doesn't work. As a good approximation (say consider the earth and moon as a &quot;single&quot; body in relation to the sun), then it might be &quot;good enough&quot;. But if the three bodies are relatively significant in mass (and distance) to each other this is not a general approach that works. </p>
<p>Computers don't &quot;solve&quot; the problem algebraically but (generally) are used to simulate by stepping through time in small time increments. Given an &quot;n-body&quot; problem (position and velocity) at time 0, it is possible to calculate using a very small &quot;delta t&quot; a good idea of what the position and velocities of the n bodies are at t = 0 + delta t. Then using this new data as the initial set, calculate the next set of positions and velocities at t = delta t + delta t. The results can be arbitrarily accurate for arbitrarily small delta t. Of course the smaller the delta t the more calculations need to be done so this is really only practicable using computers. </p>
<p>TL;DR the computer doesn't simplify - it just does time simulation and derives a solution using brute force calculation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The problem in your example is that the center of mass between A and B moves with respect to C. </p>
<p>In a 2 body system, the center of mass never changes. You cannot define a fixed center of mass for an arbitrary system though - you can't break it into static subunits except in specific situations.</p>
<p>The way computers solve this problem is not by analyzing a closed solution. A closed solution is an analytical expression of how the system behaves. You give an input (ie. starting conditions and time) and it gives you an output (ie. position and velocity of bodies at that time). In fact, Poinclaire proved that this is not possible to have an exact solution in analytical form.</p>
<p>In general, a way to solve arbitrarily large system like this is not solved by the analytical form. Instead, you have an underlying set of physics (ie newtonian gravity) and you have the initial starting points and velocities of the objects. You then chop up time into little tiny segments. For ever little bit of time, you can calculate the forces on one of the objects from all the other objects in the system. Then, you move the object according to the amount of force calculated for that period of time. Once the period of time is over, now you recalculate all the forces again and move it. </p>
<p>As long as the chosen time segment is small enough, you will converge to as if you were doing this calculation continuously - moving and recalculating and moving infinity fast. This converges to the true solution of the system. The upside is that this is a way to solve any well defind system. The downside is that it is extremely computationally expensive, especially for long timescales. You cannot jump ahead in time using a method of solution like this, and errors will stack up over time. </p>
<p>For specific systems there are other, more clever ways of solving the problem but this is a basic method of chopping up a well described physical system into bite sized chunks that a computer can solve rapidly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is the difference between an analytical and a numerical solution.   </p>
<p>For the 3 body problem:</p>
<p>An analytical solution gives you an equation(s) that tell you the position and velocity of all three particles and any time t. This equation(s) contains the variables for the initial position and velocity and the time of the where you are. It is also exact.   </p>
<p>A numerical solution, takes as input the initial position and velocity and the time of the where you are and then tells you the position and velocity of all three particles at time t. It does not give you an equation for the solution, and if you want a different time or a different starting parameter, you have to resolve the whole thing. The result also has an error. The error depends on the algorithm used for ht esoution and the processing time. Typically the error is very very small when solved on modern computers.   </p>
<p>Numerical solutions are often used when you know what the initial conditions are. Thus they are heavily used in engineering.    </p>
<p>Analytical solutions are more commonly sought after by scientists.   </p>
<p>For example, say you wanted to know how the average distance between particles 2 and 3 changed as you changed the mass of particle 1.  With an analytical solution, you could take the partial derivative of the equation for the average distance between particles 2 and 3 with respect  to the mass of particle 1. And just like that you have the solution for all masses of particle 2 and 3, and all starting conditions.   </p>
<p>If you were doing this numerically,  you would have to rerun the numerical solution changing each variable a tiny amount each time to get the same amount of information. And then cycle through all possible combinations of tiny changes. This rapidly becomes extremely time consuming to compute.   </p>
<p>Unfortunately an analytical solution to the 3 body is not currently known. This isn't too big an issue for specific cases as you can just solve it numerically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Problems can have two type of solutions: exact or approximate.</p>
<p>Exact solutions are only possible when there are equations that perfectly describe the problem, to the smallest detail. In that case, you input the necessary variables, and the perfect solution is given. Exact solutions are usually available for simpler problems or simpler conditions. Every equation you have used in your life is an example of this, such as how to predict where a projectile will land based on it's initial velocity, or how a simply supported isotropic beam deforms for a given applied force. </p>
<p>In various real time scenarios, these equations do not exist. So to solve that problem, an approximate solution is used. To reach that approximate solution, numerical analyses are performed. Numerical analyses consist in dividing your study domain in very small chunks (this can be time, if you are studying what happens over time, or material, if you want to study how a complex structure, such as a car, deforms when it crashes, etc.). The numerical problem then consists in solving a big, but solvable, system of equations, iteratively (as in, taking the result of the last step and applying it for the next step). Those system of equations use constitutive equations, which are ways to describe how your variables in the system behave, and also take into account the forces applied to the variables. In the end, you get an approximate solution. Several factors can be adjusted to give you better results, such as refining the size of the chunks you are using, improving the constitutive equations that describe the variables under study, or having more powerful computers running the simulations for longer, leading to higher convergence.</p>
<p>You might think numerical solutions are inferior to exact solutions, in that they are only approximate (so, an error between such solution and the theoretical exact solution exists) and thus should not be trusted. While that is technically true, for most real problems, that error can be controlled and is one of the requirements for the solution to be acceptable. </p>
<p>To give you an idea of such acceptableness, we can use the <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/news/2016/3/16/how-many-decimals-of-pi-do-we-really-need/" target="_blank">famous story about NASA only using 15 digits of PI for their calculations</a>: calculating the circumference of a circle that is 25 billion miles in diameter leads to a difference on the circumference result of 1.5 inches (less than the length of our pinky finger) if we use an approximate PI value (instead of using all the decimal cases we have). You'd think calculating something as massive would require a more exact approach, but it is often not really necessary to have more exact solutions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not that we can't solve the three body problem, we've been able to do that for centuries, at least for certain cases. It's that we can't solve the <em>general</em> three body problem <em>in closed form</em>, because the n-body problem is chaotic for n&gt;2. Computers don't (generally speaking) solve physical problems analytically, though. Computational modeling of physical systems is done almost entirely with numerical methods. Using numerical integration you can approximate the solution to the PDE that governs the n-body problem to arbitrary precision (obviously at the expense of cpu cycles and memory footprint).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
