		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They make a new queen.</p>
<p>The queen emits a pheromone that helps to keep the hive in check.  When the queen dies, the pheromone stops and the worker start the process of making a new queen.  They build special chambers for a small number of larvae and feed said larvae royal jelly.  The first of these larvae that emerges kills the others, and it becomes the new queen of the hive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The queen bee constantly release chemicals called pheromones when it's alive. When workers bee do not sense the pheromones of a queen in their hive, they go into a emergency mode to try and replace the queen.</p>
<p>Queen and worker bees all start out as the same larva. The only difference is that future queen bees are raised in special cups and are exclusively fed queen jelly made by worker bees. When the current queen dies, the workers will select a few larva to be raised as the future queen. The earliest queen that emerges will kill all the remaining queen larva. If more than one emerge, they will fight until one is alive.</p>
<p>The queen's pheromones also work to block the worker bee's ability to lay eggs. Without this pheromone, the workers will start laying eggs. The unfertilized eggs of worker bees will all develop into drones, male bees. Drones will be raised to fertilize the new queen. However, if there is no new queen, the workers will keep producing drones. Drones themselves don't do any work so eventually, without a queen, the hive will collapse since there are no new workers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If there are already eggs laid, the colony will then take one or more of them and create what are called Queen Cells. They will provide special treatment to the larvae that emerge in these cells, which causes them to develop into queens. Eventually they will emerge and either battle it out for control, or some may leave with part of the colony to form another (assuming the colony is quite strong). The winner will go out and mate with a drone, then return and start laying eggs.</p>
<p>Basically, as long as the colony is strong enough and there are viable eggs, they will make a new queen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The hive often makes queen cells which the queen grows in, and is fed royal jelly. As a beekeeper you check to see if any are being developed as it shows the hive is over crowded (so you add a new store or level) or the existing queen is too old and her pheromone is loosing its strength. </p>
<p>The problem will be it takes about 27 days (i'd have to check) for the new queen to emerge, which means the hive has had no eggs for 27 days. As a bee gets older its role and duties change, and during the summer live for about 42 day, so you will have lots of bees coming to the end of their life and the new ones not filling in all the roles. If they have enough honey stored they will be fine.</p>
<p>Beekeeping is incredibly fascinating, really worth doing, incredible organisation etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During the life, the queen constantly lays eggs.</p>
<p>Once the bees no longer detect the smell of a queen, they will start producing special jelly to feed to larvae's, those larvae will grow out to a new queen. The first thing a new queen does, is search the nest for other queen larvae, and kill them, so she is the only leader.</p>
<p>Beekeepers can test if an hive is missing an queen by placing another queen trapped in a cage in the hive, and watching the reactions of the bees. If the bees <a href="https://youtu.be/qXVVOn5uZCY?t=85" target="_blank">want to attack the new queen</a>, they still think the old queen is still there, if they <a href="https://youtu.be/_1FCLxCgu1g?t=69" target="_blank">just want to surround the new queen</a>, the queen is accepted</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
