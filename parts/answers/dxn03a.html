		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, don't do that. It's bad for your hearing. Covering up a loud noise with a louder noise is a bad idea. Wear proper ear protection! If you still want music, get some good over the ear muffs and put your earbuds underneath and running at a safe volume. Or get good noise cancelling headphones.</p>
<p>Anyway, your ears try really hard to protect themselves against loud noises. When there is loud noise, small muscles in your ears can pull tight against your ear drum and the bones of your inner ear. This causes the drum to be taunt and the bones to move less, so less sound is transmitted to your delicate cochlea. It's kind of like your ears' version of the irises in your eyes.</p>
<p>When you're mowing the lawn, the mower is really loud and causes your ears to take those steps to protect themselves from it. That makes both the mower <em>and</em> your loud music seem less loud. Without the mower running, there's <em>less</em> loud noise so those muscles relax a bit and let more of the loud music through, which makes it painfully loud.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can get the same effect with all your senses. Any drastic change from “norm” feels painful. For instance, consider when you just wake up in a dark room and turn on the lights or slowly warming up water in the shower to max vice waiting till max and jumping in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is how I got tinnitus.  I purchased some hearing protection headphones that also played the radio.  I cranked the radio as I worked with loud power tools. I now have what I am told is a permanent ringing in my ears.   It's been a year and a half of non-stop, high pitched tone, every waking moment, and I'm told I will have it for the rest of my life.  I warn everyone who will listen about about playing headphones loud.  r/tinnitus is full of people suffering from this.  Daily new people log in to that sub for the first time with great anxiety and regret.  I remember my first post there and how scared I was.  </p>
<p>We think it will never happen to us.  It can.  Please be aware</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You perceive it more painfully because the greater the contrast, the greater the perceived effect. Loudness is a subjective measure, so it leans to psychology, psychophysics specifically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your ears adjust their sensitivity based on the volume of sound they're getting. I think it's called attenuation. So when you already have the mower on your sensitivity is very low and the headphones don't seem that loud. But in silence your sensitivity is high and the headphones sound that much louder.</p>
<p>Sound volume is exponential, meaning a perceived increase in volume is actually multiple times more intense in terms of the energy of the sound wave, or even orders of magnitude greater. Your ears have variable sensitivity so that you can perceive something as quiet as a whisper all the way to something thousands of times louder, like a jet engine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
