		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When  you are hungry your body releases a whole bunch of hormones to get your body to metabolize stuff in to glucose, to feed your cells.  Two of these (epinephrine and cortisol) hormones also happen  to be  our &quot;stress hormones&quot;.  So...when hungry you're likely act like  you do when &quot;stressed&quot;,  which...is...irritable!</p>
<p>edit:   fixed the spelling of &quot;epinephrine&quot;.  Thanks /u/Zero_the_Unicorn .</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned already, stress hormones epinephrine and cortisol are released, but you’ll also notice something else. When you’re hungry your senses seem to sharpen (due to these chemicals), which would make you more likely to forage for food and hunt for something to eat back in the day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part is neuro anatomy: the part of your hypothalamus that lights up when you’re hungry is right next door to the part that lights up when you’re angry. </p>
<p>Also diet/addiction: most people have diets high in sugar and you start having withdrawals when your glucose levels drop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
