		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it this way: ever since you were a child, you were experimenting with the way you interact with others - when something works, you get a reward -, think of a child who cries and gets a candy bar to stop crying. Eventually that kid will learn that crying = candy. Now, apply that same logic to more complex social dynamics: You do someone a favor, you get something back. That person's friend doesn't like it, you lose some. Eventually that becomes &quot;person has friends = loss&quot;. So after a life time of similar experiences, you start feeling entitled to your rewards, which makes you ignore the harm you're causing through a false sense of fairness and reciprocity. The factors that can keep you from getting that reward are usually the same, so the &quot;abuse tactics&quot; people develop will end up being the same as well, since they work best.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of it is an instinctual play on innate human behavior patterns and some is learned behavior. It seems to follow the same manual because these behaviors work. There’s always an unsuspecting person to try the behaviors out on and each time an abuser does, they get better at using these behaviors to manipulate others. It doesn’t take a lot of experience to hone in their skill because they’re playing on natural human needs and inclinations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People tend to trust those more whom we have more faith and reliance on. So, someone over time can literally curry favor with another person through interactions and help, along with slowly send messages about their importance in that individual's life. Those messages can turn into ideas which turn into beliefs which turn into intrinsic faiths. </p>
<p>The human mind can be thought of as a web of experiences and situations that lead to influencing behavioral patterns. This is why some cults have &quot;drank the koolaid&quot;. Once you have someone's full belief and faith, they'll follow you like a god walking on the earth.</p>
<p>This isnt the only way, but I assume you wanted a rationale for the Hollywood-Stockholm Syndrome idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is what is proven to work. It is a bit like digging a ditch; everyone across the globe use a shovel to do that and none of them are copying it from each other. That is just what is found to be working. Separating the partner from anyone who threatens the codependency is logical for the abuser; they would, in time, make the partner ditch them. All of the gaslighting that happens are logical steps, it works and that creates a feedback loop.</p>
<p>And also: while they look to the outside similar, each abuse case is different and unique.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s an almost instinctual thing. It stems from narcissism. There are very few people who actively think about how they can and are manipulating people. This being said those few people who do start learning at an early age and grow over time via trial and error and sometimes even the study of psychology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
