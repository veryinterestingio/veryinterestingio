<p>If it was 140 hz you would have some weird possibility such as 20 frames showing for 7 cycles (which wouldn't sync with cinema), or stretching some frames for more refresh cycles to make 24 frames last 140 cycles (instead of showing each frame for 6 refresh cycles). 150 would have a similar issue.</p>
<p>144hz was the most sensible choice because each frame can be shown for 6 refresh cycles, and it can be split in half for 3 refresh cycles for each eye if used for 3D.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh boy. 3 comments and 3 different answers. None of which are entirely accurate, but each contains some of the reasons.</p>
<p>So long story short, 144Hz is just the perfect nexus of a lot of happy accidents.</p>
<p>Firstly, it is divisible by 24Hz where the 120Hz standard is a factor of 30Hz. You'll generally find these two factors behind most monitor refresh rates. Sometimes you'll find oddball refresh rates, but they don't ever catch on. 24 and 30 will be the two factors you'll find as one is the traditional framerate of film and the other is the traditional framerate of television. You scale upward from there. EDIT: I just want to note that there's absolutely no other reason to use framerates divisible by 30 or 24. There's no inherent benefit from them. It's simply adhering to traditional standards.</p>
<p>Second, 144Hz brings you under the 7ms pixel response time. 6.9ms to be a little more specific.  (1000ms / 144 = 6.944...) This means you can get the full benefit of 7ms response time LCD panels. (This isn't something I'm intimately familiar with so I hope I'm explaining it properly. Just going by how it was explained to me.)</p>
<p>Third was bandwidth limitations. I'm unable to find the original source for this at the moment so I'm going by memory. At the time that 144Hz monitors began appearing on the market the bandwidth limitations were in that same range. You couldn't really push much more information to the monitor and because of points 1 and 2, 144Hz was settled on. EDIT: Someone below put in the actual technical specs that backs me up on this: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/kzbt1h/eli5_why_are_monitors_144_hz_instead_of_a_flat/gjo6r13/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/kzbt1h/eli5_why_are_monitors_144_hz_instead_of_a_flat/gjo6r13/</a>  tl;dr: The maximum refresh rate of a 1080p image at 24-bit color depth is 159Hz. 144 was picked because of the first two points because it's the nearest &quot;standard&quot; refresh rate.</p>
<p>There's also anecdotal accounts that overclocking of displays landed on 144Hz because it is exactly 20% faster than 120Hz and was the sweet spot for overclocking. Of course there's absolutely no concrete evidence that I could find. Mainly just going by what people say worked for them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>DVI dual link max data rate is 7.92Gbps.</p>
<p>7.92G/1920/1080/24(bit per pixel)=159</p>
<p>The closest number that divisible by 24 (somewhat &quot;standard&quot; framerate) is 144</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
