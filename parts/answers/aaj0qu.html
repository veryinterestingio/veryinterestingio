		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey all, non-directed living donor here. I made the decision to donate to a stranger for my 30th birthday. I’m so glad I had the opportunity to do so. It’s been 2 years since my donation surgery and I’ve not experienced any adverse health effects. I’ve become quite close with my recipient and will always view him as one of my closest friends. One of the downsides I could potentially see, especially if you’re a non-directed donor, is that once you make the decision to donate, you can’t control the choices your recipient may make in the future.  As has been said, the donation process is a surgery involving total anesthesia and there is always some risk associated with any surgery. Also, the recovery process can be painful as the abdominal muscles they cut through are used for almost every movement. Coughing and sneezing are especially painful for a few weeks. Lastly, the donor is left with some gnarly-looking scars on their abdomen. Overall though, I would absolutely do it again if I had the opportunity. In complete transparency, knowing that I did something so life-altering for my fellow human gives me a massive ego boost. Feel free to reach out to me directly if you have more specific questions about the donation process. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you’re planning to get pregnant there’s evidence that having one kidney increases your risk of developing hypertension and preeclampsia <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5425635/#!po=42.1875" target="_blank">(source)</a>. This is supported by another article I found (reference 2 in the linked paper), but unfortunately it’s behind a paywall. Pregnancy is extremely stressful to most of the body’s systems, kidneys included. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2747242/?report=reader" target="_blank">This article</a> equates the stress of pregnancy on one kidney to the stress of having twins or triplets with two kidneys.</p>
<p>There are also downsides to the surgery itself and the recovery afterwards, though those outcomes are usually good.</p>
<p>All that said, living donation is the safest form of kidney transplantation and has the best outcomes. If you have more questions my partner is a kidney transplant scientist; we’ll be happy to answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The biggest long term issue is needing to be more careful with things like high blood pressure, medication, etc since you're working with only one kidney. Your resilience is diminished since efficiency is reduced by only having one kidney.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Donated my kidney 6 months ago, and so far not much has changed. I'm in my 20s and in pretty good shape, so I recovered quickly. No heavy drinking, no ibuprofen/aspirin - and that's pretty much it. I also have to go in for yearly checkups (something I didn't do before) to keep an eye on my blood pressure. Having one kidney doesn't <em>increase</em> your risk of hypertension, it just makes things go awry faster if it does happen to develop.</p>
<p>EDIT: Hell, I'll evangelize on here. I have absolutely no regrets about the procedure and would encourage anyone interested to check it out. Google your regional hospital network, find out if they have a transplant program, and email them. That's how I got started, and they give you plenty of points along the way to back out without judgement. My recipient was 21, and if all goes right, will be with her new kidney through her 40s. She can have a career, get married, travel, start a family - whatever she wants to do, all because I had a kidney to give. 10/10 would donate again if I had another one</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we get older our organs stop functioning as effectively, and a lot of medical conditions affect the kidneys negatively, such as diabetes and hypertension. When you're young and healthy it doesn't matter as much, but when you get older having one kidney could have a detrimental effect on your health. </p>
<p>As far as function, your remaining kidney grows in size to compensate for the loss of the other one, by roughly a 1/3 in size and function.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
