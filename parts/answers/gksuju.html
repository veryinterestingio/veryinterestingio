		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was talking with my husband about it yesterday! I have to pass a Math exam so I can continue to study my career,  I started in the morning and by the time he came back from work (5pm) I was extremely tired! I have to learn by myself things that I never saw in my life, and without a teacher I feel extremely pressure.
But I must approve this exam and two more. And I NEED TO UNDERSTAND everything :'(</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think when we are concentrating on something, we are not aware of the muscle tension, strain, and fidgeting our bodies are doing.  I have a habit of clenching my jaw and bouncing my leg when sitting at my desk. I don’t notice I’m doing it, but co-workers have pointed it out to me.  By the end of the day, my face hurts and my foot cramps.  I’m not dismissing the fact that the brain consumes energy, I just think we are more physical while sitting than we notice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
