		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They generally didn't. Though it depends on how bad your eyesight was. If you could see mostly clearly you likely wouldn't be in the military except for time of crisis (they usually didnt take the disabled or infirm). Though with a lack of automation if you learned a skill you could do by touch, such as weaving or pottery and the such you could likely find work. Most would have stuck near family for the support (and since the average person didnt do much traveling anyway)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
