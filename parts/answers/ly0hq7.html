		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Individual virions contained 24 Â± 9 S trimers (Extended Data Fig. 1b). This is fewer than previous estimates that assumed a uniform distribution of S21, because S was not uniformly distributed over the virus surface. A small sub-population of virions contained only few S trimers whereas larger virions contained higher numbers of S trimers.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Coronavirus are what's referred to as Positive Strand RNA viruses. What this means is that the virus genetic material comes ready to be translated into protein. But that would mean that their single long &quot;genomic&quot; script would only make 1 protein. They get around this by coding for their own RNA polymerases that read at multiple subgenomic regions. These polymerase are also not made at the same time, the virus translates proteases that cleave the long strands of protein to smaller functional proteins.</p>
<p>At the very end of all of this, are the structural capsid proteins that include the spike protein. You can imagine that different effective rates of all the proteases and polymerases I discussed (there's also the speed in which trans cleavage occurs) that you're going to get some variability in the rate that the spike protein will be made according to the number of capsid proteins made (which is always the same). Especially since at the final step, the viral genome is just stuffed into the available capsid and there's no real &quot;counting&quot; system established for how many spike proteins are on it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
