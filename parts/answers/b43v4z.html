<p>The heat coupled with the acidity breaks down whatever you got stuck to your pan faster than just water and heat would.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On a physics level when something is acidic it is trying to loose hydrogen ions. This means that there is a lot of kinetic energy involved for vinegar to get rid of the ions especially if itâ€™s being heated. Because when something is heated the molecules are moving very rapidly. Combo this with water which is a natural solvent and the kinetic energy from your hand while cleaning it and you can clean whatever is on the pan a lot faster. </p>
<p>Simply put: It is a lot easier to clean a pan when there is a lot of energy and movement involved. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
