		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The conditions for it to happen are extremely rare. First, the organ suffers in the transplant process , so to consider an already transplanted organ to be suitable for donation would be rare cause its probably accumulated some damage. It will depend on the organ tho. Liver or lungs or heart Id say its not worth the risk in most cases, and I have never seen it happen. You have to think that they are such big surgeries and cause scarring, making the surgery more difficult a second time, and patients in many cases are in an end stage of failure, that the new organ will also suffer some damage at a more increased rate than a normal organ. The other condition would have to be, a patient that received a transplant, that fits the conditions to be a donor, and that itself is low in probability. </p>
<p>The only ones I know that can happen are live donor kidney, cause they suffer very little, and are transplanted in an almost healthy recipient , so that kidney could be used again in a very special circumstance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A transplanted organ is never an identical match to the recipient. The recipient immune system therefore attacks the transplanted organ. This is usually combated by immunosuppressive drugs, but the effect is still there.</p>
<p>Better to use a &quot;fresh&quot; organ that has not yet been subjected to such a hostile environment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Never happened in my transplantation center in Zagreb, Croatia, and we have one of the best kidney transplant programs in Europe, because we transplant a lot of kidneys so the waiting list isnt's as big as some other countries in Europe, and also have high criteria for organ quality parameters. I know a few patients that had a transplanted kidney for 30 yrs, but these are rare. And the  transplanted patients usually die of cardiovascular disease or other causes (infection...) in the end with a functioning organ, but the organ isn't reused because I doubt it would pass the Remuzzi criteria/pretransplant biopsy criteria.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
