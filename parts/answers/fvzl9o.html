		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing that has come up in this pandemic is flaws or issues with cruises. Not only did COVID spread incredibly quickly among cruise staff and guests (which we’ve seen before with things like norovirus outbreaks), but multiple countries have turned cruise ships away if they have sick passengers. A bunch of cruises in the Americas have decided to head to Florida, to an area that is already dealing with a lot of COVID cases. </p>
<p>How do cruise lines typically prepare for large-scale medical emergencies? Do they normally have agreements for care in local ports if on-board care isn’t enough? You mention studying the impacts to destinations – does a situation like this get considered? Is the reaction expected or unexpected?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
