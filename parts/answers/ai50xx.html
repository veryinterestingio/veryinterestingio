		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're talking about going to an unfamiliar place, it's because the brain is processing a lot of new information and is thus more aware of itself and the passing of time due to its heightened alertness. On the trip back, the brain recognizes most of these cues, and is thus in a lighter stage of alertness and less aware of every detail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think this is a necessary universal feeling but i'll put my 2 cent in.</p>
<p>On the way there you're probably excited and therefore it feels longer because your anticipation makes time feel slower.</p>
<p>On the way back you're probably tired so psychologically you probably wouldn't have the same awareness of time as you would when going there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually think it’s the opposite. On the way, I’m already on vacation mode. Every song is fun to listen to. Every conversation is funny, etc. On the way home, it’s just a constant dreadful build up to “back to reality”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On the way there is all new experiences. Your brain is paying attention and makes a note to remember it.</p>
<p>On the way back you’re rehashing stuff so your brain is more on autopilot and only logs things you didn’t see on the way out.</p>
<p>Repeat the route often enough and your brain barely bothers to register that you made the trip - see “highway hypnosis” where people can safely complete a journey by car and at the end of it have virtually no memory of anything that happened on the trip. Once your brain is familiar with the route it just ignores the specifics of each journey unless there’s new information that important or majorly out of the ordinary - if there’s a forced detour because a road is closed that you need to know for the next time, or if a semi truck has a spectacular crash. That sort of thing. But uneventful familiar journeys - not worth the neurons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
