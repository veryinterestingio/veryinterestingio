		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are single unit washer-dryers, mostly popular in Europe, but I have one in Canada too. It takes longer to dry, and while it’s drying you can’t simultaneously wash another load for example, so that might be the convenience consumers are looking for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do have combo machines but it makes sense to keep them separate.  Washing machines need to be water tight.  Dryers need to be the opposite and have good airflow through them.  It's possible to make a combo unit, but it's more prone to reliability problems and more expensive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Where I’m from (Poland/Europe) combi-machines are very common. I put a load in and set it for wash, then it dries that load immediately after.
Maybe in America where you have larger houses in general people just get two machines but I personally don’t see a need and haven’t found my washer/dryer lacking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Washer drum needs to hold water, and might have small, valved (complex) openings for dryer air.  A dedicated dryer will have large drum vents to dry faster, no need to contain water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
