		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Emergency Alert System (EAS) functions like ripples in a pond. The alert initiates from a warning point, then its message is issued by a broadcast station called an LP1. The voice is auto-generated from the text of the alert by various EAS encoding systems, which greatly saves time in an emergency.</p>
<p>Other broadcaster stations monitor the LP1 station and automatically record/repeat the alert onto their on-air broadcasts and repeated at the next level of listening stations.</p>
<p>The system works like a game of 'telephone.' Each station listens and passes along the alert, so each new generation of the message is a copy of the original. That is probably what you may perceive as static or distortion.</p>
<p>Source: I managed an EAS program at the state level for emergency management for several years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The garbled stuff at the beginning works kinda like modems did.  Remember all the modem screeching?  Those work like that.  I am assuming the 'bleats' are designed to not be accidentally recreated or 'misheard' by audio equipment.</p>
<p>But basically there are systems constantly listening for those.</p>
<p>I'm amazed some idiot hasn't made it their ringtone yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it actually automatically triggers other radio stations to send out the message. So, there have even been instances of someone recording a home movie while the tone( a test) played on their TV. Then somehow that video got played back in a radio station, and the equipment heard the tone and sent out real emergency tones. Or something. I can't remember exactly but there's a lot of automatic shit that happens when that tone is played.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Footnote: In an EAS SAME, you hear three bursts of frequency modulated (FSK) information. ALL three bursts are identical. For a single bit, you have a 50% probability of decoding one of them correctly (probably higher, but this is a lower bound). For a given bit, if you decode all three of them to the same value, then that bit is known. If there is discrepency, then the one that was heard the most is recognized (i.e. if you hear 1, 1, 0, you recognize a 1, while for 0,1,0, recognize a 0). It's rudimentary error correction that works without fancy arrays and interaction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
