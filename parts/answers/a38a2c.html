		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The brain tries its best to be economical in distributing energy needed for different functions of the body. When you're keeping yourself awake despite being tired, your body has to keep functioning on a very low amount of energy. Like a good monarch, the brain needs to decide where resources are needed the most which in this case is keeping you from collapsing. Digestion is no longer a priority. Less blood is being sent that way, which is why you experience nausea. It's very similar to anxiety evoking situations (or indeed life threatening situations) - the brain registeres the presence of danger, increases the heart rate which pumps more blood through the muscles, prioritising it over any other activity and preparing you for a fight or flight response.</p>

This especially depends on what time you had your last meal as well, and of course what you had been drinking last (water vs alcohol or highly acidic beverages).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
