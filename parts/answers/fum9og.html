However, it’s much more of an emotional release, when our brains often interpret as a physical release as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m fairly certain that screaming has more to do with tension/mindfulness. Think about this: A cathartic scream is typically not going to happen in a super relaxed position (i.e. your other muscles are already to tenses up). In an emotional scream your muscles tense a little bit harder, like when someone’s crying turns to sobbing and they hold onto someone more tightly. The sudden jolt of tension acts like a progressive muscle relaxation for your whole body; it causes the brain to recognize how much tension there is and the scream is kind of the external symptom of what’s happening in your nervous/muscular systems (gotta reduce the tension). Consequently, after the scream all of your muscles feel more relaxed and the brain releases chemicals that tell your mind that it can relax a bit too. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if this has already been mentioned. There's a form of therapy called &quot;primal therapy&quot;. It's based on trauma recollection and screaming/ sobbing to finally express the pain that's been repressed or buried.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An open mouthed, fully released sound is the most expressive sound we can make. It used to be the only way we asked for anything. We were all born doing it.  In Shakespeare’s plays, the most emotional speeches are typically written with the most words containing long vowel sounds like AHH and OOOOHH.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
