		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll do my best here for a five year old: our eyelids open and close both voluntarily and involuntarily (by force but also on their own). For example, blinking happens on its own as a reflex when someone throws something at us, but we can also choose to shut our eyes while counting during hide and seek.</p>
<p>During the day, our eyes are open because we're diurnal (awake during the day). Our body uses many techniques and processes to keep us awake and alert in the day, including providing energy to our muscles, making us more sensitive to sounds, and keeping our eyes open. Because our body is trying to keep our eyes open, it's harder to fight it and close them unless we have to (example, for blinking). </p>
<p>At night, our body's alert systems begin to shut down to prepare us for sleep (as the sun goes down). Our eyelids begin to feel 'heavy.' There are actually muscles even in our eyelids that tire throughout the day, like every other muscle. It becomes harder to keep them open because they need a break. Making a tired muscle stay contracted or keep working is very hard for anyone.</p>
<p>Our bodies are designed to follow the sleep wake pattern for our benefit. Hope this helps. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is just part of the sleep system. There are two parts to the sleep system. The sleep-wake homoestasis and the circadian rhythm. </p>
<p>The sleep wake system is pretty simple. The longer you are awake the sleepier you get and the longer you are asleep the less sleepy you get. What happens is sleep-regulating substance(s) build up in the brain the longer you are awake. The more it accumulates the more you want to sleep. When you are asleep the substance rapidly declines. </p>
<p>The circadian rhythm works by using cortisol to help keep you awake during the day and melatonin to help keep you asleep at night. It takes a while for the body to learn when to stay awake and a sleep, that is part of the reason why babies have irregular sleep patterns.</p>
<p>When you are getting closer to sleeping at night the two processes are working together to get you to sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a scientific answer or anything but I think it makes sense. Your brain is used to darkness as a signal for sleep and light as the time when you're awake. Your eyes are closed when you sleep and if darkness signals sleep then your brain will be more lenient on having your eyes closed than not. Also, night time is when you're tired and that causes you to feel more relaxed when you close your eyes. </p>
<p>Tl;dr
It probably depends on the lighting around you and how tired you are. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
