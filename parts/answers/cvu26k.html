<p>However you dont want the cops to stay there for hours upon hours for what is essentially a small crime. You also dont want them to keep calling back up and keep the lights and sirens on because its messing with everyone in the neighborhood</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes your body can go a little overboard with the inflammation and fever and do more harm to you than you whatever infection it is fighting or whatever injury it is trying to heal. </p>
<p>For instance, your central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) don't repair themselves very well. Part of the reason for this is that in the event of an injury, certain cells respond with a bunch of inflammatory juice/molecules that basically block the way from other healer/helper cells from making it to the scene to help clean up and repair the injured tissue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Inflammation hurts, and most people don't want to feel pain. Fevers also suck and reducing a nasty one feels better. A trained medical professional (this is very different from someone selling you ibuprofen) will have a lot of training and techniques at their disposal to find out if their is a need to medically intervene when something is swollen or a fever is rising.</p>
<p>Those are most often cases where the bodies response is unnecessary or overkill. A fever can help get rid of harmful pathogens, sure, but it can also cause brain damage and/or outright kill you. So if your baby has a high fever don't assume that mother nature is infallible keep an eye on the kids temp and get them to a hospital if needed. Likewise inflammation can provide a whole lot of meaningful benefits to wounded tissue but it also increases pressure to surrounding tissues, like meningitis a swelling in your throat that can crush your brain.</p>
<p>Outside of catastrophic failures we treat symptoms of problems because they cause pain and discomfort. Fevers and painful swelling hurt and reducing a fever or icing a sore shoulder might slow down the recovery but most people find that tolerable as the recovery will still happen and they won't be feeling as shitty during it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those things do delay the healing process (or, they could potentially do so, each case is different.) but generally not by very much. The medicines make you less uncomfortable, so it's a bit of trade-off really.  In general it seems people prefer slightly longer healing time for reduced discomfort.</p>
<p>But unless you have an actual underlying health problem, there really is no good reason for you to take medicines that reduce fevers and inflammation. At the same time, using those medicines for the worst symptoms won't really delay healing by very long. So making the trade off or not is entirely up to you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
