<p>Lets say you wanted to go crazy and give a person scales and such, would CRISPR be able to safely be used for such a modification or is it limited towards changes towards sperm/eggs when it comes to such an extreme modification?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Overly simply stated, I understand that CRISPR can selectivly find/replace bits in a given genome, right? So wouldn't creating a &quot;New&quot; property like breathing fire require an existing and perfect model of both the original host ánd the property to be added?</p>
<p>I can imagine that changing bits here n there would potentially have unintended or unforseeable outcomes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Dr. Knoepfler. Having worked with CRISPR in fruitflies, I noticed that the reported efficiencies (in cells) were 80%, while in dmel I found it was around 0-2%, highly dependent on the locus.
Now I'm out of academia and little rusty, so I have two questions for you:
Are there any recent developments to raise the efficiency in model animals and locus dependencies? Also, what about off target effects? Are there recent developments to raise the specificity of CRISPR-Cas system apart from nicking cuts?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
