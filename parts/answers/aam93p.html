		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In terms of the amount of fuel required to get somewhere, the sun is actually the hardest thing to reach in the solar system. The Earth is orbiting the sun at about 30 km/s, and given the size of the sun in comparison to the distances involved you would have to cancel essentially all of that velocity in order to hit the sun. Reaching other planets is much simpler, because once you've escaped Earth's gravity it takes comparatively minor amounts of fuel to reach any other planet since they're all orbiting in the same plane as the Earth.</p>
<p>You've probably heard that the Parker Solar Probe is the closest object humanity has been able to send something to the sun, and also the fastest object humanity has ever produced? If it were feasible to send probes closer to the sun for scientific purposes it would have already been done. Even the PSP had to use multiple gravity assists from Venus in order to get as close as it did. In order to get substantially closer, close enough to be truly within the sun, it would need to cancel the majority of it's current velocity, which simply isn't feasible. The probe at this stage only has a minor amount of propellant intended to desaturate the gyroscopes, so that it is able to properly aim the heat shield at the sun during perihelion. Certainly not enough to meaningfully change it's orbital velocity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It takes a <strong>lot</strong> of power and fuel to slow something down enough to hit the sun.  To go closer to the sun in the solar system we have to shed the angular momentum that is given to the probe by starting it's journey on Earth.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The orbital mechanics have been well-explained by other comments, but there's another problem - even if we did a final dive and got some unique measurements, there's no way to get the data back. The radio signal would be completely overwhelmed by the roar of energy coming from the sun. As it is, we wait until the probe clears the area of the sun before talking to it and collecting data.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The final orbit of the probe crosses the orbit of Venus, so it's just a matter of adjusting the timing so it crosses while Venus is in the way. Actually hitting the Sun would take more delta-V to lower the perihelion even more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The changes in direction/velocity needed to actually crash it into the sun would be enormous, and require far more propellent than any spacecraft could carry. The only way to do it would be to use Venus (and maybe Mercury) to shed velocity using a bunch of gravity assists, but if you’re swinging close enough to the planet to get a gravity assist from it then why wouldn’t you just smack it into that planet directly? Rather than having to unnecessarily extend the mission by months or years.     </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
