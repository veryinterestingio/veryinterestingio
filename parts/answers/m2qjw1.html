		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The holes are already there, they're just too small for you normally</p>
<p>Objects are uniform solid things, most of the volume is just empty space between the atoms, but because its electrons and your electrons push back at each other from a distance it seems solid to you</p>
<p>Objects are more like a dense forest.  If you try to drive a big car through it you'll just get stuck because there isn't enough space between the trees, but you can walk through it and if you were the size of a mouse then there'd be tons of room between the trees to sneak through</p>
<p>Radiation is little high energy particles like electrons or photons like gamma rays that are soooo tiny that they can easily squeeze through the space between the cores of atoms and get out the other side.  If you want to stop them then you need to put enough big atoms packed closely together in its path (like in a dense element like lead) so that the particle will almost certainly hit something before it can pop out the other side.  Even when it does hit something it generally just gets absorbed and turned into a bit of heat in the material rather than blowing a hole through it like a bullet might</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a volleyball net. There are three main types of radiation: alpha, which would be a volleyball. Then beta, which would be a tennis ball. And gamma, which would be a grain of salt (but not really since it is an electromagnetic wave). Scaling only for an example.</p>
<p>Now throw these at the net and see what happens. The net is the matter around us. It can block some radiation, but not all.</p>
<p>Edit: can't believe I am getting this recognition for such a simple explanation, thank you!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that everything around us is already full of holes. The holes are frequently just too small to see or for most things to pass through, so we treat things like they are fully “solid” barriers even though they are not. </p>
<p>Many forms of radiation operate on a level where they are small enough to pass through these holes that most things can’t.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's important to note that <em>not all</em> radiation can penetrate everything. Alpha radiation can only travel a few feet and is stopped by paper. Radio waves are oftentimes blocked/scrambled by metallic frames. </p>
<p>Otherwise, it's similar to how a pebble can get dropped in a pool of water and sink to the bottom without leaving any holes. It has enough mass and energy to push through the water. In the case of radioactive particles traveling &quot;through matter&quot;, it's really traveling through the gaps and space in the individual atoms and molecules that make up the objects you see.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
