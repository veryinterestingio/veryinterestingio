		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>DisplayPort is preferred for a few reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As another comment says, DP doesn't have royalty fees associated with it, but that's not the primary reason, especially for gaming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can daisy-chain DP, meaning you can run multiple displays from one port, which is handy for a lot of use cases.</p>
</li>
<li>With gaming monitors, DP allows adaptive sync where HDMI doesn't (at least, not to my knowledge). </li>
</ol>
<p>Adaptive sync (Freesync, G-Sync etc.) allows the monitor and GPU to communicate and time frame rendering with display frequency, provided both are compatible. </p>
<p>Say you have a 60Hz monitor; that means your display is capable of rendering a complete screen refresh (redrawing everything on the screen) 60 times per second. Your GPU on the other hand may be capable of pushing 144fps. What happens then is that by the time the monitor is a little under halfway done refreshing the screen, the frames coming from the GPU have advanced, and now everything is in a slightly different spot than it was when the screen was first being drawn. This creates the effect known as &quot;screen tearing,&quot; and it's ugly. It also leads to dropped frames (frames that just aren't rendered at all as the display and GPU catch up with each other) which looks jerky and weird. But with adaptive syncing, the GPU and monitor agree on how many frames it's OK to draw at what rate--among other things--which cuts down on these effects considerably.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What exactly do you mean by &quot;extended displays&quot;?<br />
If it the multi-screen support in windows then there is no requirement for display port. I have run multiple screens with 2 on vga and 1 on DVI</p>
<p>It might be required because of the ports your graphics card has. Many display port connections on a graphics cards can also output HDMI so only a passive converter is needed or a cable wit different connectors in each end.</p>
<p>DisplayPort was developed as a replacement the VGA and DVI that was common back then so you can send the video, audio, USB, and more data over a single cable. The data on it is a lot higher than HDMI so it supports larger screen and higher refresh rate and I suppose this is the main reason it is common on the graphic card today</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Each standard was originally designed for a different use-case.</p>
<p>HDMI was originally designed for TVs.  The specification is controlled by a bunch of companies that work in the TV space.  It has features intended for TVs (such as HDMI-CEC, ARC, and support for TV resolutions and refresh rates).  It does not have features intended for PCs - or where it does, they were added recently and are not widely supported.  E.g. support for resolutions greater than 720p/1080i was not originally included because TVs did not support it, then they added 1080p when TVs started adding support, then they added 4K when TVs added support for that.</p>
<p>DisplayPort was designed for PCs.  The specification is controlled by a bunch of companies that work in the PC display space.  It has features intended for PCs (such as support for PC resolutions and refresh rates, daisy-chaining, and USB).  It does not have features intended for TVs - or where it does, they were added recently and are not widely supported.  E.g it doesn't support HDMI-CEC or ARC.</p>
<p>Nowadays, there are a lot of TVs, DVDs, etc that use HDMI, so changing TVs from HDMI to DisplayPort won't happen.  And there are a lot of PCs and monitors that use DisplayPort, so changing PCs from DisplayPort to HDMI won't happen either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
