		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This has actually been researched in social psychology. The basic answer is that when you give advice, you solve a simpler problem than the one the person actually faces. </p>
<p>This was studied through judgment and decision making research. When you give advice to someone else, you pick one most important feature of the problem and solve that. E.g., let's say your friend is in an abusive relationship: you pick safety, weigh that at 100% importance, tell them to leave their partner and call it a day. </p>
<p>But when you're actually in a situation, it's not that easy. Sure, they value their own safety. But they also place a value on their bond that took time and effort. And there's the issue of rent/housing (assume they live together); having to move and stuff is costly. </p>
<p>You may think that stuff is not a good way to think or not important, but again, that's a luxury of being outside the problem: you give 100% weight to one judgment feature. As soon as it's your problem, you weigh many more features in a more complex math. </p>
<p>This is also why self distancing can be a good strategy to solve your own problems. Self distancing is what it sounds like: ask yourself what advice you'd give to solve your problem if it was your friend who had that problem. </p>
<p>Anyway, sometimes the advice giver is being unrealistic in how simple they're making the problem, sometimes they're focusing on the issue that's most important. Context matters.</p>
<p>Edit for source since some people were curious. my response was primarily based on Kray and Gonzalez (1999), but I also included two other interesting articles.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Advice is logical.   People do not make decisions based on logic but based on emotion. So for advice to be good it must be logical but for it to be accepted it must be emotional.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
