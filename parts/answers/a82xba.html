		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ranch at a restaurant is made with mayo and buttermilk. You can make restaurant quality ranch at home! All you need to do is buy the ranch powder packet, usually on the top shelf above the dressings, and follow the instructions by adding mayo and buttermilk. Voila! Ranch made the exact same way restaurants make it. This ranch will only last as long as the expiration date on the buttermilk. Enjoy!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>But the Ken's brand ranch in the grocery store does not taste anything like the huge canisters received via restaurant direct stored in walk-in coolers.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Buttermilk
Mayo
Onion Powder
Garlic Powder
Pepper
Salt
Parsley</p>
<p>Add enough buttermilk to the consistency you like ranch and then just add a little bit of the spices to taste. Best homemade ranch. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Buy a non-shelf-stable ranch dressing in the refrigerator compartment (usually near where they keep the packaged salads and so forth).  Litehouse and Marie's, for two examples, make great ranch dressings that taste like homemade (or restaurant) ranch.   The non-refrigerated stuff has tons of stabilizers and gum product and chemicals to keep it shelf-stable.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
