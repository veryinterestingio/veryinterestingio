		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The conscious person molds into a position which makes it easier for you to lift them, since they are fully aware of what's going on. An unconscious person just lays there with no regard to your attempt to lift em up, so positioning em is much harder</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They have no control over their body movement when unconscious. So when someone is awake if you feel yourself slipping off your carrier you automatically adjust yourself so you won’t fall. Carrying an unconscious person is just a really heavy limp bag of potatoes. If one part of the unconscious person is going to fall, then it falls, the muscles won’t automatically adjust so the balance is right. Probably not fully ELI5 but it works for idiots like me</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think about carrying big sink tub of water. It keeps shifting around, water on one side, then on the other, some spills over. You have to walk really slowly and keep adjusting your arms to keep it still.</p>
<p>Now think about lifting a heavy tray with two hands. Its heavy, but you hold it to your chest, tuck your arms in, and you easily carry it to the table. </p>
<p>An unconscious person is like the tub of water. Flopping around, first a little heavier here, and a little heavier there. It takes a lot of more effort for you to keep adjusting your muscles.</p>
<p>A conscious person is like the tray. Solid, not moving, and once you adjust, you just hold that position and start walking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
