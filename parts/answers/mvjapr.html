		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The double mutant name is a highly inaccurate media garbage. Most variants have more than two mutations.</p>
<p>This variant is concerning because it has two mutations on the RBD, which is a binding site for antibodies. It has an E484Q mutation which is very similar to E484K and confers some antibody resistance, and L452R which is known to increase transmissibility moderately and confer a very minor amount of antibody resistance (its like N501Y on the B.1.1.7/UK variant). This combination of mutations hasn’t been seen before, although a combination of similar mutations (E484K and N501Y) is found on the B1.135/South African variant and the P.1/Brazilian variant (the South African variant has some other mutations on it too that make it particularly resistant to antibodies).</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the South African variant actually already has 3 mutations on the RBD as well, technically also making it a “triple mutant”. For some reason some media outlets decided to start calling this variant from India a double mutant, and then people just ran with it, irresponsibly might I add. </p>
<p>We don’t know how vaccines will perform because it hasn’t been tested, but given those mutations and what we know about the SA variant, likely vaccines will still be effective but less so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The indigenously developed COVAXIN by Bharat Biotech has shown efficacy against the variant found in India as well as B.1.1.7 (the UK variant), B.1.1.28 (Brazil variant) and B.1.351 (South Africa variant) as per ICMR.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since the question has been answered already, this is just a reminder: COVID mutates slower than the flu.  We are seeing these mutations because of the high numbers of cases in various regions.  The more people it reaches the more chances it has to mutate.  Getting vaccines out to vulnerable areas and encouraging mask-wearing should help slow the spread and thereby reduce mutations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
