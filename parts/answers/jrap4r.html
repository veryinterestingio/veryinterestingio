		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Though our sleep cycles are about 90 minutes, the cycles are not uniform in structure. Both non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep are important. The NREM stages tend to have slow, uniform brainwaves. A key function of deep NREM sleep, which tends to predominate early in the night, is to do the work of weeding out and removing unnecessary neural connections. The dreaming stage of REM sleep, which prevails later in the night, plays a role in strengthening those connections. </p>
<p>This is taken from Matthew Walker’s “Why We Sleep” </p>
<p>Very informative book, though occasionally a bit dry. He has a TED talk if you want the cliff notes version</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So much ‘TiL’ in this page:  </p>
<p>“It's important to get enough sleep, but also to get it at the right time. While it depends on each individual's circadian rhythm, in general 10PM to 2AM is when your body secretes the most growth hormone (that is- IF you're asleep at that time).</p>
<p>The other thing on the sleep to do list is waste cleanup.</p>
<p>Throughout the course of the day, the brain produces a decent amount of waste.</p>
<p>The brain handles this waste cleanup task during sleep via something called the glymphatic system in which brain cells shrink to allow for cerebrospinal fluid to flood into the brain and flush out the waste.</p>
<p>One thing that needs to be flushed out is the compound adenosine. Adenosine is a byproduct of your neurons and other cells when they burn up adenosine triphosphate, the main molecule that our bodies use to store energy.</p>
<p>As adenosine builds up, you start to slow down and accumulate a &quot;sleep pressure&quot;.</p>
<p>When your adenosine levels reach a certain point, your body sends you signals to go to sleep.”<br />

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's fine to wake mid-cycle for the most part. If you are in the slow wave sleep then you will feel groggy but if you are getting enough sleep it should go away within an hour. If you wake up during rem or early stages of sleep then you should have no issues waking up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
