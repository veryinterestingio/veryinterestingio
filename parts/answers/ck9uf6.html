		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to live in Dubai, but am currently experiencing a Dutch summer that is worse than anything I ever felt there, the diffence is air conditioning.</p>
<p>Literally every business, home and bus stop has AC in the middle east and during the summer you never go outside for more than a few minutes at a time. In Europe you sit, and you sweat because it's only for ~2 weeks.</p>
<p>For reference I'm Irish so I find anything over 25C unpleasant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aside from people in those regions being acclimated to the heat, people die over there to heat exposure all the time too. But it's a regular occurrence so it doesn't make national or international news.</p>
<p>Someone died in my town in a highway auto accident, you didn't hear about it. </p>
<p>A heat wave where it regularly doesn't get hot is unusual, so the deaths from it are also unusual.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just got back from volunteering in New Delhi, India which can reach up to 43c or 110F every day. What I notice is they have to adapt their lives to dealing with the heat. </p>
<p>You don't go out from 12-3pm because it's too hot. Kids stay up late playing outside than sleep in to avoid the heat. Everyone wears paper-thin clothes which means your pants rip like crazy. The women wear either head scarfs to protect themselves from the sun or carry umbrellas. Men carry rags just for whipping the sweat off themselves. I literally could not wear makeup because you're always sweating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We measure temperature using a so-called <em>dry bulb</em>, that is, a thermometer that is dry.</p>
<p>What is more relevant for human survival is <em>wet bulb temperature</em>, which is measured by wrapping a wet cloth around the bulb of the thermometers.</p>
<p>When the wet bulb temperature reaches 35°C or 95°F people begin to become unable to use their natural evaporative cooling system, sweating, and our core body temperatures rise rapidly, so rapidly that even consuming cold drinks may not be effective.</p>
<p>The hundreds of thousands of metabolic processes that keep us alive are based largely of molecules that are sensitive to heat. If a person is either too hot or too cold, then these proteins slow down and eventually stop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>40 celcius in Texas in nothing. They are all used to it and prepared for it. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But imagine NOT being prepared. Either no AC or lack of strong enough AC to keep temps down. Pair that with people not drinking enough and not dressing appropriately, and you got a recipe for disaster. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Like one day in Downtown Toronto was so fucking hot that I drank around 4 liters of water in like 2 hours. Yet I was always thristy and never had to piss, it all came out in sweat. If all I had was a 500ml bottle (which is normally enough for a few hours), I would have been highly dehydrated. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If I was very old and very dehydrated, then I would be in a really bad spot</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
