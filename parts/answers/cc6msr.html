		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as i know, yawning has the intention of causing to awaken you to some degree.
It causes a lot of your muscles to tense/activate and the big breather you do is meant to get more oxygen into your system.
I could imagine due to your inactivity when bored, your body is thinking that you're tired, or your body wants to keep you more active.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The mechanism of yawning isn't known yet (as far as I know). One theory is that we yawn to supply oxygen to the brain.</p>
<p>So imagine sitting in a room with many people for some time, poor ventilation, you sit still, no physical activity makes your blood flowrate slow down and this lowers the oxygen supply in the brain. So the brain triggers yawning, which is kinda deep breath which rises the oxygen level in the bloodstream and helps to deliver more oxygen to the brain.</p>
<p>What is more interesting, yawning is contagious - when you see someone yawning, you will probably yawn too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It isn't known why we yawn at all. Yawning while bored isn't universal even within the same culture. </p>
<p>It's unlikely to be a learned behavior because it is a reflex, but it's possible it is a conditioned behavior. For example, if you were bored a lot while you were tired, you could associate boredom with fatigue and that could make it more likely that you yawn while bored.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
