		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you are very cold, your body tries to keep your vital organs warm. It does this by sending more blood there and sending less blood to your extremities (hands and feet).</p>
<p>When there is less blood in your hands they get cold and go white. At the extreme end of the scale this is how frostbite happens.</p>
<p>So all the little blood capilliaries in your fingers start closing up as there is less or no blood present.</p>
<p>When you start getting warm again, the blood will rush to your extremities and force open those capilliaries and this is the source of pain.</p>
<p>This is commonly experienced by ice climbers who have the problem exacerbated by being in extremely cold places for hours on end but also with their hands above their head.</p>
<p>Climbers call this pain &quot;hot aches&quot; as a result.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's due to reactive hyperemia. Basically when it is cold, your body cuts down circulation to your extremities (like fingers and hands). Cutting down circulation means that there is less blood exchange with tissues (so less oxygen and glucose delivered, and less waste like carbon dioxide, hydrogen ions, etc. is taken away).</p>
<p>These waste products are also chemicals called vasodilators which enlarge your blood vessels and allow more blood flow. But when your hands are cold the blood vessels aren't allowed to dilate, and these vasodilator chemicals keep accumulating since they aren't being washed away by the blood. </p>
<p>When you heat them up, the warmth restores circulation to your hands, and since there was a buildup of vasodilators, your blood vessels enlarge TOO much. This excess blood flow and vasodilation triggers pain receptors. This link's up with Raynaud's syndrome because individuals with Raynaud's are very susceptible to cold-induced cutting off of blood flow. Hope this answers your question!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body isn't a thermometer. It actually senses temperature gradients. It's the big difference between the temperature of your hands and the water it senses which creates the same sensation normal temperature hands encountering dangerous heat would.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
