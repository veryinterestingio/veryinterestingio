		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>tl-dr version -- your entire GI tract is basically one long tube of muscles.  To push food along, the muscles (the walls) of the GI tract contract in a wave like fashion (this is called peristalsis).  Your stomach is basically just a sack made of muscles that secretes acid -- the walls of the stomach contract to churn the food around, mixing the acid around with the food.  </p>
<p>You might think: no food, no need for the muscles to contract?  well the body doesn't like anything sitting in the GI tract too long.  The intestines secrete digestive enzymes and mucous (to neutralize the acid from the stomach); there are also a ton of friendly bacteria in your gut, but if things are too calm for too long those bacteria can overpopulate and cause problems.</p>
<p>The rumble/growling you hear is when the muscles of the stomach and intestines are contracting against mostly air or fluid.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you haven’t eaten for a while, the stomach will release a hormone called Motillin (also called migrating motor complex), this will increase the ‘wave like motion’ movement of the gut tube.</p>
<p>The gut wall itself has an intrinsic nervous system (called the enteric nervous system) and this system itself causes the motion of the gut tube (aka, peristalsis). The hormone intensifies this motion so it can be felt by the individual as rumblings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Peristalsis, initiated through the autonomic nervous system as a PSNS or a feed and breed nervous system response to tell the body we are hungry and to eat. Peristalsis starting in the stomach and moves food through the digestive system and then out. It is more complicated then this but this is the main theme hahahaha ✌?? </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
