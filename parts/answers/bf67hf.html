		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are various nucleosynthetic processes that extend up into higher masses. There's a diagram on the third slide <a href="https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/physics/ntg/6805/slides/Decadal_slides_from_pages_on_nuclear_structure_2.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>These different processes occur in different astrophysical sites. For example, the rp-process occurs in x-ray bursts, the s-process occurs in AGB stars, the r-process occurs in neutron star mergers, and so on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nuclear fusion cycles do not end at Iron-56.  Nuclear fusion beyond Iron-56 requires more energy than the process generates at this point.  There are irregularities in super massive stars that would allow for fusion above this point but the vast majority of fusion beyond Iron-56 occurs due to gravitational collapse as part of supernovae events (potentially it could occur at edges of super massive objects as well).  Maybe transition events make more sense than Chandrasekhar limits.  As part of gravitational collapse, some matter is emitted back into space after being tempered by immense energies while the internalized matter becomes consistent with neutron stars or black holes respectively.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fusion doesn’t really “end” at iron.  That’s just the point at which it takes more energy to fuse atoms than you get back out from the fusion.  You can definitely fuse heavier elements, it’s just energy negative.  When a star is imploding during a supernova, there is more than enough energy to overcome the cutoff at iron and form heavier elements.  It’s not going to stop the star imploding and may even hasten it, because it’s not generating excess energy to overcome the collapse, but the massive spike can fuse a lot of exotic heavier elements in those moments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
