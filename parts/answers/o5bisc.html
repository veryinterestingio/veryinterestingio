		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the blood.</p>
<p>If you have A+ blood, your body likes and accepts types A+, A-, O+ and O- and the body says &quot;This is nice.&quot; Any other type the body goes &quot;Wt? Heck no!&quot; and rejects it and you die.</p>
<p>If you have A- blood, your body likes and accepts types A- and O- and the body says &quot;This is nice.&quot; Any other type the body goes &quot;Wt? Heck no!&quot; and rejects it and you die.</p>
<p>If you have B+ blood, your body likes and accepts types B+, B-, O+ and O- and the body says &quot;This is nice.&quot; Any other type the body goes &quot;Wt? Heck no!&quot; and rejects it and you die.</p>
<p>If you have B- blood, your body likes and accepts types B- and O- and the body says &quot;This is nice.&quot; Any other type the body goes &quot;Wt? Heck no!&quot; and rejects it and you die.</p>
<p>If you have AB+ blood, you're a vampire. Your body likes and accepts any blood and says &quot;This is nice.&quot; You're extremely lucky and won't die.</p>
<p>If you have AB- blood, your body likes and accepts types AB-, A-, B-, and O- and the body says &quot;This is nice.&quot; Any positive blood, the body goes &quot;Wt? Heck no!&quot; and rejects it and you die.</p>
<p>If you have O+ blood, your body is finicky and likes and only accepts types O+ and O- and the body says &quot;This is nice.&quot; Any other type the body goes &quot;Wt? Heck no!&quot; and rejects it and you die.</p>
<p>If you have O- blood, your blood is a super hero that can save everyone, but you're screwed bc your body only likes and accepts type O- and the body says &quot;This is nice.&quot; Everything else will kill you and you'll die.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Somebody that got the wrong blood type would get huge blood clots and likely die of an embolism. We did this in a biology lab in petrie dishes, mixing blood types, the blood gets thick and lumpy,, it congeals as the white blood cells attack the foreign blood type. Mixing the same blood types did not have this effect, also mixing any blood type with type O negative did not have that effect, that's why that type is considered universal donor blood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The bursted blood cells will act the same was as what happens during a wound: It will clot together and these clots will block the flow of blood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Their blood starts to clot.  Depending on the amount, this could cause a lot of clots.  Clots can float around in the bloodstream and get stuck, causing serious problems.  A blood clot in the brain can cause a stroke and/or kill you.  Not good.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
