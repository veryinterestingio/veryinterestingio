		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The two vaccines essentially function the exact same way. For the active ingredients, they’re both made of lipid nanoparticles that complex with the mRNA. The mRNA sequences are also similar, which other commenters have already touched on the elucidated sequences online.
Personally, I believe the ‘main’ difference between the two is the actual lipid makeup in the nanoparticle. </p>
<p>The Pfizer/BioNTech lipids are mostly a proprietary cationic (positively charged, this is good for complexing with the negatively charged mRNA) lipid ALC-0315,  a smaller amount of another helper cationic lipid (DSPC) to promote cell binding, a third lipid with a common polymer PEG on the end (PEG prevents the nanoparticle from getting cleared from the body too quickly)... oh and lastly, cholesterol!</p>
<p>The Moderna vaccine uses an ionizible lipid, SM-102, as the main lipid instead. This means that the lipid’s charge is more flexible depending on the pH of the environment (such as in solution versus in the body). This could be helpful for stability of the nanoparticles as well as keeping the nanoparticles protected until they are in the right spot for the mRNA to be used. The Moderna vaccine also has DSPC , a slightly different but very similar PEGylated lipid, and cholesterol too.
You can picture these nanoparticle ingredients as coming together to form a bubble with smaller bubbles on the inside holding the mRNA inside.</p>
<p>Now for the inactive ingredients, basically just salts and sugars to keep the formulation stable and at preferable pH. </p>
<p>Both vaccines are using similar scientific theory, which is why they work similarly! We can’t definitively say that one particular ingredient increases the efficacy over another since they have multiple differences (variables) in play, though. The efficacy differences (although small) do likely come mostly from the active ingredients rather than the inactive ones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The mRNA vaccines have three basic components: The RNA protein code, the lipid bubble surrounding the code, and the stabilizing buffer solution.</p>
<p>The two mRNA vaccines both contain the same spike protein code with slightly different untranslated end regions and signal peptides.

<p>They also both keep the RNA contained in similar protective lipid bubbles but the lipid formulations are slightly different.</p>
<ul>
<li>Moderna: (SM-102, 1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000 [PEG2000-DMG], cholesterol, and 1,2-distearoyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine [DSPC]),</li>
<li>Pfizer/BioNTech: ((4-hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1-diyl)bis(2-hexyldecanoate), 2 [(polyethylene glycol)-2000]-N,N-ditetradecylacetamide, 1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3- phosphocholine, and cholesterol)</li>
</ul>
<p>The buffer solutions are a mix of salts, acids, organic compounds, and sugars. These solutions are also somewhat different between the two vaccines</p>
<ul>
<li>Moderna:  Tromethamine, Tromethamine hydrochloride, Acetic acid, Sodium acetate, Sucrose</li>
<li>Pfizer/BioNTech:  Potassium chloride, Monobasic potassium phosphate, Sodium chloride, Dibasic sodium phosphate dehydrate, Sucrose</li>

This is a pretty good summary - the mRNA has the same target in both vaccines, and is likely pretty similar in sequence, but they're formulated slightly differently. Based on the different storage temperatures, the stuff in the vaccines besides the mRNA (buffer, etc) is different between the two different vaccines. They'll be similar, but whatever is holding the mRNA stable is likely one of the big differences.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Moderna also has 100ug of mRNA vs 30ug for Pfizer. During phase 1 clinical trials pfizer also had a trial arm that used a 100ug concentration but had too many adverse effects and discontinued it. Probably why moderna seems to have more adverse side effects now. </p>
<p>In terms of the mRNA itself it was cofounded at UPenn by DR Weissman and the dr. Kariko, cofounder of Biontech and actually licensed from the the university. These are the two who will likely win a nobel prize.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I didn't throughly peruse the replies, but I think it's interesting that no one answered the question about qualitative differences.  From a retail pharmacy standpoint qualitative differences from reports of our patients, having administered 100+ Moderna vaccines per week for two months now, we have reports of significant discomfort following the Moderna, while a local non-affiliated site administering the Pfizer has reported dramatically fewer incidences of discomfort following the vaccination.  Specifically the second shot of the Moderna seems to be generating greater intensity of adverse side-effects, while we can't speak to the frequency as we do not have as many reports back after the second shot--everyone who gets their first shot is automatically scheduled for their second so we are able to reliable gauge the frequency of adverse side-effects.  This is especially so, as our protocols require the administrator to specifically inquire as to side-effects of first vaccination to assess whether the patient must wait under observation for a prescribed time after administration or if they may leave earlier.  Second vaccination side-effects can only be reported as anecdotal based entirely on selection biases that compel patients experiencing negative side-effects to be more likely to return to report than those who had none.</p>
<p>Colleagues at sites administering Pfizer report far fewer incidences of patients reporting adverse side-effects after initial dose.  </p>
<p>This concludes my capabilities to speak to the differing qualities of the vaccines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
