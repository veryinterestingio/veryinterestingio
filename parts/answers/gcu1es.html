		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m an entomologist, here’s my two cents.</p>
<p>Something to keep in mind is that while honey bees are important for people’s livelihoods and the current agricultural system, they are not native to North America and compete for many of the same pollen sources that native bees use. When talking about the bee crisis I find that most people really only think about the Eurasian honey bee (Apis mellifera), when the bigger threat is that native bees are suffering from huge declines. Honey bees are of significant economic importance as a livestock animal, and there are many people devoting their time and funds to working on maintaining the industry. The same effort and funds cannot be allocated to native pollinators to the same degree and that’s where the biggest threat is (in my opinion). It’s analogous to saying “We need to save birds!” and only thinking about chickens while sweeping native birds under the rug. That’s not to say that honey bees are unimportant, it’s just something I like to mention when discussing the current bee situation.</p>
<p>As answered by others, the Asian Giant Hornet eats many different types of insects (not just bees) but can target honey bee hives when available. If Asian Giant Hornets can overpower a honey bee colony they get a huge food payout, so this is a favorable hunting strategy for the hornet. In Japan their native honey bee is Apis cerana, which is a different but closely related species to the Eurasian honey bee that we use in bee keeping in the US. Apis cerana has evolved a strategy to effectively protect their colonies against attacks from the Asian Giant Hornet. Eurasian honey bees have not developed a strategy for this hornet, and that leaves them very vulnerable to attacks by hungry Asian Giant Hornets. </p>
<p>The main issue is that the Asian Giant Hornet could pose a threat to the bee keeping industry in the region, not to mention it is a generally feared insect. Destructive invasive insects are nothing new — the emerald ash borer is an introduced insect that targets native ash trees and causes huge economic losses as just one example. However, the Asian Giant Hornet creates a pretty ideal storm for the media to capitalize on. It’s huge, people are generally scared of large stinging insects, and it attacks honey bees occasionally (the bee that the general public tends to think of as the main target for preservation). It also threatens a region’s bee keeping industry and could have a negative effect on people’s livelihoods if people don’t take protective measures against it. </p>
<p>EDIT: I am editing to emphasize and clarify my point here, it could have some negative effects in the region IF it is not effectively monitored and controlled. The Asian Giant Hornet was first sighted in September of 2019 (on Vancouver Island), and has been carefully monitored since then. That colony was exterminated when it was found. Scientists are keeping a close eye on this and are serious about eradicating any remaining Asian Giant Hornets in the region. The current calls for action are preventative measures just to ensure that things are kept under control and that people are aware of them. There is no concrete evidence at this point that they are actually well established in the region. This is the time of year when queen hornets would emerge to establish a new hive. Scientists are seeking to eradicate any possible queens before they can successfully start new colonies. </p>

<p>The beekeeping industry here would definitely be affected. There would also be human deaths. The extent of other ecological damage at this point is unknown. How do we know? Because something like this happened in Europe with a very closely related species: <a href="https://www-thelocal-fr.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.thelocal.fr/20180919/asian-hornets-claim-another-victim-in-france/amp?amp_js_v=a3&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQFKAGwASA%3D#aoh=15885464558572&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thelocal.fr%2F20180919%2Fasian-hornets-claim-another-victim-in-france" target="_blank">https://www-thelocal-fr.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.thelocal.fr/20180919/asian-hornets-claim-another-victim-in-france/amp?amp_js_v=a3&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQFKAGwASA%3D#aoh=15885464558572&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thelocal.fr%2F20180919%2Fasian-hornets-claim-another-victim-in-france</a></p>
<p>Now the good news: the Washington State Department of Agriculture is coordinating a massive trapping program in the area with confirmed finds (so far a very small area). There is a plan for eradication and it's likely this was caught early enough that they can eradicate it. France and the UK have come up with some amazing ideas to find nests there, and those will hopefully be successful in this case too. </p>
<p>There's a fact sheet from WSU that gives some guidance to beekeepers and anyone else here: <a href="https://extension.wsu.edu/wam/asian-giant-hornet-found-locally-what-we-know/" target="_blank">https://extension.wsu.edu/wam/asian-giant-hornet-found-locally-what-we-know/</a></p>
<p>There's a bunch more info here, and, if anyone lives near Blaine, WA and wants to help, the WSDA is looking for volunteers: <a href="https://agr.wa.gov/departments/insects-pests-and-weeds/insects/hornets" target="_blank">https://agr.wa.gov/departments/insects-pests-and-weeds/insects/hornets</a></p>
<p>Hope that helps. And here's hoping it gets eradicated quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There have been persistent, isolated reports suggesting the presence of Vespa mandarinia elsewhere in the US, for example in Virginia, Illinois, and North Carolina. Some of these could be dismissed as sightings of the much smaller Vespa crabro, which is common in North Carolina and usually attracts little notice; but some of the sightings describe something very large and unusual, so one has to wonder.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
