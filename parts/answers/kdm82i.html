		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctors - thank you for taking the time today with us. </p>
<p>When we hear about the various efficacy rates, Pfizer being 94.5%, how should we interpret that?</p>
<p>Would it be:   Out of 1000 recipients, 945 of them developed immune response (55 did not)</p>
<p>Or: for all recipients, out of 1000 exposures to the virus, 945 times they did not contract the virus?  </p>
<p>Or: in 1000 exposures, 945 times, the vaccine prevented serious illness from resulting?</p>
<p>(I use 945/1000 as the 94.5% number but I realize in the clinical trials, there was much larger population to work with)</p>
<p>Sorry if this seems an elementary question but Iâ€™d really like to understand what efficacy rate means, and how important that number is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A significant part of the population is worried about late-onset side effects of the new mRNA vaccines that could not have shown up yet as the trials have been fairly short.
My question is: If the mRNA contained in the vaccine decays within hours or days after vaccination, wouldn't all side effects have to show up within a few days after receiving the vaccine? These may well be long-term side effects, I'm just wondering about the possibility of side effects that don't show up until many months after application.
In my mind it's like getting food poisoning from food I ate 4 months ago, it doesn't quite add up.
Thanks for the AMA!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been seeing some theories that covids long haul effects might be due to autoimmunity, if these theories hold how would the vaccines avoid creating the same problem.
