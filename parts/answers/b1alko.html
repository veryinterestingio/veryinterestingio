		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the things like this in Astrophysics is determined by trying to apply models to what we observe. So for example if you create a model that explains the universes time evolution, you can tweak its parameters until you get an end result that matches what we observe. One of those parameters will then be the total age of the universe.</p>
<p>What I explained above might not seem like the best method of determining things like that, after all your model could be wrong. This is why we compare LOTS of different models made in different ways. And if they all agree with each other and observations made of reality, then we accept that value. And we keep trying to come up with better and better models to challenge those found values. Some years ago we actually managed to improve our models to the point where we had to correct our estimations from \~13.7 to \~13.8. So it is important to realise that these are estimations. They are just often VERY good estimations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>technically there's no light from the very start of the universe, because directly after the Big Bang the universe was too dense for light to escape, what we do have is the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, which is the first light some 380,000 years after the Big Bang. </p>
<p>After nearly 14 billion years of red shifting the light was now in the microwave spectrum.</p>
<p>We also have the rate of the universes expansion, which we can use to work backwards to the beginning. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a very complicated matter.
We use &quot; standard candles&quot; objects that have very similar luminosities.
For example a type 1a supernova, anywhere you look they are pretty much the same.
Now we can determine the distance to these objects based on the luminosity.
This works great for redshifts values upto about 1.4 z.
From here we get more creative, recently we can apply standard candles to quasars, which takes us up to about z=5.
Now for the big bang we need to go much further back, z=1000.
We currently have a model from our previous observation, applying to model and using the Hubble constant gets us our results. </p>
<p>This was a very rushed explanation as I'm about to do the school run. But it should give you some idea where to start your own research. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve just finished reading “Universal: A guide to the Cosmos” by Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw (2016).  I’m pretty noob at this, but it’s a great book for explaining “How do we know this stuff?” questions like this one in easy to understand terms.</p>
<p>To summarise some points from the book, we can use Friedman’s Equation to compute the rate at which the Universe expands, once we’ve calculated details such as how much dark matter and dark energy is floating around, and an age of just under 14 billion years is the only age that makes sense with our observations of the current Universe. </p>
<p>It also mentions how the stars in globular clusters can give a minimum age for the Universe, since some of them are 12 billion years old.  We can work this out from the colour and brightness of stars in the cluster (maybe you’ve seen Herzsprung-Russell diagrams before) and from our knowledge of stellar evolution.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’d recommended the book for other casuals like myself wondering “how did we figure this stuff out”.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
