		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a few done in Texas back before the Top 10% automatic admissions rule was implemented.</p>
<p>The results were pretty much what you expected: wealthier districts performed better overall, top students at mediocre or low income schools performed worse than the prestigious schools, and most top performing students had parents who had a college education and at least middle class income. Also, the study found that districts that had manditory integration (as in students attend schools outside their district and based on their academics) benefited lower income students but diminished wealthier student's graduation tier. </p>
<p>Overall, the study found that the wealthy Dallas Forthwort regions had the best academics (not surprising). Also, the study concluded that automatically admitting students because they were in the top 10% was extremely detrimental because many school districts did not prepare students to succeed in college (aka higher chance of failure or dropping out if you came from bad districts).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, public Texas universities went through with the plan. It's created some really awful things that I saw first hand because I attended high school in Texas for 2 years. What basically happens is that wealthy students from competitive or private schools transfer into a low ranked high school around their junior or senior year. They come in with advance coursework, sometimes even college credits, and only take Electives with AP or Dual Enrollment College. Basically, they only enroll to graduate top 10% and cheat local students who grew up in the district. These kids are usually extremely privileged to begin with: luxury cars, wealthy, emancipated, and lots of resources. It was extremely easy to spot them as they were often out of place. </p>
<p>It also created a movement and backlash from wealthier suburbs who broke away and formed their own independent school districts or opened up private religious schools.</p>
