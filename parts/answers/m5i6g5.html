		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thank you all for doing this AMA!</p>
<p>I'm a high school student and in Biology class we are currently discussing evolution. I think this subject is very interesting but one particular thing got me wondering.</p>
<p>From what I've learned, evolution occurs through 'survival of the fittest'. Organisms mutate and when, by coincidence, a mutation occurs that's beneficial for that organism, the organisms with that mutation will be more likely to survive and pass on their genes to further generations.</p>
<p>However, I read online that microevolutions (we don't discuss this in school) can and have occured, even in humans. An example is that more and more babies in modern society are born without or with less wisdom teeth and have smaller jaws. </p>
<p>How is this possible? If a human rarely dies due to wisdom teeth or jaw size related issues, how is it possible that having the genes which lead to less wisdom teeth or smaller jaws are getting more and more common?</p>
<p>Edit: spelling</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I want to Ask about Neural Interfaces Technology and Also ask if Quantum Computing can actually make a difference for that type of Technology.</p>
<p>1- are we considered in the early stages of Neural Interface Technology or have been slow due to the available technology to use for Neural interfaces</p>
<p><em>(if my memory is correct, the research for neural interfaces has started in the 70‚Äôs and I noticed it advanced a lot but still, I think the investment in that technology isn‚Äôt always happening and also, the processing of the Brain signals to turn into Electromagnetic signals in order to turn into data for the NI using device and it usually is slow and the response times look slow)</em></p>
<p>2- now since my question here is usually for the response times of Neural Interfaces... will Quantum computing be actually effective when we use Neural interface technology? and make the Robotic and slow response times slowly fade since (if I understood how it works correctly) it makes the calculations on an Atomic and Subatomic levels and supposedly processes the information much faster?</p>
<p>I‚Äôll be honest, if the articles I find about Quantum Computing aren‚Äôt just media hyping people up and it‚Äôs true that it would make response times very unnoticeable... that would probably be a really good start in advancing Neural Interface prosthetics for example, We would control many devices without direct connection to the brain since the brain is a very sensitive part and unnecessary and direct contact
to the brain would probably be too risky.</p>
<p>3- now since all the questions regarding what would Quantum computing and Neural interfaces achieve are out of the way... is it ever safe if we implant these devices or use them for big amounts of time?</p>
<p>Like if we Hypothese that we planted RFID chips for example connected to a small device that does use both mentioned technologies and we planted it in someone‚Äôs arm (putting in mind it‚Äôs used with a rechargeable battery or DC Battery) and they use this device as a remote control for various devices whether portable or inside their homes (even if it‚Äôs their vehicle)... how dangerous an idea like this would be regarding well-being of the user (regardless to the battery)?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for putting time to answer my questionsüôèüèª</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
