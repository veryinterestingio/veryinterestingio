		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To go a bit against the others here:</p>
<p>The fact that people discovered, that &quot;nothing&quot; can be expressed as a number - that you can also calculate with - is not obvious and very revolutionary.</p>
<p>It shows a new level of abstract thinking that actually leads to mathematics as something different than just &quot;counting things&quot;. That a number substracted from itself equals 0 seems painfully obvious to us now, but imagine having to do math without this simple operation.</p>
<p>The decimal system is nice, but a very similar system is also possible without 0 - the Roman numerals just are exceptionally confusing. There is nothing stopping people from expressing (for example) 2437 as &quot;2D4C3B7A&quot; and 3004 as &quot;3D4A&quot; and some cultures used systems that were conceptually similar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To us 0 is obvious but that's only because we've been using it for so long. So let's compare to something that's not so intuitive. Take imaginary numbers (I know I should call them complex numbers but &quot;imaginary&quot; helps in this case). </p>
<p>Finding a square root means finding a number, that when multiplied by itself, gives you the number you have. example, 2x2=4 but <em>also</em> -2x-2 = 4, because multiplying two negatives gives a positive. </p>
<p>So what would be the square root of -4? You could say &quot;well there isn't one&quot;, or you could say &quot;fuck it, let's say that the square root of -1 exists and just call it <em>i</em>&quot;, in that case the square root of -4 would be 2i. </p>
<p>Now is the time when people say &quot;Yeah but that doesn't really exist, you just made up <em>i</em> to do math with it&quot;, no it absolutely does exist, the symbol of <em>i</em> was made up yes, but <em>in the same exact way that 0 was made up</em>. It's just a symbol, it represents a concept, for 0 that concept is &quot;nothing&quot; for <em>i</em> that concept is &quot;square root of negative numbers&quot;.</p>
<p>If you have a hard time accepting that <em>i</em> is real, despite us not having &quot;numbers&quot; for it, then you should have a reasonable understanding of why &quot;0&quot; was revolutionary. Representing nothing is not entirely intuitive.</p>
<p>This goes for other &quot;number concepts&quot; as well. Negative numbers for example, &quot;you can't have less than nothing&quot;, &quot;well lets pretend you can and just represent it as a one with a dash in front of it&quot; then over time the concept became internalized.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Just watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3huvvxUHDmM" target="_blank">Schoolhouse Rock's &quot;My Hero Zero&quot;</a></p>
<p>[Intro: Girl &amp; Narrator]
Zero?
Yeah, zero is a wonderful thing. In fact, Zero is my hero!
How can zero be a hero?
Well, there are all kinds of heroes, you know
A man can get to be a hero for a famous battle he fought
Or by studying very hard and becoming a weightless astronaut
And then there are heroes of other sorts, like the heroes we know from watching sports
But a hero doesn't have to be a grown up person, you know
A hero can be a very big dog who comes to your rescue
Or a very little boy who's smart enough to know what to do
But let me tell you about my favorite hero</p>
<p>[Verse 1: Bob Dorough]
My hero, Zero, such a funny little hero
But 'til you came along, we counted on our fingers and toes</p>
<p>[Refrain 1: Bob Dorough]
Now, you're here to stay, and nobody really knows
How wonderful you are, why we could never reach a star
Without you, Zero, my hero, how wonderful you are</p>
<p>**[Bridge 1: Girl &amp; Narrator]
What's so wonderful about a zero? It's nothing, isn't it?
Sure, it represents nothing alone</p>
<p>[Chorus 1: Bob Dorough]
But place a zero after one, and you've got yourself a ten
See how important that is?
When you run out of digits, you can start all over again
See how convenient that is?
That's why with only ten digits including zero
You can count as high as you could ever go
Forever, towards infinity
No one ever gets there, but you could try**</p>
<p>[Verse 2: Bob Dorough &amp; (Girl)]
With ten billion zeros, from the cavemen until the heroes
Who invented you, they counted on their fingers and toes
And maybe some sticks and stones (or rocks and bones)
And their neighbors' toes</p>
<p>[Refrain 2: Bob Dorough]
You're here, and nobody really knows
How wonderful you are, why we could never reach the star
Without you, Zero, my hero, Zero, how wonderful you are</p>
<p>[Chorus 2: Bob Dorough]
Place one zero after any number
And you've multiplied that number by ten
See how easy that is?
Place two zeros after any number
And you've multiplied that number by one hundred
See how simple that is?
Place three zeros after any number
And you've multiplied that number by one thousand</p>
<p>[Outro: Bob Dorough]
Et cetera, et cetera, ad infinitum, ad astra, forever and ever
With Zero, my hero, how wonderful you are</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the number zero that has the meaning of nothing is important because it is the idea of an absence, or a set of nothing. but the idea that zero can be used as a digit to increase the value of a number is fascinating. </p>
<p>take roman numerals for example. sure, numbers like nine (IX) are simple to write, but get much higher and it becomes cumbersome and difficult to do mathematics with. a number like 998 is written CMXCVIII. badass but not efficient. using zero as a placeholder digit allows larger numbers to be created and written easily. we know the amount based on the succession of zeros. this is the arabic system of writing numbers</p>
<p>one mathematician that used this idea to propel mathematics is al-khwarizmi. the latinization of his name is al-jabr, which is where the words algebra and algorithm come from. his book &quot;the compendious book on calculation by completion and balancing&quot; is the text that founded this way of mathematics. by using simple variables and equations, al-khwarizmi created this branch of math for heritance cases in bagdad in 830 (this was due to specific fractions of money going to husbands, wives, brothers, and other family)</p>
<p>it took a while before his work reached europe due in part by the crusades and the focus on geometry and greek mathematics at the time. by around 1200, trade began opening up, and european mathematicians adopted the arabic number system that we use today</p>
<p>soon, fibonacci's text &quot;liber abaci&quot; or &quot;book on calculation&quot; was dropped, expanding upon the ideas of balancing equations and solving them. from there most of higher mathematics like calculus was born</p>
<p>edit: lol this is what i get for writing this high at 4 am but thank you for the clarifications/corrections</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
