		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Things are white when they reflect a lot of light (things are black when they don’t reflect light). The surface of bubbles is shiny, it reflects light. When you make foam, you’re making lots and lots of little bubbles. Since lots of bubbles have more surface area than one single bubble, it means more light can get reflected so your foam looks white. </p>
<p>Same thing happens if you’ve ever seen people make pulled taffy. They start out with a dark mixture and it gets lighter in colour as they fold and pull it because they’re incorporating bubbles.
They keep their colour because there’s more dye in it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the dyes are water soluble and wash out pretty quickly, leaving just the surfactant that causes the bubbles to hold and a foam to form. Otherwise you'd come out of the shower dyed all those colours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
