		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In two words: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_photography" target="_blank">Computational photography</a></p>
<p>Phones are too small to capture high quality images by classic photographic principles. So what they do instead is use multiple lenses as a more general &quot;information capture&quot;, the final photograph is a computer render based on the information and not the direct result from any one lens or even of a single exposure. The exact degree on how much computational photography is used can vary from phone to phone, but the general direction is doing more of it.</p>
<p>For an extreme example, see the <a href="https://light.co/camera" target="_blank">Light L16 camera</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lytro" target="_blank">Lytro cameras</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mainly two possible applications of multiple lenses:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Already stated in a lot of comments: wide angle- normal- telephoto , multiple &quot;zoom&quot; options without loss of quality.</p>
</li>
<li>Better picture quality. You put one colour camera and one black and white camera: the black and white doesn't have a colour filter, so it captures more light ,hence more detail.
In software you then combine the two pictures and the result is a higher quality colour image </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They've hit the limit in terms of what they can do with sensors, so to differentiate they've added lenses. These yield better results than digital zoom, and you can also do stuff like faking shallow depth of field by comparing the views from two different lenses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A large part of it is the shift from hardware to software.  On a regular SLR camera, you have a large lens with high quality glass that can collect a lot of light to expose great detail on the film.  The large lenses attached to these cameras provide a ton of adjustability and customization.</p>
<p>Cameras have incorporated more technology moving into DSLRs and mirrorless cameras, using a lot of software in conjunction with the large premium lenses. Then as the cameras started getting compressed smaller and smaller to fit into cell phones, they were limited as to how large of a lens they could fit. </p>
<p>So there are two different primary methods of dealing with this.  The first method is to use a lot of in camera(phone) processing to make some assumptions and essentially &quot;edit&quot; the picture in real time.  Google is currently the best at doing this with it's Pixel phones.  It uses only one camera module but does a <em>ton</em>of processing to stabilize and enhance it by overlaying a bunch of &quot;frames&quot; of a picture, then making some assumptions about what should be lit, what should be dark, what should be in focus, etc.  They are actually really good at it.  </p>
<p>The second method is instead of overlaying several sequential &quot;frames&quot; of a scene, it uses multiple versions of the same picture by taking pictures with multiple cameras at once. </p>
<p>That is mostly for low light shots and enhanced detail.  The current leader in this method is probably Samsung  But the other thing that it accomplishes is zoom.  Because it doesn't have the room to physically move the lenses, it uses different lenses.  So in the Samsung, it has 3 (forward facing) cameras.  A short focal length, a long focal length, and a wide angle (similar to a Gopro).  The phone uses software to switch between, or combine the cameras to get different effects.</p>
<p>A company called Oppo, just released a 10x optical zoom phone that has never been done before.  It does it by using a periscope type of setup so a long lens can be housed in the phone 90 degrees from the camera. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>3 reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>Multiple lenses and sensors allows them to create a single better image without it being necessary to have a much larger and expensive single lens or a much more expensive (and/or large) single sensor.</li>
<li>Allows the ability to take an optical zoom photo when one of the lenses is a telephoto (or wide angle, as the case may be).</li>
<li>Marketing.  </li>
