		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A priori, continuous time translation symmetry is broken by the drive to a discrete time symmetry with period T. To say that the remaining discrete time translation symmetry is spontaneously broken is to say that the Hamiltonian (which governs the evolution of the system) still has time translation symmetry with period T (i.e. H(t+T)=H(t)), but the <em>state</em> of the system only obeys a lower symmetry, in this case |\psi(t+NT)&gt;=l\psi(t)&gt;. We then would say that the time translation symmetry with period T was spontaneously broken to a time translation symmetry with period NT.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
