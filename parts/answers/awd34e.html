		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just read a quick article, hopefully It was accurate. Basically there is something in your throat called the glottis. The glottis will automatically open wide, to get oxygen in the lungs.  You won’t actually feel your glottis opening. Even when you’re swallowing, your body will automatically try to keep your glottis open. </p>
<p>Normally, when you aren’t crying, your glottis opens and closes when you swallow all day long. This ensures that food and spit go one way and air goes the other, with no mix-ups in between.</p>
<p>But, when you cry or are on the verge of crying, your glottis is trying to stay open, but gets forced close every time you swallow. This tension messes with the muscles in your throat, giving the sensation of a lump. Thus, making your throat feel closed and tight. </p>
<p>Edit: The epiglottis prevent the food from entering the throat into the airway during swallowing and to protect the glottis from any disruptions.   </p>
<p>Thank you for the correction u/xDrxGinaMuncher</p>
<p>Edit: fixed typo</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
