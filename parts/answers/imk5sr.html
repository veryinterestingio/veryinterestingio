		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Brown rice still has the fatty germ of the rice on it and so it spoils far faster than white rice which has had that removed. So most of the rice harvested is processed such that it has longer shelf life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Brown rice still has the bran and germ intact on the endosperm (the starchy white interior) while white rice is just the endosperm.</p>
<p>While brown rice is considered more nutritious, brown rice also goes bad (oils in the bran go rancid) much faster than white rice.</p>
<p>White rice can be stored for multiple years before it spoils while brown rice is only good for 12 to 24 months after it is harvested.</p>
<p>Hundreds of years ago, before refrigeration and better farming techniques were invented, making a food source that can be easily shipped or stored for long times without spoiling was more important than a more nutritious food that spoiled.</p>
<p>People got used to the flavor of white rice and that got considered the default rice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>sometimes the bran is pressed for oil and so it may be more economical to just sell the two products separately.</p>
<p>People may also be accustomed to certain ways of harvesting and processing and just not have a reason to change that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
