There had been news somewhat recently (e.g., <a href="https://news.weill.cornell.edu/news/2020/07/what-is-known-about-covid-19-and-abnormal-blood-clotting" target="_blank">Weill Cornell Medicine</a>, but already over two months old) that not only is COVID-19 causing blood clots in a lot of patients but that those clots were not necessarily responding to high doses of thinners. What makes clots respond differently to these drugs? Do we have more understanding more recently as to what about COVID-19 is causing these abnormal clots?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This question abounds on the internet and I was wondering an expert's take on it:</p>
<p>Would a daily glass of wine be as protective as a daily low dose aspirin in protecting blood vessels from clots?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello and welcome professor,</p>
<p>I have a question regarding a study which is maybe 10-15 years old now, that indicated an increased risk of travel-related venous thrombosis across all modes of travel. Being employed in the automotive industry, I see first-hand the tendency, or perhaps wish, to imagine vehicles as more of an entertainment cave for the passenger(s) rather than a medium of transportation that requires a certain amount of physical work. I was wondering if you had any thoughts on this ongoing trend. Cheers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I've been sitting a lot more recently since quarantine has limited my options for exercise, and I no longer walk to work since I&quot;m working at home. What do I need to do to reduce my risk of getting a blood clot?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Professor. My kids play video games, but I limit the time they play. Some of their friends can play for hours or days. Is there a risk for developing clots - even for teenagers and young adults - who sit for long periods of time gaming? I want other Moms to be informed! Thank you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
