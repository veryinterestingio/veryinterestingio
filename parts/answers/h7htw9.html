		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A proverb is typically a memorable, commonplace piece of advice: &quot;Never wake a sleeping bear.&quot;</p>
<p>An aphorism is more an observation: &quot;A bear in spring is always hungry.&quot;</p>
<p>An epigram is made to be clever or funny: &quot;Always respect mother nature. Especially when she weighs 400 pounds and is guarding her baby.&quot;</p>
<p>An adage is similar to a proverb, but tends to be less poetic and more of a definition: &quot;The best way to be kind to bears is not to be very close to them.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
