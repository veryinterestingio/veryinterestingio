		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Suppose they built it so that they could estimate the rover had a 1 in 1000 chance of failing by the 90th day - basically a guarantee (99.99% chance of making it 90 days). With that probability of failure, the chances of making it to the 5000th day would be something like 94.6%, so it's basically just a consequence of making that 90 day target as absolutely solid as they could.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Voyager's longevity is an interesting one, actually.  I'll see if I can dig out the relevant book at the weekend, but the summary version is they were over designed for the mission they did, because they were originally designed for a more ambitious one.</p>
<p>Interesting story with a bunch of NASA politics and guerrilla engineering in it, but I don't remember the specifics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They were designed to guarantee a goal.</p>
<p>Built by people with a passion and dedication rarely found. Because of this as well as some luck they kept on going.</p>
<p>Like Spirit and Opportunity were both designed to run for the short time. But NASA didn’t realise the winds of Mars would keep cleaning the solar panels.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>NASA absolutely overengineers the hell out of all their stuff. There isn't really a retrieval and fix option if anything breaks. With Opportunity in particular, it was assumed dust build up on the solar panels would kill the battery a lot quicker. But the dust was blown away by the wind, which wasn't entirely expected to happen. This was the luck part.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m just an undergrad engineer, but from what I understand NASA builds their projects with a minimal expectation for what needs to be accomplished. In other words, Opportunity only needed to survive 90 days to complete what was expected of it. So it was designed to survive a minimum of 90 days given very serious conditions. </p>
<p>But conditions were more favorable for the rovers than the initial expectations, leading to longer survival periods. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
