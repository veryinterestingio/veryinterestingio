		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You lose antibodies to many diseases over time. This is because there's no reason for your body to be expending time and energy to mass produce antibodies when the threat is gone. The key idea (that these studies do not test for) is the presence of T-cells that are dormant but are reactive against these pathogens. Re-challenge would lead these cells to proliferate and activate a whole cascade that results in more plasma cells producing antibodies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is absolutely false. Immunity after infection lasts for as long as we have measured it. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The immune systems of more than 95% of people who recovered from COVID-19 had durable memories of the virus up to eight months after infection. ... Antibodies against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, which the virus uses to get inside cells, were found in 98% of participants one month after symptom onset. As seen in previous studies, the number of antibodies ranged widely between individuals. But, promisingly, their levels remained fairly stable over time, <strong>declining only modestly at 6 to 8 months after infection.</strong></p>

<p>The media have done a terrible job covering this, consistently confusing scientists saying &quot;we don't know if immunity lasts for a long time&quot; with &quot;we know that immunity doesn't last a long time&quot;, but honestly it's on people as readers, too -- the media have so consistently pulled this pattern that responsible readers should recognize it and not get fooled. </p>
<p>We also know that vaccine-based immunity is going to be at least similarly long, in spite of media pulling the same click-bait tactic. Antibody responses to people who received the authorized vaccines in the earliest trials have persisted well, and show every sign of lasting for years.</p>
<p>Where vaccines are <em>better</em> than infection (apart from the obvious point about the vaccines not making you sick, killing you, or causing long-term symptoms) -- is that the vaccines <em>consistently</em> cause the immunity, where the actual infection is more inconsistent (after infection, “<em>the number of antibodies ranged widely between individuals</em>”). With the infection, very mild or asymptomatic infection <em>usually</em> gives long-lasting immunity, but it's not as predictable as with the more severe infections and it’s far less predictable than the response to the vaccines. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, in this study, we confirmed that rates of antibody positivity according to 3 commercial kits was still high at 8 months after infection, even in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic participants (69.0%–91.4%). </p>

<p>Notice that both this study and the one cited above looked at actual circulating antibodies, which will drastically underestimate immunity since memory T and B cells (which are far harder to measure) will still be present for much longer than antibody and will be able to rapidly respond to infection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;<strong>After having Covid, your body retains antibodies against it for only a short period of time. Why does the body essentially &quot;forget&quot; these antibodies?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>It doesn't magically forget, that is a myth based on flawed evidence.</p>
<p>There is an initial drop in antibody titre, which is simply a result of the immune system acting efficiently - there is no longer any need for a high level of antibodies once the virus is eliminated. Over the long term, a baseline level of antibodies is maintained.  This same pattern is observed after other infections (and vaccinations). This continues unless there is a reason why the specific memory B-cell linage dies out.</p>
<p>Reinfections of coronaviruses (not just SARS-CoV-2) can occur when the body is exposed to variants with substantially different receptor binding domains, such that the existing antibodies are unable to neutralise the infection effectively. This is just like what happens with seasonal Influenza viruses - after a few years, a substantially different variant comes along. The longer viruses circulate in human populations, the more variants (and strains) are possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There is also a population of B cells post infection which will differentiate into an antibody secreting plasmiblast cells which migrate to the bone marrow and continue secreting antibodies directly into the blood for months to years after the original infection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've anwered similar question before so I'll just copy my past answer:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Micro1ne/" target="_blank">u/Micro1ne</a> made a great point regarding the mutation rate of the pathogens and it is indeed the number one factor determining immunity lifespan. But sometimes the immunity itself just disappears, literally.</p>
<p>Long-term immunity rises from memory B cells. When a disease first hit, B cells will produce antibodies. Once the disease passes, some of these B cells will lay dormant. These are called memory B cells. Should the disease strike again, the memory B cells will re-activate, multiply, and flood our system with antibodies again.</p>
<p>Most literature teaches that memory B cells could survive for decades, but this is more nuanced than it appears. For starters, we're still not sure of:</p>
<ol>
<li>How the memory B cells could survive for so long, and</li>
<li><strong>How long they actually last</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Quoted from this <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4637268/" target="_blank">study</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because secondary antibody responses can be induced long after initial antigen encounter (5), it is generally assumed that individual memory B cells are exceptionally long-lived. However, current experimental evidence for this idea is varied and at times contradictory.<br />
...<br />
Several groups have since sought to define the lifespan of memory B cells, however the results have not led to a clear consensus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, this <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/336070a0" target="_blank">study</a> found that, in the absence of stimulating antigen, memory B cell population could disappear after 10-12 weeks, a far cry from the usually claimed decades.</p>
<p>So why do immunity sometimes last very long and sometimes not? There are a few hypotheses.</p>
<p>The same study hypothesized that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is known that pathogenic and attenuated viruses <strong>can persist for many years in other sites</strong>.<br />
...<br />
In conclusion, B-cell memory does not reside with very long-lived resting cells, but rather with clones that are maintained over long periods only by <strong>continued stimulation with small amounts of antigen persisting on follicular dendritic cells in lymphoid tissues or possibly elsewhere</strong>. Unless antigen is sequestered in this way, the increased frequency of antigen-specific precursors that results from immunization is transient. It remains to be seen if all immunological memory can be viewed as an ongoing immune response.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, immunity to some pathogens may last longer than others because these pathogens' leftover also persists for longer. Think of it like grains and meat: both are food, but grains could be stored for long period of time while meat spoils quickly.</p>
<p>There is also another hypothesis that T cells may have something to do with how long immunity last. Long ago I read a journal which made a compelling argument for this, but I couldn't find it again. For now, all I could find is this <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4540431/" target="_blank">study</a>, which found that B cells die three to four times faster in the absence of T cells. Maybe T cells don't perform very well against certain pathogens, thus immunity against these pathogens disappears faster.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we know that immunity could persist for varying amounts of time, but we don't know yet why.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
