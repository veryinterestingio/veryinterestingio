		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A computer's motherboard has a battery, known as the CMOS battery. This battery remembers all the basic BIOS settings on a computer and keeps track of the time and date. If you remove this battery and leave it off for a while you'll notice all BIOS settings have reset and your time will also have to be re-synced.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are not shutting it down completely. CP has a battery on the motherboard that is there to power the real-time clock and to keep bios setting.</p>
<p>For a desktop, it is often a button cell battery that is easy to switch but in a laptop, it is often soldered on. </p>
<p>Just looked at a motherboard like <a href="https://www.asus.com/se/Motherboards-Components/Motherboards/ProArt/ProArt-B550-CREATOR/" target="_blank">one of ASUS's current models</a> and the battery is trivial to spot. It is the large silver-colored circular you seed in just to below the initial P in  &quot;ProArt B550-CREATOR&quot; that is printed on the motherboard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not all computers do this.</p>
<p>I've tinkered with a Raspberry Pi 3, and it absolutely always needed to stay powered on or use an Internet service to know the time.</p>
<p>The difference between computers that can keep the time and ones that can't is a &quot;realtime clock&quot; (RTC) circuit or chip.</p>
<p>An RTC is typically powered by a little coin cell battery. On a PC, this battery is usually also used to retain some of the computer's basic hardware settings in its BIOS or UEFI.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're never truly off.  CMOS battery.  It keeps the board alive with a tiny amount of current to store settings and keep time.  If you're going to store a machine for more than a year, pull the battery.  Sometimes they corrode.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
