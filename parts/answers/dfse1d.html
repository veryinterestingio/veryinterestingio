		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The battery is the pond, the frame is ground, and the alternator is a pump. The flow runs to the sprinklers, and trickles back to the pond through the ground.</p>
<p>Batteries are part of a closed circuit. Cars complete the circuits using the metal body and frame.</p>
<p>It would be too much extra copper wire to have every circuit be fully wired, so the battery (-) is connected by a heavy gauge wire to the frame. The battery (+) is fused, and the current runs out to do whatever job it needs to do, and then is grounded to the frame and back to the battery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your basic understanding of how a car's electrical system works is correct. The chassis and all connected metal parts act as the car's &quot;ground&quot;, and are connected directly to the car's negative battery post. Electrons flow from the high potential source (battery positive post) through your device (the headlights or radio), through the ground, and back to the negative battery post.</p>
<p>But your question is how does the battery allow this to happen, and to get recharged without exploding?</p>
<p>The battery is a grid of lead plates sitting in a mix of water and acid. When the battery is fully charged, the plates are lead and lead-oxide, and the liquid is highly acidic. When you turn on your headlights or radio, the battery will start to discharge. A chemical reaction occurs, transforming chemical energy into electrical energy. As the electrons exit the battery, all the plates gradually turn into lead-sulfate, and the water-acid mixture gradually turns into just water. As you might imagine, this is a more chemically stable, low-energy state. This is where the battery wants to be, the goal is to control that flow of electrons. </p>
<p>When your engine starts, your alternator will begin working to recharge the battery. It essentially forces electrons to flow backwards, back into the battery. This reverses the chemical reaction, transforming the plates back into lead and lead-oxide, and making the liquid highly acidic again. Electrical energy has been converted into chemical energy. A healthy battery will store this energy safely, hopefully without any explosions! </p>
<p>However, if the battery is damaged, or if you short-circuit the posts, then you might end up releasing all that energy VERY quickly. That could result in an explosion, so try not to do that.</p>
<p>Another important bit of battery safety is that during rapid charging or discharging, hydrogen gas will be produced as part of the chemical reaction. If this gas meets a spark (say, from disconnecting a jumper cable), that could result in an explosion. That is why it's important to connect the negative end of your jumper cable to the chassis or other grounded metal component, instead of directly to the negative battery post. When you disconnect it, any spark will be far enough away from the battery that it won't ignite any potential hydrogen gas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So “ground” in this sense is just the lowest potential. You need the potential to do work like you said but it’s the difference between high and low that matters. </p>
<p>Analogy: For parts of your car to work, let’s say it needs a potential of a 10m waterfall. You could go from 210 down to 200m above sea level (or -30 to -40) if sea level is something you care about. But to your car, the 200m is 0 and the 210 is 10 and we don’t care where sea level is. </p>
<p>So if your battery is like a lake that has two elevations, when an application needs power, the waterfall opens up and you get current. You don’t lose water in the process it just has less potential now. Your car uses the alternator to push the water back up to the top elevation (charging) to be reused later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I hope what I'm saying is accurate, I'm just learning this stuff myself.</p>
<p>Ground is your vehicle frame. All it does is creates a &quot;quick return&quot; to your battery's negative terminal (-).</p>
<p>The frame is obviously a conductive metal, and needs to be the &quot;skeleton&quot; of the vehicle anyway so using it as a ground is easier than having to run twice as much wire back to the battery... it would look like a rat's nest and be more expensive if done that way.</p>
<p>Battery's very much <em>can</em> explode. When charging (boosting) and [possibly] discharging, hydrogen (flammable) gas is produced due to the chemical reaction inside the battery. This is one if the reasons you're supposed to hook jumper cables up a certain way...and not to create sparks by the battery (precautionary measures).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
