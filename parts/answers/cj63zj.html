		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A snake would absolutely try and bite a drone if it flew near it. Well at least some aggressive snakes would. They'd also bite stick, rocks, hands, cars, lawnmowers etc if they got too near to them and they felt threatened. Whether it thinks it's an animal is a bit too philosophical for them though. They know danger, they don't know animal. Some animals do show that they know what other animals are, usually prey, like mosquitos &quot;smell&quot; blood and probably wouldn't try and eat a tree unless they were very confused.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our state conservation magazine had a cover photo of a guy on a lawnmower right near a bear. The bear would run off if it saw a human (smarter than the average bear), but a human on a noisy lawnmower wasn't scary at all, and the bear would ignore it, going about it's business munching blackberries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
