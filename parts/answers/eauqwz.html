		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Look up a false vacuum or vacuum decay. It's what happens when the potential energy from a Higgs field is released and a false vacuum turns into a true vacuum. When this happens, a bubble of energy expands in all directions at the speed of light, consuming all matter and converting it into pure energy and stabilizing all space at the same time. If the true vacuum hit us, we wouldn't even know it because it would pass over the entire earth in a split second. Scary stuff until you realize none of us would feel pain and it would all be over in a moment.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The whole universe? Vaccuum decay could do it. If the universe happens to be in a state of false vacuum and some bit of it achieved true vacuum then the true vacuum bubble would expand at the speed of light until it consumed the universe. There would be fundamental changes in constants of nature. Not only would life as we know it end but not even basic chemistry would survive intact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The closest event that comes to mind is an intense close <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_burst" target="_blank">gamma-ray burst.</a> These sorts of events happen routinely in the universe when massive bodies clash together during mergers or supernovas.  Thankfully it's very, very unlikely that something like this will happen close enough to Earth to kill us all. But terrifyingly (or mercifully?) if it did, then we would have no way of seeing it coming since the gamma rays would travel at the speed of light so the moment we would see it happening is when we would already be dead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as <em>all</em> of existence, like the entire universe? The closest I can think of is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_vacuum" target="_blank">vacuum decay</a>, and that's an extremely speculative idea. Even that wouldn't destroy the entire universe because it can't move faster than the speed of light, while spacetime expansion moves much faster across large scales.</p>
<p>Things that could destroy us on earth without any warning are much more common; for example, we wouldn't have any warning at all of a gamma ray burst. We could potentially have warning of an asteroid impact, but we also might not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is a different answer for something that could wipe out all of *humanity* before we see it coming:  </p>
<p>A chunk of <strong>strange quark matter</strong> hits the earth.  This stuff is theorized to be ejected from colliding neutron stars... and it would act like a virus, corrupting any matter that it touches, turning that matter into strange matter.</p>
<p>If a lump of this stuff hit the Earth, then very quickly, the planet be converted to strange quark matter, eliminating humanity.  (except for the lucky folks on the ISS, who might live a few months longer).</p>
<p>Here is a deeply fascinating video on the topic:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_8yK2kmxoo" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p\_8yK2kmxoo" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p\_8yK2kmxoo</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
