		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Disclaimer- I have never done a liver transplant, but I have done hundreds of kidney transplants and there are certain basic principles of vascular surgery that apply to both. However, I don't know the ins and outs particular to liver. Maybe someone with liver transplant experience can correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
<p>Blood vessels have an inherent degree of stretch to them that can be used to overcome discrepancies in lumen diameter. The amount varies depending on the vessel type (artery vs. vein) and on the degree of stiffness or atherosclerosis if it is an artery.</p>
<p>If the inherent stretch isn't enough, there are several tricks that can be applied in different scenarios. For example, you can spatulate the blood vessel (cut a short slit in it) to effectively increase the circumference of its opening. It's hard to explain but you can model it by cutting a slit in a paper tube to see how it can make the opening of the tube wider. You need to have enough length to spatulate though, as doing so shortens the vessel.</p>
<p>In some scenarios, instead of attaching the vessels end-to-end, you can attach them end-to-side, making a T junction. Doing this allows you to cut a new hole of the appropriate size for your anastomosis (blood vessel joining) as you aren't forced to join two ends of a certain size. Again, this requires excess length.</p>
<p>In other scenarios, you can use a piece of the donor's own blood vessels from elsewhere in the body to fashion a graft that bridges the gap between the donor's and the recipient's blood vessels. However, this can only be done in deceased donors, as a living donor needs all of their other blood vessels. I assume you're asking about living donation because it is framed as a partial liver transplant.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Here' a cool video from the University of Toronto showing a pediatric liver transplant with an anastomosis between two different-sized arteries to illustrate the point.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For some of the more important vessels, the surgeons can connect them together. The body also has it's own mechanisms for reconnecting and supplying blood vessels where they're needed. That's why some cancers get so well supplied, it hijacks that system by requesting more blood than it should or that can be immediately supplied.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we’re doing a liver transplant, we plan around the vascular anatomy. For a full liver, we often keep the donor vena cava attached posteriorly (with hepatic veins draining into it) and do a connection between the donor IVC and the recipient. Hepatic artery is connected directly (usually we save donor vessels closer to the origin) and portal vein is connected directly. Angiogenesis plays a very small role, because as someone pointed out below, there isn’t much tolerance for warm ischemia time (it dies fast with no blood flow). </p>
<p>The gist is you don’t need to make a thousand tiny connections, you just need to connect the big ones and rely on the vascular networks that are already in place. I’ve never done a partial, but the principle is the same. </p>
<p>Regarding size mismatch, many anastomoses (connections) are made end-to-side rather than end-to-end (picture a branch off a tree trunk rather than two pipes layed in series), so mismatch is not as important. </p>
<p>So yeah. We sew them all, but there are fewer connections than you probably thought.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Sewing in the new liver: First, venous blood flow is re-established by connecting the donor's and the recipient's inferior vena cava and portal veins. Next, arterial flow is re-established by sewing the donor's and recipient's hepatic arteries. Finally, biliary drainage is achieved by sewing the donor's and recipient's common bile ducts.&quot;</p>

<p>As with any procedure there are standard complications of anastamotic leak..which usually resolve by themselves with proper observation and monitoring...but in case of major leaks the patient would have to be re explored</p>
<p>Transplant and Vascular surgeons are really a dime a dozen</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So blood vessels are like tree branches. The little microscopic ones branch off of bigger ones and still bigger ones ones and so on and so forth until you get to the really big vessels that you can see and manipulate. When you do a partial liver transplant, you don't reconnect all the little vessels, you cut out the chunk of liver you're taking and the largest blood vessels that go into and out of it, and reconnect those vessels into the corresponding vessels, and there usually isn't a size mismatch. If there is, you can plug the donor vessel into the side of the other vessel. The rest of it takes care of itself.</p>
<p>This is super simplified, of course, and I've only scrubbed into one partial liver (on the donor side). But generally there are only like 4 major vessel connections you care about in a liver: the hepatic artery, the portal vein, the bile duct, and the inferior vena cava.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
