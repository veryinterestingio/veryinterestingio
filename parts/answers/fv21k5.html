		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Viruses do not have metabolism nor can reproduce by themselves, which are the reasons some argue are not really living things. Nevertheless, they carry DNA, (or RNA). During replication inside host cells small errors happen. Thus, viruses do evolve like all other living things. The most ancient precursor of life was probably some self-replicating organic molecule. That sounds similar to a virus, except again viruses need a host cell to replicate, so probably some other life forms evolved first.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A virus that persists (is able to parasitise its host &amp; also survive between hosts) must have some genetic material (DNA or RNA), a covering to protect itself, and a means to gain entry to host cells &amp; commandeer the cellular machinery to make more virus particles. That means, of course, that its genetic material must code for all of that. The process of replicating genetic material isn't always perfect. Mistakes (mutations) occur. Most result in defective products &amp; are a dead end. A few might confer a reproductive advantage &amp; would be amplified by that very success.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some are probably an ancient divergence off the first organism that can self replicate. Once you have the core replication machinery in place, it's ripe for a freeloader to use it parasitically. It may depend on the virus, though. Some are so large and complex that it's possible, even likely, they evolved more recently from sort of cell parasite that gradually pared away functions until it was technically classified as a virus. Typically, viruses have such short generation times and such high mutation rates that questions of origin or age are almost totally impossible to approach from computational analysis. The evolutionary distance between HIV and HTLV-1 (a retrovirus that infects humans, so same family of viruses and same host) is impossible to assess because their mutation rate is so high. It could be 10,000 years or 10 million for all we know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
