		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m a librarian with no medical and minimal scientific training. My community is yearning for a chance to talk about Death, so I’ve been hosting monthly Death Cafes so that the adults in my area have a safe place to come talk about all topics death. As a medical professional, is there anything you think laypeople like myself and the people I serve should know about death and dying? Are there any common myths or misconceptions you wish were dispelled? </p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
