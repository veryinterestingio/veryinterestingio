		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every element has its own characteristic spectrum of light, so we can look for this fingerprint in the light we receive. Since hydrogen is by far the most abundant element, we expect the spectrum of hydrogen to feature prominently. However, the features of the hydrogen spectrum won't appear at the same wavelengths as they do when we measure hydrogen in the lab, because of the red shift. </p>
<p>Instead, the spectrum is shifted by a certain amount. But despite the shift, the structure remains unchanged, so we can identify the spectral lines of hydrogen in the light we collect. And by the amount it has shifted from what we measure in the lab, we can obtain an estimate for the speed with which the source is moving away from us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like in music, if you sing a song with each note being shifted by same amount (like one octave higher) you can still identify it as the same song. </p>
<p>Similarly, the entire song of hydrogen just gets red shifted by the same amount, but we are still able to identify it as being hydrogen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One universal constant is how much hydrogen it takes to ignite a white dwarf into nova; it has to do with a certain threshold of gravity to ignite fusion. As such, all novas are pretty much the same; they're called &quot;standard candles&quot; and can be used to estimate the relative velocity of a galaxy based on the red or blue shift. This is a great technique to supplement emission spectrum analysis from the elements</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Basically, That.</p>
<p>Red shift and blue shift will shift those bands to the left or right (thus the name), but the distances between each black band stays the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I assume you are sneaking in these questions..  </p>
<p>1). How do cosmologists know that redshift is not caused by atoms shrinking slowly over time?</p>
<p>2). How do cosmologists know that redshift is not caused by the mass of all particles slowly increasing over time?</p>
<p>3).  Out of the 56 different causes that could create what looks like redshift, why did cosmologists go with the cosmic expansion idea?</p>
<p>I will assume this is what you were really asking. If this is not what you meant, stop me now before I say anything else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
