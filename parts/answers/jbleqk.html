		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a few questions :
1) Does the Captain of ISS lead all the teams aboard regardless of their nationality? If not how often do you interact?
2) Do astronauts often get existential thoughts when looking at the earth from a distance? Or are they the pros?
3) Have two ppl who are dating ever sent to the ISS ? Or has someone started dating once they were aboard?
Cheers !!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
