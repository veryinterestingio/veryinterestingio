		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The technical people answering are technically correct, that a voltmeter would indicate the voltage of a battery, but they’re missing what OP is after: when won’t a battery work anymore? In other words, they are wondering “why can’t I know the health of my battery?”</p>
<p>With car batteries (the 12V lead acid type) the voltage isn’t really a good indicator of health. An old dead battery can read ~12V just fine. It would likely power most lights and equipment, too. The real test of health comes when trying to start the engine; the “load” test. An old battery can read 12V until asked to turn the starter, then immediately drops to an unusable voltage. </p>
<p>The simple answer is that traditional 12V car batteries do not have the sophisticated tech to indicate their health like, say, laptop batteries. Nor is there a good way to test the health except for hooking the battery to a load, which isn’t an easy thing to build into a car’s circuitry. Basically, starting the engine IS the load test.</p>
<p>Edit: To all those asking why a load tester couldn’t be added into the hardware or software of a car: it could. Nearly anything is possible with time and money. But I agree with the comments from those in the industry; it comes down to three basic things:</p>
<p>1) Added cost (automotive margins are very thin)
2) Added complexity and engineering effort for nearly no return (exactly who would truly want this?)
3) Service side (auto companies do not wish customers to have to think about maintenance beyond knowing to take the vehicle in when the light turns on)</p>
<p>Edit 2: Since this blew up from my original simple answer, we’ve attracted the attention of my more astute engineering colleagues. It appears my answer is a little dated. The fact is that this diagnostic capability DOES exist in more modern vehicles. But just as auto companies have chosen to shroud engines in giant swaths of plastic to hide the ugly technical bits, so have they chosen to hide most of these diagnostic abilities from the consumer behind a simple light or “Service Soon” message. Good discussion!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a battery light that pops up when battery voltage is low on some cars. Diagnosing lead-acid battery health is not as simple as measuring voltage, it can be near full voltage and go down super low when you actually try and draw power. You're required to change batteries often enough that it shouldn't be a problem, but many people only change them when they die leaving them in a field.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Batteries in traditional (i.e. gasoline-powered internal combustion engine) cars are only used for (a) powering the starter motor to start the engine or (b) running electrical features (e.g. radio, lights) when the engine isn't running. Car batteries are automatically re-charged by the alternator, which uses power from the engine to generate electricity while the engine is running, both for re-charging the battery and running electrical features of the car. </p>
<p>Traditional car batteries don't really store that much energy, since their primary purpose is only to power the starter motor that gets the combustion engine running. Basically, they need to put out one big boost to start the engine, then they get automatically re-charged once the engine is humming. So there are two reasons your car battery will die: </p>
<ol>
<li>The alternator is failing to do it's job, so, while driving, anything that relies on electricity like lights or windshield wipers or radio will drain the battery instead of getting electricity from the alternator. </li>
<li>The engine isn't running, but something else is draining the battery. E.g. lights are left on while the car isn't running or there's a short somewhere in the electrical system. </li>
</ol>
<p>Most modern cars (at least in the US) <em>have</em> an alternator/battery-warning dashboard light that comes on when the alternator is failing to provide sufficient power to re-charge the battery. That takes care of #1. </p>
<p>However, #2 occurs when the engine isn't running ... which usually means you aren't in the car. Since a car battery doesn't store all that much energy on its own, if you're away from the car for a few hours with something draining the battery, it's not going to start when you get back to the car. (And if it didn't drain the battery enough to prevent the car from starting, then the battery will be re-charged by the engine as soon as you start driving again.) </p>
<p>So, as long as your alternator is working correctly, your battery generally won't have issues. Cars have warning lights to let the driver know if the alternator is failing. But if your battery loses its charge for some other reason (e.g. human error or electrical system problems), it's going to go from a usable charge to insufficient charge to start the car pretty quickly <em>while you're not driving and not in the car</em>, so a warning light isn't any help. </p>
<p>TL;DR: if you leave your car lights on overnight, a warning light that you're draining the battery isn't much use while you're asleep in bed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even a bad battery can show you 12v. But as soon as a load is present, drop to 8v.
When you test the battery in the shop, a big load is put on, for example some heating coils (inside the tester). It should be hard to automate this and not overstrain the battery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, mechanic here. Some (most?) trucks have a battery volt meter in the instrument cluster that reads the voltage at the battery (for simplicitys sake). Cars, not so much, but as stated theres a battery light in the cluster. Toyotas light up the abs and vsc light (if I'm not mistaken) when the alternator goes out and the car is running on battery power alone.</p>
