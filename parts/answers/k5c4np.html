		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes it doesn't, people have been known to wake up with snot all over the pillow. When it does stop it is normally because the nasal passages swell which prevent both snot and air from going through them. The nasal passages tend to swell completely shut when you are laying down. When you treat a cold with advil + sudafed you are dramatically reducing the swelling in the nose so you can blow the crud out of your nose more easily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

For most people it just runs down the back of their throat into either the stomach or lungs where it lodges unless you are able to cough it up in the morning. If you can’t cough it up it may become pneumonia.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
