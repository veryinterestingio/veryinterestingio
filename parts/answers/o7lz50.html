		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question! </p>
<p>Some researchers wanted to know too and wrote a paper about it. In short, geckos stick to the wall through van der Waals forces and friction, this was already known. In the paper they took live geckos and recently euthanized geckos and dragged their feet across a surface. They found that the adhesive force did not change after death and concluded that geckos can not control their clinging to a wall. Itâ€™s an entirely passive process. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is the Van Der Waals force still believed to be behind most reptile wall adhesion? There is a 2014 paper that concludes the following for geckos:</p>
<p>&quot;We have demonstrated that it is the CE-driven electrostatic interactions which dictate the strength of gecko adhesion, and not the Van der Waals or capillary forces which are conventionally considered as the main source of gecko adhesion.&quot;</p>

<p>The wiki article for Van Der Waals force also references this finding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
