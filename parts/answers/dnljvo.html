		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is still a lot of research that needs to be done, and unfortunately due to the bullshit scheduling of cannabis for so many years, we don't know as much as we should right now.</p>
<p>But the essence of what we do know now is that our bodies have an entire network called the endocannabinoid system. When introducing the elements in cannabis into our bodies, the receptors in that system bind to certain elements to varying effect. Certain canabinoids like CBD have been shown to regulate certain immune functions, like inflammation, and this is one area where we are seeing potential for medical application.</p>
<p>As far as snake oil goes, it's really just a matter of how it's being marketed. With cannabis becoming legal in so many states, people looking to make money are jumping at the opportunity and being downright deceptive in stating what CBD is capable of. There's also the matter of how it is ingested, and if it is an extract, how it is extracted. There are good ways to get concentrates from cannabis now, but plenty of sketchy, &quot;hot dog water,&quot; synthesized CBD and THC concentrates also. Similarly, with how it is ingested, some ways are better than others in terms of bioavailability. AFAIK, with CBD, sublingual and through vaporization, seem to be the most effective methods.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basic pharmacology stuff: All drugs work by binding to a receptor. Receptors are specific types of protein structures that act like a one-line telephone that penetrates the walls of a cell. In a no-drug state, your bodies' own chemicals (hormones + neurotransmitters) will bind to them (like a key in a keyhole) to transmit a signal. When a receptor has something bind to it, the part of the receptor inside the cell will release other chemicals that change how the cell behaves. For muscle cells, this could mean &quot;contract&quot;. For nerve cells, this could mean &quot;become more sensitive to other signals&quot;.</p>
<p>In essence, it's a form of signalling, how one part of the body communicates with the other.</p>
<p>Drugs are like keys that are shaped close enough to the body's own keys that they can still fit into the keyhole. If the drug fits in, and causes the receptor to activate, it's an <em>agonist</em>. If it fits in but just blocks it up, it's an <em>antagonist</em>.</p>
<p>Example: caffeine is an <em>antagonist</em> at the adenosine receptors. Adenosine is a waste product that your body builds up when you're awake, and adenosine receptors, when activated, make you tired and sleepy. Blocking them with caffeine makes the receptors unable to measure the adenosine level, and consequently, you stay awake.</p>
<p>From what I understand, CBD is an antagonist of endocannabinoid receptors and has action at a few other receptors whose functions are not yet known. It also has partial action at the <em>opioid receptors</em>, making them more sensitive to the endorphins that are normally produced.</p>
<p>A quick little thing about how pain is perceived. The nerves that send pain signals to the brain must pass through a part of the lower brainstem called the <em>dorsal horn</em>. The dorsal horn has a microstructure akin to a switch: a means for the brain to literally disconnect the incoming pain signal. Nearly all pain-relieving drugs work by activating this switch. The cells that make up this switch are covered in opioid receptors, and activating those receptors is how opioids relieve pain.</p>
<p>Since CBD turns up the signalling of opioid receptors, amplifying the effect of endogenous opioids, I suspect this is the principle mechanism by which it reduces pain.</p>
<p>As for how it stops seizures, that goes beyond my knowledge.</p>
<p>I can safely say this, however: anyone who says that the effect is a placebo is bullshitting. The fact that these substances have activity at these receptors (and can cross the blood-brain barrier) means that they must have real effects. <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2019/09/27/JNEUROSCI.0708-19.2019" target="_blank">Studies like this one prove they have real effects.</a> (ironically, the existence of psychoactive terpenoid compounds in some essential oils means not all of those essential oil therapies are bullshit either). The recent phenomenon of folks getting admitted to hospital for CBD overdoses definitively demonstrates that these are real effects.</p>
<p>The full range and nature of the effects, however, is not entirely known yet (thanks to the War on Drugs), but I think the government is actually starting to realize this. Don't discount the political and economic bullshit going on here either. There is a lot of money in competing industries that stand to lose market share to a more effective product. Spreading the claim that CBD is a snake oil delegitimizes it as a medicine. Conversely, the selling of actual snake oil is nothing new (see: homeopathy, faith-based healing, etc.) and there are a ton of companies out there who are taking advantage of the informational asymmetry inherent in medicine markets to sell CBD as a panacea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't believe there's much scientific evidence that it does much, the exception being for the treatment of some childhood seizure syndromes, but it's being sold heavily for treatment of other issues for which there is limited or no evidence of efficacy. Plenty of people believe it does something for them, which could very easily be a placebo effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
