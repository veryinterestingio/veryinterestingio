<p>Eventually you get a car whose instructions are too far gone to read, you accidentally build a Pontiac Aztec and it’s game over.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the end of your dna is a portion of &quot;junk&quot; DNA called telomeres. The purpose of telomeres is to prevent DNA damage when cells divide. Every time a cell divides a little bit of the telomeres is lost. When you run out of telomeres then your dna is damaged in the cell division process, meaning it no longer functions effectively. This is aging, and the reason we die.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s a sort of biological limit to the number of time cells can replicate due to factors others have mentioned. </p>
<p>Interestingly, I’ve read that one gene that helps control for this longevity also affects likelihood of reproduction. For most of history, it’s been more valuable from an evolutionary standpoint to have lots of kids than it is to be able to live far beyond our current lifespan, so the gene over time tipped to that side of the scale. </p>
<p>In theory, then, and if it was ethical, we could genetically engineer these markers back in the other direction and have much longer lives. Assuming what I read was correct, after all. In modern society, if we were healthier for longer, longer lives would often lead to more reproduction (many if not most people are waiting much longer to have kids), so perhaps over time we will see evolution tip the scales the other direction. Millions of years doesn’t help us right now, though. </p>
<p>Just food for thought!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For those as old as me, it was ELI5 to me as this - take a VHS and copy it, discard the original. The copy looks pretty good. </p>
<p>Follow this same process and eventually it won't look so great.</p>
<p>I suppose a modern equivalent of this is to repeatedly apply 'lossy' compression to an image - i.e. repeatedly encode an image where information is discarded at each turn, eventually it degrades (gets old) to the point of being non-functional.</p>
<p>In other words - cells don't replicate perfectly. In time, these imperfections accumulate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
