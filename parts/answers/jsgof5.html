		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since you're feeling this way after about 4 days it's most likely your blood CO (carbon monoxide) levels. CO binds to hemoglobin (the stuff in your blood that carries oxygen) much more strongly than oxygen can, so when you smoke and introduce CO to your body it binds to your hemoglobin and prevents your blood from carrying as much oxygen as it should be. This affects all of your body systems as all of your cells require oxygen to function. Your brain is getting more oxygen now which is why you feel more &quot;clarity&quot;. </p>
<p>Keep up the good work, not smoking gets easier and easier the longer you do it!</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Enjoy <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/oFL9xVJZrpEUtPzU8" target="_blank">this infographic</a> detailing the other benefits you can expect to see in the future both short and long term!</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> A couple of people have asked if Marijuana has the same effect. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3340105/" target="_blank">This study</a> suggests that the amount of CO in the blood (here referred to as carboxyhemoglobin, that is CO bound to hemoglobin) is 5x higher after smoking &quot;marijuana cigarettes (741 to 985 mg) containing 0.004 percent or 1.24 percent delta 9-tetrahydrocanabinol&quot; vs &quot;single filter-tipped tobacco cigarettes (900 to 1200 mg)&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 3 because I just realized this is ELI5 (what the heck kind of 5 year old is smoking?):</strong> Okay little one. First off I'm super proud of you for kicking the habit. It's not an easy feat when you're also dealing with the stresses of choosing what kind of cereal you like best and trying to do important work with dried out play-dough.</p>
<p>Basically, the reason you feel so much better at this point is because your body is getting more fresh air. Now to explain that further. There's these little &quot;boats&quot; in your blood called hemoglobin. The purpose of these boats is to give a ride to &quot;fresh air&quot; called oxygen from your lungs to all of your body parts. The fresh air has to reach every single part of your body so that those parts can breathe, all the way from your little piggy toes up to that big brain of yours. </p>
<p>Now, when you smoke those nasty cigarettes instead of breathing in fresh air you're breathing in lots of these big mean bullies called Carbon Monoxide, we'll call it &quot;CO&quot; for short. CO <em>really, really</em> likes boat rides. In fact, CO likes riding on the boats so much that it will just stay on the boat instead of getting off when it's had its turn. The fresh air may try to get on the boat too, and some may be able to squeeze on, but until CO gets off the boat there's not room for very much fresh air at all. This means that your body parts don't get the fresh air that they need and your brain and body feel crummy :( </p>
<p>When you stop smoking for a while, then enough of the CO gets bored and gets off the boats allowing the fresh air to go for a ride and let your brain and your body breathe and feel happy and healthy again. ❤️</p>
<p>Now don't get me started on that sugar habit of yours...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

But if I walk into a building where people are smoking my body still perks up as if it wants to smoke. So you'll be tempted but if you have made it this far you can keep it up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m in about the same place, I quit on the 5th.  Thought I would be far more miserable than I currently am.  The main thing seems to be breaking the “oh, now would be a good time to smoke” habit.   Just have to keep reminding myself we dont do that anymore</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nicotine contains nicotinic acid which causes blood vessels to constrict.  Smoke particles are also foreign bodies at a microscopic level.  This triggers a constant low grade inflammatory and immune response.  Your blood vessels are now more relaxed meaning circulation is better.  You body is also no longer expending resources on that inflammatory immune response. Your lungs are also getting clean air.  As withdraw fades you may also sleep better.
Good job!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
