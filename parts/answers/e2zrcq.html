		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Being exposed to abrupt cold like a shower or wind can provoke your body into releasing adrenaline, which makes you more alert. However, it’s important to note this in no way speeds up your ability to process alcohol (which decreases intoxication), so you’re just as drunk as you would be without the shower/wind. Your body’s blood alcohol level decreases at a fixed rate.</p>
<p>Edit since this got waaay more attention than I thought it would:</p>
<p>I know this is simplified with some other factors at play, and I know there’s stuff you can do on the margins to affect metabolism of ethanol. It didn’t seem worth diving into because it’s ELI5 and I wanted to hammer home the general rule that your body works through intoxication at a measured pace you don’t have much control over. Also I was eating soup and it’s hard to type one handed.</p>
<p>To the person saying it’s because of the mammalian dive reflex, it is not. That helps you hold your breath underwater by concentrating oxygen in essential regions, and (I think) is largely triggered by water all up and around your nostrils.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
