<p>Hatmaking has more steps to it than you'd imagine.</p>
<p>Edit to add: I misread/misinterpreted OPs bit about cotton. </p>
<p>Oilskin and waxed cotton use precisely what it sounds like to toughen up the cotton/denim base after the hat has been sewn.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the cotton is not so much a fabric, but a compound in this case. cotton is from a plant that when it blooms, it creates a white, fluffy ball on top like <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2497/5092/products/2017-12-03_200712_1200x1200.jpg?v=1548405383" target="_blank">this</a>. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>instead of the cotton being woven, it's being felted (very likely by machine). the felting is similar to wool felting (presure/movement, heat and water, sometimes soap), but with cotton it can take longer as the fibers of cotton are different from wool. you also have polyester felting (most crafting felts are made of this).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>to get to the desired shape, a sheet of the felt is placed on a dummy head/mold, and it's heated and made wet to shape it. this can be done either by hand or by machine.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>to get the leather finish it's possible to add a coating that mimics it, though I don't have much knowledge on that specifically. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>to get the weathered look, there are machine or tools for that (probably similar to how stone washed/weathered jeans are made).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work as a cutter/draper at the Houston Grand Opera and have quite a bit of experience with millinery for theater. In theater, we generally work with 5 types of hats - felt, straw, leather, fabric covered buckram, and cloth. I'm going to assume that what you're asking about is the process of making felt hats. In theater, we purchase felt bases to save a bit of time in the blocking process. If you're making a brimmed hat, you want to start with a cartwheel base, and for a hat with no brim or a very small brim, you'll want a hood. There are a wide variety of felts available these days ranging from the basic wool felt to fancier varieties like angora rabbit and velvet. Felting is the process by which staple fibers are matted together, generally using moisture, heat, pressure, and friction to create a textile that is dense, durable, and water resistant. </p>
<p>Once you've got your felt, the next step is blocking. Hat blocks consist of two parts that work together to form a blocked hat - the crown block and the brim block. These blocks are made of soft wood so that the milliner can pin the felt in the desired position as she works. First the milliner selects the correct crown and brim blocks for the desired hat shape and size. Then she begins blocking, which is just a fancy way of saying she uses steam to release the felt fibers so that she can slowly but surely stretch the felt over the block. If you've never seen this done, I suggest watching some YouTube videos on the process. Steam works magic on all natural textiles but the way steam and pressure seems to make the felt melt into hat blocks is still fascinating to me after all these years. Once the felt is blocked and pinned, it is allowed to sit and cool.</p>
<p>Once blocked, the milliner releases the felt from the block and sizes it. Sizing is really just a mixture of chemicals that hardens the felt so it stays doesn't deform with normal wear and tear. Depend of what kind it is, it is either sprayed or brushed on before or after blocking. Sizing comes in a variety of forms these days. Way back in the day, when hatters were going mad, sizing and glues used in millinery were extremely toxic. Unfortunately for us, the most effective sizing chemicals are still the toxic ones. Non toxic sizing is available, and we use it, but you won't get the same rock hard results that you find in true vintage hats.</p>
<p>Once the hat is blocked and sized, the trimming can commence! These days, commercially made hats are pretty much all glued together, including any trims applied around the brim. In the millinery world, glue is a huge no-no. A hat should seem as though every ribbon and feather was blown onto it by a happy accidental wind. For the milliner, this means everything must be delicately placed hand sewn. The result is a gorgeous hat that can be retrimmed for a different look year after year. When hats were worn daily by people of all classes, this was a must. Generally, people would have one or two felts and a similar quantity of straw hats and would retrim them every season for a fresh look.</p>
<p>I hope I've answered your question! If y'all have any more questions about costume shops, theater life, or garment production don't hesitate to ask. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>From what I remember so possibly incorrect in details:</em> </p>
<p>Fur-felt is (after being turned, from the finer under-fur, into felt 'sheets' - during which process it hooks together and matts up) extruded (stretched) and dampened and then shrunk and dried into finished form (bit like a banjo vellum).  </p>
<p>It's at that point quite a dense compacted material. Also from memory - hats can get weird if wet, almost positive non-synthetic modern hats are waterproofed/sprayed. I know there are fixers like a hat-starch.  </p>
<p>It'd be interesting to see what the knowledgeable answer is to this one, I looked it up once trying to find out what mercury was used for in the hat process, seems it's slightly superfluous. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
