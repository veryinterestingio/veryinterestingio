		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scientists believe that this happens to about 50% of people.  They have studied it in music listeners and theorize that it is linked to being &quot;surprised&quot; by an unexpected change in the music.  Like during a really cool &quot;part&quot; of the music.</p>
<p>Brain scans show that different areas of the brain light up brighter in people who feel this while it is happening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sensation you described is called piloerection. It's the same sensation we encounter when we are inspired, hear a certain song, something moves us deeply. It's literally when we are in awe of something and our body reacts (kind of like a body orgasm). It supposedly comes from when predators use to attack us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would assume some parasympathetic nervous system response something along the lines of ASMR.</p>
<p>Edit: forgot I was on ELI5... Basically certain stimuli(breathing a certain way, certain sounds/lights/smells, etc.) Stimulate the lesser nerve clusters in your spine and such, causing unusual sensations. Which is part of why deep breathing meditation and such have physical health benefits) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
