		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With so many differing opinions and thoughts on health and weight loss, it is very difficult to separate what are known truths and developing theories. One quote that stuck with me from my undergraduate nutrition class at Chapel Hill went something like this:</p>
<p>&quot;There are no great diets, the only good diet is one that you can stick to&quot;</p>
<p>This led me down a rabbit hole of deconstructing all of my previous held beliefs about diet and exercise. Googling brings up so much snake oil its near impossible to distinguish fact from fiction. And with what you have included in your post, even something as simple and widespread as CICO has flaws. Personally my beliefs have been deconstructed so much the only thing I feel I can trust is an ephemeral &quot;diet and exercise are good for you&quot;.</p>
<p>In your expert opinion, <strong>what are actionable steps that anyone in any situation can take to have a healthier lifestyle regarding nutrition?</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very excited to read the book. One finding from your team that I found particularly interesting is the similar daily energy expenditure between Hadza and US adults despite the seismically greater levels of physical activity in the Hadza. </p>
<p>My question is in regard to this finding, and the implication that exercise doesn’t lead to an increase in daily energy expenditure. I wonder what would you expect to see if instead of looking cross-sectional between two populations (one habitually active, one habitually inactive), but instead looked longitudinally at individuals who increase their physical activity. </p>
<p>My way of thinking about this is if you took a seasoned runner and a complete novice (but otherwise matched) and asked them to run at the same intensity for a set period of time, we would expect the seasoned runner to cover a far greater distance. If we subsequently asked the novice to complete the same distance as the seasoned runner, they would either have to increase the intensity (heart rate) at which they are running or the duration for which they are running (in either case increasing their active energy expenditure).</p>
<p>Coming back to the US, <strong>if we asked habitually inactive individuals to be as active as the Hadza, would there be an increase in their daily energy expenditure (until they become as efficient at the activity as the experienced exercisers)?</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You seem to be making a case for an anthropological approach to understanding diet and exercise. </p>
<p>I’m curious why do you think the study of nutrition has had such trouble coming to the right conclusions of over time given that human biology is pretty fixed over the last 100 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I watched some documentaries about fat and sugar. And, in that content it says that sugar (added in many different ways) is really the enemy to our bodies than any other thing acting as an inflammatory.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Does dieting cause metabolism slow down or starvation mode? More precisely - what kind of dietary change is needed to cause a 10% change in your relative basal metabolic rate (relative to your weight)? 20%? </p>
<p>I'd love to know the answer in both directions - what would it take to cause a 10% decrease, and a 10% increase?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
