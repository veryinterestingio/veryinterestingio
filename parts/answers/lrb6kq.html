		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What are you thoughts on leveling the playing field by mandating medical entities follow the law when it comes to transparency with regards to pricing. Or enacting such governance as:</p>
<ul>
<li>100% publicly visible pricing</li>
<li>Disclosures of actual price to be charged for each event prior to service and signed by both parties</li>
<li>Non-billable events: events caused by poor treatment (e.g. MRSA as a result of surgery)</li>
<li>Medical records belong to the patient down to the last period, and are due immediately upon request in a transportable format</li>
<li>All medical surgery providers must provide all instances of all complications and negative outcomes on a monthly basis for consumption by the public (de-identified). </li>
<li>Non-requirement of imagine from the provider. You get to chose the imaging provider and all images must be accepted by the primary</li>
<li>You can freely have any test you deem necessary that doesn't require an Rx or Radiation without prior approval from a doctor (e.g. A1C)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are lot more I can share, but let's start with those.. I think these will drive costs down tremendously because it will spur accountability and competition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How do we address the waning personal responsibility for ones health? There are many modifiable risk factors that contribute to long-term health outcomes for our most cost-intensive disease states; as a physician I’ve noticed a trend towards wanting a “quick fix” for modifiable risk factors such as tobacco, EtOH, obesity, sedentary lifestyle that extend beyond face-to-face clinical medicine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How do countries with public/universal health care system perform in combating COVID-19 compared to those without public health care systems? There was another question about inequity in vaccine distributions. On that same line of thought, are there any differences in the kinds of resources available between countries with public health care systems and those with privatized systems?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
