<p>One exception to this is the liver. It had unique regenerative qualities not present in other organs. This is why it's possible to grow a full liver from a single lobe, the liver has 4 lobes I believe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The age if the donor is not the only factor. Different transplanted organs last different lengths of time. Hearts, lungs, kidneys, and livers have differing viability times. The recipient is also a factor; what is their overall health, do they take their meds when required, and diet are also factors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably the most useful way to answer this question is to look by organ. </p>
<p>For liver the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1421181/" target="_blank">18 year survival after transplant</a> was 59% compared to the actuarially expected value of 49%.  However these numbers are hugely influenced by a) reason for transplant (malignancies do much worse than cirrhosis); b) age of recipient (younger is better); c) when transplant was performed (recent is better).  </p>
<p>For <a href="https://mdedge-files-live.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files/s3fs-public/issues/articles/media_13aba03_33.pdf" target="_blank">heart</a>, most people are very sick and the 1-year survival rate is about 90%, the 5-year rate is about 70%, but only about 20% survive 20 years or longer.  </p>
<p>For <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/05/170529090008.htm" target="_blank">kidney</a>  the average transplant only lasts 10-15 years.  Selena Gomez already needs a new kidney after only about a year. </p>
<p>Therefore, the issue is that the age of the organ is almost irrelevant since most people end up surviving less time than the actuarial tables would suggest from a healthy donor (i.e. if you were donating at 30, you would have expected to live to close to 80 and the organ recipient is not living 50 years with your organ).  This is largely because people getting organ donations are pretty sick already and so have shorter life expectancies.  As pointed out by u/d0rf47 the liver is unique.  There has actually been a successful liver transplant from a 92 year old donor.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I found this out from a friend of mine. He'd had a heart transplant. I asked him if it beat at the same rate as his old one, and he said yes. Exercise increases his heart rate. But that the strange thing about a transplanted heart (and I did not know this) is that it is not connected to the sympathetic nerve system, which means if something &quot;excites&quot; him, his heart rate isn't affected as it is with a normal heart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your assumption would be correct in terms of time.</p>
<p>Healthwise, age isn't the only factor in the health of an organ since other factors like drugs or stress can worsen the health of an organ.</p>
<p>A 50 year old organ from a perfectly healthy organ is going to last longer than a 30 year old abused organ. </p>
<p>Edit: brain fart</p>
<p>Edit part 2: As others have pointed out, if the organ can even last that long is another story, and it even depends per organ.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
