I found a study from 2003 that looked at this called <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347203922287" target="_blank">‘Handedness’ in snakes? Lateralization of coiling behaviour in a cottonmouth, Agkistrodon piscivorus leucostoma, population</a></p>
<p>I'm not sure it if it is open access, but the main result that only 3 out of 30 snakes displayed any significant &quot;Handedness&quot; in this population.  There does seem to be some bias in the snakes, but the results are not statistically significant. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
