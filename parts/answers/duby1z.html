		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, your teacher is correct.</p>
<p>The reason why gravity seems to be the strongest over large length scales is that the strong and weak forces have very short ranges (~ 10^(-15) and 10^(-18) meters, respectively), and electrostatic forces tend to cancel each other out when you have material that is macroscopically neutrally charged.</p>
<p>So for material which extends over a large region of space, and has no net charge, gravity tends to dominate. That's why gravity is a very important force for astronomy/astrophysics/cosmology, but it's totally irrelevant for things like atomic/nuclear physics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A teacher once pointed out to me that if you jump off a building and gravity accelerated you for 100 stories, the <del>nuclear</del> electromagnetic force holding the concrete together would stop you in less than an inch. That helped me grasp how much stronger nuclear forces are in an analogy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You need the gravitational attraction of a whole star or stellar remnant with its over 10^55 atoms to get enough pressure for nuclear reactions.</p>
<p>If the strong interaction would have a larger range then the force between two elementary particles would be enough to lift up a whole car.</p>
<p>If you could magically remove one out of 10^17 electrons on Earth the resulting tiny imbalance in electric charge would be sufficient to make Earth explode - against the gravitational attraction.</p>
<p>Gravity dominates on large scales only because its range is not limited and because there is only a single type of charge - the more stuff you accumulate the stronger gravity gets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think &quot;which force is the strongest&quot; is actually an ill-posed question. A better question would be: &quot;normalizing for the masses, charges, distances, and other properties of the particles involved, which force is the strongest?&quot; Once you do all those things, the relative strengths of the forces becomes a trivial comparison of scalar coefficients.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
