		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ELI5 answer is that they just &quot;know.&quot; We lose a lot of intrinsic knowledge when we define things as humans. Parrotfish can distinguish itself in the same way an infant might distinguish a human parent from another primate for example. While the infant might react similarly, there is deep-rooted intrinsic knowledge about what it means for that particular infant to be a human.</p>
<p>Instincts are very powerful devices which, depending on your belief in whether or not living beings are born with prior knowledge, can bridge the gap between the known and unknown. I'm sure a parrotfish would absolutely know to flee from a predator the same way we can recognize that a wolf wants to attack us in the wild.</p>
<p>Imagine as a human you come across an animal you've never seen before. I guarantee there is a 9/10 chance you can decide within the first few moments if that animal is going to be a threat to you. In that same vein, parrotfish can recognize familiar fish based on instinct alone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to the other comments, sometimes they dont. Often birds and ducks will imprint on any species and more domestic animals can easily assume theyre similar to whatever animal raises them. Sometimes cats behave like dogs and treat their maternal dog as a mother figure etc</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The mechanisms are surely not the same for all species, but one system for which we have some solid data are  brood-parasitic brown headed cowbirds.  These birds lay their eggs in the nests of other species, and the foster parents provide all the care the young cowbird receives.  How, then, does the cowbird know it's a cowbird? </p>
<p>Well, it seems cowbirds are born with a strong predisposition to like a particular cowbird call, and when they hear that call the young cowbird seems to learn everything it can about the bird that made it, which leads to them learning cowbird song and learning that they should be flirting with other cowbirds.  This is called the &quot;password hypothesis&quot; because the young cowbirds' learning systems are activated by hearing the species-specific &quot;password&quot; call.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My wife hand-reared a pigeon. This boy was rather confused as to who or what he was for a time. He would try to woo or fight the wild doves, somehow knowing which were male and which were potential mates. He would even confuse some inanimate objects (my wife's furry slippers, for example) as either male competition or he'd even try mate with them. But then one day, he brought home a lady pigeon. His own species (judging by her ring and RFID, she was obviously a racing pigeon). And now we're having to replace the constant production of eggs with dummy eggs. So yeah, after all his confusion, he eventually managed to find a mate and convince her to come live on our patio with him. They generally mate for life. Hard-wired instinct.</p>
<p>Then on the flip side, we have an aviary of budgies, cockatiels and love birds. The Birds were rescues, so homed one by one and the like. Early on, there was just one budgie, 2 cockatiels and a love bird. The budgie decided one of the cockatiels was his soul mate. The cockatiel wasn't very keen, but the budgie persisted.  As the flock grew from more rescues, more budgies were introduced to where there are now 5. That first budgie still only has eyes for that cockatiel and the cockatiel seems to have accepted this (even though there are more cockatiels now too) and the two behave like mates, with the budgie feeding the cockatiel as it would a mate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
