		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very basic answer: Laptop batteries are bigger and need to deliver more power at once than phone batteries. So they need more powerful chargers. More powerful chargers need bigger <del>transformers</del> heatsinks to prevent overheating, which means they need a bigger housing.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Laptop chargers have a much larger power handling capability. A phone charger might be in the 10-20W range at max. but a laptop charger might be &gt; 100W. </p>
<p>Greater power means any efficiency loss shows up as heat. Trying to put that in a small form factor might lead to overtemperature situations. </p>
<p>Most manufacturers treat their chargers as &quot;not a priority&quot; (there are exceptions) so generally it is also sourced pretty cheaply. So it isn't likely they'll put a lot of money into something expensive - and it costs money to make things small.</p>
<p>It makes sense - how many reviewers or buyers think about the power brick when discussing or contemplating the latest laptops?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the middle of a charger is a thing called a transformer. This converts electricity into a magnetic field, then back again into electricity. While it is a magnetic field it needs to be moved from A to B in the same way wires move electricity ... except it's much more of a pain in the arse. The <em>best</em> thing we have for doing this is lots of thin layers of iron stuck together. &quot;Our&quot; ability to make these things hasn't improved significantly since the 1950's because, honestly, physics. </p>
<p>So a phone charger has a small transformer because it's not pushing much power around, and laptop chargers are pushing lots more power and the 'brick' ness is because the transformer needs to be physically large and made of iron :(</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The correct answer (more power, heat dissipation) has already been given. I just want to add that there is a new technology (GaN) that will make it possible to further shrink chargers. It's a bit pricey but you can (or will soon be able to) get a 100W charger the size of a pack of cigarettes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
