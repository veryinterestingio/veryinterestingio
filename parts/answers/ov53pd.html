		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They use cranes which can be placed on the part of the building that's been built so far. The machine itself can't get as tall as the building, but put the machine on top of what you already have and the CABLE can still reach the ground.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unless I was taught wrong they build using a crane. Then remove the cross section of the crane and use the vertical portion as the elevator shaft. (Skyscrapers) Having watched them build Miller Park (Now American Family Field baseball stadium Milwaukee) I can verify that they have mobile cranes that are actually big/tall enough to build stadiums and arenas. It is VERY dangerous, however, as was proven when wind caused the partial collapse of the roof while they were building Miller Park, killing 3 construction workers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They also use something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slip_forming" target="_blank">slip forming.</a> The concrete form for the building is constantly moving upwards. Fresh concrete gets poured up top, hard cured concrete comes the bottom. The forms moves up by jacks secured to the hardened concrete. </p>

<p>Cranes can then be attached to the top, like others have mentioned,  to haul up all the other stuff like cladding and mechanical equipment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the lower levels are build to withstand the weight of the higher ones, therefore they can also fit the machinery required to work on it. Cranes do a lot of the heavy lifting, and then other specialized machines are lifted to where they’re needed</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
