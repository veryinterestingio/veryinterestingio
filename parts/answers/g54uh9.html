		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The laser is just there so you know where the reading is being taken from.  Everything emits infrared radiation as long as it's above absolute zero and if it gets hot enough it starts emitting visible light.  The radiation things normally emit based on their temperature is a form of light below what the human eye can see unless it gets intensely hot.  The laser thermometer is able to sense this radiation and determine temperature based on how strong and what &quot;color&quot; the light is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They are just IR-cameras with a chip that can calculate the temperature based on the distribution of IR wavelengths</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All heated bodies emit light out of it, and so does our body. Except, this light is not visible to human eyes. The laser pointer thermometers are like special eyes which can see this kind of light. Depending on the wavelength of this light, the thermometer can determine what is the temperature of the body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others did a fine job giving the explanation.  The rabbit hole you're seeking is the search term 'black body radiation.'  Very key and important problem to solve in the late 1800s for process control in making steel.  The solution was literally a quantum leap.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Atoms jiggle around because of temperature. This jiggling jiggles the electrons too. When electrons move back and forth, they create light. In fact thats basically what light is, a history of the motion of an electron, propogating outward at the speed of light. </p>
<p>We can relate the frequency/color of light to the temperature associated with the amount of jiggling in the atoms, which is what we call temperature</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
