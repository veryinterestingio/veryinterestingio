		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of different types of reactors could potentially be used as breeders (meaning they produce more fissile fuel than they consume), but it's <a href="http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2014/ph241/rehn2/images/f1big.png" target="_blank">easiest to do on a fast neutron spectrum, or on a moderated spectrum with a thorium fuel cycle</a> (the relevant fissile nuclide to the thorium fuel cycle is uranium-233). So that's why you always hear the phrases &quot;fast breeder&quot;, or you hear about breeding in the context of thorium fuel cycles.</p>
<p>Breeders can take waste (specifically actinides/transuranics) from existing reactors and use it as fuel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thorium systems are what we call &quot;paper reactors.&quot; They're really simple concepts that promise to be cheap and simple to design and operate, usually with some fuel cycle benefits. Real reactors are extremely complicated. The bottom line is that you absolutely need fissile material to start the system. There's a good set of information about <a href="https://whatisnuclear.com/thorium.html" target="_blank">thorium as a nuclear fuel</a> and <a href="https://whatisnuclear.com/thorium-myths.html" target="_blank">thorium myths</a>. The long and short of it, though, is that most of what you've probably heard is either exaggerated or untrue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are you sure you understand what fertile and fissile mean?  99.3% of uranium is U-238, which is fertile.  Fresh LWR fuel is usually around 4% U-235, and the rest is U-238.</p>
<p>The fact that thorium is fertile certainly doesn't mean that reactors that use thorium would be safer.</p>
<p>Reactor designs that use thorium can use any fissile isotope as fuel, just like reactors that don't include thorium.  &quot;Byproducts&quot; that could be used as fuel in thorium reactors could also be used in reactors that don't use thorium.</p>
<p>Edit: to answer your question, you don't need a thorium reactor to &quot;recycle waste&quot; from existing nuclear reactors.  It's possible in most, if not all, reactor designs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of reactor designs can recycle waste from older designs.</p>
<p>I'd be careful with relying on thorium as a crutch against accusations of the alleged &quot;danger&quot; of nuclear power. Uranium fission is already the safest form of energy per kilowatt hour we have.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
