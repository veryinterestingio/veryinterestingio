		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the 19th century, Lord Kelvin (the one the temperature's named after), thought the sun emitted light and heat through gravitational contraction. The sun's gravity would move all matter closer to the core, thereby decreasing their potential energy and releasing energy in some form.</p>
<p>Calculations based on this 'determined' that the sun was about a hundred million years old, and definitely no older than half a billion years, which was already disputable in his own time (geologists were much closer to the actual value in their conclusions).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would just add (separate from the discussions of Lord Kelvin) that nuclear fusion was initially postulated, not discovered. The idea of nuclear fusion was developed <em>as a way</em> to explain the Sun's energy, not the other way around (it wasn't discovered and then applied to the Sun problem). Arthur Eddington suggested this in 1920. The exact reactions would wait until Hans Bethe's analysis in 1938.</p>
<p>I like to point this out because people often think the discovery of fusion came after the discovery of fission (1938), probably because the hydrogen bomb came after the fission bomb. But fusion is in fact the older idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lord Kelvin, and others discussed this at some length.  It was known that no source of heat via chemical reactions could possibly work, so they were left with gravitation.</p>
<p><a href="https://zapatopi.net/kelvin/papers/on_the_age_of_the_suns_heat.html" target="_blank">On The Age of the Sun's Heat</a> talks about this in great detail, showing how much Heat energy must be radiated into space, and how it is impossible for chemical reactions to account for it.</p>
<p>The proposed solution ( the graviational contraction of the sun, and the impacts of meteroids ) is now of course seen as wrong, but given the forces known at the time, seemed to be the only solution.</p>
<p>“meteoric action . . . . is . . . . not only proved to exist as a cause of solar heat, but it is the only one of all conceivable causes which we know to exist from independent evidence.”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This was on a documentary a few nights ago. In the 19th century some serious consideration was given to the idea that the Sun was made of burning coal. The fact that it would burn itself out after a few thousand years didn't seem odd, since most people thought the Earth itself was only a few thousand years old.</p>
<p>Then geology came along and put us right about that, so science had to find an alternative explanation for the Sun's energy.</p>
