		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you drive a car on a road with traffic there is an advantage to be towards the center of the road.</p>
<p>If you are going to overtake a truck in front of you on a two-lane road you need to be able to see what is in front of you on the road.  You overtake cars towards the center so if you sit close to the center you are seeing cars going in the opposite direction a lot sooner.   You can compare how you can see ahead if you are a driver instead of from seat passenger in a car.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Even if that was not the case the with of most cars is just wide enough for two people to sit comfortably side by side. So a diver in the center would remove the front passenger seat so it reduces the number of people you can transport. You can fit 3 people in the back seat of most cars but it is very cramped and would not like to drive a car sitting like that.</p>
<p>A truck is often so wide so 3 people can fit side by side without any problem but three the diver is still to the side as you can see other traffic better in lots of diving situations.</p>
<p>There are sports cars with the driver in the center but they can't in most cases have any passengers. They are quite narrow and you like the driver in the center for weight distribution reasons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Couple of reasons:</p>
<p>Vision: coming up to a junction in a car  with the driving side opposite to the norm will immediately demonstrate how much vision you lose. To be able to accelerate out of a junction onto the road, the junction is usually angled allowing you to be somewhat facing your intended direction of travel, the further you are from the normal side, the more of your own vehicle you have to look through, as opposed to looking through your driver window.  In addition when following behind a vehicle you have a far more limited view past them for overtaking by being away from the centre of the road. </p>
<p>Capacity: cars are designed to take people places, the more people in the car the more efficient and useful it is. Only cars in the extreme ends of design opt for middle driving positions, such as the Maclaren F1.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it's an inefficient use of space on a normal-width car. It's also much harder to get into and out of the car. There are rare exceptions, like the McLaren F1 that had a center driver seat and tow passengers on the side but set back a bit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aaaand nobody has stated the obvious...  Its cheaper.  It is also easier to get in and out.  This has nothing to do with safety or visibility or any of those things.  Even horse drawn carriages had an offset driver just so you could fit 2 people on the bench.  Driver always sat on one side so it was easy to get in and out if needed.  Don't overthink this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
