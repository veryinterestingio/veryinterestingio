		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So light is an electromagnetic wave. A changing electric field will generate a magnetic field - this is how electromagnets work. And a changing magnetic field will generate an electric field - this is how generators work. So if you set it up right, a changing magnetic field will generate a changing electric field which generates a changing magnetic field, and so on, and you get a wave of oscillating magnetic and electric fields that propagate onwards until it hits something. So there isn't a material medium, but it's electric and magnetic fields that are &quot;waving&quot;.</p>
<p>But this is a really interesting question, because in the 19th century it <em>was</em> postulated that there was a medium that light propagates through. The idea is that, while the equations of motion for a particle (e.g. throwing a ball) do not change when you add a constant velocity to the whole system, the equations for electromagnetism <em>do</em> change when you add a constant velocity to the whole system (assuming that time and space are the same for every reference frame). This means that light should look different depending on your velocity. So, what is the &quot;zero velocity&quot; frame for light? The best guess they could come up with is that there is some &quot;aether&quot; medium that light propagates through, and the velocity of this aether gives the zero point for velocity for an EM wave. This was only later removed because Einstein took the much more radical step of postulating that when you shift the entire system by a constant velocity, instead of light acting different, <em>the entire nature of time and space changes</em>, and this is what we call Special Relativity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There isn't a physical medium for light, because it isn't a matter wave. A wave is a periodic variation in something, but that something does not have to be matter. For traveling waves, that periodic variation spreads throughout the something. For ocean surface waves it is the height of the water and for sound waves is is density of the material. Light waves are periodic variations of the electro-magnetic field, which is not a physical thing.  </p>
<p>There was some pretty vigourous debate and experimentation regarding electro-magnetic waves (see the luminiferous ether theory) because up to that point all waves that had been described mere matter waves, so it was erroneously thought that all waves had to be matter waves. Eventually, physicists learned that waves are a description of the time and spatial variation of something, but that something does not have to be matter. The acceptance of this with light, along with the photoelectric effect, formed the basis of wave-particle duality, where particles have an associated wavelength, knows as the De Broglie wavelength that determines the probability density of finding the object at a given point of the configuration space, which is decidedly not a matter wave.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's easy to visualize a wave as &quot;something&quot; moving up and down or back and forth. But this image requires a medium (or something that is doing the moving. )</p>
<p>For light, instead imagine something pulsing. This pulsing is basically potential energy being stored and released in two fields alternately: the magnetic and electric fields. Like water being poured back and forth between two cups, energy passes back and forth between two fields propagating through space as part of the process.  Now this pulsing follows a sinusoidal wave function which allows us to describe its behavior as a wave. </p>
<p>So material waves require a medium because something is moving. Energy is essentially being propagated through the kinetic energy of particles (the medium) moving. </p>
<p>Light energy waves are essentially propagated as potential energy bouncing between two fields which don't require a medium.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The medium for light (photons) is the electromagnetic field, while the medium for electricity (electrons) is the electron field.</p>
<p>According to quantum field theory (which is among the best and most proven theories to date), spacetime is built up from multiple fields that interact with each other according to some basic rules. All types of particles (like photons and electrons) have their own field, and most of them interact with multiple fields. It's these fields in which the particles propagate through spacetime. <a href="https://wp-assets.futurism.com/2013/11/775px-Elementary_particle_interactions.svg_.png" target="_blank">(Image showing those interactions)</a></p>
<p>You shouldn't think of those fields as something inside spacetime (like an ocean or air) though, as those fields literally make up spacetime - add them and their interactions all together and you get our universe.</p>
<p>A bit off topic but it fits this discussion: unlike the other forces, gravity doesn't seem to be mediated by particles in a field, and rather seems to be an even more integral part of spacetime that affects all of the particle fields in some fundamental way. It's the curvature in those fields that gives the effect of gravity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other answers have correctly stated that the electromagnetic field is not a physical medium, but &quot;something else&quot; that is present everywhere in the universe, and can be accurately described using mathematical vector (or tensor) fields. But what does that &quot;something else&quot; actually consist of? What causes it to be there?</p>
<p>The answer is that we <strong>just don't know</strong>.</p>
<p>In fact, in the standard model (modern quantum theory), <em>all</em> forces and all particles are represented by their own fields. So physical fields seem to be perhaps the <em>most</em> fundamental thing in the universe. We know we can accurately model how they interact using mathematical fields of vectors/tensors, but as for what they actually <em>are</em>, we have no idea.</p>
<p>Some people think we'll never know, and that this is a matter of philosophy, not physics. But then, they used to think the same thing about gravity, so who knows?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
