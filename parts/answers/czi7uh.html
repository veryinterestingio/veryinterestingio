		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people here are talking about more oxygen. This is a good thing for bigger bugs, but for everything else, the answer is actually more related to CO2.</p>
<p>Unlike bugs dinosaurs don’t have their size limited by oxygen because lungs are way better at getting the gas exchange needed. What <em>did</em> limit their size was the availability of food. Dinosaurs weren’t always colossal: coelophysis, one of the earliest dinosaurs, was actually quite small (it was very long for balance but weighed less than a Labrador).</p>
<p>As the age of dinosaurs progressed and CO2 levels rose the amount of plant life exploded as the planet became hotter and wetter. All the extra food meant prey Dinosaurs could bulk the hell up. Now they were getting bigger and could resist predation, right? Sort of. </p>
<p>As prey got bigger to resist predators, predators got bigger to take down prey. This is what’s called an evolutionary arms race. Eventually this reached a point where you have carnivores like Giganautosaurus and herbivores like Argentinosaurus which could have weighed as much as 100 metric tonnes. </p>
<p>Nowadays mammals are the dominant life form and the largest is much smaller. Why? Because mammals have other answers to being hunted than just “getting bigger.” Mammals care for their young, work together, run away or just hide. These strategies require bigger brains but are just as effective</p>
<p>TL:DR/ELI3: there was a ton of food so everyone got bigger. Nowadays we have better ideas than just getting bigger to eat or be eaten</p>
<p>Edit: holy hell this blew up. Yes to those saying “but blue whales!” You are absolutely right but I was restricting the scope of my answer to land animals. The Square cube law that restricts so much on land is kind of turned on its end in water</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blue whales are still around and are pretty big.</p>
<p>There were quite a few big animals that went extinct only recently, likely due to human intervention (we either ate them or their food source) Wolly Mammoth is as big as a T-Rex.</p>
<p>Dinos were around for quite a while, lots of races came and went. It wasn't just one 'period'. As such you can pick the biggest and meanest of them even if they didn't live around the same time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We've either hunted to extinction many of the largest animals or competed with them for space and food, in addition to the environmental changes that we know about and others have mentioned (such as different combinations of carbon and oxygen and other molecules in the air).</p>
<p>Ths term &quot;megafauna&quot; is used to describe large members of the animal kingdom, and include animals like Hippopotami and Elephants. &quot;Megafauna&quot; has been used in different contexts to describe animals that are roughly similar in size to humans but <em>not</em> domesticated as well as those much larger animals I mentioned above.</p>
<p>There is an interesting archeological record of megafauna, and there are many species and subspecies that humans have encountered in our past that we likely out-competed for resources and/or actively hunted to extinction. Animals like the Gound Sloth and Mastadon and Mammoths roamed North America at one point. <a href="https://www.livescience.com/51793-extinct-ice-age-megafauna.html" target="_blank">https://www.livescience.com/51793-extinct-ice-age-megafauna.html</a></p>
<p>It is also possible that, to some degree, this perception of &quot;more large creatures <em>used to</em> exist&quot; is just that: a perception. As we look back through the fossil record and historical writings and accounta of creatures, we cover far more time than a snapshot of the present, but large and diverse creatures exist today as well, such elephants, giraffes, buffalo, oxen, hippos and rhinos, and not the least, the blue whale, larger than any known dinosaur. But it is true that elephants aren't as large as an apatosaurus, so we have to consider temperatures, chemical makeup of the environment that provided the right mixture of nutrients to sustain massive bodies, including an abundance of food and lack of massively successful competition. As the climate changed it provided a different set of rules by which to live, and eventually the smartest apes we know of evolved, us, and so far virtually nothing competes with us, except ourselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming you mean land-based giant animals, because the blue whale is the largest animal in history and can be found swimming today. After the dinosaurs went extinct, other animals evolved to fill the same roles and reached similar sizes to the dino counter-parts. There's multiple reasons there aren't many of these giant land animals around today, but the cause many point to is the rise and dominance of humans. </p>
<p>In the case of large predators, humans most likely started taking such a large share of their food source they were forced into extinction or adaptation. For example, the massive dire wolves were replaced by the smaller grey wolves who require far less food to survive in response to this shortage.</p>
<p>Large herbivores were most likely hunted to extinction by humans as they improved their group hunting tactics and tool use. An example is how species of ground sloths on human-free islands continued to exist long after the ones living on the mainland with humans are believed to have gone extinct.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is more of another question than an answer, but aren't bigger bones easier to fossilize than smaller ones? I know that we have some small fossils, babies, eggs, and such. But from my limited experience and from what I've seen in the museums, I've seen mostly large fossils. Even with the larger fossils, what is often missing are the smaller bones.</p>
<p>Taking from this lack of evidence, could we just be missing out on a ton of smaller, maybe even more intelligent species of dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals because there wasn't enough tissue to fossilize or they lived in areas that didn't allow for fossilization for such small animals? Or since smaller animals tend to survive by mass reproduction, then is the lack of evidence just proof that such small animals didn't exist?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
