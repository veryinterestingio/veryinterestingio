<p>Look at the graph <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep" target="_blank">here</a>. If you wake up at a peak, you wake up feeling alert. If you wake up during a valley, you wake up feeling drowsy. The length of the sleep determines the long-term benefit the rest would've gotten you; even if you wake up at a peak, if you've only gotten a single cycle's worth of sleep after a long period of being awake, ie having a significant need for rest, you'll quickly go back to being tired.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on which stage of sleep you reached. If you got to deep REM (Rapid Eye Movement, when one generally dreams), then it's more restful. If you don't, you're in the shallower part, and it feels like a short time. </p>
<p>There's a sleep pattern that is something like three hours awake, a 20 minute nap, alternating constantly. The idea is that you'll be tired as hell for a while, but once your body gets the idea that this is all the sleep you're going to get at once, it will pound right down to REM, not screwing around with the light 'am I awake? Or asleep? Or thinking I'm asleep but I'm awake?' nonsense. You get a total of two hours sleep in 24, giving you extra awake time. Is the theory, anyway. This infographic has some information on alternates.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yikes, tons of misinformation in this thread. I'm surprised how many people incorrectly recall information without taking 10 seconds to look it up to refresh their memory. Here's a description I lifted from the NIH (because I had to look it up to make sure I wasn't crazy after reading these comments):</p>
<p>There are two basic types of sleep:  <strong>rapid eye movement (REM) sleep</strong> and <strong>non-REM sleep</strong> (which has three different stages).  Each is linked to specific brain waves and neuronal activity.  You cycle through all stages of non-REM and REM sleep several times during a typical night, with increasingly longer, deeper REM periods occurring toward morning. </p>
<p><strong>Stage 1 non-REM sleep</strong> is the changeover from wakefulness to sleep.  During this short period (lasting several minutes) of relatively light sleep, your heartbeat, breathing, and eye movements slow, and your muscles relax with occasional twitches.  Your brain waves begin to slow from their daytime wakefulness patterns. </p>
<p><strong>Stage 2 non-REM sleep</strong> is a period of light sleep before you enter deeper sleep.  Your heartbeat and breathing slow, and muscles relax even further.  Your body temperature drops and eye movements stop.  Brain wave activity slows but is marked by brief bursts of electrical activity.  You spend more of your repeated sleep cycles in stage 2 sleep than in other sleep stages.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 3 non-REM sleep</strong> is the period of deep sleep that you need to feel refreshed in the morning.  It occurs in longer periods during the first half of the night.  Your heartbeat and breathing slow to their lowest levels during sleep.  Your muscles are relaxed and it may be difficult to awaken you.  Brain waves become even slower. </p>
<p><strong>REM sleep</strong> first occurs about 90 minutes after falling asleep.  Your eyes move rapidly from side to side behind closed eyelids.  Mixed frequency brain wave activity becomes closer to that seen in wakefulness.  Your breathing becomes faster and irregular, and your heart rate and blood pressure increase to near waking levels.  Most of your dreaming occurs during REM sleep, although some can also occur in non-REM sleep.  Your arm and leg muscles become temporarily paralyzed, which prevents you from acting out your dreams.  As you age, you sleep less of your time in REM sleep.  Memory consolidation most likely requires both non-REM and REM sleep.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know this question constantly shows back up and the answer always comes back quickly that it's about REM sleep but could anyone give me any insight as to the disparity between good and bad sleep?</p>
<p>Like this post says, sometimes I'll get 20 minutes and feel very refreshed, and another night I'll lay around for 5 hours unable to keep my eyes shut. Is there something causing resistance to falling into REM? Is there other causes that make it much easier to enter REM?</p>
<p>...obviously there's a million factors that affect asleep but it seems strange that these could be days apart so seemingly most variables are pretty comparable in both cases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
