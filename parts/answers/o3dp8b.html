		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two types of waves which can turn a flat sea into a rougher one - swell waves and wind waves.</p>
<p>Swell waves can arrive at any time of day, but because wind waves are generated by the wind, they only develop when the wind begins to blow steadily. Since wind speeds are often low at night, and increase during the daytime, wind waves often die out during the night, leading to a relatively flat sea (perhaps with swell waves) in the early morning. During the day, the wind waves increase in size as the wind speed increases, leading to a rougher, more choppy, sea surface during the afternoon and evening.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know how much this effects waves but it might be interesting to you anyway:</p>
<p>Close to the shore the wind usually forms convection cells.
At day, the warm air from the land mass rises due to it increasing in volume and 'sucks' cold air from over the ocean towards the shore.</p>
<p>This is that steady seabreeze you might be familiar with.</p>
<p>At night the land cools down faster than the water since there is no sunlight hitting the land. Neither do they hit the ocean but water can collect much more heat and gives a little of it off at night. </p>
<p>So, the air above the ocean gets heated up, rises and leads to the same circle (rather a cylinder spanning the shore) spinning the other way around with cold air coming from the landmass.</p>
<p>In the morning the wind would thus normally come from the land (at least before the sun heats up the land again)</p>
<p>Waves form due to wind catching on small irregularities on the water and from then on it catches on the small waves this wind has created. This can build up to the big waves you might know from the days.</p>
<p>At night the wind came from the land and that could be why the sea is calm then.</p>
<p>You could go out at night once and check if that hypothesis is true. It should be calm most of the night unless bigger weather phenomena interfere with this system. </p>
<p>Also, you might want to look up convection cells yourself. Could be helpful to see a video of the process. </p>
<p>There are also 6 major cells (3 on each side of the equator) spanning the whole planet leading to the steady trade winds the sailors used before motorised ships made the wind direction less important</p>
<p>Edit: I just checked the other comments and found this to be the right answer appearently (yaye). I hope this longer explanation still helps someone out there thus I will leave it here anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yeah during night it's colder and the sea and the land will have a similar temperature.</p>
<p>When there is only a small temperature difference there will be less wind, and without wind there are no waves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sailboat captain here: this is a big deal for us, and is a big part of how we get from point A to B sometimes. Worth noting that its a land phenomenon and doesn't happen in the ocean once you get out a ways.</p>
<p>The &quot;sunrise glass-out&quot; (also happens around sunset) is a bubble of warm air coming off the land, it can extend for miles if the coast is right. It kills the normal wind, so if you have to move a boat upwind you can motor at sunrise/sunset and make great progress. Particularly useful off Cuba and Hispaniola if you hug the coast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the absence of any large weather system wind you basically have two winds on the coast: Sea breeze and land breeze.</p>
<p>Sea breeze is wind coming in from the sea and is caused by the sun heating the ground and happens during hot days. Land breeze is wind going out to sea and is caused by the cooling of the ground and happens during the night. So you have wind blowing out to sea at night.</p>
<p>Also, wind causes waves by gently/violently pushing the top most layer of the water.</p>
<p>So at night and in the morning you basically have winds that cause waves going out to sea but not coming in from the sea. During the day it reverses and you have wind and waves coming in from the sea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
