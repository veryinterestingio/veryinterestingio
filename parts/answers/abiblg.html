		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we’re awake, particles, allergies or an illness can stimulate the nerve cells in the nose. The nerves then send signals to the brain in order to initiate a sneeze to get rid of whatever is irritating it. But during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, certain neurotransmitters shut down. This means that the motor neurons are not being stimulated, so they aren’t sending these signals to the brain.</p>
<p>TLDR: Your brain shuts down information sharing from the nose so you won't wake yourself up.  </p>

<p>Brain releases chemicals that shut down those functions while you’re asleep. Different chemicals, but same idea as how you don’t pee your bed when you sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ventrolateral preoptic nucleus inhibits forebrain and brainstem arousal systems when asleep, preventing them from waking the body. One of these arousal systems is the sneezing reflex of the medulla. Thus, no sneezing when asleep. </p>
<p>Edit of actual ELI5: Parts of the brain that keep the body awake during the day are turned off at night, one of those parts is also the home of the brain part of the reflex that turns that itchy feeling from irritants in your nose into a sneeze. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
