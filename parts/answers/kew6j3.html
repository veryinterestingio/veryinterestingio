<p>What are some the challenges remaining for solid State batteries, and where do you see the most promising innovations improving the energy density:weight challenges with current battery designs?</p>
<p>Do you think improved fuel storage or propulsion efficiency is the bigger breakthrough for achieving commercialization?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, thanks for doing this!</p>
<p>So just as an FYI, I know virtually nothing about this, so forgive me if this is an overly simple question.</p>
<p>The big thing that I've always thought that somewhat hindered electric fueled propulsion is the weight of batteries.  For example, a Tesla car, because of the batteries, weighs almost as much as a pickup truck that is twice the size of the Tesla.  </p>
<p>I would imagine that weight is an extremely significant factor in aircraft.  So my question is:  what new ways are you addressing the weight of energy storage in your experiments and designs?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
