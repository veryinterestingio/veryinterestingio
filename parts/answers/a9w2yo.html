If this happens with the current dictator or after a revolution is still to be seen, but there is practically no chance of the current currency recovering.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Over time the value of money only has decreased, as such I wouldn't keep on to the million dollars except for funny money.</p>
<p>In the country itself, after a event of a mega-inflation, the treasury can adjust the value back to normal numbers. They can do this by distributing new bills which have for example six less zeros but which are the same value.</p>
<p>So the old value is US$ 1 000 000, and the new value is US$ 1.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the economy eventually stabilizes, they'll just retire the old money &amp; issue something new that isn't hyper inflated. At best, this will be a collector's item you could sell on eBay in a few decades because people think it's fun to buy 100,000,000 <em>whatever</em> bills.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
