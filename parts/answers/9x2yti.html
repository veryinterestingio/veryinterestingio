		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A long time ago, people who are now 80+ years old, took a vote in November to have free TV with ads, or paid TV without ads. They voted the latter. Now through some loopholes, the paid TV services are allowed to sell airtime to advertisers at the customer's expense.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cable company is just providing you access to the network's content. They manage the box, the wires, the distribution, etc.</p>
<p>They need to pay networks licensing fees in order to broadcast that content to you. Of course, that means you're paying the fee, plus profit.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Your bill is service costs+licensing costs. You're paying for access to what the networks provide, not buying the content directly.</p>
<p>You can just buy the content directly, it's called a &quot;box set&quot;. Alternatively, a lot of networks sell direct access. EX: HBO Now (which costs the same as adding HBO to cable). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All these young kids are wrong.</p>
<p>Cable used to be ad-free. That was its selling point. You pay upfront and don't get ads, and you could cuss and show nudity. </p>
<p>As with anything, they eventually want more and put in ads.</p>
<p>See: Netflix</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ul>
<li>Broadcast TV is free in the US.</li>
<li>Ads that air on broadcast TV pay for the production and distribution costs.</li>
<li>
<p>The same company that sells the ads built and maintain the equipment that broadcasts the signal.</p>
</li>
<li>Cable TV costs money because a new company built the system of equipment and cables that gets the signal to your house. </li>
<li>When you pay for Cable TV, most of the money goes towards maintaining that system. Only some of it goes to cover the cost of the programming. </li>
