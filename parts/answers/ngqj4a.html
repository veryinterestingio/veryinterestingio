		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are correct, FM is not sending out a single frequency, but a band of frequencies. However, by tuning to the carrier frequency, you can filter out the carrier to get just the signal. Read up on <a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/radio-frequency-analysis-design/radio-frequency-demodulation/how-to-demodulate-an-fm-waveform/" target="_blank">FM demodulation </a>.  This article starts with a basic demodulation and then explains demodulation using a PLL to lock onto the signal.  But we need to set the PLL to approximately the carrier signal so it demodulates the right FM radio station.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not that your radio only &quot;listens&quot; on the carrier frequencyâ€”it actually &quot;hears&quot; a band of frequencies to either side of the carrier frequency. If you tune to 101.9 MHz, say, your radio is detecting between 101.885 and 101.915 Mhz for the main audio.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Waterfall_FM_Broadcast.jpg" target="_blank">Check out this frequency-domain plot of radio signal intensity</a>. You can see there are stations being received at 97.5 MHz, 98.3 MHz, and 99.1 MHz. However the frequency varies by a bandwidth of about 100 KHz for each station. So you tune the central frequency, and your radio has a receive filter bandwidth of also about 100 KHz, so it receives the whole signal and demodulates it.</p>
<p>This is also why stations are only odd odd-decimals of MHz (eg 99.1 and 99.3, but never 99.2), because they need that 200 KHz spacing between stations to avoid interfering with each other. The reason they are on odd decimals instead of even ones is because the band allocated by the FCC is 88.0 - 108.0 MHz. If a station was on 88.0, it would be spilling over to 87.9 MHz and be outside the legally allowed band. So the lowest frequency used is 88.1 MHz, and the highest is 107.9.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
