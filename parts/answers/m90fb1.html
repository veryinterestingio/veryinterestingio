		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eyo neuroscientist here! You’ll be producing slower waves of neural activity (alpha waves) as you rest, but this is not nearly as slow as the waves you get in deep non-REM sleep. So, yes it would be better than being completely awake, but it wouldn’t have the same effect as sleep. Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you are laying at night with your eyes closed and relaxed, but you feel awake, you may actually be in the first stage of sleep. People who go for sleep studies can report that they didn't sleep all night but when their brain wave activity is analyzed, they were going in and out of light sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
