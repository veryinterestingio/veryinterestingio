		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wow, so many answers and yet none of them really answer it. </p>
<p>The real answer is that its coming from posture. Our body is essentially stabilized by a variety of competing muscle groups. Ones that pull everything back, and ones that pull everything forward. They’re not exact opposites, but they allow opposing motions. Some people are more flexible than others, and some are more flexible in certain muscle groups. </p>
<p>All this results in your body being “most comfortable” in certain positions. For those of us with less flexible hamstrings, for example, a bent leg puts less pressure on the hamstring. Since your resting body is ideally in its least stressed state, bending your legs reduces that stress and the amount of effort your body is having to exert. </p>
<p>Our bodies are picky because we all have different degrees of strength and flexibility across our muscle groups, and based on that there is an “ideal” position that our body likes when we sleep. Putting your spine in a specific position, your hips, your legs, etc. what produces the least tension? </p>
<p>You’ll find that - generally speaking - more flexible people are able to sleep with more variability, and more often in a more “natural” pose that is conducive with our natural spine curvature.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work with people with disabilities who are not able to move around in their sleep. They get horrible pressure sores that can kill you. We move around in our sleep the same way we re-adjust our butts when we are sitting in a chair. If you just sit or lay in one position for too long it stops letting the blood flow through that area pf contact and the tissue becomes necrotic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A repost of mine from a related ELI5,</p>
<p>Our spines are still halfway between bipedalism and nesting in tree canopies</p>
<p>Thanks to our fantastically large complex brains we've had 20,000 years of being able to jury rig a decent nest/bed to help conform and support our jank-ass skeleton and get a decent nights sleep in.</p>
<p>But that also means that there isn't much selection pressure to produce a genetically well sleeping person.</p>
<p>The result is a population of 7 billion shaved apes that all have unique best practices for sleeping. We get by alright for the most part, until some injury or illness common to our slap dash monkey bones makes things worse. </p>
<p>The cat does enjoy better sleep than us though, and I at least am convinced that they are intentionally smug about it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
