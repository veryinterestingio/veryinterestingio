		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, passwords are normally hashed.</p>
<p>Password change requirements are typically only used in enterprise environments, in which a user may write down their password or share it with another employee. It's not necessary for the normal user, in fact, it's generally considered less secure to make passwords expire, as most users just make small changes the password. IE: <em>Password1, Password2, Password3</em>, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It isn't. It's an outdated practice that is <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-FAQ/#q-b5" target="_blank">no longer recommended</a>. The passwords should be stored as password hashes, however cracking the password history is often tremendously useful to an attacker as it provides insight in to how you compose passwords. Also, a lot of users modify their passwords in a predictable way each reset, so if I know you start at Password1, then progress through Password2, Password3, Password4, and Password5, I can guess that your next password will be Password6, which helps me maintain access as an attacker.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's about protecting you and their company from someone using an old password.  Most hackers that get names and passwords don't go logging in right away, and will sit on them for awhile.  </p>
<p>By forcing you to change your password every so often, it puts an expiration date on how long the bad actors have access to your account.  If you keep re-using the same passwords, it defeats the whole purpose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
