		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cell death technically just means &quot;failing to carry out its functions.&quot; That's pretty broad, so I think a better way of answer this is to detail the two variants of cell death you can fall into: apoptosis, intentional death; and necrosis, unintentional death. If you haven't undergone either process, then you're not dead.</p>
<p>Apoptosis: two forms, intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic is what occurs when your cell has been damaged by external factors sufficiently for its preprogrammed machinery to induce auto-destruct. It can also be the result of embryologic planning: e.g. many of the cells you were born with committed suicide so you could grow. Extrinsic death occurs because a white blood cell of yours has &quot;commanded&quot; that cell to commit suicide via a series of molecular interactions. Both processes' keystone molecule are caspases. </p>
<p>Necrosis occurs after a cell has crossed the boundary of irreversible injury, which is characterized by membrane rupture. If the membrane hasn't ruptured yet, it's possible the cell may come back from its injury after repairing itself, usually by making sufficient ATP to manage the reparations. If ATP is depleted for long enough (either in an effort to repair itself from nearby infection/inflammation, or because the means by which the tissue is dying is loss of energy), then Na/K ATPases can't function, the cell swells as water remains with Na inside the cell, the membrane blebs out because of increased pressure, and eventually ruptures==&gt; the process of cell death has started and will not stop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's plenty of fine answers here, but I will be more simple. I'm going to tell you the difference between life and not life is a membrane. There are <em>many</em> molecular signaling pathways that induce cell death, but at the end of the day, the membrane ruptures. When this happens, your cell is dead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cell death in terms of cell biology is literally determined by the integrity of the cell wall. A disrupted cell carries out no functions (apoptosing cells are strategically compartmentalised to maintain some order of degradation though).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For those interested in learning all about cell death, I highly recommend Means to an End by Doug Green. The book is aimed at people with a little science background, but it's a much easier read than a textbook. That book has everything about cell death you'd want to know. Doug is a really brilliant researcher in the field of cell death and a really nice guy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
