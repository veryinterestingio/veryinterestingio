		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The research hasn't been done very deeply yet, to be honest.  The studies that support it are small, and it's not the kind of experiment that a good control group can be set up. </p>
<p>That said, here is the theory :</p>
<p>&quot;Deep touch pressure&quot; has been studied as a aid for Autism spectrum kids.  Basically light stimulation (tickling  loose clothes, the wind, etc.) excites your nervous system.  If you are already anxious, it increases your fight/flight response. Deep pressure (hugging, a tight compression shirt, or a weighted blanket) pushes past that triggering response and actually <em>sooths</em> your nervous system, encouraging the release of calming neurotransmitters. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>nobody is really sure WHY they work, only that they do. </p>
<p>most speculation revolves around the idea the weight interacts positively with the human reaction to touch. we're herd animals, after all, we evolved to be around and in contact with other people. the weight of the blanket simulating the sensation of sleeping with or near another person.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
