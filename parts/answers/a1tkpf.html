		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Right, I see that most folks have decent answers but were kinda 'half-answers'. I'm hoping to provide some simple, complete and conclusive answer considering I just did a thesis on this.</p>
<p>Here's the first part of the answer: <strong>in short, the force of ejaculation does not influence probability of impregnation.</strong></p>
<p>The second part of answer, we'll explore what exactly determines probability of impregnation. I've included some proper scientific terms just so in case you come across these terms while reading around, you'll have a rough idea what scientists are talking about.</p>
<p>We must all bear in mind will be that sperm literally 'go through hell' in order to meet the egg. I remember an <a href="https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article-abstract/8/12/2019/639588" target="_blank">experiment</a> done by my professor way back in 1990s where they asked women who were about to have their womb removed, to be inseminated either with partner's or donor sperm, let the sperm swim for a day, and then performed surgery to remove the womb and then check how many sperm cells made it to the fallopian tubes. Fertilisation usually occurs in the fallopian tube. Considering that a normal ejaculate roughly contains at least 20 million sperm (usually in the order of 40-60 million for most people), it was found that a median of ~260 (range 79 to 1300+) made it to the tubes and had a <em>chance to participate in fertilisation</em>. That's some serious competition and some harsh drop out rates.</p>
<p>The main factors that affect impregnation, from a sperm point of view, would be:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sperm morphology</strong> - does it have a normal head/tail?</li>
<li><strong>Sperm concentration</strong> - are there enough sperm within the ejaculate?</li>
<li><strong>Capacitation</strong> - can the sperm properly undergo this 'activation process' and become capable of fertilisation? Non-capacitated sperm can't fertilise eggs.</li>
<li><strong>Progressive Motility</strong> - can the sperm swim properly and cover the distance?</li>
<li><strong>Hyperactivated Motility</strong> - can the sperm wriggle intensively to escape sticky parts of the female reproductive tract eg mucus plug at cervix, lots of mucus along the way, penetrate egg?</li>
<li><strong>Acrosome reaction</strong> - can the sperm produce enzymes to dissolve/digest the tough walls (known as zona pellucida) surrounding the egg?</li>
<li><strong>Survival</strong> - can the sperm just....survive all the way?</li>
</ol>
<p>Only when the sperm possesses all these capabilities then will it have a chance to be considered at fertilisation.</p>
<p>Increasingly folks have realised that there's another checkpoint that the sperm must bypass to trigger fertilisation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plc-zeta</strong> (think of it as like an engagement ring) - does the sperm have this protein and able to pass this protein to an egg once sperm has properly penetrated the egg? (The egg will not be fertilised if sperm cells do not present this 'engagement ring' to egg cells even if the sperm has physically entered the egg).</li>
</ul>
<p>So it's really quite an arduous journey a sperm cell has to make within the female reproductive tract, making all of us miracles of nature.</p>
<p>edit: formatting, edit2: fact checking</p>
<p>edit3: someone rightfully pointed out that i didn't really explain why ejaculation velocity <strong><em>doesn't</em></strong> matter. I've copied the comment into this post for easier reading.</p>
<p><strong><em>Here's why ejaculation velocity doesn't really matter.</em></strong></p>
<p>Apologies if I failed to provide any direct answer.</p>
<p>Ejaculation velocity does not matter at all, due to presence of a mucus plug at cervix. No matter how strong the force of ejaculation (and it's really not that strong - another poster in this thread has cited the source), the cervical mucus plug is the mechanical barrier that all sperm must overcome. Sperm cells can reach here earlier or later, but if they do not acquire hyperactivated motility to violently wiggle their way through, they are stuck there. The mucus plug is constantly replenished, so the earlier sperms can't really kamikazi for their later teammates.</p>
<p>Currently, fertility doctors are toying with the idea of physiological intracytoplasmic sperm injection (PICSI) in order to select the best sperm. Traditionally, sperm selected for ICSI just need to swim properly, look normal, and become hyperactivated when triggered with some chemical. PICSI introduces an additional step where sperm are challenged to swim up some gel which has a similar density/composition as cervical mucus plug. Only the ones that survives this ordeal would be considered.</p>
<p>Hopefully that answers the question!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Female specific factors (timing within her <del>estrous</del> menstrual cycle, hospitability of the uterine environment, etc) are far more critical to the probability of impregnation than ejaculation force. Assuming the woman has an exceedingly regular &quot;standard-length&quot; 28 day cycle, there are only \~6 specific days during that cycle where she can get pregnant with a nice little bell curved distribution. If a viable egg isn't there, appropriately matured, and receptive - you can't try to blast sperm up a little higher to improve your chances.</p>
<p>If we take the female half out of the equation, the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/male-infertility/symptoms-causes/syc-20374773" target="_blank">largest factors in male fertility</a> are (i) sperm production (# of swimmers), (ii) sperm function (health of swimmers) or (iii) physical blockages that prevent the delivery of sperm. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5889641/" target="_blank">Sperm need to swim</a> in order to meet their target, it's not like shooting in inert bead and hoping you get the bullseye.</p>
<p>For artificial insemination, <a href="https://attainfertility.com/understanding-fertility/treatment-options/artificial-insemination/artificial-insemination-the-procedure/" target="_blank">sperm can be &quot;placed&quot; in the vagina with a soft catheter</a> (low force) and result in a successful pregnancy. In animal husbandry &quot;<a href="https://extension.psu.edu/artificial-insemination-technique" target="_blank">slow delivery is recommended</a> in order to maximize semen deposition and equal flow, increasing chances of successful pregnancy.</p>
<p>There's a lot of research into sperm motility relating to pregnancy/fertility (capacity to swim of course, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5889641/" target="_blank">pattern of flagellar beating and trajectory</a>, and similar). Not a lot of easy-to-find research on delivery force/speed except to avoid imprecision or damaging sperm through excess shear forces (risk if using a syringe, not so much in a natural delivery).</p>
<p>If speed force is a factor (which it doesn't seem to be), it's a very, very small part of the puzzle. Sperm can remain viable in the woman's reproductive tract for a pretty long time, there's no real reason other than inter-sperm competition why slow-and-steady couldn't win the race.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
