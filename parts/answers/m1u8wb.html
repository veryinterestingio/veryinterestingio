		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on where you're at in a desert. Desert terrain isn't uniform, so plenty of places have no sand and are just earth and rock, while other places can be over a hundred feet deep of sand. The deepest known part of the Sahara is around 141 feet deep of sand.</p>
<p>Underneath it all is a lot of barren earth, places with nutrient-rich soil from ancient lakes and river beds, and plenty of oil due to ancient vegetation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sand depth varies both from desert to desert and also within individual ones and can vary dramatically. In most cases it will be between 1 and 10 meters, with the Sahara been often a LOT more. </p>
<p>Beneath, varies on a lot of factors, particularly the climate in ancient times. For example, in many parts of Australia, under sand, there is often a layer of clay known as regolith. This is actually in situ rock that has weathered to clay. In other areas such as south America, it is generally just rock. </p>
<p>As for valuable. Yes. Many mineral deposits are in deserts. Hence why I know this subject as I am a geologist who explores for them and have drilled many deserts around the world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Under the sand is dirt and rock. The big fields of sand dunes that are so iconic for deserts like the Sahara are called &quot;ergs&quot; and form when windblown sand meets and obstacle like mountains or countervailing winds. Ergs take an extremely long time to form so there aren't any ruins of cities from before it was a desert buried down at the bottom or anything (except maybe near the edges where deserts are expanding).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
