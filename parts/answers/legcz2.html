		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know a lot about sleep science, but you shouldn't think of yourself as having a single &quot;energy meter&quot; like in a video game. You have <em>a bunch</em> of <em>different, specific</em> meters, each of which affects you differently — meters for blood sugar, lots of different hormones, boredom, etc.</p>
<p>As the day progresses, meters will rise and fall, some due to your behaviors like eating and working, and some just due to your body's natural rhythms (your <em>circadian rhythms</em>, which simply means your bodily rhythms that cycle about once a day).</p>
<p>When enough meters are low, you feel tired. So it may be that your daily habits and personal rhythms line up so that you're tired in the afternoon, and not so much at night. Of course there's a lot more involved in sleep than what I've described, but that's one possibility.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think a lot of this has to do with <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/think-act-be/201804/frustrated-you-cant-sleep-try-staying-awake-instead" target="_blank">paradoxical intention</a>. Basically, the harder we try, the less likely we are to succeed at influencing involuntary physical responses, like suppressing a blush or sustaining an erection.  Ever notice that it can be impossible to stay awake through a boring lecture, but ten minutes later in a quiet room once you give yourself permission to nap, you suddenly feel wide awake? There's a certain combination of effort &amp; anxiety that makes your attempt backfire.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/revenge-bedtime-procrastination-is-real-according-to-psychologists" target="_blank">&quot;Revenge bedtime procrastination&quot;</a> is also a thing that makes it harder to fall asleep at night, when we finally get a moment to ourselves and don't want that free time to end. Compare that to the afternoon, when we have lots of things to do and outside obligations to meet; a nap is a welcome respite from responsibility.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our circadian rhythm takes a dive around afternoon while our adenosine levels (sleep pressure) increase. This graph illustrates it perfectly - <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://media.shortform.com/images/why-we-sleep-cycles-2.jpg&sa=U&ved=0ahUKEwjttL6YtNfuAhWV7aQKHXpnCqcQ5hMIBTAA&usg=AOvVaw31hsWyzpgujPqAYl8Yn_XV" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/url?q=https://media.shortform.com/images/why-we-sleep-cycles-2.jpg&sa=U&ved=0ahUKEwjttL6YtNfuAhWV7aQKHXpnCqcQ5hMIBTAA&usg=AOvVaw31hsWyzpgujPqAYl8Yn_XV</a></p>
<p>If you are more interested in why we sleep, I suggest the book 'Why We Sleep' which the graph is also from</p>
