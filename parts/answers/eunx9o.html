		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The origin is estimated by comparing genomes of the virus collected at different times and places.  By applying mathematical models of how the viral genome  drifts and adapts, it's possible to work backwards and choose the most likely ancestor.</p>
<p>See Genomic epidemiology of novel coronavirus (nCoV) on Nextstrain for an example of how this information is collated and presented. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You've gotten a lot of technical jargon about identifying strains and specific dna sequences of viruses but I think you were looking for more about epidemiology, which is the science used in tracking outbreaks, it's very similar to classic detective work and relies a lot on interviews and deductions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answer here is great, but would like to add if you are curious about that kind of thing, I recommend &quot;The Hot Zone&quot;. It is a book that (at least a part of it) details the search of the origin of the Ebola virus. Reading level at least middle school. I read it in HS for a biology class. I have heard it is required reading in some curriculum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
