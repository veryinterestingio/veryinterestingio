		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think I've seen this mentioned yet: The important part of CPR is generating pumping force. That is moving blood around the body to mostly the brain, heart, and kidneys. Our body utilizes a small percentage of the oxygen we breathe in. Air is 21% O2 and we exhale about 15-16%. We don't even actually use all of that 5% that we do capture. We bind most to hemoglobin and some is dissolved in the blood itself. Oxygen is still leftover as blood circulates the body. Meaning the arterial system (oxygenated) doesn't offload all of the O2 in every blood cell on the way to the capillaries and the venous (less-oxygenated) system. Venous blood still actually maintains a decent amount of Oxygen attached to it as it heads back to the heart. We don't necessarily have to give breaths initially because we need the blood to move and the small amount of oxygen we would be breathing into their lungs would not be of much benefit due to the concentrations of other gases in the lung like CO2 and atmospheric nitrogen. It is more important to circulate than it is to ventilate initially.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The latest guidance from the AHA says that only compressions are needed. The act of compressing the chest creates enough pressure differential that air will be drawn in to the lungs during compressions. But to answer you’re question, we don’t exhale 100% CO2 so the oxygen that is there is helpful to the person you’re doing CPR on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Air is approximately 20% oxygen the air we breath out still is approximately 16% oxygen so still has plenty of oxygen to be useful. However the increased amounts of CO2 in our breath can make someone else using that air breath more often.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
