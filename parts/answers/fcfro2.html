The patch could be entirely replacing existing data without changing file size, it could be adding new content not present in the install, or it can be any combination of the two.  You'd have to check the patch notes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on if the update is to patch bugs or add new content. </p>
<p>Let's say we have a house. There are some pieces of wood that have termites so we need to replace them. So we switch them out with good wood. Our house still contains practically the same amount of wood. Bugs fixed! </p>
<p>But now we want to build a porch. So we get some new wood and put up our porch, so now our house is bigger, it contains more wood. New content added! </p>
<p>tl;dr It depends mainly on the purpose of the update. If it's mainly a bug-fix patch, then a lot of that data is going to be replaced older data. If it's a content update, then it will be probably a lot of brand new data.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, every patch that's released these days contains all the incremental updates of all previous patches so you only need to download this one patch file to be updated to latest from a v1.0.  </p>
<p>Yes, this is inefficient for people who keep their programs updated but developers these days cater to the lowest common denominator.  </p>
<p>The patchfile is basically one large executable that detects what verson you're on and updates or adds the necessary files and them deletes itself after or not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A standard game updater would take in 3 types of commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>add/replace file</li>
<li>patch file</li>
<li>delete file</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding/replacing a file is basically just writing/overwriting an existing file.</p>
<p>Patching a file is when you only want to make small edits to a file, and you give instructions on how to modify file to do so (e.g. go to 10th character and replacing next 5 characters with these new 10 characters)</p>
<p>Delete file, self explanatory.</p>
<p>Which command it uses depends on how the update is generated, sometimes it makes more sense to just overwrite as a patch can be larger than the actual file.</p>
<p>Real ELI5 attempt:</p>
<p>if you eat 1kg of food, you don't necessarily gain 1kg in weight. It gets broken down and either converted to energy, stored, or passes right through your body. In fact some foods can cause you to lose weight because it costs more energy to digest than it gives you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
