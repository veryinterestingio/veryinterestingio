		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A rom is just a copy of the media.  In case of GC it's a copy of the data stored on the CD.  Some roms are encrypted, like on the 3ds and you need to decrypt them before use on a device.</p>
<p>They're called ROMs because originally they were the <em>dumps</em> of Read Only Memory chips found in cartridges and arcade cabinets.</p>
<p>Today however, they are more akin to directory structures found when browsing a PC/Mac rather than binary dumps of a single chip.   If you're emulating the GC for example, it's more appropriate to call the games you're emulating &quot;images&quot; - &quot;disc images&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the platform. Typically in older systems you would have some sort of interface to the cartridge that could pull address lines up and read data lines in sequence transferring it back to whatever you’re going to store the ROM on. </p>
<p>For a lot of the DVD based consoles they would often need custom firmwares for certain PC DVD drives or, if you could get access to run arbitrary code, you dump the game over a serial connection or network. For the GameCube it usually involved exploiting another game (i.e. Phantasy Star Online) to run a dumper that would send the contents of a GameCube mini DVD over the network to a host computer. These days it’s much easier because you can use a DVD dump tool from the Wii’s Homebrew Channel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a potato (a game) , I know how to eat this potato (I'm the console).  You have no idea what a potato is (You're the PC). To you it's just a weird object.</p>
<p>You take this weird object as is without understanding it (ROM). Then you watch me how I'm eating it, and you replicate the exact steps I'm doing (emulator) to eat the potato .</p>
<p>Now you know how to eat a potato.</p>
<p>The reason there's a limited number of potatoes you can eat, is because not all potatoes are the same. Some have a complex way of eating them , so it's hard for you to replicate the eating process. Unless you understand exactly how I'm eating those complex potatoes and replicate it yourself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The rom is essentially just a copy of the data on the original game's disc or cartridge. Exactly how you do that depends on what type of media it is and what anti-copying protections it has. Seems GC games can be copied with a modded Wii.</p>
<p>That can be played on Android via an emulator. An emulator is a piece of software that interprets the code from the rom and executes it, and emulates the environment of the original console.</p>
<p>I don't know why there are only a limited number of roms. They're easy enough to create for someone who knows what they're doing. Depends where you're getting them from I suppose. Sharing roms is illegal so maybe a lot are getting taken down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a software standpoint, the physical medium is irrelevant. A disk / cartridge contains either a file (usually a memory image directly loaded into ram or directly addressable as memory) or a file system that can be traversed and contains a listing of files / directories.</p>
<p>For an emulator, you can intercept and emulate at the high level apis such as chdir (change directory), open, read, and write functions and just provide the expected file / directory. At a low level, you can emulate the hardware, so reading of a memory or an io register needs to provide the correct data based on the command provided. In the case of old school roms, you can probably just load the ROM into memory at the addresses (or emulated addresses) defined by the system or loader. Ie, for older systems generally the cartridge was always loaded at the same address and if it's memory mapped there's basically no difference between ram and rom at a software level. I think the N64 was the first cartridge system that didn't memory map the cartridge and instead treated it as a disk.</p>
<p>CDs, DVDs, and beyond will have a file system similar to any disk (floppy, USB, hard drive, etc). It may or may not be something standard like ISO9600, but the premise is the same, you have a data structure to traverse that consists of directories and files. It is more likely you could get away with high level emulation for disk based systems than cartridge based systems.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, it's not really even different than how computers work now. When your device boots (PC or phone), it goes to a specific memory address where ROM is located and begins executing. Generally this sets up a few things, and then goes to a memory address where the initial removable storage is mapped. At this point, or maybe a few more code jumps, you'll have enough software loaded that you can start issuing open, seek, and read write commands to a disk, which has its own simple processor and firmware to understand the commands, so you can move away from the limited storage of having to memory map everything on the disk, while also giving up the simplicity. Load a bit more software and now you have the convenience of a file system driver, that lets you issue your chdir, list dir, open file, read file, write file, etc commands.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
