		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you've been on the beach laying in the sun, your body is trying to recover from the excessive heat it has gotten. If you have been in the water, your body is trying to recover from all the bashing of the waves. If you have been swimming, your body is trying to recover from all the abnormal muscle movements you made. If you have been playing volleyball, it is because of the excess impressions you were trying to make to impress the other people on the beach. If you haven't eaten and drunk enough, your body is just grumpy.</p>
<p>And since you're Australian, you are most likely missing a leg from a sharkbite, your other leg is covered with bluebottle or man-of-war stingers, you have been crushed multiple times on the rocks, you twisted your ankle in a rock pool, a snake bit your toe and you just heard that you have a new prime minister.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even if you have sunblock on every three hours and wear a hat, the water reflections get under the hat and you usually get some measure of mild sunstroke after four hours or so. The biggest impacts are top of the head where you don't usually apply sunblock, the back of the neck, the forehead and the front of the neck down to chest.</p>
<p>If you're in the water, you often don't even . notice the amount of sun affecting you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Walking and staying on your feet all day in hot temperatures wear a person out. That is just walking along the beach. As soon as you add in swimming, volleyball, surfing, etc you have more movement and exercise. Just walking around in the water causes someone to burn more calories because of the increase in resistance from the water.</p>
<p>Then there are the electrolytes lost through sweating, poor re-hydration and alcohol</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
