		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the slippery factor. But, they can get tangled when put in unnatural conditions like aquariums with artificial continuous flow. They're evolved to live with fluctuating currents, and their own tentacles slide over and off each other. When kept in close quarters with other things--other jellyfish, corals, fish, etc--they can get caught in those items or sting the live objects to death.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of sally who has the longest hair in class. When sally goes underwater, does her hair become tangled as she shifts directions in water? They don't because of how inertia works in water. Each strand of hair flows uniformly in the same direction.</p>
<p>Lets say hypothetically they get attacked by some bored dolphin and it decides to leave after trying to eat one. The inertia from the water will naturally flow between the strands and they will eventually untangle. If it dies, it's because the dolphin ate that thing whole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Jellyfish tentacles are not some collection of dead cells that hang without control. A jellyfish can move them, contract and expand, so if they do get tangled, they can get untangled as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
