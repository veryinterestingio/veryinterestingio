<p>It's the dehydration. Alcohol stops you kidneys from capturing water, so you basically pee out all your water and electrolytes despite the fact you drank a lot. As a result of dehydration, your saliva production really halts. Normally you might have bad morning breath because you don't clean your whole mouth with saliva at night, but when dehydrated from alcohol it gets much worse. What will help somewhat is drinking as much water as possible, with some electrolytes as well. That goes for almost all symptoms of a hangover too, water beforehand and during with alleviate them to some degree. Alcohol also causes heart burn or even nausea, and if anything from your stomach is getting anywhere near your mouth or throat it's also going to smell even worse. Tums or something beforehand would help too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I haven't seen anyone mention yet that you breathe out ethanol after you drink. The alcohol in you blood passes through your lungs and you breath out ethanol (also how breathalyzers work). So it's not just dehydration, you also have ethanol in your mouth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
