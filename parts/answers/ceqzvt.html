<p>Since alligators and crocodiles overlap in range in the Everglades and in Southern Florida in general, are there any interactions between them? Are there fights, or awkward mating attempts?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>And (to settle a debate I have with a friend if you don’t mind) if crocodilians had gone extinct in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, do you think that we would colloquially refer to them as dinosaurs today?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
