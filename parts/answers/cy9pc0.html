		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>hard to say, depends on the circumstance.</p>
<p>There are some groups in the asia/africa region who will plant trees for anyone willing to pay.  You see charities and such that collect money and donate it to these groups.</p>
<p>Its unclear how sustainable their tree planting is, photos suggest its extremely dense planting in already heavily wooded areas.  By the letter, they are fulfilling their obligation; realistically, its not accomplishing much.</p>
<p>Other times, they are planted in a deforested area, which could be very productive.  But its a hell of a lot more work to plant over a huge swath of land at a reasonable density.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Commercial logging in Canada is required to replant everything they cut down. The programs are well-developed. We have stands on the coast of British Columbia that have been clearcut and planted and regrown for multiple cycles now.</p>
<p>Depending on the conditions on the cutblock, the size and species of sapling that has the best odds of growing will be planted. In areas where there is heavy forage, treeplanters will also install protective structures (generally a stake and a cone) to deter herbivores.</p>
<p>These cutblocks do well. Most trees take. Sometimes treeplanters have to go back and replant if there's a dry year or otherwise unforeseen condition, but most blocks only need to be replanted once.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on local conditions.  We planted ~200 trees on our property, the majority didn't grow because the soil/water wasn't suitable.  A couple years later it was filled with volunteer trees from the neighbouring Christmas tree farm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
