		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Octopus have muscles too, but while mammals have mainly linear muscles, octopus have mainly circular muscles. This paper describes it well, although in very scientific terms: <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2016.00010/full" target="_blank">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2016.00010/full</a></p>
<p>Since the muscles are arranged circularly around the tentacle, there are no large fibrous strands to give the same texture as mammal meat.</p>
<p>Edit ELI4: muscles in mammals are fibres. The fibres stretch and relax to change shape and move the body. Muscles in octopus are rings. Stretching and relaxing also changes shapes.</p>
<p>Fibres and rings have different texture. One is grainy, the other is smooth. Thatâ€™s why when you eat octopus it feels different.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had a similar thought while eating crab the other day. That's also a very different muscle structure and it seems way too fragile to enable the strength that I know crustaceans can have. I've never cracked open an uncooked crab, and I'm sure the meat changes during cooking, but even still. How do crustacean muscles work?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
