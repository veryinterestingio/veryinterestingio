<p>IR thermometers work just by looking at the amount of light it receives from wherever it's pointing. The same way you can tell that one hot piece of metal is hotter than another piece by the amount of visible light given off.</p>
<p>So light interacts with different materials in different ways. Infrared light in this case doesn't really interact much with air just like visible light. If it did, the atmosphere would look cloudy to infrared cameras. As such there's very little IR light being emitted by the air between you and the thing you're measuring. As well as that the air isnt absorbing much IR light. The actual object will almost always be the bigger factor by far.</p>
<p>Not so fun fact, that small amount of interaction with IR light is partially due to the CO2 in the air hence why as the amount of CO2 in the air rises the amount of Earth's heat that is absorbed by the air also rises causing the greenhouse effect (water, methane and other gases also do the same thing).</p>
<p>Edit: TL;DR: IR thermometers do get affected by the air between them and their target by not enough to really matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I never got a satisfactory understanding of one of them. But regardless of exactly how the work;</p>
<p>They measure temperature by capturing the infrared radiation of whatever they're looking at. How much a thing radiate infrared depends on something called 'emissivity' and i think most of tbose thermometers have a setting to correct for it; its 1 for what we call 'black body' and 0 for mirror like or white things, with most real things somewhere in between.</p>
<p>Now your scenario; air is mostly transparent at the wavelength used by the thermometers, so it would only really see ir radiation from the object it is looking at. Meanwhile the transparency also means that the emissivity is nearly 0; it doesn't radiate much radiation, even if it were hot. More accurately, its just that there are far fewer air molecules flying around to emit anything at all, compared to a solid object; if you clump up enough gasses and heat it up, it would emit like a black body. (Stars! And thats how you tell how hot they are too). Finally, in most measurement scenario, the thing you are trying to measure will be by far the hottest thing within the column of air in the visual field of the object, so even if the air was denser and had higher emissivity, it wouldn't emit much. </p>
<p>This would be why its not affected by the air temperarure you are looking through.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ol>
<li>Everything emits radiation because of how hot it is. When it gets really hot it gets hot enough that you can see that radiation (the object will start to glow.</li>
<li>The reason that a infrared (IR) thermometer can measure the surface temperature of an object and not the air is that air is simply not very dense. Your average solid object is about 1000+ times as dense as air which means that the vast majority of heat radiation will come from the thing you're aiming at. Air also doesn't absorb heat radation (much). It''s pretty much as transparent to heat radiation as it is to visible light (it will however absorb other types of heat transfer).</li>
</ol>
<p>This means that you can pretty accurately measure the heat radiation from that object and based on that energy reading determine its temperature. This does however mean that you can't measure through glass. Glass and liquids will obscure whatever is behind them since they're as dense and therefor emit enough thermal radiation to obscure whatever is behind them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While most of the other answers are much more detailed and correct, here is a very intuitive way to understand it: </p>
<p>When you take a picture of something with your phone how does it capture the objects in front of it instead of the air? Because the air is transparent in the wavelength you are capturing.</p>
<p>This isn't a perfect metaphor, but it is probably the simplest metaphor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
