		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It does. It's called the feedforward mechanism, and it is caused by chemicals known as the incretins (GLP-1, secretin). When food enters the digestive system, the incretins stimulate the pancreatic beta cells to release insulin, so when the glucose gets absorbed, insulin is already there. However, this is more of a preparatory step and not a major driving force of insulin release, since much more is released when glucose is in the blood.</p>
<p>Edit: I’ll add this, the feedforward mechanism is not why you’re administering insulin in-advance though, since insulin only has 6 minutes half-life (doesn’t stay for a long time in the blood). The time of administration depends on how fast the drug is being absorbed into the blood and the route of administration. Also note that there are diabetes drugs that specifically work on the incretins (either mimic them or prevent their breakdown), so they’re significant :D</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As with almost all bodily functions things are a bit more complicated than most responders here explain. </p>
<p>The short and sweet is yes. You do release insulin in response to environmental cues including visual recognition of food. It also is released from other cues like time of day, sweetness taste, and almost anything else that you care to train into the brain. </p>
<p>Sure. The major and greatest response is to blood sugar level. But studies clearly show other things have an affect too. </p>
<p>It is called the cephalic phase insulin response. It may be why nobody really loses weight moving to sugarfree but still sweet foods. </p>

<p>Here is a quick article which I found interesting on the matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, insulin is released in response to rising blood sugar as the sugars in food are digested and absorbed into the blood. Insulin release is quite “instant” and manages blood sugars within a relatively tight range. Hence insulin is released after food is already being digested. </p>
<p>As a type one diabetic, you need to administer insulin before food because it takes time for that insulin to be absorbed from the subcutaneous fat (under the skin) into your bloodstream and take effect. </p>
<p>So, no, the pancreas does not produce insulin in anticipation of food. It only produces insulin once blood sugar begins to rise after eating (digesting) food. </p>
<p>You administer insulin in anticipation of food to allow time for it to be absorbed and to work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
