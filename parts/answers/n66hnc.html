<p>The first black hole merger observed through gravitational waves (GW150914) was a merger of a black hole of ~35 solar masses and a black hole of ~30 solar masses (i.e. 35 and 30 times the mass of our Sun). The final black hole had a mass of ~62 solar masses. </p>
<p>So, you might notice the final black hole had less mass than the original two combined. The &quot;missing&quot; ~3 solar masses was almost all radiated out as gravitational waves, over the course of less than a second.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
