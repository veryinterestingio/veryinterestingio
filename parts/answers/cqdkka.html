		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ants place scent trails wherever they walk; a lost ant will wander randomly until she crosses an existing scent trail, at which point she will follow it home.  Some species can in fact use &quot;landmarks&quot; - familiar non-ant scents, familiar tactile sensations, familiar sights, or the magnetic field of the earth, all of which can help orient them and find their way home.</p>
<p>However, all that time away from her smelly home (and any time spent on your smelly arm or in your smelly breath) may have washed the ant's scent away to the point that her nestmates won't recognize her, will assume she is an invader, and will attack and kill her as soon as she gets home.</p>
<p>So <em>chances are</em> the ant is fucked.  But it's okay.  Ants die all the time, and the queen lays eggs fast enough to compensate for this fact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not my field, but they're probably fine. Ants use scent trails to communicate. Chances are an ant from its colony had already passed through there.</p>
<p>Not sure if they have anything more sophisticated, but they're very good with scent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As already comented before, ants use scent trails but they are also able to use landmarks for orientation or use path integration which means they &quot;count&quot; every step in each direction and sum it up to get a return vector to the nest (also called &quot;dead reckoning&quot;). Most of the time it's a combination of one or more methods, depending on how close the ant is to the nest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
