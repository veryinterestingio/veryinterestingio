The lungs are also lined with tiny hairs called cilia that beat in a coordinated fashion to slowly push the mucus up and out of your lungs as new, fresh mucus is produced to take its place. The old, dirty mucus reaches the top of your airway where you may cough it out, but healthy people usually swallow it continually. It is then cleared through your digestive system, which (unlike the lungs) is quite robust to dirt and bacteria and such.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually you have many airway defense mechanisms. First the hairs in your nose filter out the majority of larger particles. Smaller ones that reach your trachea and bronchioles are trapped by ciliated (hair like cells) and goblet cells which produce sticky mucus. This is gradually shifted upward and you spit or swallow it out. The few particles that get through into your deep lung, or alveoli, are dealt with by macrophage immune cells which essentially eat the particles. On top of this actions such as coughing and sneezing cause a huge expiration which can shift particles too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you have ‘healthy’ lungs, most dust that you breathe in, get trapped in the trachea, bronchi &amp; brochioles.  Those parts of the Respiratory system have epithelial glands lining them that produce mucous continually&amp; the cilia present help to sweep that mucous up &amp; into the back of your throat.  Most ‘regular’ dirt &amp; dust particles are handled by your body this way.  That said all ‘dust’ particles aren’t the same. Some types of airborn particles have different morphological shapes, such as asbestos, which embed within the tissue itself &amp; will never be expelled.  Cigarettes, &amp; also marijuana, when smoked &amp; inhaled have plant-based substances that turn into a sticky tar-like substance that covers the cilia &amp; blocking the mucous-generating cells, eventually killing them &amp; causing a chronic inflammatory process that causes permanent scarring of the bronchi &amp; bronchioles.  That is called a ‘Chronic Bronchitis’.  The scarring shrinks as it goes on - as all scars do, &amp; causes narrowing of the airways.  The narrowing causes difficulty breathing, because your body, when healthy, will dilate the bronchi &amp; bronchioles in conditions where you need more oxygen, like running, or if you’re sick.  Emphysema is the result of chronic narrowing of the airways, making the lungs unable to expel the expired carbon dioxide (what you get after breathing in &amp; using up oxygen).  The trapped carbon dioxide dilates the alveoli because of the increased pressure.  The Carbon Dioxide also takes up space in the lungs that should have oxygen in them- rendering those parts of the killings useless.  So, it matters what types of ‘dust’ or other matter you are inhaling into your lungs.  Even campfire smoke is harmful to your lungs, as are cleaning agents &amp; many chemicals used in manufacturing.
Your Gastrointestinal (GI) Tract (from your mouth to your rectum) is contained of differentiated specialized epithelial cells.  Your skin is an example of a specialized epithelial tissue, but the GI Tract is not the same.  Your GI tract is specialized to breakdown food, to absorb the food, &amp; then excrete &amp; defecate the waste products.  The GI tract includes the liver, pancreas &amp; the gallbladder, that help to breakdown &amp; regulate what products get absorbed, how much gets absorbed.  Your body, with the help of hormones &amp; other organs, help to make all the substances your body needs, such as more hormones, sugar, insulin, bone, blood, an immune system, &amp; everything else.  Different types of nutrients are absorbed in different parts of the small bowel, in fact, if a person loses a part of their small bowel, they run the risk of having a mal-absorption syndrome, where certain types of food can’t be absorbed.<br />
Sorry for the ‘lecture’, but wanted to get some things straight. I don’t want people to be mis-informed.  This may seem long, but obviously this is a health-Science where new findings are being discovered continually, &amp; there are textbooks, classes &amp; specialists in all these areas.  If you have any concerns, it would well be worth the effort to consult with a specialist, rather than to hope to get ‘good’ info from a social website.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Although some answers here are correct, they are incomplete. </p>
<p>There are 3 ways that inhaled dust is removed. </p>
<ol>
<li>Impaction</li>
<li>Sedimentation</li>
<li>Alveolar immune response</li>
</ol>
<p>In Impaction, large inhaled particles &gt;5um  get caught in the nasopharynx (back of the throat) and are swallowed </p>
<p>Sedimentation occurs in the bronchi of the lungs in which particles that are able to enter these airways (1-5 um in size) get removed by the mucociliary clearance system</p>
<p>Particles that are able to get down to the Alveoli (smaller than .1um) are engulfed by macrophages</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
