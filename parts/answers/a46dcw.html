		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just like the importance of exposing kids to various foods with different textures and flavour from early on, it's got a lot to do with that you are used to.</p>
<p>I recommend checking out a few episodes of freaky eaters. Especially the episode where they gradually try to make a woman who has eaten nothing but cheesy potatoes for 30 years not gag but enjoy the textures and tastes of other foods. </p>
<p>Now I wish I could acquire a taste for tomatoes.. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like others mentioned, constant exposure.  But it's not just to one particular beer.  Over time you've probably tried different brands, different flavors/types, and even how they were poured or served (can, bottle, or pulled from a draft).</p>
<p>The same can be said for any type of food.  Take for example broccoli.  I know a lot of people, both kids and adults, who hate broccoli.  They've probably only had it one or two ways, but when you try it served other ways, either as a side dish or as an ingredient in an entree, you might come to like broccoli.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By continually exposing themselves to it. You didn't like beer but you kept having beer until you liked it. Now you like beer. </p>
<p>You become accustomed to the taste. Usually with beer it's the bitterness, but after having it more and more you got used to it. Now you can ignore the bitterness and enjoy other flavors in it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember all my life hating olives. Like I had eaten them and knew what they tasted like and did not like them in the slightest.</p>
<p>Then one day I had a craving for something and I didn’t know what it was. And I realized it was olives. I went from not eating olives for about 10 years because I didn’t like them to suddenly needing to eat a fucking olive like right now lol</p>
<p>Very strange experience but now I love olives!!!</p>
<p>Anyway I have nothing to back this up but it makes sense to me. So I figure when your young your taste buds are not developed. So you like basic flavours. Sweet. Salty.  Kids love ketchup because of this. Things that are bitter or pungeant or strong tasting overwhelm you and your brain recoils. So you don’t like that. But as your taste buds mature you can get by the initial sharpness of strong flavours and pick out the nuances.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
