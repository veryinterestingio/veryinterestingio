<p>Though to answer the question of thunder (in the case of there is lightning) snow acts as a sound dampener. Go outside after a snow fall and notice how it's eerily quiet. That's because sound waves get trapped in the nooks and crannies in the fresh fallen snow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Clouds need to collect a charge imbalance in order to create lightning. The way this happens is when all the water/ice particles knock together in the cloud. The primary way of this happening is (loosely speaking) when warmer air from below forces cloud particles upwards, while cooler air allows cloud particles at the top to cool and fall downwards.</p>
<p>In the summer, it's easy to get an unstable storm because there's lots of warm/hot air down below the clouds that rises very quickly, but in the winter, the air below the clouds is already much cooler and there's less of a temperature gradient to push the air upwards. This leads to a much more stable storm overall, but also means there's no lightning, and by extension, no thunder.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have seen a lot of answers on here. A lot beating around the bush of the root cause I feel.</p>
<p>In Summer storms have stronger updrafts (rapidly rising air), this rapidly rising air helps to separate small ice particles which have a positive charge, from liquid water which has a slightly negative charge. The small ice particles are carried high up into the atmopshere, while the rain drops fall to the ground. As this continues you are building a large electrical difference between the ground and top of the cloud. In order to remove this difference, a flow of electrons travel down to the ground in the forn of lightning. The lightning breaks the sound barrier forming thunder. </p>
<p>In winter these updrafts are weaker therefore they cannot as efficiently separate the smaller ice particles from now larger ice particles (because winter). Therefore no electrical difference, no lightning and thus no thunder. However, sometimes in winter you can get conditions that are supportive of big thunderstorms much like in summer and you can get the phenomena known as thundersnow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
