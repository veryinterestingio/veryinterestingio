		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Things that cost more money in a screen:</p>
<ul>
<li>More pixels</li>
<li>Smaller pixels</li>
<li>Higher refresh rate</li>
<li>Faster response rate</li>
<li>Higher dynamic range</li>
</ul>
<p>When comparing a 4k TV to a 4k monitor, the only thing that really stays the same is the number of pixels.  Everything else about those pixels and how they behave makes a monitor more expensive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Input delay/lag is a big selling point for computer monitors, Smaller and Faster costs more.</p>
<p>Input Delay is the time between when you press a button and the action happens on the screen. Gaming monitors all aim for 1ms input delay (1/1000 of a second). Cheap TV's can have extremely bad input delay anywhere from 20 to 500ms that makes playing games annoying.</p>
<p>edit: I confused input delay and response time. Also I own a cheap 55&quot; flat screen from 2011 that has a 500ms delay. I confirmed this by mirroring my pc output with a millisecond counter running on screen. I took a picture of the TV and computer monitor side by side and counted a 500milisecond difference. The TV is too old to have a &quot;game mode.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pixel density.  Smaller areas with the same numbers of pixels are harder to manufacture well. Add to that the fact you're sitting a few meters away from a 60&quot; 4k TV, but 40cm away from a 30&quot; 4k monitor means theres a need for higher quality displays to make sure colours are reproduced correctly and text is legible. Also consider sales volume of 4k TVs is far higher than 4k monitors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
