<p>Basically, you always unconsciously walk while spending minimum energy (minimum potential energy) to do so. When they want to model someone's gait, they model the dynamics their body and calculate the most energy efficient way to travel from point a to b. This will give super close results. Even when you have an injury, you will still take the minimum energy path within limits of your injured joints. </p>
<p>Since everyone's body (and dynamics) is a little different, your minimum energy path (gait) will be a little different.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your gait is super-heavily influenced by the size, shape, and mass distribution of your entire body. You are basically a stack of pendulums on top of another, upside-down pendulum, and since every part of you is connected to every other part, your organs' momentum pulls on everything. Something off about your shoulder might change how you move your arms, which changes how you move your feet in order to compensate. Even subtle differences exponentially compound just because of how complex people are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A series of simple actions forms a very complex whole action. Walking seems simple, but when you add up all the tiny little movements, it is a fairly complex whole movement. More pieces = more possibilities = more differences.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
