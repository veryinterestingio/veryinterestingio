		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In superconducting quantum computing one typically uses Josephson junctions (superconducting tunnel junctions) to make anharmonic resonators that act as qubits. Junctions are made by litography like classical CPUs. Such qubits are prepared by microwave pulses that correspond to rotations on the Bloch sphere. Entanglement between qubits is generated by variable coupling (in the simplest case adjusting current through a Josephson junction changes its inductance and thus coupling). The Junctions are almost purely reactive so no loss is associated with them. Readout is usually done by reflecting a microwave pulse from a coupled microwave resonator and then determining the phase of the reflected pulse (which depends on the state of the qubit). Losses etc. limit the coherence time within which one has to do all the operations. The actual arrangements tend to be a bit more complicated, but that's the general idea. One gets pretty far with the experimental side of things by just doing classical circuit simulation. Understanding the many particle behavior between readouts maybe no so much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several different ways people are trying to create large orders of Entangled qubits. One of the most promising methods (which IBM have focussed on) is the use of superconductors called a Josephson Junctions.
The Wikipedia entry is a good starting point, especially if you pull up and read through the sources. </p>
<p>In general, I find the best place to go for physics papers is ArXiv.org which is essentially a pre-print archive of science and mathematics based papers which can be viewed before they are picked up by journals. Their quality can vary wildly with some being simple to understand and others can make very little sense. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of good responses here so far, but none of them really cover the enormous range of ways that people have proposed for implementing quantum computation. In theory any 2-level quantum system can act as a qubit, and there are plenty of ways to make such systems including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Superconducting qubits. These have been mentioned already in a good answer by /u/den31 but additionally I'll say that these qubits come in a few different types: phase, charge and flux. These three types encode qubits using (respectively) the phase of the superconducting wavefunction, the number of charges on an &quot;island&quot; in the circuit and the magnetic flux through a superconducting ring. Superconducting qubits are currently the most popular implementation of QC with companies like Google investing quite heavily in R&amp;D for them. <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/03/a-preview-of-bristlecone-googles-new.html" target="_blank">https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/03/a-preview-of-bristlecone-googles-new.html</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spin qubits. The spin of a fermion is a natural 2-level quantum system (and a lot of the theory for qubits came from theories developed for looking at fermionic spins). Spins qubits can be implemented using nitrogen-vacancy centres (see /u/SamStringTheory's comment), single-electron quantum dots or really anything that lets you isolate a single electron. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trapped ions. You choose two electronic energy levels of an ion to act as your qubit states so each ion encodes one qubit. Interactions between ions in the trap are used to perform computation. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Photons. You can encode a qubit using horizontal and vertical photon polarisations. /u/ihasaccount has a good comment about this. </p>
</li>
<li>Topological quantum computing. This one is extra weird, and uses particles called non-Abelian anyons. There is currently no experimental evidence for the existence of these particles, but in theory they exist in 2 dimensions and you can change their state by swapping their order (I can go into this in more detail if you'd like, but this is currently the least viable implementation so I wouldn't worry about it too much if I were you). This is what Microsoft have put their money behind because this method is much less susceptable to errors than the others I have mentioned, but there's also a chance that these particles simply don't exist so its a very high-risk, high-reward approach. </li>
</ul>
<p>And probably plenty more that I've missed. I haven't gone too much into the really fine details of fabrication and gate implementation etc because I work more with the theory of this stuff so I don't know enough to go into that level of detail. I think this is probably a good starting point for looking more into it for yourself though, which you seem quite keen to do. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
