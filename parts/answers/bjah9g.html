		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During the day, the cells in your brain have a lot of work to do. Each cell is like a little factory working hard to build proteins and shuffle ions around and help you be you; coordinating every plan you make and piece of info you retrieve and breakfast burrito you pick up to eat with massive efforts. So much work! In the process, like any factory, some trash builds up that doesn't get taken out. The cells are simply too busy! You have breakfast burritos to eat and people to recognize!</p>
<p>At night, your brain (pineal gland what's good!) coordinates a hormone cascade to help get you relaxed and sleepy and off to dreamland. Once you are asleep, the liquid bath that your brain floats in all day becomes the star of the show. Your brain goes into dishwasher self-clean mode! Lots of swishing and sloshing, extra production of the liquid sweeping through the brain. This is when your brain cells can take out their trash and make sure it gets on and out and that proteins out for garbage don't gum up the works. This is just one reason that skipping sleep may make you feel off; your brain did not get to take out it's trash and dump it into the cerebrospinal fluid trash river! The same fluid that steals away toxins and trash proteins also nourishes the cells, getting them primed for all their work the next day!</p>
<p>Edit: Wow! My first ELI5 comment ever, thank you for the gold and silver! I will definitely try to do this again with topics I understand. Cheeeeeers!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cortisol increases in your system and can be damaging to your body in high amounts. Your brain unable to rest builds waste which impairs your cognitive abilities(Memory impairment,fatigued muscles etc...). You may start seeing things if you stay up too long as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nobody mentioned Testosterone.  You make testosterone when you sleep. Poor sleep or an all-nighter can reduce your testosterone levels, which will make you weaker in the gym. Should recover relatively quickly (a week?). I found zinc and tribulus helpful.  </p>
<p>Source: had sleep apnea for a few years and saw my testosterone and gym performance go to zero (along with my sex drive). I notice similar effects after a red-eye flight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems no one addressed the second part of OP's question in the title, so I'll try to answer that.</p>
<p>How long it takes to recover varies by person. I've read before that it takes about two weeks of normal sleep (7 to 9 hours each night) to fully recover from an all nighter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
