		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Biologist here, it’s basically a case of too much grooming/preening, i.e. it’s an attempt at self-care that’s taken too far. Once there starts to be skin damage it can get itchy, which makes the problem even worse, and it can take on some addiction features of  compulsively repeated behavior. But in the initial stages the animal is just trying to soothe itself and take care of itself by grooming or preening. Boredom can also play a role in setting it off; if animal is alone in a small cage with nothing interesting around, it can end up grooming/preening too long just because there is literally nothing else to do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><h2>Physical distress:</h2>
<ul>
<li>From improper or severe wing-clipping: Wings that are cut too close to the feather shaft can cause discomfort when the cut tips rub against the bird’s body, causing the bird to chew and pull until she removes the stub</li>
<li>From being removed from their parents and subjected to the rigors of transport at too young an age</li>
<li>From being passed around from home to home</li>
<li>From the stress of hand-feeding when done by inexperienced people</li>
<li>From not enough hours of rest, not being able to bathe, or not being misted</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fear:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Feeling threatened by a family pet, by a teasing child, or by a person who reminds the parrot of another person who was unkind (for example, some parrots have an aversion toward males or females, some are afraid of children)</li>
<li>Being afraid of an object or an animal (e.g., a grandfather clock with a loud gong, loud or violent programming on TV, a cat who jumps up toward the parrot’s cage)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Physical environment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Objects located directly overhead or higher than the bird</li>
<li>A nearby cage where there is a larger or more aggressive bird</li>
<li>Placement of another bird’s cage so that the other bird is higher</li>
<li>A cage placed too low, near the floor</li>
<li>An environment where there is too much or too little humidity, too little natural light, incorrect lighting, or lighting that is too bright at night (try a very dim night light)</li>
<li>Traffic noise or too much activity taking place nearby</li>
</ul>
<h2>Loss and grief:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Loss of a mate or a friend, whether the friend is a bird, a human, a dog, etc.</li>
<li>Loss of something that’s been familiar over a long time: her cage, a favorite toy (usually this is a factor along with other causes), a view out the window</li>
</ul>
<h2>Any other kind of significant change:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Relocation of the bird’s cage, being relegated to a back room, or being placed in a room with too much noise or activity</li>
<li>Changes in the family situation: moving, divorce, grown children going away or moving back home</li>
<li>Changes in the bird’s environment, such as erratic room temperature changes  </li>
</ul>
<p>After I lost my spouse my Tui-bird had to stay at a friends, said friend was more apathetic then I thought so out of boredom and despair he plucked. thankfully he is with mum now and back to being the sweary, feathery disney bird I brought home 14 years ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
