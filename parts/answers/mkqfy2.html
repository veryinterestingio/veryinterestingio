		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 4 main types.</p>
<p>FPSO - Floating Production Storage and Offloading. Basically a converted tanker anchored in place. (Multiple anchors, sometimes as many as 12-18).</p>
<p>Semi-sub. - Looks like a fixed oil rig above the water but basically has big pontoons just under the water level to make it float, and is again anchored in place.</p>
<p>Jack-up. - Exactly what it says on the tin. Normally a big floating body that gets owed in to place by tugs and then has legs that jack it up in the air.</p>
<p>Fixed. - Big steel structure that sits on the seabed. normally on concrete piles.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Then there are also some weird less common versions. e.g. Norway has one that is a set of giant concrete tubes and is held in place on a soft seabed by sucking itself into the ground.</p>
<p>In most cases they are not in really deep water. Most of the UK is less than 100m deep. Even when we do talk about &quot;deepwater&quot;, we normally mean 200-300m, not really deep ocean.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends, some are on long legs and some float.</p>
<p>The floating ones are held in position by several anchors, although some exploration rigs just use motors and thrusters to hold themselves stationary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My dad works in the oil industry and explained this to me.</p>
<p><strong>How they are installed:</strong></p>
<p>When geographers and surveyors find (or expect) an oil reservoir underneath the ocean, they send a team to go down there and make a 'plug' that an oil rig can later attach themselves to to get out the oil. This part isn't super clear, but also isn't that important because we're talking about oil rigs, here.</p>
<p><strong>Why oil rigs float:</strong></p>
<p>It's important to realize what exactly is going on here. Sure, it may just sound like a big puddle of oil under the ground (which it essentially is), but it's been down there for <em>millions</em> of years and has been under <em>extreme</em> pressure levels. If you break the seal, all that oil is going to explode out and leak into the water. That is bad. So, we make some kind of 'cork' to regulate the outflow of oil.</p>
<p>That cork CANNOT be directly attached to the rig. Even if the rig is stable, unexpected changes in the water can move the entire rig, breaking open that cork, dumping out all that oil into the life-rich ocean. (See the last section for more).</p>
<p>Oil rigs are crazy expensive, and oil reservoirs have limited supply. So it's important that you make these oil rigs reusable and easily transportable over great distances. <strong>This is why oil rigs float.</strong></p>
<p>When enough oil was pulled out, they seal it up the hole with concrete, wait for it to dry, then float away. </p>
<p><strong>Real-world context (****<em>Deepwater Horizon</em></strong> <strong>@ 2010, optional):</strong></p>
<p>BP (British Petroleum) is one of the largest oil companies in the world. To save money, they picked up a &quot;it hasn't fucked up yet, so why would it now?&quot; mentality, and chose to not follow through completely with sealing the hole at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico. The seal was unstable, and boom. 11 people were killed in an explosion that leaked 134 million gallons of oil into the ocean, equivalent to 200 Olympic-sized swimming pools.</p>
