		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, there are multiple ways to answer this. Yes, scientists (generally, material engineers) study physical tying knots. There are multiple studies that I'll link to. As for strength, that's a big question. Friction/surface area, material, and use all factor into strength. According to one source (2), one of the strongest knots is the tensionless hitch due to its &quot;friction and a very gradual bend.&quot; Additionally, a knot can decrease the strength of a rope (3) every time one is tied, so an older rope will become weaker over time. If I had to summarize it, I would say, &quot;when it comes to knot strength, there are a lot of factors and variation between tests; however, in general, figure-8 knots are the strongest.&quot; Sources:</p>

<p><strong>As an interesting sidenote</strong>, there is a field of mathematics called <a href="https://www.knotplot.com/knot-theory/" target="_blank">knot theory</a>, so I can definitely say there <em>is</em> a science about knots. At the most basic level, it's studying what would happen if you took a unit circle and deformed (or tangled it) in 3D space. The reason it's worth studying is because some knots are the same as (homeomorphic to) other knots, and other knots can be distinguished based on their properties (# of crossings, where the crossings are, etc.). This actually has a few real-world applications, such as DNA untangling, <a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0219887811005798" target="_blank">cryptography</a>, and <a href="https://www.livescience.com/1903-science-knots-unraveled.html" target="_blank">how objects (like electrical cords) get tangled</a>.</p>
