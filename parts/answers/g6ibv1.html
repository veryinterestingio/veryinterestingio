When crickets rub the upper and lower parts of their wings together, they create a chirping sound called â€œstridulating.&quot; </p>

<p>u/superspifffy: A  large vein running along the bottom of each wing has &quot;teeth,&quot; much like  a comb does. The chirping sound is created by running the top of one  wing along the teeth at the bottom of the other wing. As he does this,  the cricket also holds the wings up and open, so that the wing membranes  can act as acoustical sails. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bjcg4eCcihE" target="_blank">Video with further info</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
