		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of vaccines are cultured in chicken eggs by injecting viruses into fertilised eggs. It takes one egg per vaccine dose. In the US, for the flu vaccine, this means a supply of 140 million fertilised eggs per year. It could be disasterous if a nasty disease spread to the special population of chickens that produce these eggs. Someone with poultry is a possible disease vector hence restrictions. In the US, the location of the farms is considered a matter of national security and armed guards are on site! </p>
<p>However I imagine this restriction only really applies to certain parts of the vaccine industry, particularly around manufacturing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Poultry are commonly infected with various <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/retrovirus?s=t" target="_blank">retroviruses</a> (retroviruses have the ability to splice their genetic code into ours) which risk crossing over to humans. [0]  Cancer causing viruses are widespread among poultry, for example, and these are known to be able to infect humans; poultry workers have unusually high rates of certain rare cancers caused by these viruses [1], and behind them are people who handle raw poultry on the distribution end [2]. Consumers who handle raw poultry are believed to be at higher risk of getting infected by these viruses as well.</p>
<p>I suspect that barring people with poultry at home may be a way to manage the risk of such viruses contaminating the vaccine production process.</p>
