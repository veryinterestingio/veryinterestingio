		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The family is called the Sygnathids, which includes seahorses and seadragons and pipefish. If you look up pipefish, you'll see that they look like a stretched-out, less horsey version of a seahorse: similar eyes, jaws, and mouth, but long and slender like, well, a pipe. Seadragons are shaped like a cross between the two, with a more seahorse-shaped body but without the seahorse's characteristic upright body position while swimming. All the Sygnathids do the thing where the male incubates the eggs, either in a pouch or attached to his tail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The earliest known seahorse fossils are of two pipefish-like species, H. sarmaticus and H. slovenicus, from the coprolitic horizon of Tunjice Hills, a middle Miocene lagerst√§tte in Slovenia dating back about 13 million years. Molecular dating finds that pipefish and seahorses diverged during the Late Oligocene.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><strong>It looks like nature hit the random button during critter creation</strong> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, that is what evolution does, random mutation compared with natural selection.</p>
<p>In this case, the natural selection was about being able to swim upright, because this allowed you to blend in with the seagrass.</p>
