		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m a designer for the plasma-facing armor system in the upcoming SPARC tokamak. This is actually one of the most common questions I get from people when I tell them what I work on. </p>
<p>The key to containing such hot plasma is taking advantage of the fact plasma is composed of charged particles, so it can be shaped by a series of extremely powerful magnets to prevent it from contacting the inner walls of the machine. Needless to say, some plasma will still touch the walls, so an array of carefully engineered tiles made of special materials (typically tungsten alloys or certain composites) that can survive very short exposures to high heat fluxes are used to protect the other parts of the machine. </p>
<p>One of the most interesting parts of the armor design is a region called the ‘divertor,’ which essentially acts as an exhaust system for the plasma. In this region we intentionally smash the plasma into the armor. As you can imagine, this presents another layer of complexity to design and engineering. Check out one of the papers my colleagues published on our divertor system if you’re curious about the more technical aspects. (There are also 6 other free to read papers that we’ve published if you’re interested in the rest of a tokamak’s inner workings.)</p>

<p>Edit: for physics accuracy</p>
<p>Edit 2: thanks for all the awards, everyone! It's been fun chatting. I'm going to hop off now. If you're interested in more info about fusion, there's tons of great info on the internet and cool videos on YouTube.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The 100M degree plasma is levitated and doesnt touch the sides and suspended in a vacuum so the only way heat can transfer is through EM radiation. The sides are then heavily shielded to reflect some em radiation back at the plasma and then there is a substantial amount of cooling, so the container is nowhere near 100M degrees even though the plasma inside is.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget that while it's an extremely high temperature, it's an exceedingly small amount of material that actually gets to that temperature (compared to the total mass of the system), so the total heat energy contained in the high temperature material is relatively small. Even if the heat spreads out into the surrounding equipment, the equipment has so much more mass than the high temperature material that the equilibrium temperature once the heat dissipates is low enough for the equipment to withstand.</p>
<p>Think of it like putting a drop of boiling water into a glass of water. Yeah, that boiling water was hot, but it's not going to do much to raise the temperature of the glass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is also important to note that magnetic confinement fusion plasmas are very thin. So even ITER, a future fusion reactor which will be much bigger than KSTAR, contains less than 1 g of plasma (please don't quote that number I just got up and did the math quickly).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
