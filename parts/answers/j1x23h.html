I.e. most of your work seems focused on preventing or slowing the spread of misinformation (which is obviously super important!), but do you have suggestions for how to deal with folks who've bought massive quantities of misinformation?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Personally, I always saw misinformation on social media as an echo-chamber phenomena. Many people seem to follow the news/feeds/informations/ideologies that suit their initial affirmation and reject the ones that oppose those. In this sense, I got a couple of questions: </p>
<ol>
<li>Doesn’t your task lead to more distrust and division?</li>
<li>Wouldn’t it be more beneficial to society as a whole to encourage critical thinking and exposure to a variety of different informations rather than having authorities decide which informations the population is exposed to?</li>
<li>What is your thought on complete censorship of misinformation?</li>
<li>How can we ensure that it doesn’t become a slippery slope resulting in censorship of all kinds of socially unacceptable and politically incorrect ideas?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the beginning of this pandemic, we were told masks weren't effective and not to buy them. Then we went to mandating masks. As understanding of the virus changes over time, we adapt our strategies. How do you keep the public informed without putting  seemingly contradictory information out?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
