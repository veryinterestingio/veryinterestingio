		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes it comes from rain, and seasonally from melting snow. You have to keep in mind that large rivers are draining rainwater from areas tends of thousands of square miles in area. Most of the continental U.S.drains into the Mississippi, for example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a closed loop. Water evaporates from the oceans, falls as rain and snow, and then makes its way right back to the oceans.</p>
<p>For perspective: Suppose you live on a one-acre lot. If it rains one inch, you've received 27,152 gallons of water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From rain and snow, yeah. Another factor is that a lot of rain soaks into the ground, rather than running right off. The ground acts like a sponge, and leaks water into the rivers at a moderate rate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It comes from a combination of rain and snow.  When dealing with mountainous areas, it's often the case that rivers swell in the spring when warmer weather causes snow on the mountains to start melting.  But rivers are fed from water over <em>all</em> the land, and not just mountains.</p>
<p>The general concept here is what's known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage_basin" target="_blank">drainage basin</a>, which is the total area of land that &quot;feeds&quot; into a river.  And for large rivers, the drainage basin can be <em>huge</em>.  For instance, the water in the Mississippi River comes from rain and snowfall over a total of 1.2 <strong>million</strong> square miles of land.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
