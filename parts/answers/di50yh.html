		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No - the equator of Earth is different from the plane of the solar system, which is different from the plane of the galaxy. Galaxies are in amorphous groups or spherical clusters rather than planes. These groups and clusters are in a &quot;cosmic web&quot; filamentary pattern.</p>
<p>We do use latitude/longitude style coordinates for plotting things on the sky, but this isn't a universal system. We either use the Earth's equator as the &quot;plane&quot; for the system (the &quot;celestial&quot; system of &quot;right-ascension&quot; and declination), which is useful for observations from Earth, or we use a galactic system of &quot;galactic latitude&quot; and &quot;galactic longitude&quot;, where we define 0° latitude &amp; longitude as the centre of the galaxy, as seen from Earth. So, not only do we use multiple different systems, these systems also only work if you're at (or near) Earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/attachments/motion-of-earth-and-sun-around-milky-way-eso_-10oct2016-jpg.107278/" target="_blank">Here</a> is a nice diagram that shows all the &quot;Norths&quot; of the  geocentric (Earth), Ecliptic (Solar system/Sun) and galactic (Milky Way) frames. So no, not all equators of objects and star systems / galaxies are in one plane, therefore no &quot;altitude&quot; with respect to one equatorial plane can be defined. Furthermore, altitude is not a concept used in 3D space, usually distance and two angles are used to point at a location in space, relative to a defined reference frame in Cartesian or polar coordinates.</p>

<p>Basically, the orientation in space is whatever you say it is - it's all relative.</p>
<p>There is a plane that can be formed from the Earth's orbit around the Sun - but the rest of the planets in the Solar System only kinda-sorta orbit on similar planes, and one or two of them have very different orbits (probably due to some huge impact in the distant past).</p>
<p>The Solar System's orbit plane itself is mostly due to the rotation of the Sun around its own axis.  </p>
<p>That is mostly independent of the motion of the Solar System around the galactic core.   But that, too, forms a plane.  Which appears to be mostly unrelated to the planes of any of the galaxies nearby.</p>
<p>To use some every day examples:  You asked if everything was on the same plane - that would be like putting all of these objects on a table.</p>
<p>Instead, it's more like they all exist in an aquarium, all rotating and revolving in different planes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but only in a limited part of space. </p>
<p>Altitude from Earth (or another body) is usually still necessary to know when a spacecraft is high enough to be in space but still using that body’s gravity to orbit/slingshot around.</p>
<p>In the rest of space, you stop using altitude and start using measurement systems based on whatever local bodies exist, like the plane of the solar system and distance to planets, or galaxies, or super clusters.</p>
<p>What you use to measure your position depends on your purposes in flying through or looking at space. It’s all relative, man (said in my best Cheech and Chong voice)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You would need a refference point. But if you would put beacons in space you could travel in 3 distinct axis relative to the beacon.</p>
<p>So in other words you could travel &quot;up/down&quot;, &quot;left/right&quot; or &quot;forward/backward&quot; relative to the beacon. Of course there is no &quot;universal&quot; up or down. It all depends on what you choose as your reference point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
