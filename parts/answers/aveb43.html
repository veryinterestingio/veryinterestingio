		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two ways to stop a moving object: you either have something hard and heavy enough to stop it over a short distance, or you have something flexible with high tensile strength that &quot;catches&quot; it and slows it down over a longer distance.</p>
<p>In the case of the hard and heavy, this is what you typically see on vehicles because, well, it's heavy. The thickness of the material is usually porportionate to it's effectiveness. The projectile will impact the side of the armor and shatter/deform because the hardness and mass of the armor is higher than that of the projectile. Obviously there is a sliding scale here, as the heavier a projectile and the faster it moves, the harder it is to slow it. This is why tank rounds are designed the way they are: very high velocity, dense (hence depleted uranium) and a small cross section (discarding sabot). The intent is to overwhelm the armor by concentrating a significant amount of energy in a small area.</p>
<p>Kevlar, on the other hand, takes a different approach. Instead of trying to resist and stop the moving projectile at the surface, Kevlar will &quot;give&quot; and flex under the impact. But because Kevlar has such a high tensile strength, it doesn't break as it gives. It effectively acts as a kind of 'catcher's mitt' to slow the bullet to a stop. This is why even if your armor stops a bullet, it hurts like a fucker because your body is still being hit very hard, it's just dissipating that energy over a larger area.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, however, the threshold for the effectiveness of Kevlar is much lower than that of steel or composite armor, which is why kevlar vests are usually only rated for certain kinds of handgun rounds, and only resist rifle bullet impacts with the addition of ceramic inserts and below a certain caliber/velocity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>One's not better than the other.</p>
<p>There are trade offs for both.</p>
<p>Kevlar is lighter and more flexible than steel or ceramic plates.  The disadvantage is that kevlar will only stop some handgun rounds.</p>
<p>Steel/Ceramic will stop rifle rounds, but it is <em>much</em> heavier.  Typically the plates are carried in a kevlar carrier.</p>
<p>So it's a tradeoff.</p>
<p>Police typically wear kevlar vests because they're more likely to be shot by handguns.</p>
<p>Military wear kevlar vests with ceramic plates because they're more likely to be shot by rifles.</p>
<p>I've also got a plate carrier with steel plates in my patrol car I can put on if needed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not the fall that kills you, it's the landing. When two objects collide, there is an energy exchange that takes place and the more you can slow that down and spread out the force over a larger area, the less damage it will cause. </p>
<p>In the case of a bullet, it's a projectile colliding with a person and imparting it's energy in a very short period of time, to a very small area (the size of the bullet itself). So if you can spread that force out over a larger area, and slow the bullet down, you can prevent it from penetrating and killing a person. </p>
<p>Steel is very strong, but it is rigid and hard. When shot it absorbs the impact at the site of the shot and either shatters if it's hard steel, or deforms if it's ductile. Either way the energy is concentrated at a small point, and the steel gets a hole drilled into it. </p>
<p>Kevlar is not hard, but it has a high tensile strength, which is a measurement of the amount of force it can handle stretching or pulling on it. It doesn't shatter, it bends and stretches. The kevlar fibers are woven in overlapping layers and in different directions so that they reinforce each other and no matter what direction a bullet comes from, it will be stretching as many fibers as possible at impact. </p>
<p>When the bullet hits, the fibers begin to deform and stretch and as they do so, they spread the force of the bullet out over a large area. when you grab a blanket in the center of the bed and lift up, the entire blanket gets pulled inwards, so the force of your lifting, is resisted by, and spread out over the entire bedsheet. A similar thing happens with the kevlar. </p>
<p>What makes a knife more deadly than a punch? They have the exact same amount of force behind them. But the punch is spread out over the size of your hand, and a knife concentrates all of that force into the very tip of the blade. Kevlar vests turn dense, high velocity kinetic energy into diffuse, lower velocity kinetic energy. It turns a knife tip into a fist. The persons body still absorbs the energy, but it absorbs it more like a punch, than a puncture. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Kevlar® is most-generally used in body armour, so it may be assumed that the question is intended to be &quot;Why is Kevlar® preferable to steel as an element of body armour against bullets?&quot;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The answers to that are dependent on many factors.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If the focus is on wearability, including weight and flexibility, then Kevlar® enjoys many advantages.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If the focus is on protection, including strength, density, and mass, then steel enjoys many advantages.</p>
