		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One possible explanation is the stress of exams makes your body go into fight or flight mode where stress hormones such as cortisol diverts glucose (energy) away from the hippocampus and thus decreasing your ability to recall memories. For our ancestors, this gave them the extra punch needed to survive, as it was more likely for their survival to be hinged upon beating the predator threatening them than beating the test curve. Sadly, this means when you're stressed it'd be harder to recall specific memories.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reading a book on resilience: cortisol (stresshormon) makes connections between neurons weak. You have to respect your palliatif pallet: relax your brain. Lower the amoynt of cortisol in your body.
Best way is to lift weight: this injures your muscles which makes your body release a hormone to fix the muscles. This hormone also repairs the connections between your neurons.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If your mind does freeze during an exam the best thing you can do is daydream. I’m serious. </p>
<p>As other commenters notes, your brain goes blank due to the stress-triggered flight or fight response. </p>
<p>The simplest way to break out of this during an exam setting is to daydream. Give yourself permission to imagine winning the lottery for 3 minutes. Your brain reasons that if you’re able to sit and plan what you’d do with your millions, then you can’t actually be in that much danger and reduces the response. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You never really knew the information going into the test.  You crammed just enough to remember some key terms, but you didn't know how they truly relate to anything.  So when the test asked you to use the knowledge you were supposed to have, you couldn't do it.  Then you assume your mind &quot;went blank&quot; to compensate for the truth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
