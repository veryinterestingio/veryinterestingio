		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, for one, polymers degrade when melted, so you can't just turn a PET water bottle into a new PET water bottle. It won't have the same properties anymore. You can use post-consumer recycled PET in something <em>else</em>, like a CPET microwave dinner tray, but even then you can't just use all of it, you can only use a small percentage of it. EDIT: That &quot;something else&quot; can, in fact, be a new bottle, but it will almost certainly be mixed with virgin material and won't be 100% recycled.</p>
<p>For two, you can't mix types of plastics, which means that either consumers have to be exceptional at separating their types of plastic (by which I mean the cap <em>and</em> ring on your water bottle has to be separated since they're probably PP while the bottle itself is PET) or we have to have people sort through garbage bags full of recycling to separate it, which adds a hell of a lot to the cost. There's also the fact that most plastics have some additives in them, for one reason or another, and plastics with certain additives can't be mixed with others.</p>
<p>For three, any contaminants (adhesives from stickers, residue from food or drink, etc) have to be washed off to the point where they're as close to completely gone as possible, which is basically impossible and also adds a ton of labor, again increasing the cost dramatically. (This is also true for paper/cardboard - STOP RECYCLING YOUR GREASY PIZZA BOXES, THEY CAN'T BE RECYCLED IF THERE'S FOOD OR GREASE STUCK TO THEM. <em>Edit: This may not be true, I'm not sure - my city explicitly says not to recycle pizza boxes with grease on them, but YMMV. Maybe someone with more experience in recycling, or paper/cardboard, can chime in on this one.</em>)</p>
<p>For four, not all plastics are thermoplastics - thermosetting polymers cannot be melted down, they'll just burn up and release a ton of pollutants into the air. And obviously you can't mix thermoplastic polymers and thermosetting polymers.</p>
<p>And for five, it's largely just not feasible to <em>use</em> post-consumer recycled plastics because it's 1) extremely expensive to buy and 2) can be extremely difficult to work into your existing process while maintaining quality and matching the needed performance without using so little that it's basically irrelevant. You're paying through the nose to use a tiny amount of the stuff you bought, just to be able to put a label on your product that says &quot;Contains post-consumer recycled material!&quot;</p>
<p>Basically, plastic recycling - while it <em>is</em> done to some extent - is <strong><em>much</em></strong> more limited than the public has been led to believe, and in an amount of cases that would shock the average person, is outright impossible. I guarantee that 80-90% of the plastic items people put in their recycling bin actually end up in a landfill or incinerated because they can't actually be recycled for a myriad of reasons.</p>

<p>LAST EDIT: Okay, this comment alone now makes up more than 90% of my total karma and comments just keep rolling in, so I'm gonna go ahead and disable notifications. Sorry for not responding to all of you, there's just <em>too many!</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plastic processing engineer here.</p>
<p>Plastic parts can be ground and reused (regrind) but options for doing so are limited.  Plastic has a heat history, the more you melt and reheat plastic, the more it degrades.  As the plastic degrades you lose its physical properties.  This means you have to use virgin material (no regrind) for many applications, such as automotove or medical parts.</p>
<p>Regrind also can be more difficult to process, as it is more prone to part defects.  Visible burns in the final product or brittleness would be a few examples.  Regrind typically needs to be mixed with virgin material during processing to avoid these defects.  </p>
<p>The size of the regrind also matters.  With virgin material the plastic comes in little plastic pellets, all the same size.  When these are melted down they all melt at relatively the same time.  With regrind you get bigger chunks and dust.  The dust tends to burn while the bigger chunks may not melt evenly.  There is equipment to remove dust and more evenly chop parts, but then there is now additional cost to reusing materials.</p>
<p>Then you get into contamination issues.  Typically when doing regrind you don't reuse consumer products, instead you are taking the scrap at the plant and regrinding it there.  Even keeping it at the plant level, the chances for contamination is high.  If a part is dropped on the floor and picks up dirt, now its in your regrind.</p>
<p>There are many different types of plastic and each may require different processing temperatures.  In many cases you cannot even mix different grades of the same material.  I may have 5 different types of polypropylene at the plant. each with different fillers or additives that should not be mixed.  This creates a logistical problem at the plant, because now you need 5 different grinders and 5 different storage containers for you materials.  All it takes is one person putting the wrong part in the wrong bin or grinder and now you have a lot of scrap.  </p>
<p>Taking this a step further, this contamination could create machine damage in some cases.  Incompatibile materials such as polycarbonate (melts at round 400F) and polypropylene (melts around 300F) mixed together could chew up your machines by running unmelted material through.  Mixing materials such as PVC and Acetal can create explosive chemical reactions.</p>
<p>Many common plastics are thermoplastics and can be remelted.  There is another group of materials called thermoset.  These materials undergo a chemical reaction to harden them. (example epoxy) These materials cannot be reverted back to their original form and recycled.</p>
<p>TLDR:  Some plastics can be reused, but process problems and costs make reusing plastics infeasible in many cases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Like metal, you can melt ice and freeze it in a different shape. Like plastic, you can't un-fry and re-fry an egg. It's also difficult to separate the quail egg from the Duck egg after stir-frying them together.</p>
<p>This is not an exact comparison, but I guess it will do for a 5 year old. Plastic is really quite complex on a molecular level. Metals are simple.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
