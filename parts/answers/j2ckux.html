		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I donâ€™t know that I understand it well enough to ELI5, but the brain filters cerebrospinal fluid CSF during sleep and it drains out of the ventricles of the brain. Less sleep = less time for drainage = a buildup of pressure and inflammation.</p>
<p>I got these migraines daily since I never got enough sleep. A lot was related to a vitamin B2 deficiency. Vitamin B2 helps mitigate inflammation in the brain. Try taking a daily vitamin B complex supplement and see if that reduces the occurrences of the migraines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 3 cycles/stages of sleep in humans. 1st cycle is just a normal phase where your body movements like breathing rate, heartbeat etcetera slows down to save energy for the next cycle cycle. In 2nd cycle lot of energy is consumed since crucial process like digestion, storing memory on brain etcetera take place. In the 3rd cycle aka Rem phase rapid eye movements takes place so that we can dream. If you wake in middle of any cycle then it will lead to headache. It doesn't matter if you sleep less but at least one cycle must be completed. </p>
<p>In short if you woke in middle of any cycle then you will get headache and sleeping less is not the reason for your headache</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
