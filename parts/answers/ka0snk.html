<p>So the fluid that’s released during squirting is essentially watered-down urine, sometimes with a bit of ejaculate in it. It comes from the bladder and exits via the urethra, the same as when you pee.</p>
<p>In very rare cases some biological females are capable of producing a large quantity of ejaculate but this usually traces back to abnormal testosterone or hormone levels. </p>
<p>Many people will firmly believe and swear it's absolutely not the same as urine... They're wrong. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: the fluid contains pee and comes from the same hole, but is not just pee. In porn, I assume they just pump water into the woman and have her squeeze it out, there is no secret organ that makes that much liquid.</p>
<p>I am a woman who has squirted a few times unintentionally during sex and who has also reviewed the scientific literature on the subject. I can tell you with 100% certainty that while the fluid contains some urine, it is not urine.</p>
<p>The fluid is ejected from the urethra, which is where pee comes from. In my and my sexual partners’ experience it is an extremely dilute, clear fluid that has very little smell or taste to it besides saltiness. The handful of times that I have done it, (1) it was never on purpose, (2) it was always because I had a powerful orgasm, (3) the amount of fluid is very small, and (4) I did not have to pee before, during, or after the sex, so it was not just me being magically incontinent.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how exactly it gets there, but if you do some reading about how urine is made you will find that there are various selectively permeable membranes and chemical gradients that control the flow of water and waste (components of urine) into the bladder and ultimately out of your body. I would not find it hard to believe that somehow during sex, due to the mechanical force/pressure applied during penetration, a surplus of saline builds up in tissues/within the bladder (a place where water normally goes anyway). I feel like that is ultimately what science will find about this, but we’ll see!</p>
<p>Edit: ITT are many kids with no exposure to sex besides porn. Real sex involves getting comfortable with your body and your partner’s body — really comfortable. A trace amount of urine is nothing. Guys use the same tube to ejaculate AND pee, so y’all already have this issue even if you don’t like to acknowledge it ;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
