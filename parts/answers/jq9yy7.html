It really isn't that different from viral vaccination, you stimulate an immune response with the goal of long term antibody (IgG) production.  Here's a quick list of some of the bacterial vaccines we use routinely:  <a href="https://www.drugs.com/drug-class/bacterial-vaccines.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.drugs.com/drug-class/bacterial-vaccines.html" target="_blank">https://www.drugs.com/drug-class/bacterial-vaccines.html</a></a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vaccines have been used against almost every type of microbe. Malaria is a parasitical infection yet there are multiple trials to develop a vaccine for it with low to moderate success according to clinical trials last time I checked. As long as a microbe is big enough so that we can analyze and replicate its antigenic epitopes  then we produce any vaccine against it!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! Vaccines can be used against both bacteria and viruses. The basic principle behind a vaccine is that it is either a live attenuated form of the pathogen or an inactivated form. The inactivated form can either be a whole cell or fractionated (protein based or polysaccharide based). Basically, the inactivated form just takes a “portion” of the pathogen. Both vaccines induce an antibody response in the human body. </p>
<p>There are two typhoid vaccines in the US: the oral live, attenuated vaccine (Ty21a) and a parenteral Vi capsular polysaccharide vaccine (Vi CPS). One of Salmonella’s virulence factor (what makes it highly infectious) is the “Vi” Ag capsule. So we can vaccinate against Salmonella either by taking a live virus and weakening it (hence live attenuated vaccine) or taking an antigenic structure (which is the Vi capsule) and heat it or add formalin to it (inactivated vaccine). </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Poultry veterinarian here. I work with Salmonella vaccines on a daily basis. I've seen some good replies but not a complete full answer yet. For a nice scientific review on Salmonella vaccines used in poultry including a bit on how they work check out: <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1586/erv.12.138" target="_blank">Desin et al. 2013</a> </p>
<p>We can vaccinate chicken against Salmonella with live vaccines (&quot;live-attenuated vaccines&quot;) or killed vaccines (&quot;inactivated (subunit) vaccines&quot;). There are some Salmonella serovars that can cause disease in poultry, but the ones we usually are vaccinating against don't. They are happy to live in a chickens gut, but they are vaccinated against just for food safety reasons. They are what is called a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/onehealth/basics/zoonotic-diseases.html" target="_blank">zoonotic disease</a>. We vaccinate mainly against two serovars (note: not species) of <em>Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica</em>: Enteritidis and Typhimurium.
While there are estimated to be hundred or so of Salmonella serovars that can potentially cause a food poisoning in humans, these two serovars are by far the most common culprits. Obviously, you get sick from Salmonella serovars by consuming undercooked chicken meat or eggs - or through poor kitchen hygiene. </p>
<p>So as to your question: how do they work.
The live attenuated vaccines are Salmonella Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis strains that have been weakened so they are not able to cause food poisoning in humans anymore. The strains are weakened, but alive enough to colonize the gut microbiome for a short while and trigger the birds immune system: both antibody and cell-mediated responses. We use live vaccines because mass application through spray or drinking water is an easy and effective way to administer a vaccine in a flock of poultry. </p>
<p>Inactivated vaccines are also referred to as killed vaccines. These vaccines are not alive (duh) and they consist of the beforementioned Salmonella serovars, but they are inactivated (you could say: destroyed) and an adjuvans is added (google adjuvans if you don't know what that is). The resulting mixture consists of fragments of the Salmonella serovars. Because these vaccines are not alive you always have to inject them in the breast muscle (pectoral muscle), otherwise they don't work. Also, we typically have to use a booster vaccination (a.k.a. vaccinate another time with the same vaccine) a week or 4 after the initial vaccination. But once injected and boostered they trigger a strong antibody response. As you can imagine, the inactivated bacterial vaccines are typically used for poultry that lives longer than your typical broiler: broiler breeders, layers and layer parents.  </p>
<p>Once vaccinated, a field strain Salmonella Enteritidis or Typhimurium, coming from (for example) the feed or that might be carried by rodents, will have hard time colonizing the chicken gut. This is because the immune system (in the gut) already recognizes Salmonella and keeps it from reproducing/shedding. So this is why Salmonella vaccines work. </p>
<p>Some companies are now introducing or working on Salmonella vaccines with newer techniques and also with other serovars like S. Infantis. </p>
<p>Also, the EU has an extremely strict and thorough system for Salmonella monitoring and management in the poultry production chain. They use a list of 'the big five' Salmonella serovars they consider to be of the highest risk and it is generally working extremely well. With these good monitoring systems in place most EU countries don't need to vaccinate their broiler chickens against Salmonella Enteritidis and Typhimurium, but we do see some prevalence with other serovars. Layer chickens, however, are often vaccinated because they live longer and (hopefully) get to go outside in their lives a lot - increasing the risk of Salmonella infections. </p>
<p>Something not clear, or additional questions on this: let me know!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The antibody needs some sort of molecular hook to hold on to. It grabs this hook and lingers on it, inactivating some of the targets properties.
