		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Antibiotics treat an infection. When you start feeling better, you know they're working but likely not all the germs have been killed yet. If you stop before the end of the course, you leave a few alive, which your body can probably/usually fight off okay. Those few bugs left behind were the ones most resistant to the antibiotics and they're the ones that will multiply. Sometimes people get a second infection because of this, or they pass it to someone else. Every time this happens, the drugs have less of an effect because the infection was built off the strongest bodies of the last infection. </p>
<p>Eventually, this leads to the &quot;superbug&quot; problem where no antibiotics will treat a particular strain of infection effectively anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Antibiotics kill germs.</p>
<p>When you get sick, some of the germs making you sick might be lucky.  In the sense that the lucky germs have genetics that make them able to somewhat resist antibiotics.</p>
<p>When you feel better, 90% of the germs are dead and 10% survive.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep taking the antibiotics:  Eventually 100% of the germs will be dead and you will be cured.</li>
<li>Stop taking the antibiotics:  The 10% survivor germs breed back up to 100% numbers and make you sick again.  Since the lucky germs are more likely to be in the survivor group, they pass on their lucky genes to large numbers of children / grandchildren / great-grandchildren germs.  And some of those descendants might have even luckier genetics, and antibiotics might not work on them at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking all your antibiotics makes you better.</p>
<p>Stopping early risks you getting sick again from the survivor germs.  And it also risks you breeding resistant germs that antibiotics can't fight.  That's a serious problem, both for you and for anyone you pass your germs on to.</p>
<p>You should always take the full course of any antibiotic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine your house is on fire, then the firefighters come and do their best to put it out, but they only put out about 95% of it. They say &quot;good enough&quot; and leave, meanwhile the fire that's left grows again, but the house is soaking wet from their attempts so it can't grow too much, just does does some extra damage, but it gets just big enough that it spreads to something in the yard and then to your neighbor. This repeats until the entire neighborhood has caught fire and had to deal with the damage, with a few houses being unable to be saved. If only the firefighters had done a complete job instead of just leaving when it looked mostly done.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A year or 2 ago I read of some researchers in the UK saying some surpring, but logical things about antibiotics. If I find the article I would uodate the comment with the link.</p>
<p>Essentially bacteria become resistant to antibiotics ONLY in the presence of antibiotics. If you are not taking antibiotics they can not become resistant. Therefore if you are feeling better before having consumed the full course of antibiotics, it is better to stop taking the antibiotics, monitor how you feel and if you feel fine from that point on, you do not need anymore antibiotics. If however you begin to feel sick again you resume taking the antibiotics. Though in a majority of cases once you're feeling significantly better, it's because you are cured.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because there's a chance that not 100% of the bacteria has been wiped out by the antibiotics even though you no longer feel sick.  There's a chance that that remaining bacteria can become resistant to the antibiotics and there's a chance that you can still infect others with that potentially resistant bacteria.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
