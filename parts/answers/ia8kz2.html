		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The capsaicin is all in the seeds and the veins surrounding the seeds. The flesh isn't really spicy.  Peppers that are bred for spicyness will tend to have a lot of seeds and veins and little flesh, which contributes to the crinkled up shape because the flesh is what covers the outside to make it nice and smooth. If you look at a picture of a cut open reaper or scorpion it's like 95% white (the veins) with a thin veneer of flesh on top.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The hottest peppers have been selectively bred for their heat.</p>
<p>The heat is not in the flesh, it’s primarily in the seed bed.</p>
<p>So the hottest peppers are those that have, for whatever reason, put more of their energy into forming a super hot seed bed and generating extra capsaicin. Now, because they put more work into that, they had to put less work into something else - so, they’re smaller. The ones that put all their effort into being nice and big and fleshy, put less effort into being hot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
