		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a phenomenon known as 'presque vu', derived from the French phrase meaning 'almost seen'.</p>
<p>The strange thing is that even though almost everyone you'll ever meet has experienced this, we aren't actually sure why this happens or what causes it.</p>
<p>The biggest theory out there is the Blocking Hypothesis. The theory goes that when we attempt to actively remember something (lets say actor's name) your brain blocks off other similar/ related words to make it easier. So if you want to remember that it's Tom Hanks who played Forrest Gump, your brain might block Tom Cruise and Tom Davies so that there are less names to pick from, and therefore find your correct name faster. This theory suggests that when blocking out the similar, but incorrect information, your brain accidentally blocks the thing you actually want to remember by mistake.</p>
<p>This makes lots of sense because if we start talking about something else later on, we may suddenly remember it was Tom Hanks, as the block is lifted once we no longer need the information, or start blocking something else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tip_of_the_tongue" target="_blank">tip-of-the-tongue effect</a>, and what's fascinating about it is the inherent inability to be explained.</p>
<p>Shapes in the mind correspond to shapes on the tongue: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clanging" target="_blank">schizophrenic patients respond particularly strongly to this.</a> Yet the shapes in the mind can never be adequately, or at least non-tediously, put to words.</p>
<p>The most intriguing part of the tip-of-the-tongue, to me, is that it <em>recedes</em> in a second. It does not persistently accumulate: that you thought yourself 95% close the one moment does not preclude you from being <em>completely</em> lost the next. How? Why? These are geometries of the man's brain, and he can never adequately put them to words.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The mind is a web of connected ideas. As a complex web of connections, you can stumble upon a given thought just as easily as you can touch each edge around it, without making contact. It's not a linear list of files that can be read sequentially. </p>
<p>To apply these ideas to the question, perhaps a feeling or a letter is strongly connected to the word we're looking for, but that doesn't mean we've found it yet. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
