		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called the Helmholtz Resonance. It's pretty cool essentially the air outside gets forced into the car BUT there's already air in the car so it creates a vortex (the air spins around) as the two air pressures compete. Since more air is getting forced in to the car throughout this, the old air that got &quot;pooled&quot; over by the window gets forced out again causing a moment where no air is coming <em>in</em> the window, it's only going out.then air rushes back in. That keeps repeating resulting in a sort of &quot;throbbing&quot; or &quot;thumping&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how you can blow over the top of a soda bottle and make a whistle sound?  You know how doing it with a bigger bottle makes a lower sound? Ok, so imagine that as far as the air around the car going down the freeway is concerned, the car is just a big bottle and the open window is the hole at the top of the bottle. </p>
<p>All sound is just vibrations of the medium you're in, so in most cases for us humans who need to breathe air pretty constantly, we're going to be most familiar with the air transmitting these vibrations. The measurement of these vibrations is done in frequency for pitch and in a pretty wide assortment of pressure units for intensity, but the one you're likely most familiar with is the decibel (which leads to a whole other discussion that's beyond the scope of this question). Frequency is measured in cycles per second, called Hertz. The higher the frequency of the sound, the bigger the number. Make that frequency low enough and you can actually start hearing the space between those cycles. A good example of this would be an engine running. At a high rpm, an engine sound like it's whining or buzzing, but slow it down and it sounds more like a rumble. Slow it down enough and it sounds like a series of pops as the fuel and air mixture lights off each cycle making a small explosion. </p>
<p>The technical term for that soda bottle effect is Helmholtz cavitation, but you can think of it as just a harmonic resonance</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The interior of the car forms an acoustic resonance chamber, and the air coming in through the windows creates a bass sound that gets amplified to very loud levels.  The car basically becomes a very loud whistle, except with bass sounds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s the change in air pressure, there is a tiny bit of air inside your head/behind your ear drums. Low external air pressure causes your drums to slightly bulge, high external air pressure causes your ear drums to concave. Going back and forth between convex and concave can be painful for your eardrums. The change in air pressure if caused when air gets forced into your vehicle, causing a air pressure greater than the air pressure outside, which inturn causes air to get forced back out of your vehicle. Because the wind outside of the vehicle isn’t steady and changes sometimes rapidly, the air pressure in ur car follows</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
