		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Axial wind turbines are significantly more efficient. That means for the same size of tower and same weight of turbine you'll get more output while producing less drag force on the tower.</p>
<p>For axial turbines the efficiency is around 35-45% while for vertical wind turbines the overall efficiency is 15-20% at best. I'll explain more about this in a bit.</p>
<p>Moreover, for very large turbines, the axial design requires fewer large-size structural parts.</p>
<p>Lastly, axial turbines are tolerant of a wide range of wind speeds, whereas peak efficiency for vertical turbines occurs at a narrow range of speeds. Vertical turbines are subject to aerodynamic problems outside of that range, which robs them of efficiency.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let my also clarify a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Horizontal axis turbines change direction and always align with the direction of the wind.</li>
<li>While the blades rotate they manage to &quot;absorb&quot; energy from all the volume of the wind that passes through the disk of the rotor.</li>
<li>There is a key difference that you have to take into acount when you design an optimum steam or gas turbine or diesel engline vs. when you design a wind turbine: The wind is for free. Energy efficiency  in wind turbines is important but not us much as in the other energy coversion machines that you pay for the input energy.  In wind turbines you have always the option to increase the size and gain more energy (wind, the input energy, is free).</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with the length of the rotating shaft. The longer it is the more difficulty it is to support. </p>
<p>Also wind speed decreases as you get closer to the ground. So there is no advantage of having a turbine close to ground.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simply due to the smaller footprint and lower operating speed of feasible vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs), they may be the better option in urban areas or areas with sensitive wildlife (large HAWTs can cause bird/bat deaths <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982208007513" target="_blank">citation</a>).</p>
<p>Typically, HAWTs are more efficient than VAWTs in isolated configurations. But, in reality, the wakes of nearby HAWTs can cause the efficiency of the next wind turbine to drop by 40% or so. </p>
<p>A better metric might then be what is the maximum power density ( W/m^2 ) a design can achieve? So, given an area of land, how much energy can we extract? There is evidence that VAWTs can achieve higher power densities due to less destructive interference when placed in counter-rotating configurations (<a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.3608170?class=pdf" target="_blank">citation</a>), similar to a mechanism schools of fish use in order to maximize efficiency. This is a promising direction, and we may see a shift toward the VAWT technology in the future (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032113000312" target="_blank">citation</a>). There are institutional and practical obstacles to still hammer out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The vertical axis wind turbines only allow so much air through them, most of the air passes around them. Someone should use those &quot;lines of smoke&quot; ftom wind tunnels to visualize this.</p>
<p>Plus, due to laminar flow (air right next to something flows slower than air a short distance away due to friction) the air above 70-feet is flowing faster than the air near the ground. That means trees and houses slow down the only breeze close enough to the ground to create work ftom a VAWT.</p>
<p>The giant 3-bladed turbines up high in the air can turn to face the wind. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
