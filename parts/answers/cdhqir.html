		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Headaches are caused by vasodilation (swelling) of blood vessels in your head. This can happen for a bunch of different reasons, like dehydration, stress, lack of sleep, nutrient imbalances, medication overuse, and much more. One of the most effective ways to manage a headache is the same way we treat any other kind of swelling... with ice. You should always try to ice your head before you try other things because even taking too much ibuprofen can lead to more headaches called medication overuse headaches. Some headaches, like migraines, are more intense and require heavier meds, but for everyday run of the mill headaches, try ice!

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, there are tons of things that can cause a headache. Hunger, thirst, sleep deprivation, etc. It is really a way of your body communicating to you that something isn’t quite right. For example, with thirst you get a headache because your body is trying to tell you <em>before</em> you get severely dehydrated. </p>
<p>These aren’t the only things that can cause headaches, but they are the cause most of the time.</p>
<p>The brain itself doesn’t have nerve endings, so it can’t feel pain itself. What is actually happening is expansion or swelling of surrounding muscles and blood vessels. This causes pressure on your nerve endings, which send a “pain signal” to your brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine that your brain is like a big garden and you have invented this really fancy new hose system to water it. This hose system is your veins. This fancy hose system is always moving water along from your water source, distributing it to the plants, and then your hose system is so fancy it even pulls the water back out of the soil and sends it back to your water source for cleaning. </p>
<p>You know how when you stand on a hose, less water comes out the end? Your fancy hose system can change in size on its own so that it delivers more or less water depending on how wide the hose is.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, your fancy hose system isn’t perfect. Sometimes it gets too big or too small on its own for the wrong reasons. (You’re still working out the kinks with your design.) Certain things, like stress, seem to make the hose get bigger and deliver more water to the plants because the hose thinks those plants are in need. But the plants are like, “whoa, what’s with all the extra water?! This is too much water for a plant and it kinda hurts my plant feelings!”</p>
<p>You’ve also noticed a really serious version of this problem called migraines. In this case, the hose gets very small on its own. It stays like that for a little bit, then realizes it’s mistake and notices the plants aren’t getting enough water, so then it wildly expands and sends way way too much water to the plants all of a sudden and it keeps pumping too much water for several hours.</p>
<p>Long story short, plants don’t like too much water and your brain doesn’t like too much blood. It also doesn’t like too little. Headaches happen because one or the other is happening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
