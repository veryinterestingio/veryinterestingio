		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s incredibly time and resource intensive as well.  Wagyu beef costs so much more to produce than “regular” beef.  Beyond that, there simply isn’t a benefit to it for many uses of beef, like ground beef.  All that marbling is wasted.  Think of it like high end sports car.  It’s by far a nicer automobile than, say, a Camry, but the Camry is way more economical and practical most of the time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its expensive. The reason Wagyu is marbled aka fattier is its <em>lazy</em>. The cows stand around and are fed constantly. Cows eat <em>A LOT</em>... and its high quality feed too. == $$. Meanwhile, your average beef cow is kept out on the grasslands. Grass = cheap.</p>
<p>In Japan, Wagyu might be the way to go because of scarcity of pasture/grassland vs. land costs, but everywhere else its much more cost effective to let cattle graze. Wagyu cows are also allowed to get older and fatter - ~3 yrs as opposed to a year and  a half before slaughter for a regular beef cow. So your Wagyu crop basically takes twice as long to mature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are incredibly expensive to raise, and thus the cost of the meat is prohibitive for most people for everyday eating. The high fat content is probably also a lot less healthy. But mostly its that a $100 steak is a rare splurge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well issue 1 is that saying Wagyu is the best beef is like saying a Ferrari is the best car.  A Ferrari might be a great car if I'm out on a summer night looking to cruise through the suburbs but it might be the worst possible car if I'm driving to visit my relatives in winter when it's snowing.  </p>
<p>Wagyu is very very very fatty.  Too fatty for making a stew, or having it as a big steak.  It's amazing for small slices and the like but if you want a big steak dinner it's the wrong choice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
