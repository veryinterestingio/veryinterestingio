		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are right to think that the spacecraft would be dramatically affected by all the thrust from the shaped charge shooting the 2 kg copper projectile at the surface of the asteroid at 2 km/sec velocity.</p>
<p>However, the clever engineers solved that by making the explosive device/cannon detachable from the main spacecraft.  So it detached the cannon, and then put a camera in a position to record the violent experiment, and then parked itself on the other side of the asteroid to avoid any debris from the explosion causing damage.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Im a PhD student studying spacecraft optical navigation whose currently doing some work at NASA Goddard for the OSIRIS-REx mission (the ongoing NASA asteroid sample return mission).</p>
<p>To give you a sense of how challenging small body missions are (that is, missions that go to asteroids and comets) virtually every force is non-negligible.</p>
<p>In the case of OSIRIS-REx, the dominant force is solar radiation pressure.  For our orbit determination we consider gravitational effects of all planets and major moons.  We model solar radiation pressure using a shape model of the spacecraft.  We model the Yarkovsky effect (that is, anisotropic thermal radiation emission which acts as a &quot;thrust&quot; generated by a temperature gradient on the spacecraft/asteroid).  Even turning on the antenna to transmit back to earth causes a measurable perturbation to the trajectory!  I mean, the orbital velocities around these objects is in the cm/s range.  With the surface gravitational acceleration on Bennu being a million times weaker than Earth's surface gravity!</p>
<p>So yes.  Firing something like this would have a tremendous effect on the spacecraft trajectory.  That being said, they detached the firing mechanism and &quot;hid&quot; on the far side of the asteroid, so it wasn't an issue.</p>
<p>These kinds of small body missions are absolutely ridiculous from a navigation perspective!  The amount of things to consider is truly unbelievable when you're operating so precisely around something so small.  I can't directly speak for Hayabusa because I've never worked on it, but just from my work on OSIRIS-REx I can tell you these missions are truly insane </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Just read up on it. The method used was pretty interesting. It was a low velocity release but charges were used to explode/propel the impactor once the probe was at a safe distance</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The shape charge the spacecraft carries was separated, left to fall onto the asteroid, and then detonated. It was not still attached to the spacecraft when it fired.</p>
<p>Now you are right that Newton's third would kick in and the spacecraft would recoil, but the spacecraft weighs 600kg. The acceleration imparted would be less than 7 m/s which is correctable by the spacecraft (albeit undesirable).</p>
<p>A large risk would be debris from the crater formation and back blast from the explosive charge. While the explosively formed penetrator is directional, the detonation that forms it is far less discriminatory. The spacecraft deployed a remote camera and then took cover behind the asteroid while the charge was drifting down towards the surface.</p>
<p><a href="https://spaceflightnow.com/2019/04/05/hayabusa-2-sci-operation/" target="_blank">This news article</a> covers it in a bit more accuracy than a lot of not-spaceflight-specific news outlets. The Hayabusa2 spacecraft is a bit of a clown car with all its gadgetry and deployables.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If it were fired directly from the spacecraft, yes it would. conservation of momentum would be observed, and the spacecraft would begin moving in the opposite direction. However the spacecraft is planning on being on the other side of the asteroid to avoid contacting any debris created by the impact. Iâ€™m assuming there is a smaller probe that will launch the shape charge, and this will receive the force in the opposite direction. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
