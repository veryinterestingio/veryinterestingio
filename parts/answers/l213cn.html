		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your blood is constantly flowing through your entire body so that the temperature is pretty much the same in all limbs. So if you lose a lot of heat through your legs you can still heat them up by making sure your upper body is well insulated from the cold. A very common strategy is to have enough layers on your legs to be comfortable in a shirt indoor and then enough layers on your upper body that you will be comfortable outdoors. This way you do not have to remove your pants every time you enter or exit a building but can regulate the heat through jackets alone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another piece of information:</p>
<p>Making you feel &quot;comfortable&quot; and actually keeping you warm are two different things.</p>
<p>Responsible for the feeling of heat and cold are certain nerves that are distributed all over your body in your skin. Different parts of your body have a different density of heat and/or cold sensors.</p>
<p>Your hands have a lot but actually the highest density of sensors you have on your lips!</p>
<p>You can test this easily on yourself: Take an ice cube and touch your calve with it. Try to remember <em>how</em> cold this feels, keep it there for something like ten seconds... compare it to touching your lips with that same ice cube, for the same amount of time ... it should (your results might vary) feel colder.</p>
<p>This is because your calves are actually the part of the body with the smallest amount of nerves for coldness.</p>
<p>To add on that:</p>
<p>There is nerves for cold and there is different nerves for heat - and this distribution isn't even on your body either!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body is extremely efficient at sending minimal amounts of blood to the extremities when its cold out. It is why you can survive frost bite and not die of hypothermia. Likely the blood temperature in your legs is lower at the time, its just not enough for you to notice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body loses less heat through your legs than it does through your upper body. Your core has all your internal organs and need the most insulation. If you can keep your head and core warm, chances are the rest of you will be less challenged by the cold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
