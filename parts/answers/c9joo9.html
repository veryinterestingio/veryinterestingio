		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans didn't evolve to work in an office building, eat hamburgers and soda or any of the other thousand things we do every day in the modern world.  Humans spent hundreds of thousands of years as hunter/gatherers, and we're exceptionally well adapted to that lifestyle.</p>
<p>Our starch and sugar rich diets are full of energy, but those starches and sugars also stick to your teeth and dissolve the enamel. Fruits and meat don't cause this problem nearly as much.  </p>
<p>If you live in the city, you spend a lot of time indoors very close to lots of other people, so body odor and general hygiene cause a hell of a lot more problems than if we were all outdoors running around.</p>
<p>Speaking of running around, humans evolved to run <em>a lot</em>.  That's literally how we would hunt, just chase a deer until it collapsed from exhaustion.  But these days we drive to work, sit in a chair for 8 hours, drive home, then sit on a couch for 8 hours.  Your heart isn't getting the exercise it evolved to deal with.  </p>
<p>Also, keep in mind that you can eat poorly, not clean yourself, and never exercise, and still live to like 50.  That's plenty long to breed in the wild.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>a lot of the things you mention arent really a problem in the wild</p>
<p>people didnt need to brush their teeth because they ate probably 1/100th of the sugar we eat. </p>
<p>eating healthy / exercise wasnt a problem back then because you were just focussed on having <em>enough</em> food to survive, and you didnt need to exercise because you spent all your energy hunting.</p>
<p>not to mention that you basically only needed to live up until you were old enough to raise children.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well.. Humans now are living much longer than our ancestors who lived in the wild. Much of it comes from better health. And how do we get better health? Good upkeep like hygiene, healthy diet, and lifestyle.</p>
<p>Furthermore ancestors living in the wild probably didn't have trouble with exercise (they have to hunt and stuff), and they also probably didn't have problems with processed food.</p>
<p>Conclusion, it's a matter of how long and how well you want to live. You can forego upkeep and exercise, etc. And you'll probably get a stroke in your 40s.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well exercise and eating correctly were pretty much mandatory in the wild. in the last 100 years sugar has become way way way more available, so that's why. Basically our modern lifestyles are so far removed from how we evolved that we need to maintain ourselves. You have to understand, humans are the fastest animal on land when you factor in how long we can move. We used to hunt by basically running animals down to exhaustion. exercise wasn't an activity it was a way of life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I look at it from an alternative perspective - why does the human body manage to function in such horrific conditions? E.g. we can poison it with smoking, alcohol, drugs, pollutants, pesticides, a sedentary lifestyle... and it still functions!!!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
