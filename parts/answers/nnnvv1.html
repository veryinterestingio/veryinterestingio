		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No because alcohol resistance requires drastic changes to the organism. Antibiotics target specific enzymes in cells and so a few mutations to the site the antibiotic binds or metabolizing it is enough to become resistant. </p>
<p>However alcohol works by disrupting lipid bilayers and denaturing proteins. One way to become resistant is to form spores with protective shells and this is a very big change and an energetically costly one. Spore forming bacteria are still killed by alcohol but their spores can survive and grow after the alcohol is gone. </p>
<p>Notably one of the “0.01%” of bacteria is <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridioides_difficile_(bacteria)" target="_blank"><em>C. difficile</em></a> whose spores are very hard to destroy but it can also be outcompeted by non-spore forming bacteria since spores require so much energy to make.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I've read of this issue before, it isn't that the 0.01% are some kind of super strong germs that resist the alcohol, it's just that the alcohol does not fill every microscopic crack of flesh, and so some of them get missed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The 99.99 thing is more of a mathematical remainder than a statement about bacterial resistance. I used to work for a laboratory doing disinfectant efficacy testing (not for commercial release, but still) and the way the calculations are performed are based on Logarithmic reductions in colony counts. </p>
<p>(In case you've forgotten your logs) Essentially a 2 Log reduction is a 100-fold reduction. 3 Log a 1000-fold reduction, etc....</p>
<p>So when you perform a test you use a known concentration/ amount of microorganism, say .1 ml of 10,000 cfu/ml. (Colony forming units) so a total of 1000 organisms is what you would expect on your control and then the disinfected test would have less. If it is 0 (&gt;1 technically) Then that would be a 3Log reduction. So for every 9 that gets added there would have to be a 10x increase in testing concentration. Which at some point becomes inpractical or infeasible for other reasons. </p>
<p>Using 99.99% instead of Log4 Reduction is I'm sure because it sounds more market-friendly, but it essentially means &quot;complete killing&quot; from the lab.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Antibiotics are basically clever ways of sabotaging a bacterial cell. Alcohol etc. is more like using a sledgehammer. The ability to withstand that sort of thing is not the same as antibiotic resistance, because the attack vectors antibiotics rely on are much more specific, and can be &quot;patched&quot; with relatively small genetic differences. </p>
<p>For example, penicillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic that tampers with part of the final step of building cell walls, and tons of bacteria have developed the enzyme beta-lactam<em>ase</em> which inactivates it before it can harm them. </p>
<p>Other ways to gain resistance could be to change the vulnerable parts of the bacterium or carry the antibiotic  away from them. Staph aureus just plain old made its cell wall <em>thicker</em>, and gained resistance to vancomycin, a fairly strong drug.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first reason is simply that cleansers can't kill everything. There are plenty of microorganisms that are not denatured – that is, torn apart – by alcohol, which is the primary ingredient in hand sanitizers. For example, norovirus, which is responsible for the stomach flu, and clostridium difficile, an intestinal germ that causes severe diarrhea, are not killed by alcohol. </p>
<p>The second reason why products say they only kill 99.9% of germs is marketing and legal liability. If a company claims that they can kill 100% of germs, and someone with an electron microscope decides to put that to the test and discovers germs on the cleansed surface, the company could be liable for false advertising. </p>
<p>The third reason is one of physical reach. Look at your hands. You can see tiny textures to your skin, right? Little micro-wrinkles, pores where hair grows, the deep grooves around and under your nails. To you, these are tiny. To a germ, they're larger than the grand canyon. Bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms can hide deep in these cracks, where an application of hand sanitizer might not be thorough enough to get them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
