		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't understand mental illness as well as we understand physical illness, because the mind is a much more complex system than most individual body systems. We have some theories, but for the most part mental health care is largely based on past trial-and-error to see what works.</p>
<p>There's also a drug-development challenge: there is a barrier called the <em>blood-brain barrier</em> that makes it hard for most molecules to enter the brain. Many medications that would do something if we could get them into the brain are hard to get there. The space of possible drugs that you can explore for mental health is often a lot smaller as a result.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My flatmate studying neuroscience once described medication for mental health like “trying to find a needle in a haystack by smashing at the pile with a sledgehammer”. </p>
<p>Probably comes down to 1. Mental “illness” is less illness like curing a cold, and more environmental factors + past trauma or experience / long-term reaction thereto + chemical proclivity, which are hard to untangle much less treat and 2. We know, like, SO LITTLE about how the little details of what happens physically in the brain translate to lived experience i.e. mental illness (or anything else for that matter)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One major reason is that we still don’t understand the brain as well as we understand other organs in the body. But that’s not the whole story. Mental illness has complexities involved that play a factor such as genetics, social circumstances, surrounding environment, family dynamics, childhood history, and much more. It is really hard to screen for mental illness in its early stages and no one wants to talk about it. Often mental illness is left untreated for too long and this makes it worse by the time help arrives. On top of the stigma, scarcity of qualified mental health workers also don’t help.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
