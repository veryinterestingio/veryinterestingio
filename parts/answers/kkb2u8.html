		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: your body can’t tell the difference between your fear due to an impending lion attack and your fear of speaking in public, and it uses a strategy that works well for lion attacks in an inappropriate situation. </p>
<p>Imagine you’re a tiny animal. You’re all alone, munching on some good food. You hear a noise nearby, and look up and see a huge predator crouched and ready to pounce and eat you. You digesting that food is helpful for your long-term survival, but it takes time and energy. If your body suddenly isn’t sure that you will live to see tomorrow, digesting food today to give you energy tomorrow is no longer a good use of your body’s resources, so it’ll stop digestion, and if it thinks that the contents of your stomach / bowels / bladder are a big enough weight that it could slow you down when running for your life, your body will happily empty the organ in question, which will both make you lighter and will distract the predator with the smelly mess (“Eew, gross. I have to run through THAT? No, I’ll run around the mess, even if it costs me a meal.”).</p>
<p>Some creatures try to run away from predators with partially-digested food in their stomachs, and other creatures forcibly eject this digestive ballast. Over time, more of the running-with-full-bellies critters get eaten than the ones who leave a smelly mess and run. The smelly mess critters pass on the genes that list that as the preferred survival strategy. </p>
<p>Fast forward to the descendants of the smelly mess critters. The creature’s brain tells its body that it is in a very scary / dangerous situation. Your body looks through its options and finds the ‘smelly mess’ strategy. The brain says, “um, no. I’m not in danger of being eaten. I just have to talk in front of a room full of strangers. If I do badly then they will reject me. Then I’ll be alone, with no friends and no one to love me, and then I’ll die.” The body nods knowingly, “Risk of death if we fail. Like with a lion attack. So we’re going with the ‘smelly mess’ strategy, right?” The brain, looking horrified: “No! That won’t help.” The body raises its eyebrow and asks, “do you have a better idea?” Cue the smelly mess.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called fight or flight. </p>
<p>Your body can generate a boost by cranking up some substances in your system. Mentally you will be thinking about you imminent &quot;death&quot;(although it can be something as traumatizing like failing an exam or practical test that will make you think you quality of life is ruined or that you will be seen someone else die in front of you.)</p>
<p>This would help most people react faster, be stronger and for longer times than usual. </p>
<p>Except for those other people who can't handle the chemical imbalance. For those, it's panic and vomit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
