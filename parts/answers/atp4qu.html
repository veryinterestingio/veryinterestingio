		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A change in blood flow to the head area. Whether it is muscle inflammation or chemicals, the change in blood flow isn't regarded as a good thing to your brain. The sensors on your veins and arteries will send a signal to your brain saying something changed and a pain signal is created. The more the change, the worse the headache. That's why ibuprofen works so well because so many times a headache is caused by inflammation in a muscle. Relax, separate your jaw from clinching, relax your neck and back, etc.
Hope that is eli5</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
