		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cash flow of the company doesn't depend on the net worth of the people running it.  The executives' net worth, however, can be very tied to the value of the company if most of their wealth is due to owning stock or stock options.   </p>
<p>Even if they were still cash rich, the CEO of a company is under no obligation to use their personal funds to help the company in troubled times.  They might decide to do so, but few executives have the vast amount of cash needed to keep a large corporation going for long.    </p>
<p>They simply don't keep their wealth in the form of piles of cash lying around.  Most of it will be invested, and a lot of investments have plummeted in value recently. They could sell off investments at a loss and donate them to the corporation, but why should they? They don't own the company, they just work there.    </p>
<p>A <em>well managed</em> company will retain a cash reserve so that they can get through hard times.  Not many will have enough cash reserves to get through a major disaster that virtually stops all of their income for an extended period of time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, they're only billionaires because the stocks they hold are worth a billion dollars.  Should they admit the company is failing and try to sell all their shares, the value plummets and they're quickly not so rich anymore.  Their wealth is very closely tied to the ups and downs of the company.</p>
<p>More generally, consumers want to pay as little as possible and suppliers want to charge as much as possible.  That leaves most businesses operating on fairly thin &quot;margins&quot; - it costs them $95 to make $100.</p>
<p>If you suddenly make $0 but already agreed to pay the $95, shit can hit the fan very quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Liquidity. Companies' and billionaires' net worth is largely tied to the value of things they own, be that shares in the company, or physical property, or even trademarks like brand names. So, while the sum total of what they own might be in the billions of dollars, they'd have to sell something to actually get &quot;liquid&quot; cash on hand. </p>
<p>Add into that that (companies especially) are often heavily &quot;leveraged&quot; where they've borrowed money against the value of the things they have (just like using the house as collateral for your mortgage, or home equity loan), so that they can launch big projects and pay them off over time. Which all works fine as long as the business is bringing in enough cash in the short term to make the loan (and payroll) payments, but can become a much larger problem if that cashflow is interrupted. </p>
<p>The government is doing what it can in terms of low, or sometimes even no, interest loans. These are helpful as the cashflow interruption is a temporary thing, and not due to a change in the market. But even with all of that, companies can only take on so much additional debt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>cash flow.</p>
<p>let's say materials are $10000 monthly. you pay $10000 in other expenses monthly such as buildings paying yourself and utilities</p>
<p>you make  21,000 monthly. so your net profit is 1,000. yay. </p>
<p>then suddenly your monthly income is $5000 instead of 21,000.</p>
<p>you are losing $16,000 a month now.</p>
<p>quickly you  are running out of money. an entire year of profit is gone in 1 month.</p>
<p>you can't not take the supplies. you have contracts. you don't want to fire people, it takes time to train new people and this is only temporary.</p>
<p>obviously it's more complicated then that. but the gist is companies are designed to take X income as minimum and many are making significantly less now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most corporations don't maintain any significant liquidity (cash in the bank) so they have no rainy day savings so to speak.</p>
<p>Most Corporations are heavily leveraged, meaning they borrow lots of money to stay in operation and grow. When you talk about corporate buyouts, these are rarely are in cash. Companies borrow heavily to buy out other companies, and use the profits of that acquires company to pay the loans.</p>
<p>Liquidity in the bank also doesn't benefit the shareholders. Shareholders see loose money in an account as profits they can't get. They would rather take the money out of the company and into their own pockets, or re-invest it to grow the business.</p>
<p>Simple fact is most corporations are run paycheck to paycheck and have no savings for this kind of economic shut down. This kind of 'act of god' situation doesn't even play into their equations.</p>
<p>Unfortunately most companies these days are run in a way to maximize quarterly earnings and EBITDA scores  rather than thinking about the long term goals and risks. Executives are hired by and answerable to the shareholders (of which they are members), and generally speaking all the shareholders care about is how much money they are making. The bonus structures in executive contracts are written in such a way as to only encourage this kind of behavior.</p>
<p>If meeting your quarterly target means laying off 1000 staff so you don't have to pay their paychecks they'll do it. All that matters to them is their bonuses and profits. How is the company going to continue to operate without those 1000 staff? That's a problem for next month.</p>
<p>This leads to a corporate culture that only cares about numbers rather than their workforce.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
