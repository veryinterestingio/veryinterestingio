		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>PhD geneticist here. My graduate work was on theories of aging, and one of the coolest papers I read (and cited in my dissertation) was about sending fruit flies to space that lived longer than their Earth-bound counterparts. </p>
<p>Is there ongoing work related to this? And how are you planning to validate the RNA-seq data from the Kelly twin study? Do you subscribe primarily to the wear-and-tear theory of aging based on these studies?</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to do this!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
