		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's a general property of beams of light traveling in free space that they will spread out as they propagate. It's easiest to think of an ideal case, e.g the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_beam" target="_blank">TEM00 mode of a Gaussian beam.</a> From the side the profile of the beam looks <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/GaussianBeamWaist.svg/1024px-GaussianBeamWaist.svg.png" target="_blank">like this diagram</a>. Notice that there is a place where the waist of the beam is narrowest, defined by the minimum radius w0 here. At a certain distance from this narrowest spot called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_length" target="_blank">Raleigh length</a> (zR), the cross section doubles. There is a simple relation between the two quantities:</p>
<p>zR=w0^(2)/lambda, where lambda is the wavelength.</p>
<p>As a result you see that the narrower the minimum waist is, the faster the beam will spread out <a href="https://i.imgur.com/5qqRJrw.gif" target="_blank">as shown here</a>. The reason is that the narrow you make the beam, the more it diverges in angle. As a result, the way to make a beam stay narrow for the longest propagating distance is to make it wider to begin with. However, for any finite waist, the beam will spread out as it travels.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I learned about this in class just today! If you pass focused light through a hole (let's say the end of the laser emitter), you can derive that sin(theta) is proportional to the wavelength of the light divided by the diameter of the hole. Theta can be seen as the divergence of the light or <em>how much the diameter of the beam grows as you you get farther from the emitter</em>. In order to get an unchanging beam diameter, you'd either need to emit light of wavelength zero (essentially no light) or your laser beam would have to be about as wide as reality itself. All things considered we can get fairly close with the right equipment but truly parallel light isn't possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A laser emits photons of the same wavelength, and in phase.  However, they're not the perfect lines movies show.  All beams diverge, even in a vacuum.  By varying amounts, but they all diverge.</p>
<p>The thing to understand is these photons do not interact, unlike a laminar flow water stream from a slow-running faucet.  They don't pull together, nor bounce off each other.</p>
<p>You just pick one photon in the middle and look for the probability that picking another photon at random, will be within say 5millirads of the same direction?  In a 5mrad beam,  most are, a few are not.</p>
<p>If you say &quot;ok, if I pick this one photon and then another, what's the chance that they are <em>exactly</em> parallel, like 0.0000000000000000... degrees different?&quot;  That probability is 1/infinity, essentially zero.  If you ask for a finite <em>nonzero</em> tolerance (0.001 mrad angle between the two) you will get a small, but nonzero probability of being as-good-or-better.</p>
<p>Next question, what if we focus it?  Well, we usually do.  Often a beam converges and initially gets smaller from the emitter.  It will reach the &quot;beam waist&quot; (which is a minimum, but never zero, diameter) then diverge again, like a bowtie.  In no case can you make &quot;zero&quot; divergence.</p>
<p>Because all the photons are traveling in straight lines and do not cling together, summing momentums, like that funky 8-beams-summing together into one out of the Death Star.  They don't do that.  If you had 8 green laser pointers doing that, they'd cross through the same point and go off in 8 different directions.  Any one beam would have the same spread regardless of whether any other beams were turned on.</p>
<p>You could say &quot;ok let's start with a beam where 99% of its energy is within a 5mm dia, what if we just look at that 5mm dia a km away and forget what's outside that dia? Or a light year away?&quot;  Well, there will be <em>some</em> energy at any distance, and eventually the quantization into photons becomes relevant.  At a light year away, a perfect 100% sensitive 5mm detector will probably not get a single photon in any given second.  There is only a <em>chance</em> of seeing a photon from the original beam on the detector's area in any given second.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I find a lot of these answers are not exactly correct and misleading, like the most highly voted comment for this question.  I will try to clarify things.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>No laser we can make is perfectly collimated. Therefore even in an absolute vaccum, we cannot expect the diamater to stay constant. Photons simply have smaller differences in trajectory between one another.  The vacuum itself does not affect the beam for standard light intensities. There is no diffraction and no refraction.</p>
</li>
<li>Theoretically, there is no law that says that a perfect beam will diverge so a theoretical beam will never diverge. It's just that making that perfect beam is not possible in practice.</li>
</ol>
<p>How it COULD MAYBE be possible: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I'm not sure, but there may be a way to make a beam that does propagate for nearly infinite distance in a perfect vacuum without having a perfect laser that can't exist.</p>
<p>There's a recent paper which describes light refraction of light by itself in an ultra intense beam.  In a similar way that nonlinear optical filamentation (some may find this interesting to look up) self-focuses due to the Kerr effect in a medium, maybe its possible that through some a similar effect that consecutive focusing and defocusing feedback effects in a vaccum could allow for essentially lossless self-guiding in a perfect vacuum. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Sarazin, Xavier et al. “Refraction of Light by Light in Vacuum.” The European Physical Journal D 70.1 (2016). </p>
<p>But this is purely speculation as to what could be possible. Chances are high it may not be.</p>
