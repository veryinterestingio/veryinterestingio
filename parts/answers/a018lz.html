		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Consider it from the evolutionary angle: &quot;spiciness&quot; originated as a defense mechanism of some plants against being eaten.  A wild animal unadapted to the spicy chemicals will probably take one bite of a hot-looking pepper and be in pain for a few minutes, so it would learn from its mistakes and not repeat.  If it were just a few seconds of pain, they might just keep munching.  Kinda ironic that humans actually enjoy it!</p>
<p>On the other hand, lots of sweet fruits adapted specifically to be eaten, so that the seeds could be transported (in the digestive tracts of animals) far and wide.  Animals are adapted to, once they learn that food is good, (sweetness being one good indicator in the wild) keep eating it.  One part of this is that, after you take your first bite, you can't just enjoy the same bite, you want to take another one to continue to enjoy the flavor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apart from the Chemical reason explained by u<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Lettit_Be_Known" target="_blank">/Lettit_Be_Known</a>, there is an evolutionary reason: We retained sensory channels that actually perceive spice as 'pain' to help us avoid certain plants that might not agree with us. </p>
<p>On the other hand, starch/carbohydrates - one of our main sources of energy is something our body carves and we need to eat a lot of it for satiety - lingering sweet taste might makes us eat lesser. </p>
<p>Have you noticed that you need to only lick or touch the tip of your tongue to a chilly/pepper to perceive 'hotness', why you need to swallow anything sweet to actually relish it? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Fun tip: If you keep eating spicy, our pain sensors get tired and numb (capsaicin desensitisation) and don't perceive pain anymore, so much so that the active agent in hot peppers are used for pain alleviation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
