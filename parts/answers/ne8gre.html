		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Repetitive action in those kind of counts without recovery can damage anything. People commonly get worn out shoulders, knees and ankles from repetitive action for a few common examples.</p>
<p>Excercising has specific forms meant to help protect joints and connective tissues. Repetitive activity, be it clicking, doing the same thing over and over on a factory line or a lot of sports activities typically does not and often involves doing that one motion for hours on end, hundreds or thousands of times, day after day instead of a relatively small number of reps before shifting to a different activity.</p>
<p>Tldr; it's just too many times, too often and usually it's the joints or connective tissues that really suffer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>we do strengthen wrist and hand through repetitive usage.</p>
<p>THE BIG PROBLEM, is that you give leg and arm time to recover post usage by not using them.</p>
<p>Where as gamers don't really stop to it it time to rest, thus damaging the muscles.</p>
<p>And also wrist contain much less muscle than arm and leg due to it being a joint.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Someone weight training to strengthen their arm muscles isn't doing hundreds of movements per minute. If you were clicking the mouse at the same speed as the guy is pumping his iron then you would be very unlikely to get RSI, but because you're doing it as rapidly as you do then it causes damage. To use an analogy: if you're driving along with the engine in your car doing 2000rpm then it'll be fine. Try and take it up to 8000rpm and chances are you'll damage something, even though the engine is doing exactly what it was doing before, only faster.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have given excellent answers but an additional issue is how our hand and finger anatomy is set up. </p>
<p>It takes a LOT of muscles to do all the motions a hand is capable of: each finger can go up, down, left, right, and has three sections that can (theoretically) move independently, plus the thumb can be moved to an opposite (opposable) position, plus the wrist can change the orientation in a nearly 100 degree cone. The hand is capable of incredibly delicate motions (like picking a single flower without crushing it), broad ones (like pushing open a door), and strong ones (like holding a 50 pound weight or supporting the entire body while climbing).  There's simply no way to get all the muscles required to fit into a small enough package entirely within the hand. </p>
<p>So instead a bunch of the muscles are in your forearms. You can test this out by gripping your arm below the elbow and moving your fingers around, or looking at the underside of your wrist while you move them. The muscles pull on long tendon &quot;cables&quot; that run through your wrist and connect to various points on the fingers. </p>
<p>Some compromises have to be made though. Some can't be moved entirely independently, and at some angles strength and dexterity aren't the best because the cables are bending around sharp turns. But the biggest one is that all of these cables have to go through a small channel in your wrist that ALSO has to be small and flexible if it wants to move as well. </p>
<p>So these &quot;carpal&quot; wrist bones have a tunnel in them, and those cables are packed in there and can be moving backwards and forwards and sliding past each other constantly. But if one of them gets irritated it will swell... which makes the space in the carpal tunnel smaller, which inflamed them, which causes them to swell, which narrows the space, which restricts their motion and inflamed them, which... you can see how it spirals out of control. </p>
<p>So it's not the muscles that are getting weak, it's the connections between muscles and joints that are getting irritated and if not given a chance to heal will only become worse and worse. That's why proper posture and wrist alignment is so important.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
