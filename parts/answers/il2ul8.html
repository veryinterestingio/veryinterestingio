		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The book &quot;The Naked Ape&quot; does a pretty good job of explaining this and why both men and women orgasm. For men, it gives an incentive to reproduce, while for women, it's an incentive to stay laying down to maximize chances of fertilization (getting tired after orgasming). When we started walking on two legs, it became harder for semen to &quot;stay put&quot; inside of a female. So female homosapiens orgasm, get tired, and stay laying down to solve this issue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To understand how your body knows when to orgasm, you need to understand what an orgasm is, and why your body does it. The first question's answer is that, it is an response your body does after recieving a specific signal from the brain, only a response, your brain isn't in too much control of what happens after you send the signal to &quot;pass the point of no return.&quot; The second question's answer is, your body does this because your brain has said, &quot;okay, I have recieved the appropriate stimuli to have an orgasm, then it sends the signal down to the base of your back bone. It doesn't matter if you were really stimulated, if your brain just decided to send the signal without the physical contact, or even if I were to hook a signal up to the specific nerve ending in your back bone and fire said signal, your body will orgasm, and this is evident by the fact that we can even make recently dead bodies orgasm. From there your body has a &quot;built in&quot; pattern of contractions it does which we basically call the orgasm, these contractions then send a signal back up to the brain, which release a massive amount of feel good neuro transmitters, until the orgasm subsides. The differences between female and male orgasms start alittle bit before this point, but for the most part they are pretty similar. Anymore questions, just comment and I'll fill in some more blanks</p>
<p>Tl;dr- brain sends signal, body receives signal, orgasm is something your body does independent of the brain, orgasm ensues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
