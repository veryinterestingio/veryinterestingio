<p>Interesting side-note. The modern horse originated in North America, then went extinct in the Americas around 12,000 years ago (Ice Age, probably). Fortunately they had migrated to Asia before that. They were only reintroduced to the Americas with the arrival of Christopher Columbus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Using birds' digestive systems is how many plants spread around the globe. </p>
<p>Surtsey is a pretty famous example. It is a volcanic island that appeared in the 1960's. A rock in the middle of the ocean is a nice hide out for birds, whether they be fishing, flying back and forth from Iceland and stopping on the way or just hiding from predators. </p>
<p>Birds of course poop and sooner than later, the island was already growing plants. </p>
<p>It even grew a tomato plant, but that was traced back to a scientist who had been a bit too careless with his own droppings and it was subsequently removed from the soil.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  You've heard of fruit? </p>
<p>Ever wonder why fruit is so sweet and delicious? It's a trap.  That's the plant tricking you(or any animal) into taking that fruit(and the seed(s) inside) somewhere else, so the plant can spread and replicate.  Sometimes the animal just eats the fruit and discards the seed nearby. </p>
<p>Sometimes the animal eats the fruit and the seed and then (assuming the seed is indigestible - evolutionary pressure encourages seeds to be either indigestible or unpalatable) excrete the seed some distance away. </p>
<p>Animals do this on a massive scale in terms of both distance and time.  They are constantly moving and migrating. Birds migrate tremendous distances, moving from continent to continent.</p>
<p>Coconuts spread around the whole world without any assistance because their seeds float.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes! A perfect example will be Hawaii, it is a volcanic island that millions of years ago was only rock and nothing else. Then it is believed that a bird carried microorganisms and maybe even seeds that eventually after millions of years turned Hawaii into the paradise that it is today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean that they intentionally brought species other than themselves to a new place? No, but if you count the animals themselves... sort of? Lemurs are believed to have arrived on Madagascar long ago (~60 million years ago), but they weren't natives. In fact they somehow made it over from mainland Africa, possibly in floating logs while they hibernated, but who knows for sure. Presumably whatever parasites they had in/on them also came with them. </p>
<p>Either way, I think it's safe to call that the introduction of a non-native species, and it's not the first Madagascar has been home to. The truth is that birds, insects, and even reptiles and mammals seem to get around on geological time scales. The problem with humans is that we do it <em>all of the time</em> and on a truly huge scale. Rats on our ships, insects in our food, etc... all moving around the world every day by the gigaton.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
