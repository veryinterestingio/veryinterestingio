		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answers here are missing the fundamental problem, which is not the fact that the Big Bang was too hot or too cool or too short for heavier elements to form.</p>
<p>There are no stable nuclides of mass 5 or 8, and this is called the &quot;mass-5 roadblock&quot; or &quot;mass-5 bottleneck&quot; by various folks. Why is this important?</p>
<p>At the start of the Big Bang we think most of the matter in the universe starts out as either protons or neutrons, each with an atomic mass of ~1. Nucleosynthesis occurs when two of these nucleons happen to collide. When a proton and a neutron bind together they create a deuteron with a mass of 2. When a proton binds with a deuteron you get helium-3. If you add another neutron, or if you bind two deuterons together then you've got helium-4, etc.</p>
<p>The point here is that Big Bang nucleosynthesis builds up larger atoms out of smaller mass-1 or mass-2 building blocks. </p>
<p>We don't get larger elements because there are no stable mass-5 nuclei. You can get a mass-5 nucleus if a neutron or proton binds with helium-4 (which would result in helium-5 or lithium-5 respectively) but these nuclei are not stable and quickly eject the extra neutron/proton, decaying back to helium-4. Both helium-5 and lithium-5 have half-lives on the order of 10^-22 seconds.</p>
<p>The way you get around this is by &quot;jumping&quot; over mass-5. For example, if you bind a helium-4 (two protons and two neutrons) with a deuteron (one proton and one neutron) you can get lithium-6, which is stable. Then you add another neutron and you have lithium-7, also stable. Or, you can add a proton to lithium-6 to get beryllium-7, which is stable. </p>
<p>The problem again is that there are no stable mass-8 nuclei. Any mass-8 nucleus that is created quickly decays back down into a mass-7 nucleus.</p>
<p>This is where the time and pressure arguments become meaningful. It's possible that two large mass-7 nuclei could smash into each other and create something beyond mass-8 that would be stable. However, Big Bang nucleosynthesis did not last long enough or create enough of these larger nuclei for this to happen in any significant quantity. Thus, these heavier collisions and their heavier, more complicated byproducts were not produced at that time.</p>
<p>Later, large clouds of matter would coalesce into stars and begin fusion again. Where the big bang lasted for a moment, stellar fusion lasts for millions of years, and those reactions would slowly create elements that are heavier than mass-5 and mass-8. Then, once those stars eventually go supernova you have lots of violent Big-Bang-like collisions happening but with much larger nuclei, providing many more possible pathways (more possible building blocks) to form heavier elements.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The early universe was essentially a hot soup of quarks - as it expanded and cooled quarks bound to become hadrons, which bound with electrons to form hydrogen.</p>
<p>Its a misconception that the universe began with a singularity - we actually don't know what happened at the beginning. There was a period of inflation in the very early universe where the &quot;observable universe&quot; expanded from the size of a grape to interstellar or intergalactic scales in a fraction of a fraction of a second.</p>
<p>To create heavy elements there needs to be an extremely high pressure - they form in dying stars because once their energy runs out there is nothing stopping gravitational collapse, and the sheer gravitational pressure smashes atoms together to create heavier ones..</p>
<p>Even if the singularity were true - the universe expanded from the singularity. There was no extreme gravitational pressure forcing quarks together, as the universe was quite hot and there was plenty of energy around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
