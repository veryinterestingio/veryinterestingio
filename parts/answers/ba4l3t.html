		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Animals with fur can still make Vitamin D via UV dependent pathways, it's just less efficient because the fur blocks some of the sunlight. Fish are excellent dietary sources of Vitamin D and much of the non-human arctic wildlife eats fish or other aquatic wildlife that is obtaining Vitamin D from the aquatic food chain. </p>
<p>As for the humans in arctic regions, Vitamin D supplementation and dietary sources rich in Vitamin D are essential during the periods of the year where there is a little to no UV rays.</p>
<p>I know in certain regions of Alaska that have prolonged periods of darkness, tanning beds are popular in the winter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vitamin D is needed by animals, and almost all of them can synthesise it trivially via several pathways, all of which are photo-mediated: Biology seems to only be able to make vitamin D precursors using photochemistry, which plankton has been using for 500 million years (the ultimate source of it in the marine food chain). Vitamin D as we know it is really a pro-vitamin, the cholecalciferol is itself inert.  7-dehydrocholesterol  in the skin is photodegraded to  cholecalciferol. The liver converts it to 25-hydroxycalciferol, which is hydroxylated to calcitriol in the kidneys, this is the active form of vitamin D.</p>
<p>Dogs and cats can't use this mechanism at all, and rely on dietary sources. Ruminants get most of theirs  from their skin ( <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20412916" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20412916" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20412916</a></a> ) even if they're hair covered. Sheep are industrially used to make vitamin D, from lanolin (wool grease), which is rich in  7-dehydrocholesterol. It is not well conserved in terrestrial animals, but the liver and kidney metabolic pathways are, indicating that diet is an important source of vitamin D precursors among terrestrial animals.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>(This, BTW, is an excellent question, and the science here seems to require more research as we don't seem to have studied many animal groups on this topic)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>“In birds and fur-bearing mammals, fur or feathers block UV rays from reaching the skin. Instead, vitamin D is created from oily secretions of the skin deposited onto the feathers or fur, and is obtained orally during grooming.”</p>
