		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A <em>meteoroid</em> is a small rock in space. If it hits the atmosphere and stars burning up, it's called a <em>meteor</em>. Once it hits the ground, the remnant is called a <em>meteorite</em>.</p>
<p>An asteroid is a larger rock in space - the cutoff is about a metre or so - but especially refers to big rocks in certain parts of the solar system - basically, stuff in the Asteroid Belt, but sometimes the Trojans orbiting with Jupiter are called asteroids too. They typically have close to circular orbits. The biggest ones are <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/The_Four_Largest_Asteroids.jpg" target="_blank">hundreds of kilometres across</a>, and aren't very different from a small moon or a tiny planet.</p>
<p>Comets are a bit like asteroids, but with more ice and other volatile material, because of their elliptical orbits - which are sometimes <em>extremely</em> elliptical. In an elliptical orbit, you spend most of your time very far from the Sun, and then quickly whip around the Sun before heading out again. So they spend most of their time in the cold outer solar system, which means they can be covered in ice and dust particles etc that don't survive for long in the inner solar system. When they get close to the Sun, this stuff gets evaporated and blown away, and you get enormous tails of gas and dust behind a comet. They can also start to break apart a bit from the change in temperature. But because they aren't in the inner solar system for long, only some of the ice etc gets blown off each flyby, so you can get periodic comets like Halley that produce a brilliant tail, fly away again, and then return after 75 years and produce another tail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add some explanation to why we have all these words, when they basically all mean &quot;space rock&quot;.</p>
<p>People saw the flaming streaks in the sky (&quot;shooting stars&quot;) before we knew the cause, and called them &quot;meteor&quot;, meaning something like &quot;high in the sky&quot;. </p>
<p>The suffix &quot;ite&quot; basically means rock/mineral. Granite for example means grainy-mineral, kryptonite would mean a mineral made of krypton, etc. (You've probably heard of some of andesite, graphite, bauxite, carbonite, calcite etc). So &quot;meteorite&quot; is what we called the weird rocks that came from this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Finally, once we understood what caused shooting stars, and started discovering similar objects in space (but not in our atmosphere) we started calling those objects essentialpy &quot;meteor-like&quot;. (You may have heard the terms &quot;spheroid&quot; or &quot;cuboid&quot; to refer to shapes that are <em>like</em> spheres or cubes, or android for person-like robots for example (andro means man).)</p>
<p>Along this last line, note that &quot;asteroid&quot; means &quot;star-like&quot; because when they reflect sunlight they looked to early observers like weird stars. (And similar lines, &quot;planetoid&quot; is used as a catchall for anything that's sort-of almost planet-like, like really big asteroids, and sometimes moons)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Comets= Loosely formed chunks of ice and dirt. They tend to leave a bright tail as the sun melts it and blasts the gasses off. They originate from the Kupier Belt and Oort Cloud.</p>
<p>Meteorites= solid chunks of space rock that enter Earth's atmosphere and hit the ground.</p>
<p>Meteors= solid chunks of space rock that enter Earth's atmosphere and burn up.</p>
<p>Asteroids= space rocks. May be very small or very big and somewhat loosely or very solidly formed. Usually odd shapes. These are typically found in the inner solar system in a large belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, but there are also groups of them following Jupiter around. Sometimes, the Earth will temporarily capture small rogue asteroids too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The meteorite is a source of the light
And the meteor's just what we see
And the meteoroid is a stone that's devoid of the fire that propelled it to thee</p>
<p>And the meteorite's just what causes the light
And the meteor's how it's perceived
And the meteoroid's a bone thrown from the void that lies quiet in offering to thee</p>
