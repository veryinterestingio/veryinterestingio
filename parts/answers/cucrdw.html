<p>It's more complicated than that (as everything brain related always is). The other commenter's response about needing stimulation isn't really accurate. </p>
<p>First, ADHD isn't really about being overstimulated / overactive in general. It's more about having difficulty deciding which things to do, especially deciding which things to do based on what you're <em>supposed</em> to be doing / future consequences. This is why one of the hallmark features of ADHD in teens and adults is a long history of failing to get important things done, and why suffering consequences as a result often fails to have an effect on future behaviour. </p>
<p>As for how stimulant medications address this: We aren't sure. Most likely, though, the stimulant medications are somehow stimulating the brain circuits involved in using information about future consequences to guide behavior, or other brain circuits involved in &quot;executive control&quot; of behavior (basically, exercising deliberate control over your actions).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also neuroscientist here, specifically focusing on neuroimaging of ADHD and autism.</p>
<p>The ELI5 version is that stimulant medication alters dopamine that effect the reward pathways  in the brain. Effectively this means that it helps decrease the salience is distracting stimuli which ultimately allows you to focus.</p>
<p>As others have said the exact mechanism is not well understood. However for a good introduction scientific reading I'd start with the following article:</p>

<p>ADHD meds are to stimulate the policeman, not to speed up the traffic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was diagnosed with ADHD around 8 years old, put on stimulants when I was young and then tapered myself off because, at the time, the medicine I was receiving only made me depressed. Into my years in college I experimented with others, and found great success. However, I  always held the belief that I didn’t want to be dependent on something that I was going to require for the rest of my life to function normally, partially for my own pride, but also because I don’t believe we have a full understating of the long term effects of continued use of amphetamines. I’ve found that listening to music when trying to accomplish a task can be very beneficial, which makes complete sense when the idea is described as needing addition stimulation to complete a task to not be bored or lose focus. I still try to stay away from medication as much as I can, although I do from time to time seek it out for large tasks. Is there any other actions or habits someone can recommend to try and offset the lack of attention/ low impulse control? I graduated college on the deans list multiple times finishing with all A’s in my most difficult semester, but I still feel so lost and incapable in my internship because I’m afraid I’m just simply not going to perform the way I need to without the structure of organized education and the resources that were available to me. Additionally, this has also translated into a lack of confidence that leaches into a variety of areas in my life. I’d just like some semblance of control.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We lack dopamine which is a hormone that is made in brain as &quot;reward&quot; and also stimulates movement and emotions. People without adhd get this reward regularly, for doing things that feel good. We - ADHDers don´t, so we are constantly looking for something to do which can give us dopamine. We are literally chasing dopamine, looking for some action because our brain needs dopamine so we don´t feel depressed. Stimulants  increase our attention and energy levels by raising levels of dopamine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
