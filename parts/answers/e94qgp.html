		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a classic thought experiment in special relativity. There are a few variations on it, but the core thing is that if you have some long rigid stick, you can seemingly break special relativity.</p>
<p>The solution here is that it's actually impossible to have a perfectly rigid stick (or clock hand, in this case). When you wave a stick around, the other end of the stick doesn't instantly &quot;know&quot; that it's been moved. You move the atoms at one end, and they pull the atoms next to them, and they pull the next atoms, and so on up the stick until the tip starts moving. This happens slower than the speed of light - it's actually at the speed of sound.</p>
<p>This isn't very noticeable on a small scale, because the transmission is fast enough that it looks like the stick all moves at the same time - it looks like the tip instantly knows that the other end is being moved. But if you have a really long stick and spin it around really fast, the transmission time starts to matter. The end you're moving can move quite a distance before the other end gets the message. So you end up <em>bending</em> the rod, and nothing goes faster than light.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that if you're assuming that the stick is perfectly rigid, you're already saying that you can go faster than light. If the far end of the rod instantly knows that the near end is being moved, then it has communicated faster than light. So this problem turns out to be saying &quot;assuming I can go faster than light, is it possible to go faster than light?&quot;. It's just that the original faster-than-light bit isn't immediately obvious.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a related mind-bender. Replace the stick with a laser pointer and shine it at the moon. Presumably, there is now a laser spot on the moon. The moon is about 385,000,000 m away. If you then sweep the laser pointer in an arc, at 6rad/s \~1Hz, So it takes 1s to make a full circle.  That spot on the moon will move at (3.85X10\^8)*2*Pi/1s. The math here is the circumference of the circle formed by the laser, with radius from you to the moon, divided by the time it takes to go around that circle, which is  1s.  That speed is more than 6 times the speed of light!</p>
<p>Of course, you now immediately make the analogy that this is just like you spinning with a water hose, like a human sprinkler.  The water takes time to travel from the tip of the hose to the ground, and so the water sweeps out a spiral curve. And by the time it would get to the moon, it's lagging very far behind the front of the hose, and you may have made many circles at that time.  And you would be exactly right, that is how it works, and that is how your very long rod example works aswell.  <a href="https://www.britannica.com/video/185489/Animation-speed-of-light-laser" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.britannica.com/video/185489/Animation-speed-of-light-laser" target="_blank">https://www.britannica.com/video/185489/Animation-speed-of-light-laser</a></a>.  </p>
<p>Abiding by special relativity, an observer on the moon can only see photons from the laser pointer land on the surface of the moon at the speed of light, because this is how quickly they measure the photons traveling, ALWAYS, NO EXCEPTIONS. But this is a good problem for friends and fam who think they know a thing or two about physics, claim with your example that you can transmit matter/information at multiple times the speed of light, and watch their gears grind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let me start this off by saying you cannot reach the speed of light.</p>
<p>Your idea is not new and shows a basic concept that starts to break down in relativity. Rigid bodies. While they are usefull for a lot of scenarios they really are just a great approximation. They do not exist in practice. To come back to your question: the hand would snap or bend preventing this. If you think about a rotated coordinate system at that speed you would not be a time like particle but a space like particle.</p>
<p>A lot of these naive approaches to go faster than light come from newtonian physics being basically a low velocity  approximation of special relativity. This means if the velocities become big you are throwing away lots of extra terms which would be 0 (or 1) in day to day applications.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two parts to my comment: Am I not understanding why it transmits at the speed of sound?</p>
<p>If you increase the speed of the rod at an infinitesimal small rate, would this not negate the issue of transmission? Technically it would take forever to get to the speed of light but would it not though?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
