It makes the material tougher and less susceptible to decomposing. That’s why we can have leather products without it rotting like regular skin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I once worked in a leather workshop making high end leather goods. </p>
<p>The sales rep from the tannery William Clarke’s in Kent came in once with some 300 year old reindeer leather. They had recovered a cargo of ‘green hides’ (untanned/untreated hides) as part of a salvage operation, which had been submerged in mud which had preserved them. </p>
<p>They tanned them and sold them at around 5 times the cost per ft.</p>
<p>We did a factory visit there once was fascinating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tanning involves several steps that include removing all non-skin elements from the hide, and then treating it with an acid to make the skin more durable and less prone to rot. There are a lot of ways of doing this. </p>
<p>The reason we do this is that if you don't, the skin will probably rot away to nothing. By tanning, you are basically pickling/preserving the leather so it will last a very long time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
