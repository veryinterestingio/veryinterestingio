		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The proportion of the population that is needed to reach herd immunity is proportional to how effective the virus is in spreading.   With Delta the threshold is much higher. </p>
<p>Keep in mind here immunity is not a fixed number. It really means that there are not enough opportunity for the virus to sustain itself. Localized herd immunity in a community that generally interacts at a distance and outdoors (or infrequently with each other) is going to be different than one where this is frequent close contact and a lot of mixing (all else being equal). This means things like local culture can, and will, have an impact.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every disease has an infectivity rate. r0 (pronounced &quot;R-nought&quot;) is a theoretical number that each sick person would spread the illness to, assuming 100% of the population is susceptible and zero measures are taken to slow the transmission. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number" target="_blank">This Wikipedia page</a> is a great resource. </p>
<p>The biggest takeaway is that as r0 increases, so does the herd immunity threshold. It takes more work to stem the tide. </p>
<p>Side note: this is why flu was virtually non-existent in 2020. The masks, social distancing, and constant symptom screening was enough to <em>reduce</em> Covid-19 spread, (r0 of 3), it was enough to bring the flu (r0 of 1.6) to an effective rT under 1.0. When the observed transmission rate falls below 1, the disease will decrease in a population. </p>
<p>So we needed at least 65% of the population vaccinated against Covid to effectively end the pandemic. It didn't happen. And it likely won't happen. This allowed the virus to survive, spread, and mutate. This gave rise to the Delta variant. </p>
<p>Delta's r0 is estimated between 5.0 - 9.5. At that rate, we need as much as 90% of the population to get vaccinated to protect the ones who can't get vaccinated. This will not happen. Almost 20% of the population is under 12 years old. Another large portion has health issues that are contraindicated with vaccines. And that doesn't even get into the 25-30% that refuse it due to propaganda, political, or religious reasons. </p>
<p>The conversation on heard immunity stopped, because the window for it to be an option has closed. At least, through controllable measures. The only back door to it now is if the pandemic runs its course and enough susceptible people get the virus to develop their own antibodies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Herd immunity is not feasible without vaccination, and that is the goal with getting everyone vaccinated. </p>
<p>Originally politicians were discussing opening early to attempt to reach heard immunity though the innate immune response of people actually getting infected, but the issue is that the death toll of attempting this would put the country in such an economic recession it would not be beneficial (not to ignore the obvious moral catastrophe that would be but that doesn’t seem to be the concern for some). Immunologists have been saying this for the last year and a half yet the discussions continued until a proper vaccine could be developed. </p>
<p>Vaccination, however, is an extremely effective method of getting herd immunity to protect those that cannot get vaccinated (immune compromised individuals) but the issue is that the same threshold for herd immunity is steep. The CDC is aiming for at least 70%, but some immunologists are saying it may be closer to 80-90% (this is what we commonly expect with influenza vaccinations). </p>
<p>So herd immunity is still the goal, the problem now lies in getting to that percentage. We tend to only discuss herd immunity when it comes to actual virus infections, but in reality that is what will be achieved with vaccines, without the massive death toll that would occur if we only used actual virus infections. And that’s why vaccination is so important!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
