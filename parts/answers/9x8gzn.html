<p>In short, when the bubble filled with water vapor rises from the heated water layers up to still cold water, the water vapor inside the bubble cools down, its pressure drops and the bubble collapses quickly, many of them creating cracking sound. The more water is heated the less is the effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most water has oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other gases dissolved into it, but its ability to hold these gases decrease as its temperature goes up, so the bubbling you hear before the boiling begins is all of those gases being liberated from the water and forming bubbles that float to the surface and then pop. Near-boiling water has no more dissolved gas and thus the bubbling stops.</p>
<p>If you used distilled water to make tea, it wouldn't bubble until it actually boiled, but I strongly recommend against this, as it could potentially <em>not</em> boil and instead become superheated and explosively evaporate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
