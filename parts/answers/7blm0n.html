So If your leg is broken and you can't move a little your chance developing cloths is higher. That's why they give you shots in hospital every day. While sitting the legs aren't moved much, they are angled and the blood have to flow upwards. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer this, we should first take a look first at the circulatory system’s method of flow.</p>
<p>The blood comes out of the heart and into the aorta and arterial system.  The arteries are much thicker because of their more robust tunica media layer.  That’s basically a smooth muscle layer that handles the high pressure, and in the case of the arterioles (medium sized arteries), it changes tone to effect your blood pressure.</p>
<p>Once the blood goes through the capillary level (where it moves more slowly to accommodate oxygen, CO2, and metabolite diffusion), it goes into the venous system to make its journey back to the heart and lungs.</p>
<p>***CUE Part where DVTs (deep vein thromboses) happen</p>
<p>The venous system is composed of very floppy vessels with valves to help prevent backflow of blood.  It has a much thinner tunica media and it depends on the contraction of skeletal muscle (the voluntary muscles you use to walk) near it to help with blood flow when flow fights gravity (returns to the heart).  If blood isn’t moving fast enough, the clotting mechanisms kick in and you get a thrombus (fancy pants word for clot).</p>
<p>When you’re sleeping, your legs are more or less at the phlebostatic axis (on a horizontal plane with your heart), meaning return flow is <em>much</em> easier because you aren’t fighting gravity to get that blood back up to the heart.  When you sleep, your body moves a tiny bit to keep venous return flow going, but the gravity is your most influential variable.  With the gravity being alleviated, you aren’t usually laying down  long enough to make a difference.  If you’re down for more than a day or two, we start to treat it a bit.</p>
<p>*In the hospital, we use some anticoagulants (anti-clot meds) and powered compression devices to simulate skeletal muscle contraction.  This is mostly because people are in bed for days at a time without a lot of motion while recovering.  The tops of the beds also tilt up, so gravity makes an appearance again.  This is why nurses put pillows under the knees or slightly elevate the legs (some nicer beds can do this) so the hips are the lowest part of the body (not with a straight knee as that actually inhibits flow as well—I’ll get into that at the bottom).  Minimizing the effects of gravity helps the venous circulation even more than the compression machines by themselves.</p>
<p>Quadriplegic people bound to wheelchairs often have tilt chairs because they get almost no skeletal muscle activity in their whole body.</p>
<p><strong>Answer time/ TL;DR</strong> When you’re sitting for prolonged periods, your skeletal muscle activity is low, but because you’re flighting gravity, your blood has a tendency to push into the venous walls and expand them (remember they’re floppy), causing a decrease in flow velocity due to a widened vessel.  It’s like taking the sprayer nozzle off a garden hose.  The change in diameter causes an inverse change with regards to flow even though the same amount of fluid is going through.  When the blood is allowed to slow down like this, it causes an increased risk of clot.</p>
<p>You may be wondering why a clot is so bad.  It can break away and float to your lung, causing a Pulmonary Embolus (PE) and killing part of your lung.  It could float to your brain and give you a massive stroke.  It could also block your coronary circulation and give you a heart attack.  All three of those can kill you.</p>
<p>Getting up frequently on flights helps decrease the risk for clots.  Couple that with compression socks/sleeves/tights (the leg is more at risk than the thigh and is the more important part for compression), and that usually reduces the risk of clot formation <em>dramatically</em>.  Also to note, compression shorts aren’t a good idea because they prevent a backflow as the blood goes from the uncompressed leg to the compressed thigh.  Distal is more important, so the compression should be greater there and should decrease as it gets more proximal to your body (distal = further from heart, proximal = closer).</p>
<p>If you have clotting disorders, consult your physician before flying.  If you’re on birth control or pregnant, it’s a good idea to get your PTT/INR checked regularly (clotting factors).  This is purely educational and not a substitute for medical advice.</p>
<p><em>As promised: the straight knees thing!  Straight knees actually cause the veins to bend a tight (but small) turn.  Think of it as a kink in the garden hose that causes resistance in the vessel.  When people pass out from standing with straight legs, this is why.</em></p>
<p>Hope this helped!  I love physiology!  Let me know if you have questions!  Again, this is just for educational purposes.</p>
<p>Please excuse any typos/autocorrects.  I did this on my mobile.</p>
<p>Edit: Yay Gold!!! Thank you so much kind stranger!!!!  I’m stoked to figure out what it does ?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is called a deep vein thrombosis and its more common after surgery, during travel, and in people who are at greater risk for it due to blood conditions and platelet count. </p>
<p>The changes undergone in the body after having surgery can increase clotting and the chances of having a clot. This is made more likely by being more sedentary when recovering due to pain and mobility so it's important that people get up and walk at set schedules, even if it hurts. Patients are often given heparin injections to thin the blood after surgery, even going so far as to have patients self inject for days after being released from the hospital. </p>
<p>Sitting for long periods isn't great for the body, but under normal conditions it isn't that bad. However when traveling for long periods of time, crammed into small and uncomfortable airline, train, or bus, seats, coupled with the seating position, circulation problems from seat design, and that at many times people are discouraged from getting out of their seat, people are more likely to develop them. Blood also tends to pool in the lower extremities when seated for long periods. Imagine a 20 hour flight to Australia in coach, where you can only get up and move around sparingly due to tightly packed seats. Outside of restroom breaks you might not get up at all. </p>
<p>Laying down in bed doesn't put so much pressure on the thighs and cause blood to pool in the legs. It also doesn't affect circulation in any negative way unlike sitting. Standing still causes blood to pool in the lower limbs, however the action of walking helps with circulation and the muscle movements and motion help stimulate blood flow. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
