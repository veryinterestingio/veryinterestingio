		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here are a couple of things I learned while exploring this question.</p>
<p>1) I discovered the existence of r/metrology (metrology is &quot;the scientific study of measurement&quot;). Looks like your question was fully answered here, but for any future measurement questions I'd bet that's a good group to ask.</p>
<p>2) According to an 1991 NIST document for calibrating &quot;liquid in glass&quot; (e.g. mercury, alcohol) thermometers, a proper ice bath requires ice that is the consistency of &quot;snow cone&quot; ice. <a href="https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/calibrations/sp819.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/calibrations/sp819.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/calibrations/sp819.pdf</a></a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If they are submersible, then the best two points to test them are the freezing and boiling points of water.  To be the most accurate, you will have to use distilled water, but tap water really isn't bad to use.  If you are at a high altitude, you may have to correct for that at the boiling point.  To test the freezing point, coarsely crush ice and fill a glass halfway with it.  Pour water to the top and stir viciously for a while adding ice as necessary. When you stop stirring, quickly dip the sensor into the water. Make sure that the sensor isn't touching the ice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.nws.noaa.gov/directives/sym/pd01013002curr.pdf" target="_blank">This</a> is the National Weather Services' document on weather station standards. Note the bit on page 7 about selection of sites for weather stations, first off.</p>
<p>Page 9 addresses calibration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All temperature measuring instruments should be issued with a certificate confirming compliance with the appropriate performance specification and accuracy; or be issued with a calibration certificate which gives the corrections that are applied to meet the required accuracy. This initial testing should be performed by an accredited calibration laboratory or a national testing institution.</p>
<p>The NWS, Office of Observations (OBS), requires traceability of the performance of temperature measuring instruments which are immersed in temperature bath and evaluated in parallel with precision reference thermometers (i.e., Rosemont Model 162CE SPRT) in accordance with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidelines. The bath enables testing from -80ºC to +55ºC.</p>
<p>These tests are followed by whole system testing (for electronic instruments) inside a walk-in environment chamber. The final phase of testing requires instruments to be evaluated outdoors alongside reference thermometers for a minimum of six months. The uncertainty (i.e., accuracy) in the readings of the NWS reference instruments is estimated in accordance with the National Conference of Standards Laboratory Report RISP-5, to be ±0.01ºC at 95% confidence level, k=2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there are some pretty specific parameters for siting, as well as calibration, and the calibration conditions.</p>
<p>Interestingly, humidity is a bit easier (and more accurate) than one might think.  The consumer-level stuff (a polymer that changes length based on uptake of moisture) is pretty sloppy, but sling psychrometry (or using the equivalent dry/wet bulb thermometer combination where the sling is replaced with a fan blowing air across the wet bulb) in conjunction with <a href="https://www.d.umn.edu/~tzhu/geog1414/LAB5FIG2.jpg" target="_blank">tables</a> is much more accurate than dial-type hygrometers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The readings might actually be accurate. Temperature itself does not necessarily have to be the same everywhere in a room. Warm air settles on top in closed rooms and when rooms are open and the difference with outside temperature is large enough, you can get very interesting convection patterns.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
