		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neurodivergence is a broad category, and it doesn't mean that ADHD brains and autistic brains function the same way or can be treated with similar meds. Some people have both conditions at the same time, and the meds only work on the ADHD symptoms because autism affects the brain in different ways that don't respond to meds (so far).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ADHD, at least in some cases, has a partially chemical cause for the neurodivergence. As a result, you can use chemicals (ADHD drugs) to try to mitigate or suppress the underlying chemical cause.</p>
<p>We don't know what causes autism, so we don't know what chemical tweaks would treat it. If we discover that, we may well get an autism drug.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neurodivergent just means &quot;the brain functions differently from the norm&quot;. So that includes essentially every known and unknown psychological condition.       </p>
<p>And, of course, knowing how one part of the brain works with respect to one condition doesn't mean we automatically know everything else there is to know about the brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
