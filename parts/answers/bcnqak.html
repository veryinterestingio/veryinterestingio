		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fresh meat/muscle does twitch even without sprinkling salt or anything on it.</p>
<p>The way you react to a stinging sensation is usually done instinctually and skips the brain, that's why fish without their head can still violently move even without guts: <a href="https://youtu.be/AWB3aOX_h4Y" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/AWB3aOX_h4Y</a> The impulse is sent through the spine.</p>
<p>If the marine animal is alive with a cut, it can overcome the instinct to violent twitch when coming into contact with seawater and they often do. Just look at creatures which are hunted at sea and have a ton of cuts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nearly every animal will reflexively twitch in the scenario you are asking about as this is an evolutionary protective response. However, I suspect what you're really inquiring about is how salinity affects the muscles of marine animals which have evolved to survive in a high salinity environment, likw the ocean.  In short, the answer is yes - even a dead marine animal will move with salt applied to flesh in some cases as it is a far higher concentration than what said animal's body will normally contain. I believe their kidneys are evolved to actually remove the saline levels from ingested salt water to nearly the same level as non-marine animals. Really what's happening is the triggering of neurons in the muscles via a very well known biological mechanism for how neural cells create electrical potential for signaling you have studied in school, known as the Sodium-Potassium pump.</p>
<p>Here's an even creepier video of a dish served in Japan which is made of a freshly killed squid which literally gets up and starts dancing when soy sauce is poured on it: </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I doubt it, since they would likely be osmoconformers, meaning the osmolarity (solute in their body) is similar to that of what they live in, I donâ€™t think it would have the same effect as on an animal who actively regulates its solute contents in its body like a terrestrial vertebrate ( like us or cows)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Muscles move by contracting, and they contract by means of ion channels that are affected by ionic molecules like salt. The ionic molecules messes with the ion channels that contract the muscle fibers, and therefore the muscle overall starts twitching uncontrollably when salt or other ionic molecules, like potassium chloride are sprinkled in.  </p>
<p>Muscles are just like those fake lightsabers that telescope out, only with one extension per fiber. Imagine you put lube on the extensions or jammed it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
