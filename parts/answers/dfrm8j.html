		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A flyby only requires acceleration to escape velocity from earth, then some more to send the craft on its way.  A lander or orbiter also requires massive fuel with the spacecraft to slow it down again as it approaches the target, and to match orbits with the target. It's not technically that much harder, it's just that the fuel weighs so much, and reduces experiments, sensors, and whatnot that they could take with them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The ELI5 answer is, you're flying at these planets/moons super fast, and to land on them you'd have to slow the fuck down. But in space things don't stop unless you use a ton of fuel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are missing  intermediary steps with orbiters and stationary lander.</p>
<p>First compare a flyby and a orbiter. New horizon passed by Pluto at a speed of around 14km/s you can compare that to orbital speed for low earth orbit that is 7.8km/s or even better to orbital speed around our moon that is at around 1km/s.<br />
So you need to reduce  the speed by 23km/s. A rocket that launches stuff into low earth orbit only need to accelerate by a bit less then 10km/s. The atlas V that launched it from the ground only . So the acceleration  to get into obit around Pluto is close the total amount that was needed to get there from the surface of earth. The probe only had internal fule to accelerate 0.29km/s  or 1/100 of what was needed for orbit.  </p>
<p>So we can launch stuff that is large enough to have enough fule to slow down and get into orbit  and at the same time travel there in a resonable time that in this case was 9 years. So the only option was a fly bye or nor mission at all.</p>
<p>For the planets Saturnus and closer we have launched orbiters that have stayed around them and visited the moons. The moons might just be flyby because to get into orbit require more fuel then just a flyby and you have a limited amount of fuel so the number of maneuver are limited.</p>
<p>Now for a orbiter vs lander comparison.  A lander with a rover or not will provide a lot more data of the location they land but just for that location where a orbiter get more data but for the whole planet and moons. So it is a very precise  data for a single point or data for the whole planet.<br />
So both is done and initially you use orbiters to get a overview and then you might know where landing is a good idea and how to land.   A orbiter is cheaper then a lander because you do not need to build the complex lander. A stationary lander smaller and cost less then a rover that can operate for a longtime.<br />
You can look at earth and ask why we have weather satellites and other earth observation satellites when we can be on the ground. Some data you can only get from orbit and you can get data from larger ares quite simple. The same is true on other planets.</p>
<p>For the gas gigants landing is not a option because there is not ground to land on or at least none where any probe can survive. So &quot;lander&quot; is a short singe observation and it had been done with the Huygens probe in Saturnus.</p>
<p>The rover on mars have not traveled far. Opportunity that if I am not mistaken have the record of 45.16 kilometers (28.06 miles) after 15 earth years when  last contact was made so it is very small areas you can examine.</p>
<p>So flybys are a lot cheaper and something the only option for a resonabel travel time. Orbiters are better then just a single flyby and you can do flybys of a loot of moon on Jupiter and Saturnus on a single mission.<br />
Leanders provide more data of one location and not data or everywhere else where a orbiter have less data of perhaps the whole object. So what you do depend on the goal</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For most planets we don't have a big enough rocket to send a large probe in a timely manner.</p>
<p>The 500 kg New Horizons probe was launched on an Atlas V 551 which can send 19 tons into orbit, but because it would need to be going fast to catch up to Pluto it couldn't be too heavy or the rocket couldn't get it up to speed</p>
<p>If you make your payload twice as heavy then you need a rocket that has twice as much fuel to get it to the same speed. Landers are big so they'd require a lot of fuel, and slowing down to land will require even more. We just don't have big enough rockets to land large rovers on most of the outer system moons</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cuz they're more expensive and way harder to plan, lower chance of success, it's basically a way bigger risk. For gas giants like Saturn, Jupiter etc there isn't much &quot;land&quot; it's just really really thick atmosphere so the rover doesn't got much to rove on... Also the further away from Earth you go, the harder it is to communicate and control the rovers, so a fly-by which is pre planned is way more efficient.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
