		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Australia we're currently in peak flu season, and there's been a huge drop in flu diagnoses. For the month of May last year there were more than 30,000 cases, this year only just over 200!</p>

<p>Edit: the number of people needing hospitalisation for flu has been historically low at only 12 for the entire season, and only one needing ICU. 12!!!</p>

<p>Report number 6 is my reference.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Caveat that 2019 was a record flu season so the comparison is more dramatic. However there was an early flu surge in January 2020 suggesting we could have been in for a similarly bad season this year, and the cases have dramatically dropped since social distancing measures!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
