		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. Decomposition is a biochemical process. That means it requires the presence of other chemicals (namely oxygen in the air) and other biological life forms (bacteria and other macroscopic scavengers).</p>
<p>You might partially decompose as a result of the bacteria in your own body, but only for a very short amount of time before they, too, die or go dormant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Decay changes when in a vacuum. A body free-floating in space would be exposed to a large amount of radiation and the composition of the body would change as the organic compounds break down into their lower constituents. </p>
<p>A body shielded from radiation would be well preserved, however.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would decompose, but from a different process.</p>
<p>Ionizing radiation from the sun would eventually break down all of the complex molecules   if it were shielded, it could last until the sun became a red giant.</p>
<p>If it were outside of the solar system it would take a really really long time, but it would eventually break up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They'd be some limited bacterial decay. The body would keep some bacteria, mainly anaerobic ones, alive for a limited time before the effects of vacuum killed them or forced them into an inactive state.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
