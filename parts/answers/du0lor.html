		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that tissue starts looking blue due to a lack of oxygen for the same reason that veins look blue. That answer is because when oxygen is reduced, the fraction of the deoxygenated form of hemoglobin (deoxyhemoglobyn) in blood increases. But this answer doesn't really go that far since contrary to what many people believe, deoxyhemoglobin by no means looks blue. In fact, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/yusNqKv.jpg" target="_blank">it actually looks like an even darker red than the oxygenated form of hemoglobin (oxyhemoglobin).</a> </p>
<p>To get the real answer you need to consider how light interacts with tissue to produce the color you see. As white light hits your skin and goes into your veins/arteries, some of it will be scattered and absorbed at various points along the way. It turns out that for skin red light can penetrate more deeply than blue light. As a result, more red light can reach the blood where it will be absorbed. This absorption removes a major component of the red part of the white light spectrum, so that the light that makes it back to your eyes can look more blue.</p>
<p>Now whether tissue will look red or blue in the presence of blood vessels will depend on a number of factors, including the depth of the vessels and the level of oxygenation. If the vessels are deeper, then the effect due to scattering described above tends to increase the likelihood that the vessels will appear blue. By contrast more superficial blood vessels (e.g. in you lips) are more likely to appear red. However, if the fraction of deoxyhemoglobyn increases, then this can amplify the effect of absorbing red light. That is the reason why veins at the same depth as arteries are more likely to look blue. It's also the reason why when blood is depleted of oxygen even tissue that normally looks red (e.g. your lips) can start to acquire a bluish tint.  </p>
<p>By the way I kind of glossed over the actual details involved in light transport in tissue because it's kind of an involved discussion, but for more details you can take a look at this paper:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Beer-Lambert Law. </p>
<p>Red blood cells contain hemoglobin. A hemoglobin molecule can hold 4 oxygen molecules. Hemoglobin absorbs/reflects different wavelengths of light depending on how saturated with oxygen the hemoglobin is. Your eyes pick that up light spectrum as pink, blue, ashy grey, etc.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Low oxygen blood is a darker color than oxygenated blood.  When the low oxygen blood is in capillaries near the skin where the flesh is very thin,  such as the lips or the fingernail beds, the light shining through the capillaries and tissue makes the darker blood look blue.  You don't see the effect when you're cut,  because as soon as the blood is exposed to the atmosphere it takes up oxygen and turns bright red.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the way lights scatters through a meat/muscle without blood means that a lot of blue light is reflected back. It happens due to 2 factors: sub-surface-scattering and IOR (index of refraction). Light is absorbed differently through different materials. Muscle with blood, had a different IOR that muscle without blood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
