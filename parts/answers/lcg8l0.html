		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi everyone! Thanks so much for joining us today! I have read that most vaccines are targeting the spike protein, and that we have seen mutations arise, but so far none that seriously impact vaccine efficacy. Would mutations need to specifically alter the spike protein in order to cause Sars-CoV-2 to escape a vaccine? Or are there other mutations you could envision that would also lead to vaccine escape? Thanks!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Some big questions I often see around Reddit:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you had to choose a vaccine, which one would it be?</li>
<li>Do vaccines slow/stop transmission? </li>
<li>What's the threshold of vaccination until we can return to normalcy? When will we see that?</li>
<li>Are anti-vaccine groups a major concern?</li>
</ol></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi there and thank you for doing this!</p>
<p>My partner has doubts about the vaccine and I'd love to point them to some research that dispels or provides context on the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Are side effects from the vaccine being published? Are long term effects possible?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Is I receive the vaccine, is it still possible for me to infect someone else? </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Where can I find the latest documentation / research regarding the vaccine? I'd like to use data to fight disinformation and the anti vax conversation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
