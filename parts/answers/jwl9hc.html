		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually trial data is evaluated by an independent group. The results are tabulated and presented in full to the FDA. That application is available to the public, so anyone can re-run their statistics if they wish. Materials such as blood draws or any excess information that is not pertinent to the specific drug can be held back (and often is for the benefit of future research of the company running the trial).</p>
<p>The FDA demands quite a bit of information and makes their decision on approval based off that data. That decision is made with experts reviewing the methodology of both the trial itself and the statistics used to evaluate efficacy. The strength of the results is weighed against current best care practices and if a drug looks like it can help, it's approved. The one thing I would like to stress is that the FDA review process is incredible exhaustive. And once a drug is presented for approval, you can't change anything about it. Not what the drug is, not the way it's produced, not the way its quality checked, not even the way it's packaged without submitting the changes for another review. If you hold anything back, the FDA gets very upset, and that can lead to not only losing approval, but huge fines, prison terms, and having a very very hard time ever getting another drug approved. </p>
<p>The risk of putting a drug application out without disclosing all data or without analyzing it to the best methods available is usually far greater than the benefit. And again, trial data that is used to evaluate efficacy is available to the public and therefore review from peers and non-peers alike.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On a side note, peer review may not be what you think it is. The reviewers are not really trying to ensure that the results are correct, just that the process and people are credible and the subject is relevant. It's more of a sniff test than a detailed confirmation. In particular, it does very little to detect intentional deception, which would be a concern for drug approvals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Peer review happens for a publication. The FDA reviews, but it's not called peer review.</p>
<p>They write up in the publication, usually around 3-5 pages and describe succinctly what they did, how they did it, what their results were, and how they interpret it. The reviewers examine the paper to see if their methods were appropriate for their studies, their results seemed complete, their results couldn't be explained by something else going on, and that their interpretation is correct. They then provide feedback on the paper as a whole, any issues they noticed, and what the writers could do to improve the paper.</p>
<p>Paper<br />
Is the sky blue?<br />
I looked at the sky. I took a few photos of the sky with my camera. Here are two of the 250 representative photos. I ran those photos into a photo processing program that could assess that thing were blue.<br />
Here are graphs of how blue the sky is. Most photos are blue. Some are not blue.<br />
I conclude that the sky is blue</p>
<p>Reviewers, consisting of two photographers and one person who used to work at Kodak<br />
You need to use multiple cameras to test this. You need to take a photo of a white piece of paper to ensure your camera isn't blue biased. Your photo processing system uses 8 bit colors; you need more bits. You only took 250 photos. You  need more. You concluded the sky was blue, but you really only showed the sky is sometimes blue. Fix these problems and get back to us.</p>
<p>FDA submission<br />
Here is a list of our camera, and all specifications of the camera, the wiring diagrams, the microchips, documents verifying calibration, etc. Here are all of our photos in raw form. Here is the output and all of the intermediate output for the photo processing software. Here is the source code. Here is how every single photo was classified on the 8 bit scale, plotted for each individual photo. Here are all of our notebooks documenting the process, signed and dated. Here are the resumes of every single person who worked on this project. Here are all of the documents describing each individual process such as how we took a photo, moved it onto the computer, etc.</p>
<p>FDA panel consisting of engineers that made cameras, photographers, software developers, PhDs in image processing, atmospheric scientists, meteorologists, statisticians review it.</p>
<p>The FDA rarely rejects this. Preparing these things is incredibly time consuming and expensive. Companies don't submit them until they're pretty sure the FDA will approve. Things may be accelerated a bit with an EUA, but the FDA process is fairly rigorous. They do sometimes screw up, as the experts sometimes downplay things that should be more important which becomes obvious at a later time. But for the most part, they do a good job.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you're conflating two different things here - peer review relates to the <em>publication</em> of the study results, not the drug approval process (e.g. review and approval by the FDA and EMA). </p>
<p>Regulatory agency submissions are very extensive and pretty much <strong>all</strong> the data the drug company has (from all their clinical and preclinical studies, published and unpublished) will be submitted to support the application for approval. </p>
<p>All publications in a medical journal are peer reviewed in some shape or form - something like COVID vaccine results are pretty important and are pretty much guaranteed to be published in a high tier journal (New England Journal of Medicine or The Lancet). Peer review of drug trials in these journals usually means review by 2 or 3 experts in the field, as well as review by a specialist statistician, who will make suggestions on how the publication could be improved (or tell the journal not to publish it if something looked very 'off'). This peer review applies only to this specific publication.</p>
<p>Peer review is very unlikely to fundamentally change the results of a study, but the reviewers might suggest alternative interpretations that should be considered, or additional analyses that should be included. The primary endpoint of a study like this (vaccine protective efficacy) is set in stone (all the statistical analyses will be designed around it), so it's super unlikely that that result would change without a new cut of data from the trial. It's also important to note that the publication will focus on the results from this trial only, and will only include the data that are essential to interpret the study (versus the entire body of data available to regulatory agencies), and some data may be held back to be included in future publications</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Clinical trials are undergone according to a specific set of protocols and are divided into 4 major phases of testing. In the intial phases these trials must establish the saftey of the drug, procedure, or other treatment in question. The objective of the 3rd phase is to establish the efficacy of the treatment and must involve 1000 - 3000 subjects in multiple major world centres. Upon completing the 3rd phase the trial is submitted to the regulatory agencies of each individual country which wishes to use the treatment (in the case of the US this is the Food and Drug Administration). The FDA has a review process in which the Clinical Trial is reviewed by Doctors, Chemists, Pharmacologists, Statisticians, and other experts as required. This is not &quot;peer-review&quot; strictly speaking, however, the claims put forth by scientists in clinical trials are stringently evaluated by experts in the field.The final stage of any clinical trial, phase 4, is the use of the treatment by the general population during which any adverse effects must be duely reported to the regulatory bodies. This is called Pharmacovigilance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
