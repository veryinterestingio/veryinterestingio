		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes it will use ~30% more energy to run the same distance. </p>
<p>Letâ€™s say walking is 5km/h and running is 10km/h.
Walking would use ~340kJ of energy, where as Running would use ~480kJ. </p>
<p>Literally a study from 2004 with those walk/run speeds over 1600m:

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So it depends.</p>
<p>You are always using energy at rest, simply to keep your body functioning and warm. Standing uses 100-200 calories per hour.</p>
<p>Walking somewhere at a comfortable pace uses about 200 calories per hour.</p>
<p>Jogging uses 400-700 calories per hour.</p>
<p>So you need to sum up the baseline calories that you always burn over time + the exertion calories and depending on the relative speed it could be:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>About the same if you're not working too hard running. You'll burn a bit more running, but not loads more. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More from running if you're running fast. </p>
</li>
<li>More from walking if you walk so slowly that the baseline calories from the time are significant. (E.g you walk for 10 hours something you can run in 30 minutes).</li>
</ol>
<p>Running of course has other benefits:</p>
<p>If you only have an hour to exercise - you'll burn a lot more in the hour running than walking.</p>
<p>Running is good from a cardiovascular health point of view.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/22450611_Caloric_cost_of_walking_and_running" target="_blank">More energy is expended in general</a>. Technically, if your running is really close to your walking, the difference might be negligible, but if you're going twice as fast, your body won't be as efficient. For instance, let's say you're driving your car. The difference of fuel expended driving 45 mph instead of 50 mph might be negligent compared to going 50 mph to 100 mph. It isn't necessarily linear in that sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OP, when talking energy balances, you must look at DIFFERENCES, and remove the baseline.</p>
<p>If you spend 160W normally and 230W on an exercise and 300W on a heavier exercise, the difference is 70W for the 1st, 140W for the 2nd. So the real calorie difference from one to the other is double. </p>
<p>Ignore the baseline as that's fixed costs, sort of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It also highly depends on the individual. As you improve at running, you actually become more efficient and therefore reduce the required calories.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
