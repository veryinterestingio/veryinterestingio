The bright flame is the wax burning off of the wick like any liquid fuel would. So the wax is consumed in the burning process. The wick only burns away at the point beyond where the wax burns off, as the liquid wax flowing up it insulates it from the flame.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Seems very familiar. The wick doesn't really burn much at all, except for a tiny bit for an instant while it's lit and the very top little bit that's not saturated with liquid wax. The wick is for the most part, overwhelmingly, simply a channel of flow of the melted liquid wax, which is what is burning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Candle wax is mostly made of a long chain hydrocarbon, a molecule made of hydrogen and carbon, which when burned with oxygen turns into water vapor (hydrogen and oxygen) and carbon dioxide (carbon and oxygen). Solid wax doesn’t burn, unfortunately, but a burning wick will melt wax and draw the liquid up into the wick where it can burn as fuel. The wick mostly is ash, held in shape by the wax in it; as the candle burns lower the waxless end of the wick burns up completely</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The wick DOES burn to ash, but only the little bit at the top where the melted wax doesn't reach.   </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The rest of it is really just a channel for the liquid wax fuel to...  Well, <em>wick</em> up towards the flame, where it gets burned instead of the wick itself.  But obviously that only works so long as there's still wax to burn, and the wax only gets so far up the wick before being consumed.  So as the wax level gets progressively lower, there's a tiny little bit of the wick, right up at the top, that constantly gets burned away as the wax can no longer reach that high.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
