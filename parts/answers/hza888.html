<p>I am a surgeon and I see the underside of the belly button (umbilicus) all the time during umbilical hernia repairs. It's really just skin. Yes, it connects to fascia (the abdominal wall muscles) with the &quot;umbilical stalk&quot;, and there are the umbilical ligaments connected to it as other people have mentioned. But the little belly button itself can be lifted off and the underside is just skin.</p>
<p>This is a really neat video where you can see that: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuJmVaeHAcY" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuJmVaeHAcY</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This causes some people to feel a tingle in their privates or groin area when they tickle their Belly Button.</p>
<p>It also is where the roots of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TO8gAvl59Kw" target="_blank">Belly Button Trees</a> grow.</p>

<p>(NSFW maybe? Itâ€™s an anatomy drawing)</p>
<p>This is what your abdominal wall looks like from the inside. The umbilicus is your belly button. So, strictly speaking, the back side of it is just a knot of flesh. The median umbilical ligament goes from the umbilicus to the bladder, and the round ligament (not labeled on this picture) goes from the umbilicus up toward your liver</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I always wanted to know what would happen if no one cut/tied up the cord? How did we know to or why did we start to do that? Did we always? Were babies sometimes born and just stayed cuddling the whole cord and sack until it rotted off? Could they bleed out from it? What do people who live in tribes in the woods do?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
