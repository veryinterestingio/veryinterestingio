		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s hard to go into specifics without knowing both vaccines inside out, but in general:</p>
<p>mRNA is relatively unstable and easily broken down, as it should be in the body. <del>On average, natural mRNA’s produced by your own cells have a half life of less than 5 minutes.</del> 5 minutes is the half life of mRNA in yeasts, human mRNA seems to be quite a bit more stable. Thanks for the correction u/tulipseamstress and u/nunmaster for being critical.</p>
<p>An obvious way to increase the half-life of mRNA is by freezing it to extremely low temperatures, as this lowers reaction rates of all kinds, including breakdown rates. </p>
<p>However, you can also change the molecular structure of the mRNA to increase its stability and make it resist breakdown by enzymes. This adds complexity to the design stage and potentially during the production stage, but would make it easier to distribute.</p>
<p>So without any insider knowledge on either vaccine, my best guess would be that the Moderna vaccine has more stability designed into it, whilst the Pfizer vaccine was easier to design and produce.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two things.   First, Pfizer's has not been <em>tested</em> to the same temperatures that Moderna's has.   It is possible, they are testing now, that it will have the same storage requirements.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2259821-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-may-not-need-to-be-kept-at-70c-after-all/" target="_blank">https://www.newscientist.com/article/2259821-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-may-not-need-to-be-kept-at-70c-after-all/</a></p>
<p>Second, the New York Times article from today states that if there is a difference, it will be based on how each uses &quot;fat&quot; to stabilize the vaccine.</p>
<p>&quot;An additional concern is that both vaccines must be stored and transported at low temperatures — minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit for Moderna, and minus 94 Fahrenheit for Pfizer — which could complicate their distribution, particularly to low-income areas in hot climates. Although both vaccines are made of mRNA, their temperature requirements differ because they use different, proprietary formulations of fat to encase and protect the mRNA, Ray Jordan, a Moderna spokesman, said.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Analytical scientist for biotech here. I run a lot of testing for drug product stability studies at my company so I can speak to this.</p>
<p>To determine storage conditions for your DP (drug product), you will typically do a long term stability study where you have your DP kept at various temperatures; usually -80 C, -20, 4, maybe 25 and/or 37. You pull a vial (or several, depending on which assays you need to run) for testing from each condition and then test for stability indicating attributes. I work in gene therapy, not vaccines, so I can't comment in more detail, but for example, if your drug is an AAV delivering a gene replacement payload, then you'll want to look at the purity of the capsid proteins (are the capsids breaking down?), potency (is the transgene expressed at the same level when you dose cells on a plate?), genome titer (is the DNA in the virus stable?), etc.</p>
<p>Based off the results of your stability study, you can set storage conditions; for example, if everything stays comparable to t0 until, say, the 6-month time point, at which point potency drops for the -20 and above conditions, then you would set the storage temp to -80, or say &quot;4 months (assuming that's the next earliest timepoint) at -20&quot;, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a phd&amp;MD, and we run a lyophilization lab. Many of our former post docs work at Pfizer and moderna. Stability of dried nucleic acids is particularly difficult because the freezing step isn’t fast enough in most commercial lyophilizers to prevent aggregation (mRNAs are small and when nucleation point occurs and freezing happens....mRNAs will rapidly aggregate). Usually FDA etc allows only a certain percentage of a dose to be aggregated (even though aggregation doesn’t necessarily affect efficacy). Therefore the excipients and conditions required to dry these formulations are very difficult to optimize. Storage stability studies also take a long time (years) as you have to test them just being stored at various conditions. From those I know at these companies, these are the primary issues with the current storage conditions required by both companies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
