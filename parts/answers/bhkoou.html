		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you look closely, many trees are surrounded by saplings. Most won’t make it to maturity because there isn’t enough sunlight reaching them under the canopy of large trees. Sometimes, an old tree will die, allowing some saplings to grow until they become mighty and take the place of the dead tree. This type of “growth from death” happens in many ways. For example, some pine cones only open up when they get extremely hot during a forest fire. The fire revitalizes the nutrients in the soil and opens up the canopy, allowing light to reach the ground and new trees to grow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's actually the same process for most living things. The very <em>reason</em> that trees have so many seeds and frogs lay so many eggs is that most of them will die young (or as I prefer to think of it, go into the food chain and keep other living things alive).</p>
<p>When Darwin talked about 'survival of the fittest' he based this on the fact that most offspring die.</p>
<p>A seed must grow somewhere with good conditions. It must experience the right growing conditions (enough water, nutrients etc) and it must not be killed by being eaten, trodden on, or burned etc. </p>
<p>Trees will live to all different ages. From 500,000 seeds, only 100,000 may germinate (think of all those squirrels eating acorns), only 50,000 may make it to a year old, only 10,000 may make it to two years, 500 to three years, 100 to four years, 50 to five years, 10 to ten years, and 1 to 500 years (I made these numbers up, but less trees will get through each stage)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The right conditions basically. As you said many thousands of seeds are shed but only a few will make it into a tree and even fewer a mighty one. It basically comes down to where the parent tree is located. A tree needs lots of sunlight and the soil it stands in needs plenty of nutrients. The tree also needs water and the right climate which depends on the tree. There's also the issue of other competing trees who will battle over who gets the most sunlight and whose roots can cover the most area to get enough nutrients.
There's also the element of luck, maybe a big foresr fire breaks ut killing all trees, but the fire could also clear out the competition and a few trees survive and suddenly have free reign.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Speaking as a person that grows trees from seeds on purpose- The simplest answer is give the seed what it needs to germinate and support that juvenile growth.   </p>
<p>Seeds have different mechanisms to tell them they are in appropriate conditions.  For instance some seeds like American persimmon require cold stratification, IE they need to experience the conditions they would go through in the winter on the ground.  I put them in my refrigerator for a few months.<br />
Some seeds require warmth instead.  Some seeds have a very thick shell that requires sometimes years to break down enough so moisture can reach the seed inside (I cut or sand down parts of the shell to speed this up)   </p>
<p>Once the seed germinates, it has to stay in favorable conditions. It needs moisture, once the leaves open, then it needs sunlight to start producing food for itself because the energy in the seed itself will only last a limited time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of times it's the animals.</p>
<p>Squirrels gather up nuts and seeds and bury or stash them all over the place for the winter, they only find about half of them, the other half are in a good spot to grow into a tree.</p>
<p>Other animals exhibit behaviors like this as well, but a squirrel is a perfect example for your question. When the tree drops its acorns, they have very little chance to grow where they land, but mr squirrel is hapy to solve that problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
