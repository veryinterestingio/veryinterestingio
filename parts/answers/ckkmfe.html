		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First amendment plus fair use rules. They have very good lawyers and they play with the line but rarely cross it. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court has taken a very robust view of the right for satirists to use obscenity for purposes of humour. In Hustler Magazine v. Falwell they famously argued that saying Jerry Falwell had sex with his mother on the toilet was protected speech since robust political discussion can only happen when speech is protected even when outrageous and false, since to do otherwise might have a chilling effect on all speech.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>SNL, Key and Peele and every other skit based show does this too. They work on those shows because they’re parodies, which just wouldn’t work on most other shows. </p>
<p>For example, a fake Brad Pitt walking into the bar on How I Met My Mother just doesn’t do anything especially if it’s a no-named actor. Ben Stiller playing Tom Cruise on Celebrity Jeopardy from SNL works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
