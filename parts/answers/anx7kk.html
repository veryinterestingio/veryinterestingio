		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Constantino2's comments about pore space are basically correct, so I won't repeat those. </p>
<p>As for visible effects on the surface, there are lots of known cases of land deformation - mostly subsidence (sinking) - due to oil extraction. One of the first known cases was in Houston, which sunk several feet and is now a giant floody sag due to oil extraction in the 1920s. Same thing happened in California, Shanghai, the Yellow River Delta in China, and numerous non-coasal areas such as Iran where it doesn't have as dangerous impacts. It may damage buildings if land subsides inland, but extraction at the coastline is very problematic because it can cause flooding and greater storm surge penetration during hurricanes.</p>
<p>I would note that the degree of surface expression depends strongly on the depth of extraction. If the depths are very shallow (300 feet or so, as in parts of California), you can get extreme subsidence - like up to a foot per year. Cracked buildings, sunken roads, etc. Deep extraction (like 3000 feet) will have much less surface expression.</p>
<p>Source: have a PhD in Geology with a dissertation focused on land subsidence due to oil and groundwater extraction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>oil deposits are not huge caverns of empty space, rather the oil is sort of suspended in porous rocks, so its kind of like sucking water out of a sponge.</p>
<p>depending on conditions the rock may collapse without the oil supporting it, or water might migrate into the area, or we might even pump water (or something else) down to make the oil &quot;float&quot; up to extraction point.  Ultimately, its so deep, that any shifting that might occur is not felt on the surface.</p>
<p>As for the displacement... technically I affect the earths rotation when I throw a pebble, so sure, our extraction of oil certain produces an effect, it would be extremely small (and as it somewhat distributed around the globe, its somewhat balanced)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Netherlands, in the Northern province of Groningen, the mining of natural gas over the past decades has caused severe problems as the ground shifted, settled and sometimes collapsed. Since the Netherlands is not earthquake country, the numerous small tremors have caused all sorts of damages to buildings. As ever, it is difficult to get those responsible to pay out damages. Fortunately the mining company was government owned so the problem is one of political proportions and the current government has announced to wind down operations by the year 2025.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know the question is about oil, but there is a copper mine planned in Arizona where they were going to remove the rock and extract copper using robots and then basically blow it up to collapse the mine resulting in a pretty significant drop in the terrain of like 50ft or more over a fairly broad area of several acres. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked as an engineer on a project to extend the life of the Valhall offshore oil field in Norway, the remedial work was required because the seabed level had sunk 2m due to oil extraction. The guy that I rented my flat from had a PHD in geology he told me that the Ekofisk field, also in Norway originally had an expected &quot;Life&quot; of 20 years when 1st developed but due to further oil squeezing out of the surrounding rock this was extended by another 10 years and that the salt water content in the oil was significantly lower than when 1st developed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
