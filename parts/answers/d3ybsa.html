		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because VR headsets use special lenses (typically fresnel lenses) that distort light from upclose to make it look like its coming from further away.</p>
<p>It used to be bent such that the light appeared parallel, and thus coming in from infinite distance, but this has its own set of perculiar issues. Nowadays, the lenses are designed to make the light appear as though its coming from about 1-2m away. Which for people with short sightedness is enough to make it so they'll need perscription lenses to correct for it.</p>
<p>As an aside, the big insight that allowed for modern VR is that you could use cheap to manufacture lenses, create distortion and then fix it by using software to create the opposite distortion, allowing the virtual environment to be seen properly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wait is this why I cant read shit in VR? I just thought that the resolution was too low and I needed to wait for technology to catch up. Jesus christ it never dawned on me to put my contacts in im retarded. </p>
<p>First thing I do when I come home is try the VR with contacts. No way its actually clear I honestly cant grasp that</p>
<p>Edit: some people are asking for updates. Im sorry I got a fuckoff headache and just went to sleep. Will update as soon as possible</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, I'm working on my Master's in animation and stereoscopic technology, and there are some misconceptions in this thread. VR works by displaying two images (one for left eye and one for right) about ~1 inch away from the viewer's eyes. The slight shift in perspective between the two images is what creates the perception of depth. If you'd like a simple demo of how that works: hold your thumb in front of you in a thumbs-up. Focus on it with both eyes, then close your right eye, looking through your left; then swap so you're looking out of just the right eye. You should see slightly more of your fingerprint side or thumbnail side depending on which eye you look out of - this small difference is used in the brain to calculate the &quot;depth&quot; of your thumb.</p>
<ul>
<li>TL;DR Small differences in the left and right eye's images create the illusion of depth in the brain.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now in VR and 3D films, where you focus your eyes and where that depth is in physical space are not always the same. I'm going to try to break this down into words, but it's tricky, so please bear with me. When you look at a chalkboard in real life, you perceive the words on the chalkboard as the same depth as the chalkboard itself, because that's how vision works with human eyes. But in 3D, we intentionally mess with the positioning of images in the left and right view so that you perceive depth differently. If we re-imagine the chalkboard as a movie screen, sometimes you'll perceive a movie as having things &quot;fly off the screen&quot; or receding behind the walls of the screen's surroundings. The repositioning of the images tricks your brain into thinking the image you are seeing is actually several feet in front of/behind the physical location of the screen, even though the image is <em>still being projected at the original physical location</em>. So your eyes <strong>converge</strong> at the physical depth (aka the <strong>convergence plane</strong>) while your eyes <strong>focus</strong> on the fake depth. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/6wqwbD8" target="_blank">Here's a picture</a> from 3D Storytelling by Bruce Block to help explain. </p>
<ul>
<li>TL;DR Where your eyes converge in physical space is not the same as where they focus in 3D-perception space.</li>
</ul>
<p>So now we know that where your eyes converge in physical space is different from where your eyes actually focus. What does this mean for VR and vision irregularities? Let's review what causes near/far-sightedness. Depth perception problems are caused by the length of the eye as it relates to the position of the cornea and the retina/ocular nerve. Think of the cornea as a camera's lens and the retina as a camera's processing chip/film. If the distance between the lens and the retina is too long, the resulting picture will have blurriness at long distances - that's nearsightedness. A distance that's too short has blurriness up close - that's farsightedness. </p>
<ul>
<li>TL;DR: If you have long eyeballs, you need glasses for distance, and short eyeballs need glasses for reading.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's get back to VR. Though the screen may only be an inch away, that's where the eyes <strong>converge</strong> - the fake depth that the headset creates is where the eyes <strong>focus</strong>. As others have mentioned, VR is set for &quot;infinite distance&quot;, so farsighted individuals don't have a problem focusing on faraway objects in VR. For nearsighted folks, it's a different story. Their focus points are still processed in the brain as if they were actual objects in real life, so if you can't read an eye chart in reality, you can't read one in VR. The only way to correct this is to shorten the distance light travels between the eye's lens and retina. For that, we use corrective lenses - glasses and contacts! In theory, you could also build those into a headset, but it makes more sense to just use your own pair.</p>
<ul>
<li>TLLLDR: The closeness of the lenses in no way impacts the way the brain processes far-depth focus, so glasses are necessary in VR if you use them in reality.</li>
