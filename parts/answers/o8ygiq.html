		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everything is either soluble in oil/fat or water. Soap works by consisting of two-ended molecules: one end likes water, the other likes fat. When washing grease off with soapy water, the soap molecules will stick to the grease with their fatty ends, leaving the watery end outside. Voila, now the grease is water-soluble.</p>
<p>For viruses such as Corona, soap can even destroy the lipid (fatty) virus shells. It does that by offering stronger, more efficient bonds that the virus shell molecules will like to bind with even more than they like to be bound to the rest of the virus. (In expert's terms, it's because the virus is held together with weak non-covalent bonds, which is kind of like magnets sticking together. Bring a stronger magnet into the game, and you win the game of attraction.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Each soap molecule is like a string with a knot at one end. The string is “oily” (non-polar) and the somewhat polar H-O-H water molecules are not attracted anywhere near as much as the stringy parts are attracted a) to each other and b) to molecules of grease (also non-polar, like attracts like). Meanwhile the “knots” at the ends are polar (hold an electric charge separation) and that makes the ends attractive to water. That attraction is called hydrogen bonding and it is a big part of why life exists on our watery world. . In water, a group of soap molecules self assemble into spheres called micelles. The knotty ends all point outward toward the surrounding water and the oily strings form a gooey center. These micelles soak up bits of grease from the surroundings where oil and water don’t mix (an oily sheen on the surface is a layer of oils preferring their own kind) while the micelles are perfectly happy to disperse throughout the water. So soap is a great way to break up grease, soak it up, make it soluble (dissolvable), and able to be rinsed down the drain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Soap forms bonds with stuff on a microscopic level and then sloughs off with water.  (Shampoo does too but is the opposite charge to soap. Source: my highschool chemistry teacher)</p>
<p>It kills microrganisms by bonding with atoms in their cell wall, breaking them apart,  similar to hand sanitizer. </p>
<p>But it also removes detritus that isn't microrganisms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Soap is good at holding hands with gross stuff, but it also holds hands with water. Water usually isn't all that social, and doesn't like holding hands. So when the soap holds hands with both the water and with the gross stuff, the gross stuff gets pulled away when the water leaves, and goes down the drain with it.</p>
<p>Some of the gross stuff ends up on your hand towel too, because not all of the water leaves, until you dry off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
