		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The idea is based off the theory that people produce &quot;microexpressions&quot; that last fractions of a second, with the assumption being that we can read these microexpressions subconsciously. However, further study found that professionals trained in microexpressions had no higher odds of success than random chance. It's a debunked theory at this point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Malcom Gladwell's newest book demonstrates how dangerous it can be to believe you can read microexpressions. For example in court cases judges who look at defendants are more inaccurate then ones that simply review the cases. It's more dangerous to think that you can read people than to completely disregard it all together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Nope. No peer reviewed support for determining the veracity of statements a person makes by reading their faces. Doesn't work.</p>
<p>But also Lie Detectors are also pure theater. Cannot be used in US courts, no validity. Used as an interrogation tool.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I haven't seen it mentioned in the comments yet, but the protagonist Cal Lightman is loosely based on Paul Ekman who has publications in psychology on microexpressions. You'll see from the comments here that it's controversial / possibly debunked in more recent studies. (I'm not up to date in this field so I don't know what the general feeling is but would like to see some references.)</p>
<p>Two of Ekman's most cited articles:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's important as well to note that lie detectors don't really tell you if the person is lying. They can theoretically help identify emotional/stressful topics, but the device doesn't tell you if they are lying.</p>
<p>What the lie detector process does to identify the lie is...they ask questions. It's a marathon of questions. The same set of questions asked dozens of different ways while you are stuck in this uncomfortable arrangement with a person who acts like every last thing you say is a damning piece of evidence against you. And then once things have finally ended...they look at all of your answers to the questions and they compare them. If every time you answered a variant to question A, your answer changed meaningfully, then you are probably lying. If on question B your answers changed in small ways (ex: later remembering a tiny detail immaterial to the answer) but the bulk of the answer was always the same, then you are probably telling the truth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
