		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sweet. But, it has a fun chemical that gets produced naturally in the plant: menthol. Menthol activates a protein (TRPM8) in our nerve cells, which triggers the sensation of cold. So that's what leads to the unique &quot;taste&quot; of mint (similar to how hot peppers activate capsaicin receptors for heat/pain)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>when you eat something, you actually experience three different senses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taste is detected by the taste buds in the tongue and includes the 5 options in you listed.</li>
<li>Most of the flavor comes from retronasal olfaction, where the volatiles chemicals come off the food and travel up your throat and into the back of your nose where you smell them.</li>
<li>Then there is the trigeminal sensations. This is a broader category of other sensations your mouth experiences, namely heat, cold, astringency, and fizzyness. This sense gives information on actual temperature, however there are certain chemicals, (menthol, Capsaicin) that  trick your nerves into miss-reporting the temperature as colder or hotter than it really is.</li>
</ul>
<p>So when you eat mint, your tongue will send a signal of sweet and bitter, your nose will send a signal for the spearmint or wintergreen flavor, and the menthol will make the trigeminal nerve send the cold sensation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that we can taste 5 flavors but can detect thousands of aromas. Flavor perception is a combination of smell and taste. That's why you can't really taste things when you get a cold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
