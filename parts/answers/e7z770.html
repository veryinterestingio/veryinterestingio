		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can, but we seem more intent on chopping down the trees and turning them into paper. (which then goes into landfills, which we bury under the ground)   Nonetheless, if you bury a tree in the ground, the fungus will eat it and turn a lot of it back into CO2.  All the dead organic matter builds up in soil anyway.  Also, trees are a slower than the algae/bacteria that we use to sequester carbon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
