		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It IS cleaner. Bacteria that break down organics and cause rot are dormant in the cold. That means things that would normally be breaking down and releasing smells like dead animals, leaves, trash, etc. are not breaking down. Your sense of smell isn't affected but there's less in the air to smell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I hate being cold. But there's something about a cold, void breeze running across you that just feels so humbling. It's so silent out in the country. Nothing going on. It's like a closer feeling when you stare blankly into the stars and kind of get taken out of yourself and realize how small you are. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
