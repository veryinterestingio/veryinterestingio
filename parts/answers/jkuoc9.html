		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, thanks for doing this! Given how much information can be also understood from the lightcurves, was there an active reason to <em>not</em> show them in combination with the images themselves? Would that bias people too much towards saying something else was going on (or not going on) if they could also see dips in a lightcurve? Thanks again!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Also, I'm curious to know which was the most unexpected exoplanet you pulled out from your data: have you ever found something you really didn't expect to?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

While I read this I’m listening to a book about searching for intelligent life and habitable worlds in the universe. I’m jealous of and super interested in your work.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kepler was clearly an extremely successful exoplanet hunter. I get the impression that TESS has been less so, and that the initial expectations of numbers of detected exoplanets has been lower than expected, especially given the differential between the two fields of view. However, I'm not sure that my info on the TESS findings, both candidate and confirmed, are up-to-date. Do you know what the current candidate and confirmed numbers are for TESS, and the extent to which these are likely to increase? Also, am I right in thinking that TESS has a reaction wheel problem? Thanks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
