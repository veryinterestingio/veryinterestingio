		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a small muscle inside your ear attached to your eardrum.  It is very difficult to control voluntarily, but when you're stretching your other muscles you're also stretching that one.  It pulls on your eardrum to tighten it, your body's way of reducing loud noises to protect your delicate inner ear from damage.  Also, /r/earrumblersassemble would like to have a word with you.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is primarily due to the structure of your ears - when you yawn, stretch, or eat, a pressure regulating mechanism of the ear (Eustachian tube) opens up from its normally closed state and lowers the pressure; the opening of this mechanism then causes the surrounding sounds to flood your middle ear and makes it so that the sound doesnt reach/travel through &quot;full volume&quot; to wherever it is processed in the brain (temporal lobe).</p>
<p>Edit: My answer doesnt REALLY address the q OP posted; refer to the tensor tympani answers down below!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you chew, the tensor tympani muscle is flexed. This muscle inserts on the handle of malleus, which is this hammer like tiny bone transmitting the vibration of the eardrum to the other bones they deliver it to the cochlea. If you dampen the movement of that, you dampen perceived sound, hence preventing hearing the chewing noises loudly. When you yawn or stretch (deeply enough to stretch neck and jaw), you also move your jaw, this triggers that muscle and dampens perceived sound.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other responses explain this really well, but it's important to note that this <em>can</em> be a sign of something bad. What's known as a vasovagal reaction (when the vagus nerve gets agitated) can cause your brain to think it has low blood pressure and it will basically shut down hour ears and can cause tunnel vision and fainting.</p>
<p>Vasovagal reactions can occur when standing up suddenly or stretching. If your hearing is affected and you feel lightheaded or experience tunnel vision, it's a good idea to sit back down.</p>
<p>I had a vasovagal reaction about a month ago and fainted because I stood up and stretched suddenly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
