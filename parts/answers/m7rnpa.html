		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5: Imagine being an engineer designing a car. You know that the gas pedal can break in two ways. It can break so the car slows down or the car speeds up. You're job is to make sure that if it fails the car slows down. This is called &quot;fail-safe.&quot;</p>
<p>Nuclear reactors fail safe by requiring specific conditions to keep doing Nuclear Stuff TM. If you lose control of the reactor, the reaction stops so it is failing safely. Sure it's a mess, but you can clean up a safe mess.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modern reactors are very safe, because the physics that's going on inside them is pretty well understood.  Sure, things can go wrong, but things can go wrong with other sorts of power plants.  When something goes wrong, you shut the reactor off and wait.</p>
<p>The TEPCO plant at Fukushima was quite old, and all the cooling and backup power generation was underground, precisely to protect it from earthquakes.  Alas, it turned out bad when there was a tsunami.</p>
<p>Should the tsunami risk have been considered? Of course.  This plant was not safely designed, and it wouldn't be approved today.  Modern GenIV nuclear plants have to be passively safe, even with no power input, they don't malfunction.  Alas, anti-nuclear activists are greatly slowing deployment of nuclear plants in hopes that hydrogen fusion will be the power source of the future.  There isn't ever going to be enough &quot;green energy&quot; to run the entire Earth at a desirable standard of living.  Nuclear is a key component in addressing climate change.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nuclear Energy has a pretty extreme saftey oriented design   many of the plants running are only second generation.  Redundancy, proactive safety protocols go a long way.</p>
<p>I feel it is important to know some designs for nuclear are actually passively safe (fail safe). Currently, no commercial plants use these models but it is likely to be more heavily used, particularly in gen 4 reactors</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Talking from a US perspective:</p>
<p>Per US regulations for selecting a nuclear power plant site, you have to evaluate all natural hazards at that site, then design your plant to be protected at levels that exceed those standards. </p>
<p>As part of chapter 2 of a plant's safety analysis report, they need to perform studies on seismic events which could occur in the area. As part of chapter 3 they need to specify the safety systems and structures which must be protected from those events and how they will protect them.</p>
<p>All equipment in a nuclear plant that is vital to safe shutdown is classified as Seismic Category I, and must be designed to exceed the safe shutdown earthquake.</p>
<p>All equipment which is not required, but is located in the same area as safety equipment must be designed as Seismic Category I/M (one over M) or II or equivalent, which means that the equipment is allowed to stop functioning, but it must not break in such a way that it can damage safety equipment.</p>
<p>All seismic classified systems (I, I/M, II) must survive at least 10 OBE (operating basis earthquake - a lower level of earthquake that the plant is expected to continue operating).</p>
<p>So by identifying the worst case seismic events, reinforcing the seismic category 1 systems and testing those reinforcements on shaker tables or through complex computer modelling software, and ensuring seismic I/M or II equipment cannot break category I systems, the plant is ensured to have minimum required safe shutdown functions during an earthquake.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
