		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our body feels a feeling when its nerve receptors are triggered the way it is supposed to be triggered. Tiny hairs in our respiratory tracts are designed to trap foreign bodies and make us feel them so that we sneeze and push them out. For this our body inhales a lot of air so that it can exhale it all together forcefully in order to dislodge the particle and spray it outside which is basically what sneezing is. When you are about to sneeze and you don't, which is probably because these processes are somehow interrupted, maybe because of not inhaling a lot of air and holding it (what women do to silence their sneeze)...or maybe because the particle dislodged itself too early... In all the cases, the stimuli that triggered the response is still there, which continous to irritate you the way that it did, but if you were to sneeze properly when you were supposed to, the sensation would have disappeared. That is why starting to sneeze and not sneezing feels more uncomfortable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
