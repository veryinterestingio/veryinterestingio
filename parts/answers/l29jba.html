		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From the fact that actinides like uranium are naturally-occurring, we can deduce that natural nucleosynthetic processes can reach at least that high in mass (~240). The heaviest stable nuclide is lead-208.</p>
<p>So any stable nuclide can be produced somehow in nature. I'm not aware of any stable nuclides which don't occur naturally on Earth, albeit possibly in small amounts.</p>
<p>As for the possibility of heavier stable nuclides that we don't yet know about (for example, the <em>island of stability</em>), I'll reference our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/physics#wiki_nuclear_and_atomic_physics" target="_blank">FAQ</a>. But in summary, it's unlikely that there are any stable nuclides that haven't been discovered yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
