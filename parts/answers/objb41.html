		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other thing to keep in mind is that the speed of electricity is not the speed of electrons. There are 3 speeds to consider. One is the thermal motion of the electrons. Because electrons have very little mass (1/2000th of a proton, roughly), and because the thermal (kinetic) energy of particles at a given temperature is the same, that makes the speed of the random motion quite fast, around 1,000,000 km/h. So even though electrons would theoretically settle in a gravity field, the thermal motion would mix them up right away.</p>
<p>However, if you could actually track an electron in a wire that has some voltage on it, you would see that even with all that crazy zipping around, the electron would only drift very slowly down the wire, on the order of meters per hour. That speed is called the drift velocity. The reason why there is electricity coming out right away at the other end of the wire is that the wire is already full of electrons. If you put in one extra one on one end, you kick one out at the other end. Think of a 10 m long pipe full of marbles. Even if you put in an extra marble on one end really  slow, at the other end a marble will get pushed out right away</p>
<p>Last, how does that marble at the other end know that it’s being pushed out? The push basically travels through the chain of marbles. For the marbles it travels at the speed of sound in glass. For electrons it’s the repulsion between their negative charges, which travels roughly at the speed of light, but it’s actually a bit slower than the speed of light in a vacuum. This is the speed you will see if you look at how fast electricity travels, and it doesn’t really respond to gravity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a tube full of balls. You put in a Ball on the one side, which pushes all balls in the tube forward, making another ball fall out on the other side at the same time. This behavior will always be the same, no matter how long the tube is or which way it goes.</p>
<p>Now, this tube full of balls is your conductor, while electricity is the force that puts in a ball at one side.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think anybody has said this yet, but in most cases electricity flows in a circuit. A power cord has 2 wires. For every electron flowing up the cable there's an electron flowing down.</p>
<p>So even if gravity has a tiny effect on electrons in one direction it will have the opposite effect on electrons in the other direction and they will roughly even out because they push on each other to even things out.</p>
<p>This sort of &quot;cancelling out&quot; thing happens quite often in fields that are basically the same strength everywhere. Engineers like it because you can skip some really nasty math.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
