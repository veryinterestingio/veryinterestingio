		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>8 feet. Mirrors are interesting in that they preserve the angle of light which strikes it. So as light rays leave an object, they diverge over the four feet to the mirror. When they strike the mirror, that divergence is maintained, and then they diverge over a further four feet to your eyes. Thus your eye's focusing has to accommodate the full 8 feet of divergence.</p>
<p>If you took a picture of the object, and look at the picture, the light rays diverge from the picture. So if you were four feet away, your eyes have to handle the four feet of divergence. Your camera handled the rest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
