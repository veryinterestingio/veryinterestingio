<li>the more modes you use to experience something, the easier it is to memorize, adding sounds to an image increase the impression it is making</li>
<li>sounds have a temporal component, a distinct start, middle, and end, while images are just there...you can sustain a sound more easily by repeating it over and over, with an image there is no &quot;over and over&quot;, just raw concentration</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trying to answer your question requires thinking about a lot of very complicated brain processes that are not fully understood, so it’s hard to give you an ELI5 kind of answer. My best guess would be that our comprehension of words is more connected to internal speech than to internal mental imagery of words. It’s still connected to both though (don’t you normally visualize a word and/or the thing represented by that word when you repeat it in your head?). </p>
<p>When you are visually presented with some text and recognize the words, this process activates part of the brain called the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_word_form_area" target="_blank">fusiform gyrus</a>. Activity in this region then activates other regions that are connected to the fusiform gyrus. Some of these include networks involved in word comprehension (such as <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernicke's_area" target="_blank">Wernicke’s area</a>). These networks in turn connect to other networks that are involved in the production of inner speech (such as <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broca%27s_area" target="_blank">Broca’s area</a>). </p>
<p><strong>tldr:</strong> when you look at a word and recognize it during memorization, you inadvertently activate many other brain areas. Some of these include brain areas that are associated with inner speech. These are probably activated more strongly than visual areas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
