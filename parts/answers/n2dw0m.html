		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's called scale.  Its an oxide, and basically a layer of rust from the heat. It doesn't &quot;look rusty&quot;, but it indeed is a layer of iron oxide.   Every time you heat the metal, you loose some metal to oxidation because of the composition. Its mostly iron with some carbon and other things.  Forging temperatures require oxidizing flames (as in forced air) of sorts to make the flames hot enough to make metal malleable, and those oxidizing flames oxidize the metals themselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scale, hammerscale or mill scale, formed when hot iron reacts with oxygen in the air.</p>
<p>It is an iron oxide (mixture of oxygen and iron), similar to rust but different. There are several iron oxides of which rust is one, scale is actually a mixture of several. The iron-oxygen reaction takes place a bit differently due to the high temperatures at play.</p>
<p>It looks a bit different but has similar properties to rust. Although it provides some environmental protection, this outer layer on hot worked steel is generally undesirable. Most steel is taken through a pickling, flame cleaning, blasting, or some other cleaning process afterwards to remove it. </p>
<p>It's basically rust's cousin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surprised no one mentions how painful scale can be once it lands on your skin. </p>
<p>Spent 7 years working in an industrial forge. Scale is thin and if it lands on your skin it almost instantly cools and sticks to your skin. </p>
<p>Meaning not only did you suffer a fairly severe burn but now you have to peel the scale off your skin which removes any remaining living tissue with it.</p>
<p>I have my fair share of scale burn scars as a reminder of the 7 years I spent squishing metal for a living.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
