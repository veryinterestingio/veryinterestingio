<p>Then notating the equal a_i as y, we wish to maximize x = y^(a / y) with a fixed; differentiating wrt y gives ay^(a/y - 2)(1 - ln y), with stationary point at 1 = ln y =&gt; y = e; simple inspection shows that this is a maximum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's a cool discovery! Unfortunately I haven't been able to come up with an intuitive explanation, but here's a proof.</p>
<p>Suppose for the moment that n is fixed. The maximum of x must occur when all a(1), ..., a(n) are equal: Because if, for example, a(1) ≠ a(2), then let m be the midpoint (a(1)+a(2))/2, so a(1)a(2) &lt; m×m (because a rectangle of maximum area with fixed perimeter is a square), and we can do better by replacing both a(1) and a(2) by m. (Strictly speaking, this isn't a complete proof that a(1) = ... = a(n) maximizes x: I've merely shown that every other possibility <em>doesn't</em> maximize x. To complete the argument, we can use the fact that the function x is continuous with compact domain, so it must attain a maximum.)</p>
<p>Here's the associated visual: If you need to build an n-dimensional wireframe box, and the total length of wire you have to work with is (2^(n-1))a, then the maximum-volume box you can build is an n-cube with edge length a/n.</p>
<p>Anyway, whatever the maximum is, it satisfies a(1) = a(2) = ... = a(n). It remains only to find n.</p>
<p>Let p = 1/a(1), so that n = a/a(1) = ap. Instead of maximizing x we'll maximize log x (the maximum point of log x is the same as that of x, because log is strictly increasing). We have log x = log a(1) + log a(2) + ... + log a(n) = –n log p = – a p log p. But a is fixed, and the maximum of –p log p is at p = 1/e (equivalently, a(1) = e). Even under the constraint that ap be a natural number, the maximum occurs near 1/e (provided that a is large), so this explains why a(1) ends up close to e.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The problem is to find the maximum value of the function F(a<em><em>1</em></em>, a<em><em>2</em></em>, ..., a<em><em>N</em></em>) = a<em><em>1</em></em>a<em><em>2</em></em>...a<em><em>N</em></em> subject to the constraint that a<em><em>1</em></em> + a<em><em>2</em></em> + ... + a<em><em>N</em></em> = a, where a is some fixed constant.</p>
<p>(We also want to find the maximum value of F only for positive arguments.)</p>
<p>This is straightforward calculus problem which can be solved using the method of Lagrange multipliers. The domain of F is some section of a hypersurface in N dimensions, in the region where all variables are non-negative. On the boundary of this domain, at least one of the variables is 0, and so F = 0 on the boundary. Since the domain is compact, the maximum <em>does</em> exist and is achieved at some critical number not on the boundary of the domain.</p>
<p>Since the function and constraint are invariant to all transpositions (swapping two variables), there should be a critical number where all of the variables have the same value. But there could be other critical numbers. In any event, we can verify this easily. </p>
<p>The critical number satisfies the equations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>F/a<em><em>1</em></em> = λ</p>
<p>F/a<em><em>2</em></em> = λ</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>F/a<em><em>N</em></em> = λ</p>
<p>a<em><em>1</em></em> + ... a<em><em>N</em></em> = a</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are just the standard equations for finding critical numbers with constraints. The number λ is the Lagrange multiplier. Since we can assume all of the a<em><em>k</em></em>'s are non-zero, λ is also non-zero, and the above equations simplify to just</p>
<blockquote>
<p>F/λ = a<em><em>1</em></em> = a<em><em>2</em></em> = .... = a<em><em>N</em></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus each variable has the value a/N, and so the maximum value of F is just</p>
<blockquote>
<p>F<em><em>max</em></em> = (a/N)^(N)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The number <em>e</em> does not have anything to do with this problem. For instance, the maximum product of 100 numbers whose sum must be 100 is just (100/100)^(100) = 1. The maximum product of 3 numbers whose sum must be 2 is (2/3)^(3) = 8/27.</p>
<p>If you want to somehow get <em>e</em> into the picture, then there has to be some relationship between <em>a</em> and <em>N</em>. For instance, if <em>a</em> = <em>N</em> + 1, then the maximum product has limit <em>e</em> as N --&gt; infinity. That is, consider the product of <em>N</em> numbers whose sum is <em>N</em> + 1. The maximum product occurs when each number is just 1 + 1/N, and the product itself is (1 + 1/N)^(N), and this product tends to <em>e</em> as <em>N</em> --&gt; infinity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This strikes me as remarkably similar to the definition of e in the first place:</p>
<p>e = lim_{n -&gt; inf} (1 + 1/n)^(n)</p>
<p>This is usually framed as an interest problem -- suppose you have the choice to apply 100% interest once a year, versus 50% interest twice a year, or 25% interest 4 times a year... in the limit, if you divide the multiplier as thinly as possible, you end up with a de facto interest rate of e ~= 2.71. </p>
<p>It seems like this is almost exactly the problem you're solving -- you want to spread out a fixed sum into the maximum possible multiplier. So of course you're going to run into e somewhere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
