		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Remember that those arrows are the trend, not the rule.</p>
<p>When we look at the orbitals we notice that all valence shells are filled with the exception is the 6s shell with 1 electron. S shells are relatively likely to lose an electron <em>but</em> higher energy shells are filled (5d &amp; 4f) meaning it's more likely to gain an electron then having an empty low energy shell</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>gold fills the 5d10 orbital and leaves an empty space in the 6s orbital. Since 5d orbitals are filled up, the next orbital which is 6s orbital (filled later but closer to the positive nucleus) has higher a tendency to pull electrons in compared to the elements before gold.</p>
<p>The arrows you see are just general trends. In the end, what you see is true, for the first and last elements on either the row or column excluding some in the d block. But that is for another ELI5. However alot of things are in play when calculating a value for electronegativity and so some anomalies appear like gold for instance</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you have a 100 students, some of them are best friends, and they all belong to different (but only one) social clique.  They are lined up outside a classroom with 100 desks, some are nicer than others, some are closer to the front of the room.  The students always line up in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>If you let some number of them in, in line order, and let them pick their own seats naturally, then after they settle we will let in just one more student.  Then we ask the student to say how easy and how happy they are with whichever open seat they pick.  This is essentially how electronegativity is determined with electrons (students), orbitals (social cliques), and quantum number paired electrons (best friends).</p>
<p>So with hydrogen, one student is let in.  Then the next student happens to be a best friend, so they are pretty happy sitting together in their favorite desks at the front of the room.</p>
<p>When you get to helium, these two students are already super happy, that when the third guy tries to come in, he gets completely ignored by the two best friends and is super depressed about it.</p>
<p>For lithium, the three students have settled down into seats, and the fourth student is let in.  The original two start to notice other students, and the third and fourth student are in the same clique so there's a bit of connection.</p>
<p>When you get to the whole line with gold, you end with something like the jocks taking all the seats around the music nerd who like the acoustics of the one seat, but there aren't enough music nerds for the next couple music nerds to break apart and sit together.  This happens at tungsten where all three music clique members get to sit together, but then it dips again because they get split into two groups of two. At gold the next music guy gets to sit with all his friends, and the cliques are meshing pretty well.  But then at mercury, the music guys break the jocks apart, and the jock at the head of the line can't sit close to his clique.</p>
<p>This can of course be formalized and calculated as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
