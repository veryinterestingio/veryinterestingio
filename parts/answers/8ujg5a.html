		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work at a dairy.  I've ran the machines that make the bottles and fill the bottles.  Basically after the milk goes in the cap is for a lack of a better term dropped onto the top of the bottle, pressed down and then screwed tight in basically one quick motion that takes about a second.  When the cap is pressed down excess milk will squeeze out of the top before it screwed on tightly.  After the cap has been attached the filled bottles go through a quick sanitize rinse before they are put into milk crates.  The rinse gets the vast majority of the milk off but the little bit that's left will eventually dry on.  When we fill we fill to the top with no air bubbles left, which you have to do because milk foams when it's being forced quickly into a bottle like that.  When you look at other drinks that come in bottles you'll notice there's a little bit of air at the top, but not so much in a milk jug.  </p>
<p>For the five year olds in the room ? milk has a lot of air bubbles in it when you first put it in the bottle so you have to over fill it to top it off..  we give the bottles a bath but sometimes a little gets left behind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the jug design matters. kwik trip (an upper midwest convenience store chain) used to use nicer, higher quality design (even had a pop-off seal on the jug underneath the cap) that minimized the milk that got 'stuck' to the top that causes the stinky dried milk. but they changed to a cheaper design, similar to that used by most other dairies, a few years ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/rizzo5522 gave a great explanation about the filling but there's another aspect to this too which is the cost of the plastic jug and using the least amount of plastic possible.</p>
<p>Many companies blow mold their jugs on site and least amount of plastic (starting as small beads) that can be used means more profits made, because plastic costs money.  We strive to make the jugs <em>just</em> big enough to hold the quantity desired.  If the jug is made too big there's a headspace in the top and that is wasted space.  We want the jug filled to the top and hence some spillover that doesn't get rinsed off when the cap is applied.  I will add the some caps are just press fit on the jug and not screwed on but still it's hard to get the perfect fill where there will be no milk residue in the threads under the cap. Many plastic jugs are filled by dispensing the milk from the top into the jug vs lifting the container up and having the filler nozzle at the bottom and lowering the container.  By moving the container, less foam is created.</p>
<p>edit: wanted to add this - if you look on the bottom of your plastic jug there should be (we have it) a number somewhere that corresponds to the blow mold head # that made it.  If we get complaints about &quot;thin jugs&quot;, &quot;flimsy jugs&quot; and we can see the same mold # appearing in the complaint we will investigate that head and maybe it has reached it's end of life and needs replacing.  As molds wear they may get bigger, using the same amount of plastic and hence getting a thinner jug which may be less sturdy OR shows as a underfill with allot more headspace showing.  Getting the blow mold heads replaced is heaven for the filler operator.</p>
<p>edit 2: short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9yGlYOh_2A" target="_blank">video</a> showing this</p>
<p>edit 3: Some people are wondering why the cartons don't have this crust - think about when you fully open a carton top, the opening is huge and the cartons aren't filled to the brim like the jugs.  The opening in the jugs is very small in comparison to cartons.  Cartons are heat sealed on top and there's no threads like the capped jugs have.  The milk foam floating on top doesn't get in the way in the cartons like it does in the jugs. The jugs have challenges like small openings, small headspace and threads so that's why you see crustiness with plastic milk jugs way more.</p>
<p>See how this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0YyUm2n2Zo" target="_blank">carton is lifted and filled</a> as it's lowered to minimize foaming.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Milk is full of protein. The casein protein dries as a milky translucent crust that will stick to the substrate it dried on. They use casein as a binder in paint used for scenic painting for theatre. It smells but it's cheap and easy to use.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
