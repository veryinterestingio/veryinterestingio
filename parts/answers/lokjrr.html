		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one is citing anything other than personal opinion in this thread. Here is what the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/buy-store-serve-safe-food/refrigerator-thermometers-cold-facts-about-food-safety" target="_blank">FDA</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether you’re dealing with leftovers or just-purchased foods, it’s important to get foods that need refrigeration into your fridge quickly. Leaving perishable foods out for 2 hours or more allows bacteria to multiply rapidly — and can put you at serious risk of contracting foodborne illness.</p>
<p>Leftovers: These need to be refrigerated or frozen within 2 hours, as well. Despite what some people believe, putting hot food in the refrigerator doesn’t harm the appliance. To help hot food cool faster, divide leftovers into smaller containers before putting them in the refrigerator.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of false information here. Newer fridges don't work the same as old ice boxes. Putting hot things in the fridge won't spoil your other food.
In our kitchen we are required to break down our large pots of food like a pot of stock or chili into smaller portions. This is because the larger the batch the longer it takes the center to get out of the danger zone. Think of it like an igloo. Outside cools much faster but if you never stir it the inside takes too long to cook down. So you put it in shallow pans.
Creating less of a.center and more surface area to allow the food to cool faster. Making sure the food spends as little time as possible in the danger zone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s a few reasons not to, but none of them spoil the food you’re putting in. First, it can warm up the other things in your fridge temporarily. Generally that doesn’t matter, as your milk isn’t going to spoil if it’s temperature rises for a 1/2 hour before the fridge is able to cool everything off. Second, it’s rare, but if you put a hot glass dish onto something cold, the thermal contraction could cause it to break. </p>
<p>Third, and the largest reason, is that it’s wasteful. When you stick something hot into the fridge, it has to pump every bit of heat out of there, which takes electricity. If you just leave it on the counter, it’ll get halfway to cooled off without spending any electricity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
