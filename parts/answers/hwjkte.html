		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vaccines work by training your immune system to respond to the pathogen. Herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (the kinds that cause cold sores and genital sores) are immunoevasive, which means that they have a mechanism to avoid destruction by your immune system. As your immune system begins to respond to the virus, herpes will hide inside nearby nerves (but not destroy them like other tissue). Normally, virus-infected cells are detected by your immune system and destroyed by cytotoxic T cells, but your nerve cells have <em>immune privilege</em>, which means your immune system does not attack them. Herpes lies there in a dormant state until a biochemical stressor (high stress, hormonal changes associated with menstrual cycles, new medications, etc) cause them to pop back out and reinfect the nearby tissue. Also, since nerves don’t move around, this is why herpes almost always reappears in the same location. It just pops in and out of the same hidey hole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s not for lack of trying. These vaccines have been in the works for about 100 years but they keep failing the clinical trials. Sometimes the vaccine itself has too many side effects - I remember there was some neurotoxicity - and other times the resulting antibodies weren’t robust enough to eliminate the virus, which is pretty darn good at evading our immune system in the first place. Remember that vaccines simply stimulate our immune systems to produce antibody production without catching the full blown disease so that if/when we are exposed, our immune system can have an immediate response to a virus before it can reproduce successfully.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have worked on many projects with VZV and other herpesviruses. One of the biggest hurdles is that early vaccine research cannot be done because a lot of these viruses are primarily human pathogens (they may infect other species but to a lesser degree and with a different pathogens is). So it’s very difficult to find and rule out lots of these vaccines....they usually have to be done only in cell culture then straight to humans. Currently we work on a VZV guinea pig model, but it’s a pretty infrequently used model and one of its kind. If you look up early work but Anna Gershon out of Columbia, they commonly cannot get the anterograde axonal movement of the virus once it has become latent. So we can get the GPs to look like chicken pox in humans, but we cannot replicate the entire pathogens is. We have to use a really difficult treatment of tacrolimus to induce reactivate on of the virus. Basically I’m just saying some viruses are more difficult to research vaccines for due to there not being very good animal models. Researchers rely on those heavily to try a LOT of different vaccine strategies to then rule out vaccines before going into expensive human studies (shotgun approach is really the only way we have to treat these questions).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way the virus has evolved to evade the immune system a vaccine against it will not work with any sort of durability. For one, it specifically deactivates dendrites to bypass that defense.</p>
<p>Eventually the body responds to an infection but after clearing it, it then consolidates antibodies for only the dominant antigens and that varies from person to person. Research showed most people are either producing antigens to glycoprotein G or B. When pharma company Chiron tried to combine those two dominant antigens in a vaccine it still didn't work. All it did was help lower symptoms in some people for 6 months. </p>
<p>The people who never have outbreaks actually have antigenic responses against infected cell proteins and not glycoproteins. However even adding those in a vaccine still doesn't work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mononucleosis is caused by EBV, a gamma herpesvirus, whereas HSV1/2 and chicken pox are alpha herpesviruses. Yes, they belong to the same family (herpesviridae) but they aren't even in the same subfamily (gammaherpesvirinae vs alphaherpesvirinae). To put that into perspective, it's like kind of like comparing humans and orangutans which are in the same family (hominids) but different subfamilies, genera, and species.</p>
<p>HSV 1/2 and Chicken pox are in the same subfamily, but different genera (simplexvirus vs varicellovirus). That's like humans and gorillas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
