		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With a two pulley system. The rope goes from your hand, over the top pulley, down around the bottom pulley, then connects to the top pulley. Then the load hangs from the bottom pulley.</p>
<p>The length of rope from the top pulley to the bottom pulley is the same on each side of the bottom pulley. So if you pulley 10 ft of rope 5 ft comes from one side and 5 ft from the other. That means the bottom pulley only goes up 5ft.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, let's look at a 2-pulley system like I've linked at the bottom. When the hand pulls the rope 2 meters down the load only moves 1 meter up. Try to look at the load, see how there are actually two sides of rope? When you pull you reduce the length of both sides. Each reduced by 1 meter equals the original 2 meters, yet since they are parallel they only really move the load up 1 meter.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the rope “loops” around the weight you essentially double the amount of rope you need to move it versus it a single rope attached directly to the weight. Let’s forgot about the pulley part for a minute and say I have a 5 foot rope and a weight on the ground (assume for the sake of the example the weight is somehow completely even with the ground.) If I were attach the rope in a single “strand” my rope is still 5 feet from the ground. Now imagine rather than connecting the rope in a straight manner you loop it through the weight with equal lengths of rope on each side. You are now only 2.5ft from the ground. The same idea applies in a pulley. If I pull a 2-Pulley system 5ft the weight will only lift off the ground 2.5ft because it is looped.  I attached a basic 2-pulley diagram just to reinforce the idea.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Look at u\DoomFrog_ 's image.</p>
<p>The load isn't attached to the rope it rests on it and rolls away from you as you pull the rope.</p>
<p>You bring 10m of rope towards you, and the load rolls 5m away from you.</p>
<p>When you pull the rope it shortens the rope both sides of the load, so you can think of it as taking 5m from each side.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
