		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the early stages of the infection, the amount of virus will be low in the nose area. To make sure they get cells and fluids from along the passage way they go deep. If they don't go deep there are chances you might end up negative in the test in the early stages of the infection. With more research and data, I think we will have better and easy way of sample collection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The area of the nasopharynx is well suited for incubation and growth of pathogens both viral and bacterial. Best chance of a high viral load area and therefore best chance of a true result on testing. That being said, the best results are being found on days 5-9 of testing in the best powered studies we have thus far.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are these tests really that bad? I’ve had two in the past month and while they were uncomfortable, I’d say doing blood work or a Pap smear are much more painful and uncomfortable. </p>
<p>Do others get like nose bleeds or other issues with the test? Or is it a bigger problem for folk who test a lot more frequently (eg health care workers)?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
