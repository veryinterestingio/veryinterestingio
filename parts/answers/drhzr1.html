		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're right that there's an observable wall of light that we can't see past, called the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). It's about 300,000 years after the Big Bang, at a redshift of 1,100. </p>
<p>The key is that this wall of light is being emitted by material with a history, and that history is in some respects stamped on the CMB. There are tiny fluctuations on the CMB, that travel at the speed of sound in that medium from the moment of the Big Bang all the way to the time of the CMB. Measuring those fluctuations carefully gives us a kind of integrated history of that first 300,000 years. Check out slides <a href="https://media.universe-of-learning.org/documents/UoL_SciBriefing_2019-10-23-HubbleConstant.pdf" target="_blank">22-24 of this recent presentation</a> from Dr. Charles Lawrence, the US project scientist for the Planck Mission and the Chief Scientist for Astronomy and Physics at JPL. </p>
<p>The upshot is that the size and relative number of the perturbations on the CMB is set by:</p>
<ul>
<li>The density of “normal” matter</li>
<li>The density of “dark” matter</li>
<li><strong>The amplitude and slope of the spectrum of initial fluctuations 10^-32 s after the Big Bang</strong> (which is how we get information about inflation)</li>
<li>The angular scale of the measured fluctuations</li>
<li>The fraction of CMB photons scattered by reionized matter in their 13.8-billion-year journey to us</li>
</ul>
<p>It's worth noting that there could be gravitational waves originating from much earlier than the CMB that we could detect. That hasn't yet been done, but they would travel freely through the dense ionized matter before the wall of the CMB.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Regarding your bonus question:</p>
<p>Assuming the universe is infinite in size (which we don't have any evidence to the contrary yet), and you compress it to infinite density, it's possible the compressed state is also spatially infinite, even while the region that would become our observable universe was confined to a region smaller than an atom.</p>
<p>As to the notion of other bubbles of space like ours popping into existence independently, I think that's one of the predictions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_inflation" target="_blank">eternal inflation</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;So why do we interpolate the observed expansion of the observable universe all the way back to a point?&quot;</p>
<p>That is an extrapolation from a viewpoint which ignores quantum mechanics. Among various theories a common one is a big 'bounce' rather than a bang but until we have a quantum theory of gravity and probably an understanding of other odd things like dark matter any extrapolation we make is going to be wrong, we just don't yet know it what way it's wrong. There's a pretty rich theoryscape open to us right now and anyone placing bets on the likely outcome is probably throwing away their money unless they generalize to the point of it being nonsense. The universe has a pretty long history of being weirder than we think it is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
