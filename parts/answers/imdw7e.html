		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's awesome you're doing this AMA! Thank you very much for your work.</p>
<p>I have two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Does CMBR change with time? Will the scientists of the near future have to look past microwaves in order to detect it? What about a million years in the future?</p>
</li>
<li>Is singularity inside a black hole the only plausible explanation to what's inside of it? Could it be a different state of matter that only occurs when an object reaches its Schwartzshild radius?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Question for everyone, but definitely /u/acwgough in particular. Are there any computational barriers standing in the way of a better understanding (or verification) of some of these theories? How useful would 10x or 100x more compute power be for your work? I'd also be curious to hear about the hardware used for these simulations, and any open source software packages used. </p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A long time ago I had an astronomy teacher who was teaching our class about the expansion if the universe. He said it was expanding at the speed of light in all directions. I asked him: &quot;if the universe is expanding and has a size that implies that it has an edge. So what is it expanding into? What on the other side?&quot; He replied &quot;the future&quot;. This kinda blew my mind and I was wondering if you could elaborate on this topic. Can you explain what's on the other side? Can you explain how the future can be a physical space, or have an edge?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I never really understood electromagnetic waves. Gravitational waves are pretty easy to understand: space-time itself rippling is a pretty straightforward concept. </p>
<p>But the radio waves we use every day? That's a rough one. They're waves, but what is it that's vibrating?</p>
<p>Are we living in an endless sea of unmoving &quot;radio medium&quot; that vibrates at various frequencies when waves are emitted?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
