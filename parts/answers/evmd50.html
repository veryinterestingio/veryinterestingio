		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say we discovered 500 new species of large fish between 1800-1850, 400 between 1850 and 1900, 300 between 1900-1950, and so-on..</p>
<p>We can then model that we're unlikely to discover more than ~50 new species in the future, so the discovery rate is about 97%.</p>
<p>Of course, in real life, data is messier, but the same sort of general analysis can be made to estimate how many species we'll discover, based on how many we have discovered so far.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One way this is sometimes estimated is using something called a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michel_Loreau/publication/285953769/figure/fig1/AS:671526588252181@1537115823957/Species-accumulation-and-rarefaction-curves-Species-accumulation-curves-show-the-number.ppm" target="_blank">species accumulation curve</a>.  Essentially, this is just looking at how many species have been discovered over time, adjusting for how much effort has been put into looking for them.  Since there is some finite but unknown number of species, we expect this curve to slow down over time, getting closer and closer to the true number.</p>
<p>However, these methods are usually more suitable for estimating total number of species within a given ecosystem rather than the entire world.   To do the latter, it is also common to simply use more general estimates or extrapolations.  <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/How-Many-Species-of-Insects-and-Other-Terrestrial-Stork/77cd50721ab3e98487cd43c0b4d1d1ad8bd72b07" target="_blank">Stork 2018</a> discusses various different estimates of the total number of insect species for example, and settles on an average of about 7 million (of which just over 1 million have actually been officially discovered).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you are hunting for Easter eggs. You find 20 in the first 5 minutes. But only 2 the next 5 minutes. You can then estimate that there are probably only 1 or 2 eggs left hidden at most.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't know the exact number of marine life/insect that actually exist. I am assuming that the figures either represent numbers discovered in a time period to what has been discovered total ( i.e. random example: 2 million known animals discovered to date and we discovered 1 million the last 20 years we discovered 50% of known animals on the last two decades!).</p>
<p>That or it's estimating based on the size of the ocean that we didn't touch (if we went through 80% of the ocean and we found 4 million species maybe there is another million species in the other 20%). It's an estimation and never an exact figure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
