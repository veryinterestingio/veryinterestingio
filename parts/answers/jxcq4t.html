		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since everyone else touched on the technology of 'fire' existing pre-human, I'll chime in with another point:</p>
<p>We still eat raw meats today. Fish can be eaten raw, and often is in sushi. Inuit cultures eat meat raw often. And fresh game can be eaten raw as well. Beef tartare and 'tiger meat' are both raw and eaten today.</p>
<p>And you can order your steaks 'blue'. This isn't hot enough to get the internal temperature high enough to kill parasites or eggs, it's just enough to cook the surface. And that's largely the point, kill whatever was on the surface since that's the most likely place for it to pick something up. It's harder for bacteria to make their way INTO butchered meat if they weren't already there to begin with, and that's why when you grind it into hamburger you need to cook it more thoroughly, because you've just introduced anything on the surface to the insides too.</p>
<p>It isn't so much that raw meat can't be eaten, it's just that cooked meat is much easier on our intestines. They have to do less work since lots of the enzymes and proteins are broken down in the the cooking process. Our guts even got smaller as the developed a regular habit of eating cooked foods. It's more nutritionally available, so it doesn't take as much time to get all the valuable stuff from it.</p>
<p>So we can eat meat raw, and our ancestors did so too. But once people got the hang of fire to make every meal cooked, there's a clear winner in everyone's mind.</p>
<p>And it's not the bacteria and parasites.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first evidence of controlled use of fire is from about 2 million years ago, so we've probably been cooking meat for a long, long time. Before that, our ancestors ate the meat they could get raw, like all other animals. </p>
<p>It's possible that we got the idea to cook meat from animal carcasses burnt in natural fires before then, but this wouldn't have been a regular thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The humanoid species that existed prior to humans already had fire so there probably wasn't a time when humans were without fire.<br />
It might even be suggested that humanity came about because of the availability of cooked meat to those previous species.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is also a lot of evidence to suggest that early humanoids were very efficient scavengers. They would often come in after the other apex group predators would finish their meals and scavenge the bones: Items like Achulean hand axes and just plain rocks were used to crack open some of the larger bones which contained high-protein/high calorie marrow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends what you mean by &quot;human&quot;.  Homo sapiens sapiens fully modern like today?  We evolved from other hominids that had already been cooking meat for millions of years.  </p>
<p>What the even more primitive hominids did before fire was eat raw meat I suppose but human beings more narrowly defined have been cooking meat since long before they first evolved.  There never was a time before they cooked meat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
