		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ex psychiatric nurse here and nursed many, many psychotic individuals back in the day.</p>
<p>God was always a very popular delusion as was radio sending coded messages, television specifically targeting them with messages. I also clearly remember a couple of I dividuals that believed they were being communicated to via bilboards / printed materials and they would interpret for example colour codes as hidden messages. I remember one chap in particular that was petrified of his fridge because it had been communicating to him via white noise. </p>
<p>MI5 was also and incredibly popular dilusion in that the individual would belive they were either test subjects or were being watched and the house bugged. </p>
<p>When I very first started in Mental Health I remember a ward sister telling me that &quot;if they mention God or MI5 on presentation, they will need assessment&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's actually extremely interesting! Hallucinations are very much a product of their times, so different claims were made in different areas of the world, and even different cultures! The most common delusion is the spiritual/messiah delusion, most likely given the spirituality present in all cultures. </p>
<p>Here's a link going into further depth:<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hide-and-seek/201209/brief-history-schizophrenia" target="_blank">https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hide-and-seek/201209/brief-history-schizophrenia</a></p>
<p>Basically the afflicted were often treated as if they were possessed, or cursed. I can tell from my experience in the field, I have seen case notes of people with delusions believing old companies were stalking them personally(nowadays you get like apple and microsoft) and people talking about hearing their pagers giving them secret messages or the birds watching them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

There’s as a whole sweep of cases of people believing they were made of glass. I known after 9/11 some patient presented with delusions about bin laden. There’s clearly a massive cultural aspect. </p>
