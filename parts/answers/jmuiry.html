		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my case, it's because my kidneys and liver are working overtime to process out the alcohol in my bloodstream. It's a constant struggle to keep enough booze in my system to stay sexy. Gotta sleep sometimes though, and the organs don't, they just keep dragging along, ruining my life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ignoring the mental aspect of it, literally how you are seeing yourself can change. Is it a mirror reflection or a photo? Photo focal lengths can greatly affect your proportions, making you look uglier. Mirrors are naturally more representative of your looks. But on the other hand certain photographs can be very flattering, hiding parts of you you don't like, enhancing those that you do.</p>
<p>I'm fat, but I'm also very tall. I look OK in the mirror, because from my perception my broad shoulders are front and centre, and my belly is kinda hidden down low. In photos though it's reversed, because people are usually shorter, so are usually taking them slightly upwards from their perspective. This exaggerates my belly and makes me look bottom heavy.</p>
<p>Lighting also comes in to it. Are you squinting looking into the sun when you take the shot? Are looking down, creating a double chin?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer to this is simply your mental state at the time, it’s all in your head. What this made me realize though is that it could be impossible for us to view our selves in an unbiased lights. This is why a lot of incredibly attractive people still feel very insecure and ugly lots of the time, even though that’s not the case</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lighting.  The light in which you view yourself can a affect the way you see yourself.  Soft white, or bright white, lights with a hint of blue or red, all have different affects.  Just like the yellow light that is projected onto bananas in the supermarket to make them more appealing, they use bright, harsh, white lights in the makeup section so people will more easily see their visual flaws. </p>
<p>(It’s why they turn the lights on full bore at the end of the night at the club)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
