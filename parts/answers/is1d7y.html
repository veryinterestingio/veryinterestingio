		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sleep goes in cycles, with each one lasting somewhere between 90 minutes and 2 hours. When you wake up naturally, it's at the end of a cycle, when you would be in a lighter sleep. Your alarm clock going off after you go back to sleep is waking you up at some other point in a sleep cycle, where you would be in a deeper sleep and not ready to wake up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just want to mention that, although I don't know why this happens, when it does happen, you should wake up at the time you felt refreshed rather than sleeping in and making yourself groggy.</p>
<p>It's better to wake up a bit early naturally, than to wake up a few hours later to an alarm that shocks you out of your sleep cycle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two questions here:</p>
<p>Why do I wake up early?
Either you woke up early because your brain was rested and ready to go or you are suffering sleep disruption due to stress or a sleeping disorder.</p>
<p>Why do I feel bad after taking this two hours of sleep?</p>
<p>Sleep disruptions are a vicious cycle, where it often seems nothing you do helps.  That’s because the root problem has nothing to do with sleep. Usually you have stress and worry, and those don’t go away just because you sleep more.</p>
<p>If you are having perfectly healthy sleep and your brain wakes up, then you go back to sleep, you start over like it is a full night sleep. So your body is confused and thinks it has only been sleeping 2 hours when it gets up two hours later.   So you feel like you woke up in the middle of the night and had to start your day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
