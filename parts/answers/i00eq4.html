		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The possibility of an empty ISS was most recently raised after the Soyuz launch failure in 2018. It would be problematic, but perhaps not insurmountable. Mission control can control a lot from the ground, and it would even be possible to send a Progress capsule to automatically dock and perform an orbital reboost, but there's still a lot on the ISS that wants human maintenance. An air leak or a radio breakdown, both of which have happened to the ISS before, would be serious issues with nobody on board.</p>
<p>On the other hand most of the dirt comes from the crew too.</p>
<p>It is something NASA, and presumably Roscosmos too, have made plans for. An exact timeframe the ISS could be safely decrewed seems hard to come by, perhaps because even NASA aren't really sure. There would be considerable extra work and equipment needed for the recrew mission.</p>

<p>Now that there are two spacecraft (Soyuz and Crew Dragon) that can take crew to the ISS, with two more (Starliner and Orion) expected to fly humans soon, an ISS decrew due to launch vehicle problems is much less likely. But a decrew due to other situations could still occur.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll add some thoughts to this, maybe a little late. u/cantab314 has a really good explanation for what happens if there are no crew onboard, but I haven't seen any discussion of what the actual minimum crew is, so I'll attempt to answer that.  </p>
<p>Some baseline research has shown that the smallest crews in the history of the ISS consist of just 2 crew members. (Per this <a href="https://space.com" target="_blank">space.com</a> article <a href="https://www.space.com/8876-international-space-station-numbers.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.space.com/8876-international-space-station-numbers.html" target="_blank">https://www.space.com/8876-international-space-station-numbers.html</a></a>). In recent history though, specifically since 2006, the ISS has not hosted a crew of less than 3, as shown in this graphic (<a href="http://tossha.com/space/plot_1961_01_01_2016_04_30.png" target="_blank"><a href="http://tossha.com/space/plot\_1961\_01\_01\_2016\_04\_30.png" target="_blank">http://tossha.com/space/plot\_1961\_01\_01\_2016\_04\_30.png</a></a>) describing the number of people in space since 1961. (Sourced from <a href="https://habr.com/en/post/393367/" target="_blank"><a href="https://habr.com/en/post/393367/" target="_blank">https://habr.com/en/post/393367/</a></a>)  </p>
<p>Based on this we know that the ISS can operate with a minimum of two crew members, which leaves just the possibility of a single crew member operating the ISS. Unfortunately I have been unable to completely preclude this, but I have found some pretty compelling evidence against it.  </p>
<p>The ISS De-crewing and Re-crewing plan (<a href="http://images.spaceref.com/news/2006/ISS.Decrew.recrew.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="http://images.spaceref.com/news/2006/ISS.Decrew.recrew.pdf" target="_blank">http://images.spaceref.com/news/2006/ISS.Decrew.recrew.pdf</a></a>) does not directly address crew numbers, but has some hints that the true minimum is 2 crew. Table D-1 in Appendix D lists consumable planning estimates for the critical consumables on the ISS. The table outlines amounts for 2 and 3 crew members, but does not address the case of 1 crew. Similarly, Table E-1 in Appendix E lists necessary decrewing operations and required crew time to complete each. Some required crew times are listed for 1 crew, though this appears to suggest that crew members can split their time, and the maximum crew required for any one operation described here is 2.   </p>
<p>Based on this information, it seems likely that 2 crew is the minimum for continued ISS operation. In the event of this number being reduced to 1 by crew incapacitation or other means, it would appear that that would warrant an immediate return to Earth. Incidentally though, while 2 crew appears to be a hard minimum, It seems unlikely that the station would go below 3 crew in the near future.  </p>
<p>In this ISS Safety Report (<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/170368main_IIST_%20Final%20Report.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/170368main\_IIST\_%20Final%20Report.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/170368main\_IIST\_%20Final%20Report.pdf</a></a>), page 44 section 4.2.8 addresses response to crew illness requiring medical evacuation. In the case of a three person crew, if any one crew member required evacuation, the entire crew would depart. Per the report</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is because for three-crew operations, there is only one Soyuz rescue vehicle at any given time; therefore all three crew members would evacuate at once in support of the ailing crew member.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This then would logically extend to other incapacitating events. As a final note then on the matter of a two person crew, the only period during which the ISS was regularly staffed with just 2 crew members was from 2003 to 2006, during which time the Space Shuttle was grounded after the Columbia disaster, leaving Soyuz as the only crewed vehicle. With Soyuz operating normally, Crew Dragon expected to be certified following a successful return in the coming days, and Starliner looking to be back on the path to human rating, it seems less likely that a single, or even multiple groundings will cause a significant crew shortage.  </p>
<p>TL;DR: Hard minimum appears to be 2 crew, but barring significant disruption it is likely that the effective minimum will be 3 crew members.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
