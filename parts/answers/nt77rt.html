		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you consider it as a particle, photon, it has no charge and so would not be bent.</p>
<p>If you consider it as a wave, Linearity. Where the magnets field and the lights field would sum linearly, leaving each &quot;undisturbed&quot; by the other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light is a duality it acts like a wave and as a particle (depending on which is easier for you to work with)</p>
<p>Light is essentially the byproduct of electrons - i.e. photons.</p>
<p>Electrons and protons are impacted by the magnetic field of a manger because they are <em>charged</em></p>
<p>For example, engines and turbines and generators. Large amounts of electrons being impacted by magnets to generate large amounts of energy. Electromagnets are another great example.</p>
<p>Photons on the other hand are <em>not charged</em> thus do not get impacted by the magnetic field of a magnet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember placing a speaker with a large magnet on top of our CRT television when I was a kid and the screen colors at the top were all messed up... Taking the magnet off didn't change the effect right away. It took a while for it to return to normal color.</p>
<p>Is this not bending light with magnets?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
