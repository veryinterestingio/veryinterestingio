		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They have a tongue which wraps around the backside of their head that helps cushion their brain from impact. Their beaks are specifically designed to chip away wood, and this shape helps reduce strain on their body. Furthermore, their brains are tightly packed in their skull, meaning there is little room for the brain to shift back and forth into the sides of the skull (the action which causes concussions in humans).</p>
<p>They’re wild animals without much intelligence - hence brain damage isn’t as big of a deal for them as it is for us. Any damage they cause to themselves is not severe enough to impact their survival, otherwise the species would evolved in a different direction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although other answers have tried and mostly succeeded, i think this is too interesting to avoid answering a bit more, in true ELI5 fashion...</p>
<p>A bunch of reasons give woodpeckers greater twists than human to brain damage.<br />
-First,  shorter lives means the total amount of damage sustained does not show up as obviously.<br />
-Second, their hyoid bone acts as a shock absorber, like you've got on a bicycle. Effectively, it's got a basic safety support in place.
-Third and almost the same as above... their skull is literally more flexible and less rigid, reducing damage.
-Fourth, the top beak is longer than the thicker, stronger bottom beak, and reduces the impact as well.
'Finally, they strike at different points, angles,  and regularly stop for a bit, to spread and minimize damage to themselves. </p>
<p>All told, the answer is simple...woodpeckers have evolved a number of important tools to minimize brain damage, including a sort of internal cushioning system,  different angles of attack,  beak &quot;shocks&quot; of different length,  and because of their more flexible, relatively safer bones. </p>
<p>Also...i think it's worth noting the size of a woodpecker matters, as unlike humans their brains are smaller and lighter and thus take less impact and transfer less momentum per impact. </p>
<p>All of this is in the following article:

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, surface vs volume. One of the thing that matters the most is the amount of force per cm². That amount of force can loosely be defined along the line of </p>
<p>Speed x mass x surface.</p>
<p>The thing is, due to their comparatively smaller size, the brain is also smaller. But scales are funny when you compare a 2 dimension thing and a 3 dimension one. The brain is 3d but the skull surface is 2d. As a result, the brain take a comparatively smaller amount of force per cm² in a woodpecker's head than in a human.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
