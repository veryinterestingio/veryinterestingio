		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Besides the &quot;people like to watch fights&quot; argument, there's a few others.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Letting players fight keeps them from being dirty during the game. If they get pissed at another player, they can fight it out in a fistfight which rarely results in long lasting injury, instead of hitting them hard while they're skating, which causes tons of injuries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tradition. Fighting has been in hockey and their main audience would be super pissed if they took it out, complaining that they are &quot;pussifying&quot; the sport.</p>
</li>
<li>It discourages people from giving dirty hits or flopping. If you hit someone illegally, you're probably getting beat up by the other teams enforcer. That's why you don't see any flopping or faking injury in Hockey, because you will be labeled a sissy and probably get the shit beaten out of you. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let me ask you this. Have you ever played a sport and someone pissed you off? Well in hockey you can beat the shit out of them and only be out of the game for 5 minutes. Any other sport likely gets you ejected. I watch hockey because I love all aspects of the sport. Fighting is just fucking fun to watch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other commenter is wrong.  The idea with fighting in hockey is that its a way to for players to police each other.  You have your skill players, your Wayne Gretzky's Sidney Crosby's ECT.  These are the guys that score goals.</p>
<p>You have your role players, your defenders and your less than superstar players, and you have a few enforcers, your big guys, whose job it is to protect their players.</p>
<p>Now, when anyone from the other team lays down a big hit on one of your star players, even if that hit is legal, you can expect the enforcer to come out onto the ice on that guys next shift, and pick a fight with him.  The message being, &quot;hey, you hit our guy, you're gonna have to face our big guy.&quot;. In theory, this self policing discourages games from getting too chippy.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that guys are on skates, so it's not like they're getting their full weight behind a punch, it's mostly upper body stuff, but I'm sure it still hurts like hell.</p>
<p>Whether or not it's essential is up for debate.  All amatuer levels it's illegal, including the Olympics and college.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's all kinds of bullshit rationalizations here. The real answer is, because people like to watch them fight. It's a part of the show and it attracts viewers and attendees. Violence sells. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>i def dont think its essential but just a bi product of playing hard and getting frustrated etc.<br />
shit gets heated, players get tired, and there is A LOT of things that just arent called on the ice because ref didnt see or didnt care to call it. so they try and protect their team mates just like they would want to be protected and shut it down when they can. most fights i see arent for the fans its in retaliation to a hard hit. or a dirty play, or so and so hit my goalie so im pissed and i push a dude down but now the other team has another person come over and get in the mix too. then its 2 v 1 and that doesnt fly so my team comes to back me up etc etc etc</p>
