		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are essentially 3 high altitude native populations- the Andeans, the Himalyans, and the Ethiopians. Each have slightly different adaptations for dealing with life at altitude.</p>
<p>It's been many years, but I recall attending a talk where high altitude birth adaptations were discussed. Andeans tended to have larger diameter of their uterine arteries, meaning they could supply more oxygen-rich blood to babies. Conquistadors had to return to sea level or near to have babies.</p>
<p>Other high altitude adaptations include increased red blood cell fraction (aka ability to carry oxygen) and increased breathing rate. One other option is having an innate ability to dilate the blood vessels in tissues away from the heart so the amount of blood flow reaching distant parts of the body is increased, thereby increasing the total amount of oxygen being carried there.</p>
<p>All that being said, babies not acclimated to high altitude need special conditions to adapt. It's possible, but there are other caveats. For example, roughly 30% of humans retain a PFO (Patent Foramen Ovale) or hole between the right and left atria (upper chambers of the heart) that should close after birth, but doesn't. Most people would never know they have this, but for maybe getting more winded at sports. However, if they travel to altitude, they are far more likely to experience altitude sickness because of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood mixing (right and left heart). Knowing if this persists helps predict if someone will be more susceptible to the effects of altitude decreased oxygen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Certain groups like the peoples of the Andes or Himalayas are genetically adapted to high altitudes, so they are born with these traits.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it is challenging for the baby to be born at high altitudes. The womb itself is a low-oxygen environment because while mom is getting oxygen straight from the air, which is 21% oxygen or so, the fetus is getting oxygen from the mom's blood, which is lower than 21% oxygen--I don't remember exactly what it is, but it's a lower concentration. For that reason, fetuses have fetal hemoglobin (in addition to the regular hemoglobin present in people who are not fetal). Fetal hemoglobin is more efficient than regular hemoglobin and allows for better usage of the oxygen and solves the problem of the fetus having to get by with less oxygen. </p>
<p>But the fetal hemoglobin quickly is removed from the body after birth.... except, interestingly, in many of the people indigenous to the Himalayas, the highest altitude dwellers on earth. They have a mutation that preserves fetal hemoglobin through adulthood, which is one reason why sherpas are so skilled at climbing Mt. Everest and other ultra-high altitude places. But even they have trouble giving birth at the highest altitudes at which they live (no one lives on the higher parts of Everest, but I believe the highest altitude communities are close to 16,000 ft). and will often spend the latter part of pregnancy and the early months of a baby's life at lower altitudes, with higher altitude dwelling left to people who need to be there for work. In the Andes, which are pretty high but not as high as the Himalayas, the indigenous people don't have the fetal hemoglobin adaptation but they do have other adaptations that make it easier for them to live there than people who haven't evolved to survive those conditions. For that reason, a city like La Paz, Bolivia (and its neighboring urban area) is made up overwhelmingly of indigenous peoples whose ancestors evolved to live at 12,000 feet elevation. They can manage high altitude dwelling and childbirth, but others can't and don't settle there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
