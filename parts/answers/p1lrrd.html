		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thalamus activity. When you're in NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep the thalamus creates bursts of sigma waves (so called &quot;Sleep spindles&quot;). These sigma waves burst around in the brain, transmitting from neuron to neuron, and are speculated to have a function in helping you consolidate and make sense of memories.</p>
<p>The more sigma bursts you have, the heavier you sleep.</p>
<p>P.S: While I haven't seen research on it I'm also guessing that your attitude changes how deep you sleep. At least I tend to sleep extremely deeply if I'm a place where I feel safe, even if the noise levels are pretty high, but if I sleep in a place where I can't lock the door or in a tent or if someone else is in the room...much lighter sleeper.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aside from a few chemical balances, trauma can shape people into waking up towards certain triggers. </p>
<p>For some people, it's the sound of the garbage truck in the morning. Others, garage doors. For me, it's any physical/audio sensation that doesn't feel like it's from myself because of overlap. </p>
<p>It makes sharing a bed a very difficult if not impossible task if I need to actually sleep. Quieter, darker, secure, and familiar are the best bets on qualities for minimizing my tendencies where I can even wake myself up, and it's pretty similar with other light sleepers i've encountered. </p>
