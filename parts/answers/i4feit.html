		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the &quot;speed&quot; in getting drink has to do with 1. The volume you drink relative to your blood volume, and 2. The speed at which other parts of your body take in the alcohol rather than your brain. </p>
<p>Less limbs = less blood, so the same amount of alcohol would told a higher concentration and faster &quot;drunkenness.&quot; But if you took a fat guy and a skinny guy with the same weight difference as your missing limb, the skinny guy would get drunk faster due to fat cells not absorbing the alcohol. The alcohol is eventually released, which is why fat people tend to get drunk slower, but also sober up slower.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Getting drunk is partly determined by your weight. If you're missing an arm or leg you would weigh less than before. The end result is that since you're now lighter you would have a lower tolerance to alcohol so you would get drunk faster.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
