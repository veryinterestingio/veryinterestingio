		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Coulomb barriers (how hard it is to make them fuse) get much higher, but the Q-values (how much energy is released per reaction) don’t really get larger, and in fact can even get smaller.</p>
<p>The larger Coulomb barrier is a big problem. Even if each reaction released more energy, if they’re happening at a much smaller rate due to the higher Coulomb barrier, then it’s a net loss.</p>
<p>That’s why almost all man-made applications of fusion are using hydrogen fuel (deuterium and tritium).</p>
<p>And specifically for weapons, one of the main draws to the DT fusion reaction is not the energy that it produces directly, but the 14 MeV neutron it produces, which can then induce fission. The relevant fission reactions release ~10 times more energy per reaction than the relevant fusion. So while the fusion releases some energy itself, it can <em>cause more fission</em>, and that’s where you get real gains.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other people have already answered the question, but I just wanted to add that I think you're misinterpreting the term &quot;easier&quot;. When we say it's &quot;easier&quot; what we really mean is the amount of energy you have to pour into it to make it fuse. When gauging the amount of energy a reaction produces, we use net energy i.e. (amount you put in - amount you get out). You can't &quot;get around&quot; this, it's just a fact of physics coulomb repulsion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
