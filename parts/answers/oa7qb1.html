<p>You do NOT require relativity nor quantum mechanics to show that electromagnetic waves carry momentum.</p>
<p>Radiation can exert pressure on a surface was known before relativity or quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>P = |S|/c  can be derived from Maxwell's equations by considering the effect of a charged particle being moved by a passing electromagnetic wave.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well because p=mv isnt the only way to describe momentum. De Broglie said that p=h/lambda, with lambda being the de Broglie wavelength. Waves can have momentum without mass, as they still travel through space and can act on other matter/waves/fields.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi /u/Azooz321!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ELI5: How does light have momentum if photons have no mass?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Special relativity tells us that </p>
<p>E^(2)=p^(2)c^(2)+m^(2)c^(4) (edit for clarity: here E is Energy, p is momentum, c is the speed of light an m is mass).</p>
<p>As photons have zero mass m=0. This leaves</p>
<p>E^(2)=p^(2)c^(2) or</p>
<p>E=pc. </p>
<p>Re-ordering this equation leaves</p>
<p>p=E/c. </p>
<p>As photons carry energy, they therefore carry momentum. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Momentum is mass times the <del>acceleration</del> velocity (thanks /u/condoriano27) (p=mv), so something with no mass should have zero momentum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is only true in Newtonian mechanics, which is superseded by relativistic mechanics. In relativistic mechanics, the momentum four-vector is defined as p=(E, px, py, pz), with E being the relativistic energy and (px, py, pz) being the Newtonian three-momentum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;It's actually not a moving mass that has a momentum, but a moving blob of energy. Mass is just a form of energy so it also has a momentum. Since a photon has energy so it has a momentum.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
