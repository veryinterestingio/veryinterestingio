		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They did not test tubers or similar plants, but there was a study recently (<a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opag-2019-0051/html" target="_blank">Wamelink et al, 2019</a> or <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/farmers-could-grow-crops-lunar-and-martian-soil-study-suggests-180973387/" target="_blank">pop-sci write up of the same paper</a>) that grew a variety of other crops in artificial versions of both Lunar and Martian regolith. The only crop that they tried and didn't work out was spinach. As mentioned in the Wamelink paper, there were actually quite extensive and direct (successful) attempts to grow plants in returned Lunar regolith from the Apollo missions as well and a variety of other tests done on plants with Lunar regolith, e.g., abrading of plant leaves with it, and these studies generally found that growth in Lunar regolith did not imbue the plants with any toxicity (e.g., the summary in <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ast.2009.0417" target="_blank">Ferl &amp; Paul, 2010</a>).</p>
<p>EDIT: Going back to one of the original Apollo papers (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1295365?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents" target="_blank">Walkinshaw et al, 1970</a>), it seems they were at least able to germinate potatoes in returned Lunar regolith.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's what one of my kids experimented with for a science fair last year (dang pandemic meant the fair didn't happen, but we continued the experiment).  We used regolith simulants from the Exolith Lab.  As an aside, the folks at the lab were wonderful to work with.</p>

<p>Here is a timelapse showing the growth of the plants.  Nothing was added to the soils.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure it has minerals/nutrients but we would need to create a soil &quot;ecosystem&quot; first before plants would easily survive. Many plants can't just take up minerals unless processed by bacteria/fungi first.</p>
<p>You'd need an initial source of organic matter, starter samples of soil to seed the microbes and start by growing plants just to compost and work your way up from there building the soil until vegetables would survive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can grow plants in carbon (peat, coir, even charcoal) as the growth medium as long as there are organic components added. Plants will try to grow in just the medium but probably won’t be very successful. I’d add mushroom compost and coffee grounds and arborist mulch to my growth medium.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This might be a dumb question, but if you have a lunar colony, wouldn't you have a lot of feces, veg scraps, etc. that you could be turning into compost and mixing with the regolith to make fertile soil for more plants that can't just handle the regolith?  Could you also use this to increase the depth as well if you sort of built mounds/mini mountains out of the composted material?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
