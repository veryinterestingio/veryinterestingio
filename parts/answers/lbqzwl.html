		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Specific polymer? I have no idea. Probably some blend of polybutadiene and maybe silicone. But I can explain how it works. </p>
<p>There's two important physical properties to this polymer, it's Tg, and it's crosslinking. Another important property (this time chemical) is its affinity (or polarity) to dirt. </p>
<p>Tg is a number that's basically the softening temperature. It's based on the phenomenon that when an amorphous polymer heats up, it gets softer and softer gradually, rather than at a strict point (like ice turns to water at 0C). The Tg can be manipulated to be at practically any temperature, in the case of the sticky hand, the Tg is most likely below room temperature, which lets it conform to a surface and &quot;stick&quot;. </p>
<p>The crosslinking of a polymer allows it to hold its shape, regardless of the temperature. Highly crosslinked polymers will look like a net, each point connecting to multiple others. Nets can be flexible, or rigid, depending on what's used, but most importantly, when stretched, they return to their original shape. This lets the sticky hand stretch and bounce back without turning to goop (which happens when a low-crosslinked polymer is at a temperature above its Tg. Essentially, it melts). </p>
<p>Now it's kinda sticky and stretchy, but it still needs the proper affinity to stick to most surfaces, but not stick strongly. The second route to stickiness is through chemical interactions. Big molecules will slightly stick to everything, just because of their large areas of contact (through lewis interactions). So the bigger an individual unit of the polymer, the more indiscriminately it will stick to things. But, in this case, water grips onto the dirt better than the sticky hand, and so it can wash it off. This is where the probable silicone is at, which repels waters and dirt (AKA has lower affinity for water and oils). </p>
<p>So this means the polymer should be a very large, low Tg, and crosslinked. It's hard to do all this in a homopolymer, so mixtures are usually used. Mix the large butadiene with a crosslinker to form a co-polymer, and blend in slme silicone additives for easy washing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Likely a SBC(styrene block copolymer) compound or blend. These resins (SEBS and the like) are often modified to be super soft. Often with things like oils - ever see it stain a surface? Thatâ€™s the paraffinic oil coming out.</p>
<p>Being non polar, they are easy to clean with water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
