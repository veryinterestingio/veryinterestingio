		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The line between real and fictional memories isn't that clear. Eyewitnesses for example can remember things that aren't true. Every time you remember something you change this memory a little bit. And you can even create false memories by asking questions like: &quot;Do you remember ... we did last summer? Here's a (photoshopped) image.&quot; But usually it is possible to detect false memories by searching the context for inconsistencies (e.g. teleportation in dreams).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wonder how this works inside dreams where the brain seems to have memories of things that never happened, but inside the dream those things did happen... I don't know if I explained it well, but it's like the brain temporarily &quot;installs&quot; a fake memory (and makes it look real) to deliver context to a dream.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a discovery channel show where they took some people out to the desert made them wear cameras and walk down this trail.. Then halfway Down the trail there were these military dudes standing guard over a bit of foil and broken bits.. They were rushed along and so on.. They were then asked some time later to come back and describe the memory.. All of them had altered their memory in some way mainly due to speculation and discussions.. There were 2x the number go guards.. Standing over bodies.. A ufo and so on. They were then shown the footage..</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cognitive psychologist here. Short answer is the line can be blurred. False memories are a real thing. Your level of certainty that something did or did not occur may not predict whether or not it occurred. There is a large literature on this and we are still learning a lot, even since I was in grad school.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes it doesn't recognize the difference.  I had a dream last year that one of my coworkers died.  I woke up 100% sure it was a memory, not a dream, to the point that I didn't expect to see them at work that day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
