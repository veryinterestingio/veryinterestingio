		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I went from obese to regular weight. At the same time I unexpectedly went from a hot person to a cold person. I was told that it's because fat wraps around your vital organs keeping them toasty warm. I am burning less calories and generating less heat. Finally, my heart rate is much lower, so I'm pumping less warm blood around my body.</p>
<p>I think it's a mix of a few things, but where you store fat would be the main one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps the main reason is the amount of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/expert-answers/brown-fat/faq-20058388" target="_blank">brown fat</a> a person has.</p>
<p>Brown fat metabolizes stored energy quickly when you are cold. A person lacking much brown fat will feel cold much more easily. And the presence of brown fat is a genetic/developmental thing, not determined by diet.</p>
<p>This is along with the general differences in volume and surface area. A fatter person will have noticeably more volume than a skinnier one, but only slightly more surface area. Heat transfer occurs according to surface area, but total thermal energy stored is dependent on volume. This means skinny people lose heat more rapidly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two things at least partially for cause are the amount of both muscle and body fat. Muscle as a whole even when it's not working, burns more energy to maintain itself and produces more heat (athletes even on rest days or weeks will still eat more than your average person due to this). Added to this, body fat can help insulate you, just like any number of animals that bulk up for the winter or arctic animals like whales or seals that spend a large amount of time in icy water.</p>
<p>On a personal note, due to both COVID and some health issues, I haven't been able to exercise in ten months. I've gone from running twice a week and training for semi-competitve power lifting to sitting on my butt all day, and lost a lot of muscle. I've gone from being overly warm and sweating quite easily to basically the opposite, being cold more often and bundling up more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
