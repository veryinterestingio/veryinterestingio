The bacteria on your skin <em>love</em> that stuff and eat it up, producing waste products in the process.  It's those waste products that smell bad.</p>
<p>tl;dr: BO is mostly the smell of bacteria poop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have 2 different kinds of sweat glands. Anywhere where you have lots of hair has <strong>Apocrine</strong> sweat glands (as opposed to the normal <strong>Eccrine</strong> sweat glands). The <strong>Apocrine</strong> glands are mainly responsible for body <strong>odor</strong> because the sweat they produce is high in protein, which bacteria can break down easily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some posts are explaining the different type of excretion from armpit glands,  but what must be taken into consideration is that your armpits are not open to air, which greatly increases the rate at which they begin to emit a bad odor. This is why your feet and nether regions also begin to smell bad before other parts of your body.  The bacteria is trapped and moist. The rest of your skin is exposed to airflow which let's it dry out, greatly reducing bacteria growth. </p>
<p>For example,  you mention that back sweat does not smell bad.  Have you ridden in a car with leather seats on a hot day for a long time? Even without leather seats,  back sweat can begin to smell really bad on long,  hot car rides. I can take a shower,  get in my car,  drive an hour and the back of my shirt is soaked and stinky.  Like, real stinky.  I use one of those beaded seat covers that allow increased airflow to alleviate this. </p>
<p>It is not so much the different types of sweat the glands emit as it is the restriction of airflow that keeps those areas moist, which allows faster bacteria growth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
