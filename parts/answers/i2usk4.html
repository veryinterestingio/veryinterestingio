		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Airplanes have air breathing engines (edit: and wings). This is great, since it means they don't need to carry their own oxygen, but it's not as effective at producing thousands of tons of thrust with a smallish device and they can't run in space. </p>
<p>Rockets don't use air breathing engines (edit: or wings) because they're too heavy, not powerful enough, and don't work in space. As a result, they don't benefit in any way from being in the atmosphere, and since the atmosphere has air resistance they'd like to get out of it as quickly as possible - especially the lowest, thickest, parts of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're right in the sense that in order to get into orbit, a rocket has to go sideways very, <em>very</em> fast. The International Space Station is whizzing along at over 17,000mph!</p>
<p>However, spacecraft in orbit can only get to (and stay at) such ludicrous speeds because there's no air resistance to slow them down. The ISS is a fairly low 250 miles from the ground, most satellites are much further up.</p>
<p>In order to use their fuel in the most efficient way possible, rockets go straight up to get to thinner atmosphere as fast as possible. Then they begin to turn sideways, and increase their lateral speed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There have been experiments with so called spaceplanes. The problem with them is that in order to reach orbit and leave the atmosphere they need to get really high and fast. Using aerodynamics to fly really high is contrary to get really fast, because the higher you get, the thinner the air becomes, yet you're not nearly as fast as you need to be for orbit. So you need to accelerate more and more, but still are too low to neglect air resistance. The result is that you burn much more fuel in order to get fast enough than if you just puncture straight out of the atmosphere and start turning at sufficient height.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Planes have wings which generate lift, the wings do the lifting up part and the engine pushes, so push and lift.</p>
<p>Rockets have no wings and will simply push, to get them into orbit you need to point them upward. They then PUSHHHHH into orbit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically they do eventually end up horizontal sort of like a plane. The entire point is to get high enough and go fast enough so you basically fall endlessly while the Earth curves away. This is how we make things orbit our planet.</p>
<p>Down at sea level the air is quite thick and gravity its most effective. Space rockets go sort of straight up (they tend to start turning over in an arc early on to start their horizontal acceleration) to get up to the thinner air as quickly as possible as they have limited fuel.</p>
<p>Rockets need to carry everything that makes them fly with them including oxygen to make the engines work. The issue there is it increases weight, which means the rocket needs to be bigger to hold more fuel to lift it, which increases weight, and so on. We get past the problem now by staging, where we throw away spent engines to reduce weight while in flight.</p>
<p>In theory starting higher is more efficient. There are projects being tested that would launch rockets from large, high flying aircraft. The problem is that these planes need to get up to altitude as well which restricts the size of the payload they can bring. You will not be launching a Mars mission from a Virgin Galactic in its current state.</p>
<p>Still, the dream is to make it as cheap and efficient as possible so more and more people can have access to the space industry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
