		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bacteria do this! But not exactly in the way you are describing. One protective mechanism that bacteria use to avoid unwanted genetic material (e.g. phages) from hijacking them is to protect their genomes using methylation. The bacteria typically have an enzyme that adds methylation to a certain sequence and a corresponding restriction enzyme that chews up any DNA that isn’t protected by said methylation.</p>
<p>As an aside, that discovery was foundational to molecular biology, all from someone looking into how bacteria defend themselves from pathogens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Somewhat related, bacteria have an antivirus mechanism that is surprisingly similar to computer antivirus mechanisms! They keep a table of &quot;bad guy&quot; DNA sequences, and have &quot;code&quot; that says &quot;if you see anything from this table, cut it up&quot;.</p>
<p>Scientists discovered they could put their own sequences in the &quot;table&quot; and trick the machinery into cutting DNA exactly where they wanted. They could then use this technique to make precise edits to lengths of DNA in living cells. This is the basis of the famous, revolutionary &quot;CRISPR&quot; technique that was developed a few years ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some processes involving methylation and acetylation of DNA that more or less work in this way, however the polyA tail is designed more to control the level of expression of a protein and to prevent mRNA from lingering too long in a cell, the way it works it just protects the mRNA from exonucleases, which degrade DNA from one end to the other (longer polyAs yield longer lifespans for mRNA)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Besides the comments here about the functionality of the poly-A tail, here’s an evolutionary perspective: our genome actually contains the remnants of viral DNA. This may have actually been an important mechanism for evolution, one that introduced novel, adaptive traits. So it may not end up serving a particular species of organism to do what you suggest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
