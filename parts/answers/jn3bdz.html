		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scientists discovered several chemical compounds which had a similar  activity. </p>
<p>They lumped them all under the name B vitamin and numbered them in order of discovery</p>
<p>Later they discovered that some of their original choices didn't match up with the criteria they had set for themselves so they removed some of them.  Hence we have them out of order.</p>
<p>Biotin is B8. Inositol is B7 or vice versa depending on where you live</p>
<p>Biotin is also called vitamin H because when it was discovered in germany it was related to Hair and Skin which both start with H in German</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>B vitamins were discovered by their deficiency.
In the early 1900s we discovered that beriberi was a processed grain eater disease. Eating only polished rice gave it's eaters watery stools and distended bellies and exhaustion. Adding back in some elements of the grains reversed its effects. Around the same time it was discovered that other wasting diseases with similar presentations (exhaustion, rashes, abdominal bloating)  were also cured by adding yeast extract into the diet. The medical community had known for awhile that citrus reversed scurvy and a more comprehensive theory around what exactly was in these foods that treated disease. The theory was developed that there was some &quot;vital amine&quot; that treated particular diseases. Vitamin C was isolated. Around that same time, thiamine was isolated. It was then discovered that isolated thiamine didn't treat <em>all</em> wasting nutritional defects and there was a bit of a race to isolate the rest. The remaining vitamins were named in the order of their discovery. </p>
<p>It should be noted that all the other vitamins have different forms too, its just that the b vitamins are essentially different molecules rather than one parent molecule with different functional groups or redox states, like vitamin D or C</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why is there so many types of vitamin B? </p>
<p>Vitamin B is a class of water-soluble vitamins that play important roles in cell metabolism and synthesis of red blood cells.</p>
<p>Why there is no vitamin B10 and 11? </p>
<p>There was but then scientists discovered either A. they weren’t essential to life or B. the body produces (both of which have to be false in order to be considered a vitamin)</p>
<p>Why is biotin called vitamin B7 or B8 or H ? </p>
<p>Biotin is B7 because it was the 7th vitamin b related  compound discovered.</p>
<p>What determine vitamin B numbering (why thiamine is B1, riboflavin is B2, etc) ?</p>
<p>The order of discovery</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>B1 (thiamin)
B2 (riboflavin)
B3 (niacin)
B5 (pantothenic acid)
B6 (pyridoxine)
B7 (biotin)
B9 (folate [folic acid])
B12 (cobalamin)
These vitamins aid in the digestion and processing the metabolism. Some of the other vitamins got the ax when the definition of a vitamin changed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They’re all water-soluble, so they mix with water well. The B vitamins that aren’t included were removed because they don’t fit definition of vitamin. I think the numbers are when they were discovered.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
