<p>Yes the fluid will move around internally, mostly due to any rotation of the bottle. It you rotate the bottle at all (i.e. anything other than perfect linear motion) the inner walls of the bottle will cause drag against the water that’s closest to the edge. But the water in the middle of the bottle will be stationary due to inertia. The difference in momentum (edges are moving, center is stationary) will cause internal currents.</p>
<p>Note that this can be due to even very small-scale rotations to the point that this will always happen in the real world.</p>
<p>If you don’t believe me... put some food dye in a full water bottle then seal it. Shake it up and you’ll see the food coloring move around very quickly. </p>
<p>If you’re more interested in this, two important concepts are “Laminar flow” and “viscous drag”.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what you consider to be movement.</p>
<p>The molecules that make up the water are constantly moving, that's pretty much the definition of a fluid.</p>
<p>Even if you don't shake it, the molecules still move, but if you add force, you'll change the direction of that internal movement.</p>
<p>But the &quot;shape&quot; of the water ,for lack of a better term, will always fit the bottle. In a perfectly rigid bottle, that shape wouldn't change.</p>
<p>It's similar to the fact you're always moving, even if you stand still, because the earth is always circling the sun.</p>
<p>EDIT: which means the water is moving through space at all times as well, shaken or stirred, doesn't matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming a really perfect 100% fill with water and no air or empty space, there is pretty much zero movement. </p>
<p>There is something to be said about the water pressure being higher in the parts closer to the ground (because of the weight of the water above)</p>
<p>and also in the parts opposite the direction of any force being applied to the bottle while shaking (because it's being mushed against that side by the rest of the water)</p>
<p>BUT, water doesn't condense very much at all with these tiny pressure differences. So it wouldn't result in any detectable movement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tap a bottle on something hard<br />
The water will will try to move, this create pressure<br />
Change in pressure allows a phase change and the liquid can turn into gas<br />
Now bubbles are created inside the liquid<br />
Then water will rush to fill that void<br />
This will create a shockwave that breaks the bottle.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Beware really long post:
It depends on your physics model, are you considering the water as a &quot;fluid system&quot; or &quot;water + bottle&quot;?</p>
<p>Are you considering molecules chains?</p>
<p>Are you considering single atoms? </p>
<p>Are you considering single particles?</p>
<p>Assuming you are referring to the most basic model: &quot;water in a bottle&quot;, well, kind of, since friction between the bottle and water, but since you said &quot;100% full&quot; yes and no: take a balloon, fill it up with water, it explodes after a certain point, so, 100% in &quot;&quot;&quot;reality&quot;&quot;&quot; is almost unachivevable level of balance... </p>
<p>On a 100% assuming it's perfectly balanced, still depends on how you made it, glass bottle, plastic bottle,  ballon bottle(?)... do you think it moves? It might, do you want it to not move? Then, personally would use an alluminum bottle to fill it to 100 with low pressure...(don't know if every molecules would move, but some of them certainly yes, since, if you shake it very very very fast, you can make the water boil)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
