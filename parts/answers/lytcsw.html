		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heat transfer is a really difficult subject with whacky equations governing the details, so the true answer is &quot;it depends on a lot of factors&quot;. The temperature of each object affects the air flow around it, among other things. Heat transfer in a vacuum is not that interesting, so we can not go the typical simplifying route.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the factor that matters most for conductive heat transfer is the temperature of the item relative to its surroundings. In this case, reading your other posts, that is the same. So, their temperature would change at the same rate, and both items will reach equilibrium temperature at the same time.</p>
<p>However, the hot item can also cool down due to radiative heat transfer. An object emits more radiative energy if it has a higher absolute temperature. This number scales by T^4. This number may not be that big at 100Â°, but it is there.</p>
<p>tldr; there are too many factors to give a definite answer, but I'd put my money on cooling being very, very marginally faster in most cases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are missing one component that makes it impossible to know, actually a couple.  But mainly, how warm is the room they are in.  If the room is at 70 degrees, the 100 degree item will cool slower than the -100 degree item heats up.  Because the 70 degree air won't be able to dissipate the heat as fast as lets say 30 degree air, or -20 degree air.</p>
<p>There is still other factors too.  For example, not all materials transfer heat and cooling at the same rate.  So depending on what material the item was made out of, it might shed heat a lot faster than heat up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, are they wet? What is the humidity? The cool one might get covered with frost, which would insulate it. The hot one would cool faster when wet if the air isn't saturated.</p>
<p>What color are they? Is the airflow unrestricted, or is the object on a surface?</p>
<p>Not enough info, bud</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To list some of the other things you need to consider: emissivity, reflectivity, absorption, mass, density, flow characteristics of the item and the environment, thermal conductivity with your heat sink/source, thermal conductivity through the material, surface area, types of energy sources in the environment, delta in temperature with the environment, and probably a few things I am forgetting.</p>
<p>A great experiment to show that temperature and energy are not going to work quite how you think they will is to see how different temperature water melts ice cubes: hot still water will melt them slower than cold moving water. </p>

<p>The experiment is a bit disingenuous because moving hot water will melt the ice faster than moving cold water, but the point still stands that there are lots of things at work when heat moves around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That depends on what the temperature of the room is and if the objects are being exposed to any light.</p>
<p>If the objects are dark and being exposed to light then they will both be absorbing energy from that light and so the hot thing will cool down slower than the cold one heats up.</p>
<p>But, all else being equal, if the room is at zero degrees then they should reach equilibrium in practically the same time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
