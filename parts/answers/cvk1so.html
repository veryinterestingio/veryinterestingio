		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Peaches have less chemical complexity than something like a watermelon for instance. With a peach, scientists have discovered the right set of flavor molecules, sometimes referred to as esters, that create the proper taste of a peach. I also believe the main molecular component that gives a peach its taste can be used as a food additive, like the molecule found in apples.</p>
<p>In contrast, the flavor molecule that makes up the most common watermelon taste; red innards, green rind, is referred to as an aldehyde, and isn't as simple. This molecule is too unstable to be made into a food additive. To top it off, watermelons (like bananas) have an incredibly rich and complex flavor profile in terms of chemical makeup. You also have far more varieties of a watermelon (also like bananas) than you do a peach, making it ever the more complicated. Unless somebody finds something that mimics the watermelon aldehyde properly, or can create a stable compound using it, you're stuck with not really watermelon flavored watermelon candy and/or treats.</p>
<p>EDIT: My new top comment is about peaches, watermelons, and bananas. I'm confused.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Flavours are developed by flavour chemists to mimic the flavours for which they are named. But also to local cultural tastes.</p>
<p>Flavours can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Synthetic- made with chemicals that do not exist in nature</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nature Identical - made with synthetic chemicals that are identical to naturally occurring flavours. For example Synthetic vanillin is about $50/kg. Natural vanillin about $400/kg. Nature identical is classed as artificial in many countries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Natural flavours - made up from isolated natural flavour chemicals. Geraniol from Rose geranium, citronellal from lemon grass etc. And blended by the flavour chemist.</p>
</li>
<li>FTNFs (From The Named Fruit). Bansna flavours from banana, strawberry from strawberries etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Flavours popular here in NZ may be different to America. Cultural preferences for example. Americans love cherry flavours, Brits like black currant.</p>
<p>Flavour houses may have dozens of different strawberry flavours, grape  water melon, banana etc but ultimately the choice of flavour comes down to someone like me - a food technologist who spends time flavouring foods (and pharmaceutical) products to either customer requirements or food panels. </p>
<p>Products that reach the market may not be your ideal flavour but it has passed a team who thinks it either the best they can get or the one with the highest approval from the customer or tasting panel.</p>
<p>I've done many products where the customer hates the perfectly flavoured product I've done for them and approved something I'm not happy with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some flavors like banana or peach only have 3-5 taste defining chemicals where as strawberry, raspberrys and watermelon rely on a more complex chemistry sometime relying on the fiber content holding it together for flavor too. I will try to find a source later. Too drunk and too mobile to sause ATM</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
