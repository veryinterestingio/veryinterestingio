		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of it is deliberately misleading branding from manufacturers, there are really only 2 main TV technologies right now (LCD &amp; OLED)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LCD: Liquid crystal display</strong>. The same technology used for the display in digital watches and alarm clocks, but miniaturised to the point where they can make up the pixels of a screen. The pixels don't produce their own light so they need a backlight. Old LCDs used CCFL backlights (flat fluorescent lamps) but since about 2010 they have used LED backlights. To market the newer backlight technology manufacturers commonly call these &quot;<strong>LED TV</strong>s&quot;, even though they are just LCDs with a better backlight. <strong>QLED</strong> is Samsung branding for LCD TVs that have 'quantum dot' films inside them, it's a layer between the backlight and LCD layer that enables the tv to produce more colours with higher brightness. A problem with LCD is that when watching dark scenes some of the light from the backlight still bleeds through, making blacks look grey (especially at high brightness settings). Local dimming is a technology where the backlight is divided into sections that can individually be made lighter or darker, allowing an LCD screen to look better in dark scenes, <strong>Mini LED</strong> is the term for a perfect version of this local dimming technology where every pixel has it's own individual backlight, this is the newest LCD technology branding you will start seeing in 2021 TVs, but it's still LCD at it's core.</li>
<li><strong>OLED: Organic Light Emitting Diodes</strong>. This is a totally different technology to LCD, the pixels themselves produce their own light so there's no backlight. This means there's no backlight bleeding through during dark scenes allowing inky blacks and amazing contrast. Also because there's no extra layers needed for the backlight, quantum dot layer, etc OLED TVs can be extremely thin. The downsides of OLED is that the pixels break down over time and static images can get burned in, also they tend not to be as bright as LCD screens. That said companies have been improving the technology every year making these problems less and less prevalent.</li>
<li><strong>Plasma</strong> screens were an older technology which worked by having thousands of pockets of a gas that would turn into plasma and produce light when an electric field was put across them. It offered many of the same benefits as OLED since each pixel made it's own light, but it was costly to manufacture compared to LCD TVs, and then OLED came along offering all of the same picture quality benefits and made it truly obsolete.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a new upcoming TV technology called 'Micro LED', which is a TV made up of millions of tiny LED lights. It has the same benefits as OLED but with the increased brightness and longevity of LCD TVs, so it's like a best of both.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>LCD - Liquid Crystal Display - Generally the low end of displays and TV's now. First major flat panel tech.</p>
<p>LED - This is a LCD Display with LED (light-emitting diode) backlight. This allows for better contrast often and more energy efficiency.</p>
<p>OLED - Organic Light Emitting Diode - As of now this is the peak display tech is most applications.  Literally each individual pixel is it's own light source. There is no need for a backlight so when a image is displaying a black night sky for example. It literally turns those pixels off and can give the truest blacks and best contrast.</p>
<p>The rest maybe someone else can comment on.  Plasma is an older tech, very energy-hungry, heavy, and not really around anymore that I'm aware, at least in mainstream displays.  QLED as far as I know is just an LED Tech from samsung and a few other companies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Woohoo, I get to bust out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/jdm4u/eli5_lcd_vs_led_vs_plasma/c2b8psw?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">my 9-year-old response</a> to this question again!</p>
<p>That response covers LCD, LED and Plasma. The other two you mentioned are QLED and OLED.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>QLED</strong> is essentially the same as LED, but a special &quot;quantum dot&quot; color filter is added to the screen that greatly expands the color space that the TV is capable of displaying. The Q stands for &quot;quantum&quot;, referring to the quantum dot filter.</li>
<li><strong>OLED</strong> is a completely different technology. It stands for <em>Organic Light Emitting Diode</em>. How exactly it works is a little beyond the scope of an ELI5, but the key thing to understand is that it is an <em>emissive</em> panel rather than a <em>transmissive</em> one.</li>
</ul>
<p>In an <em>emissive</em> panel, each pixel is responsible for generating its own light. The advantage of this is that black pixels literally emit no light whatsoever, resulting in absolutely inky-black black levels that OLED is famous for. Plasma is also an emissive panel display technology, and it also had amazing inky blacks. The disadvantage of emissive panels is that each pixel will wear out at different rates from surrounding pixels depending on how hard those pixels are being used; as the pixel wears out, its light output diminishes. When you have uneven wear rates across the panel, with some pixels noticeably darker than others, that is what's known as burn-in.</p>
<p>In a <em>transmissive</em> panel, there is an independent light source behind the panel called a <em>backlight</em>. The light form the backlight passes through the panel, and each pixel is designed to filter the light to generate the color it needs to be. All of these panels rely on LCD (liquid crystal display) technology for the pixels, but the backlight technology has changed greatly over the years, first using fluorescent lightbulbs, then moving to LED lights. What we call &quot;LED&quot;, &quot;QLED&quot;, &quot;xLED&quot;, etc. are all variations of this theme.</p>
<p>The advantage of transmissive panels is that individual pixels are not going to wear out, so you won't get the phenomenon known as burn-in. But that isn't to say the <em>TV</em> won't wear out, it's just that it's more likely that the <em>backlight</em> will wear out first before the pixels do. The disadvantage of transmissive panels is that the pixels can never really filter 100% of the light coming through the panel, so it is extremely difficult to get the inky-black black levels that you get with OLED.</p>
<p>Manufacturers solve this problem by using <em>full array local dimming</em> whereby the backlight is divided into sections that can be controlled independently; if an area of the picture is dark, that section of the backlight can be dimmed or turned off resulting in better black levels in that area of the screen. The problem with this is that each backlight section is fairly large compared to the size of the pixels, so you can't control the brightness of each pixel as precisely as you can with OLED. Some manufacturers solve this by literally making the backlight into its own black and white LED panel, with as many &quot;sections&quot; are there are pixels in 1080p.</p>
<p>And then there's Micro LED. This doesn't use OLEDs, it uses normal LEDs--the same as you would find in a LED lightbulb or traffic light--that have been shrunk down small enough to serve as individual pixels for a TV (hence the &quot;micro&quot; part). There's a limit to how small they can be shrunk however, so Micro LED TVs are typically massive, upwards of 100&quot; diagonal. It's an emissive panel, but the pixels don't wear down the same way OLED pixels do, so there's no threat of burn-in.</p>
<p>I hope this helped!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>LCD is any display that uses liquid crystals to display an image, that's basically the next step after CRT's. Those liquid crystals can display colour, but no light on their own, so you need a light source. On never displays that's always done by using LED's, that's why those displays are often called LED-screens. They still use LCD's though.</p>
<p>OLED is again the next step, by using organic liquid crystals who have the ability to emmit light on their own, so you don't need additional LED's and have a better picture with far more contrast.</p>
<p>QLED-screen are basically still using &quot;normal LCD's&quot;, but rather special LED's for the backround light. Those aren't white, but can take on every colour, which means that the colours on the screen are also better. You don't have the same superb contrast OLED's have though.</p>
<p>Plasma-TV arent using liquid crytals as pixels, but basically small chambers filled with gas. There are three chambers for each pixel, containing different gas for displaying either blue, green or red. By connecting an electric current to them you're turning them into plasma and thus visible light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
