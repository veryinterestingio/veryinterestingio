		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When they are directly done using they immediately bend the needle so no one gets poked by it if they were to accidentally stumble upon it, or, so that no one can reuse it if they know they might have a disease.
The reason it gets left behind is because after getting high they usually wander off because staying in the same spot that they got high makes them feel unsafe. </p>
<p>Only reason I know any of this is because I live near PDX and watch plenty of addicts do exactly this. You’re lucky your addicts bend their needles. Ours either cap them or discard them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It happens over time from reusing a syringe too often. It can bend when you cook it up and press the needle down in to the container you used. I know this from personal experience in fact I have a bunch of bent needles right now</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
