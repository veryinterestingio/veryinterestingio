		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can (and many people do) chew fresh herbs, either for their taste or their perceived health benefit.</p>
<p>But fresh herbs only stay fresh for a very short time after being picked. Within a couple of days they're usually starting to go limp, to lose some of their flavour, and generally to be less desirable.</p>
<p>So the answer to that is to dry the herbs and distribute them in their dried form. But then they're quite unpalatable: putting a handful of dried herbs into your mouth is not far different from shoving in a handful of sawdust!</p>
<p>However if you steep the dried herbs in hot water for a few minutes, you get a reasonable compromise: a product that can be easily distributed and stored for months, along with an experience for the consumer of something that tastes good and isn't unpleasant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just adding a note about cannabis. THCA isn’t psychoactive, but once it’s heated (the technical term is decarboxylation), it becomes THC which is psychoactive. That’s to say, the chemistry of plants changes when you add heat.</p>
<p>Edited to add: that’s why you can eat a bud of cannabis without any harm or true high, because there are only trace amounts of activated THC in the flower.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
