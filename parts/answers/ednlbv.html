		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s a couple reasons why you might get them. Sometimes they’re caused by stress, hormones, biting the area, or even eating very acidic foods like oranges and pineapple. The sores are basically little wounds, so if you irritate the lining of the mouth enough, you’ll get a sore. They sometimes taste like metal because of the iron in your blood, and as for feeling weird, you’re poking a little wound. There’s a lot of nerve endings there. Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who suffers from chronic canker sores and who has looked into why they appear, I can say that doctors don’t really know why they appear or what triggers them. There are some theories as to why, maybe a species of bacteria or stress or both, or maybe an autoimmune reaction. But my cure is to put a large grain of salt directly against the sore and hold it until the pain goes away (it’ll hurt like a bitch). For me this shortens the recovery time dramatically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
