		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The bacteria in there &quot;go dormant&quot; although that is not a biological term. Since their cellular structure is very simple, the stress of being frozen doesn't damage them to the extent that freezing eukaryotes does. Usually, the solution we used in lab for freezing bacteria for long term storage is called &quot;glycerol stock&quot; <a href="https://www.addgene.org/protocols/create-glycerol-stock/" target="_blank">https://www.addgene.org/protocols/create-glycerol-stock/</a> this addgene website is very trustworthy, it is what universities use for sending each other bacteria/plasmids. They say that a stock is good for years at -80c (conventional freezers in our homes are only -20c).
Your &quot;clean slate&quot; situation is known in scientific terms as &quot;sterilization&quot;. This requires complete death of any bacteria in the sample, freezing is not a method of sterilizing, this is usually done with heating (such as autoclaving or industrial pasteurization processes).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mold produces Spores(mold eggs) and they survive freezing(and high temps).  So the idea is to not leave food out long enough for mold to mature to spore production.  Remember, cheese is mold and everything is a “little” moldy, but spores are nasty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The bacteria goes dormant in the case of freezing. With the exception of listeria, most bacteria can't even divide and gather nutrients in fridge temperatures, much less a freezer!</p>
<p>When it's thawed, the very same bacteria warms up and goes back to doing it's bacteria thing, that's why it's important to thoroughly heat up frozen foods using an oven or microwave.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
