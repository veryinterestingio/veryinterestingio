		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sole is made of an especially soft and finely treaded rubber that allows more contact with the surface, increasing friction and grip between the two. </p>
<p>Tread pattern is also a factor, slip resistant shoes might have deeper and more numerous treads that increase the surface area available to make contact with the ground.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to be a bartender and it blew my mind how many times the girls I worked with would hurt themselves and spill drinks slipping everywhere. They refused to get the special shoes because they didn't look cute enough. There's probably a market for that</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It works along the same idea as how treads on tires keep you from hydroplaning, if I’m not mistaken. </p>
<p>You have a bunch of grooves on the bottom which help channel water and bits of food and stuff so that you aren’t just standing on an entire layer of water. This, like with tires, sacrifices a little bit of traction on dry ground due to the lack of surface area, though usually isn’t really detrimental.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, from what I’m reading in other answers, there’s a tiny layer of fluid that makes a surface slippery. Regular shoes sit on top of this layer and slide all over. Slip-resistant shoes have little channels  and treads that move the fluid layer and let the rubber sole make contact with the ground creating traction</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two aspects:</p>
<p>1) Friction depends on both materials - even if the ground is slippery, it will be less slippery wrt some materials. </p>
<p>2) Profile can prevent a water film from forming - others have already explained that well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
