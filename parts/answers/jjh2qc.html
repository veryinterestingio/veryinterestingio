		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the time an overactive pituitary gland that causes gigantism is caused by a tumor causing the gland to secrete more of the hormone for growth. The pituitary gland however is a very important gland that causes all sorts of other changes in the body with it's hormones. This is why it's not worth risking messing with it if not necessary. By trying to makes more growth hormone you could cause others to enter the body which could cause very unfortunate side effects</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

At the end of the day, being short just isn't that big of a deal.  People with dwarfism (achondroplasia) have a whole different issue, which wouldn't be fixed by HGH.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They can but only within a certain time frame. They can administer growth hormones for a child whose endplates have not fused yet (ergo have the ability to grow). They typically watch for below average growth with age/bmi monitoring and if it is critical then can address it accordingly.</p>
<p>Thus typically after puberty itâ€™s not possible</p>
<p>Example of the opposite where there is excessive growth hormone during certain stages of life:
Before puberty results in gigantism
After puberty results in acromegaly</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Once your growth plates close near the end or some time after puberty, there's no more growing really. Supraphysiological amounts of hgh, igf etc won't make your height or much else increase after your skeletal system has decided enough is enough. These treatments would have to happen before the closure of growth plates if there were changes possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
