		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Short answer:</strong> Maybe. Maybe not. It depends what you mean by 'dark.' </p>
<p><strong>Long answer:</strong> There are two ways to interpret this question.</p>
<p>The first interpretation is that the room is somehow, magically, completely devoid of any and all photons. If that's the case, you'll see nothing, no matter what you do. In order to communicate information via light, a photon needs to travel from the mirror to your eye where it can be detected and the information sent to your brain. </p>
<p>But, of course, 'photonless' rooms don't really exist. Everything has some finite temperature in our universe, meaning all these things are constantly radiating electromagnetic radiation like a black body. Hot things, like the sun and fire and me, shine brilliantly producing many photons in the visible part of the spectra. But just because something is too cold to emit visible light doesn't mean it's not emitting photons!</p>
<p>Humans, being near 300 Kelvin, are constantly radiating infrared photons, photons with slightly less energy than visible light which are not detectable to our eyes, <a href="http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/uploaded_files/graphics/high_definition_graphics/0008/1341/sig08-004_Ti.jpg?1315346777" target="_blank">but are totally detectable with fancy electronics!</a> This is what you're seeing in that image- and it turns out a black trash bag is actually transparent (like glass!) to infrared radiation, so we can see the man's infrared emission right through it!</p>
<p>So, if you're in a dark room facing a mirror, and you put on infrared goggles, will you see yourself? Most likely! Most mirrors are coated with either silver or aluminum, which are highly reflective in the visible range and into wavelengths slightly below the visible range, so they reflect infrared radiation well. This is why those heat lamp things you see this time of year have those mirrored parts- it does a good job of focusing the heat down to where its needed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a common problem with people asking hypothetical physics questions that include an impossible element; the answer is usually either 'there's no way to answer because the premise is impossible' or 'it entirely depends on how your underspecified impossible element works.'</p>
<p>In this case: to 'see' something is to gain true information about it.  There's no way to 'see' something without interacting with it in some way; usually this is done by having some kind of particle/wave interact with it, then interact with you.</p>
<p>If your magical version of 'seeing' includes some type of particle first bouncing off your body then the mirror then back to your body (which is how a mirror works with light), an that particle has a different reflectance function for your body than it has for the rest of the room, then yes, you will see yourself in the mirror.</p>
<p>If the magical vision works via any other method, and 'dark' means there is truly absolutely zero EM radiation in the room within the range that the mirror reflects (also near/totally impossible), then no, you won't see a reflection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You'll have to be more specific. If there's no light, then you mean something different by the word &quot;see&quot; than the usual meaning. If you tell us how we'd &quot;see&quot; in the dark (echolocation? non-visible light like infrared or radar?), we can tell you whether a mirror would work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By completely dark I assume there is no light at all. If you still can see that means your eyes aren't light sensors.   </p>
<p>If what you use too see is reflectable by the mirror, you would be able to see yourself in it. Otherwise, it would be like trying to find your reflection on a concrete wall.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If completely dark room you mean a room that is void of light spectrum visible by human eyes, than yes - you still could see other bands of light, which would be reflected off of mirror.</p>
<p>But this question is moot, since if you were somehow able to see in a dark room, it would be either with some kind of technology or it no longer would be a dark room anymore since your eyes would be able to see other bands of light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
