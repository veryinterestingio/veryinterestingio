		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By hot liquid, you probably mean hot water.  Water dissolves simple carbohydrates (sucrose being the most common sugar in a cookie; sucrose is a disaccharide, formed of two different  sugar molecules joined together in a solid, covalent bond), which help the cookie stick together.  Hot water dissolves them more readily (quicker) and at higher concentration (more sugar dissolved in a given volume of water) than does cold water.  Keep in mind that this is not melting, which is a common misconception.  Sugars do not melt in water - they dissolve.  People think they melt because a higher temperature allows the sugar to dissolve faster and in greater amounts.  Again, this is not melting.</p>
<p>Thinking of non-aqueous liquids, hot vegetable oil would probably cause a cookie to fall apart faster than cold vegetable oil as well, but because in this case the oil is dissolving the fats, which would be congealed and sticky in the cookie, helping it hold together as well.  It's a general rule that the solubility (amount you can dissolve, per volume of liquid) of a solid increases in a liquid as the temperature is increased, although some solids are not soluble in certain liquids at all.  For example, table salt is not soluble in vegetable oil or mineral oil at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everything is made up of molecules. All molecules are vibrating all the time. Hotter things have a faster vibration. Therefore more collisions occur when something is hotter. Therefore adding a hot liquid will break something down quicker than a cold liquid due to the increased amount of collisions and vibrations!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
