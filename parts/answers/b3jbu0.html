		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When a seed is shed from the parent plant, it's in the state of dormancy; contains very little water and is metabolically inactive ( no respiration and thus no energy ), so it doesn't grow. However, when it's put in soil where there's water, it basically absorbs the water which stimulates the production of plant hormone called gibberellin. This hormone, in a series of steps, allows starch to be broken down into maltose. Maltose is then converted to glucose which is respired producing energy; allowing seed to germinate and grow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/byodiftera has a good answer, I just wanted to add that some seeds require something else to happen to them before they germinate. Like scarification or fire. I'm pretty sure avocados wouldn't exist without us because they had to go through the digestive tract of a giant sloth to germinate. Neat stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Seeds have many different germination triggers.   For example, some require scarification ( scratching or thinning of the seed coat).  Others are triggered by chemical compounds- for example - chemicals produced by wood smoke are triggers for proteas.  Temperature can also be a trigger.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Afaik, they have different triggers, but most plants in moderate climate work with moisture + temperature.</p>
<p>Equatorial plants of course will have developed different triggers, since there is no freezing in winter, also meaning there is no &quot;bad time&quot; to grow.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>A lot of seeds work by activating when it is freezing (shell cracks) which causes water to enter the seed when it gets warm and that activates the process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
