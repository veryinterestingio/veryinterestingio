		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how far back you’re asking about. </p>
<p>Mostly, for eras preceding the written word we have to make a lot of guesses using what we know about modern humans, paired with artifacts found around human remains. These artifacts include things like tools, buildings, and personal objects. These things give us clues about the people and time period, and anthropologists sort of piece the rest together into a cohesive story. But they’ll be the first to tell you that it’s a lot of guesswork. </p>
<p>Once we start getting into the time of the written word, though, it starts to get a little more clear. Now, not only do we have artifacts, landmarks, etc, but we also have written records. And anthropologists will take things like laws, religious texts, diaries, tax documents, etc and they use all of these clues to put together a story of the time. </p>
<p>In addition, when combining the work that anthropologists and historians do with the hard sciences (like biology, chemistry, and geology) we can explore the relationship between people and their environments and get even more “proof” of things that happened. </p>
<p>Historians tend to look for confirmation of the facts in as many sources as they can find, but sometimes it’s still a bit of a guessing game. And it’s made muddier when you consider the phrase “history is written by the victors”. But that plays into social and racial issues that is a whole other can of worms when we question the veracity of historical “facts”.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a bit of just survivor bias when you think about these things.   </p>
<p>When you hear detailed historical accounts its usually because its something that would have been recorded many times and we found a lot of things about it. So we know about Julius Caesar and Alexander the Great and Xerxes and the Three Kingdoms in China and the Kahn Mogolian empire etc...<br />
But pick some random place or person and its very unlikely we know much about it.<br />
Naram-Sin was the 37th King of Assyria... should be an important person, we know his name because he's on a list of kings. We know he was the former king's son...and that's about it, we don't even know when he reigned or anything he did.   </p>
<p>When we do know its usually a case of preserved documents and contemporary kingdoms around the area also making note of it.<br />
When there's a new Roman Emperor, you'll probably find records mentioning it from Persia to Portugal.<br />
You only hear about the parts we know, we don't know the vast majority of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We dont know, we make &quot;reasonable guesses&quot;.</p>
<p>Lets say I want to know your name. I can ask you, and it is probably reasonable to assume this is your name. Now, I could be skeptical of it and ask for ID. But if I keep on being skeptical, I could think it was forged and check it is legit. But then of course, someone in the administration could have tampered with the records. And so forth, and so forth.</p>
<p>Much simpler to assume you told me your real name the first time, and just adjust my guess later if a proof of the contrary comes forward. Those &quot;reasonable guesses&quot; are the basis for interpretations and that is what historians usually argue about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer this question you need to consider types of sources for information:</p>
<p>Primary sources would be from the time period itself. These can be people writing about it (ex. Pliny the Younger writing letters to Tacitus about the eruption of Vesuvius), objects/art (vases, mosaics, etc) from the period, architecture, and even bones.</p>
<p>Secondary sources are people from later time periods (anywhere from 100 years later to now) writing about the time period based on their own research. </p>
<p>By combining these two things with an emphasis on primary sources historians can come to an ever-evolving understanding of what historical periods were like. This knowledge is always being added to whenever a new study/artefact comes to light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By putting huge effort into it actually. History is an effort of a giant amount of scientists who are working every day on little puzzle pieces which they put together slowly. Some parts of history are well documented, others have almost no written record. Many things can be explained with objects like tools from the time, pieces of everyday life and even feces (do we say poo in eli5?). Lots and lots of very clever people are piecing history together. Even then authors of popular books and movies have to guess a lot of things because for many topics we don't know enough to really reconstruct a whole society.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
