		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not only can birds eat them— and they do— birds are better at spreading the seeds. They don’t chew and destroy them, and they poop them out over a large area because they fly.</p>
<p>So capsaicin is thought to <em>help</em> the peppers proliferate because stopping mammals from eating them leaves more available for birds to eat, and they’re the ones that help the plant spread the most.</p>
<p>Of course humans got around this by deciding they liked eating the peppers anyways, but on the other hand being domesticated by humans is a <strong>huge</strong> win in terms of the plant being protected, nurtured, and spread to a wider area, so I’d argue it was an excellent evolutionary trait.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>well you already got your answer but i'll go on anyways, a lot of organisms co-evolve along side other ones. in the case of spicy plants they have birds in mind for their proliferation, as noted birds cannot detect spicy or taste spicy so they are not deterred by the heat as other animals are. this was designed if you will to ensure birds are the only thing eating them. why? well as you noted plants have dispersal methods for their seeds, and instead of using wind or other factors, they are counting on birds to carry their seeds far and why and provide new places to grow.</p>
<p>now the wrinkle in their plan is humans. humans ate spicy, got pain from it, but decided, &quot;hey i like this&quot;. in fact humans are basically the confusing kryptonite to the plant kingdom, many things designed to deter certain predators we like. obviously spicy, but take mint, mint is meant to deter bugs, but again we eat it and say yum. same with other things like spices and mustard. we basically crap in the face of all plants</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is why birdseed may have capsaicin added to it.  It's for bird feeders that might be in a place that could get raided by squirrels.  The squirrels will feel the heat and be deterred, whereas the birds won't care, and be able to comfortably eat the birdseed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
