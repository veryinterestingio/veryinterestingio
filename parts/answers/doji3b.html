		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you work out, your body is basically increasing the amount of blood flowing all around. Things are opening up, and blood is getting where it needs to go very easily because your muscles also help squeeze the blood around. Also your brain is drugging you with endorphins which help you to return to calm after working out.</p>
<p>When you are stressed to the point that your heart rate is increasing, none of those other muscles are helping. You're just sitting there making your heart work harder. None of the blood vessels are opening, so there's just so much more force required to push all that blood just with one little heart. Also your body is flooded with cortisol, a corrosive hormone that causes fight or flight feelings basically. You want to run away, and your body is preparing for that, but you're not going to run away, so it hurts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>When we stress our bodies with exercise, it opens the veins and makes blood flow easier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Having a high heart rate isn't healthy or unhealthy.  Cardiovascular exercise is healthy, increased heart rate is a sign you are doing it right.  Excessive stress can be unhealthy, and an increased heart rate can be a sign you are overstressed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
