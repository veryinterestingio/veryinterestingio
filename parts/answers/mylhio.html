		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For appendicitis in particular, yes. I believe the appendix wasn't properly identified as an organ until the 15th century, and the first appendectomy wasn't performed until the 18th century. So yes, people would probably end up dying from appendicitis before that, with an unknown cause of death.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, pretty much. Go along any old graveyards and you'll see ample amounts of dead children and teens. If you're living somewhere like me, you'll see some with the &quot;cause&quot; of death. Many times, it's passed suddenly away in his sleep, or was taken too soon. A lot of the time, people just had these unknown ailments that did them in.  Some premodern surgery could crudely save lives, but ultimately, a lot of people died from things that wouldn't be a major issue nowadays in modern society</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is yes, this is in part why the average life expectancy has increased so much in the past century.</p>
<p>Most people find this hard to believe but the chances of dying before the age of 5 in the early 20th century in the US was as high as 1 in 3.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
