If both people are getting vitamins but running short on calories, a fat person will last longer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There was an interesting csse a few years back where a morbidy obese man told his doctors he wasn't going to eat, so they checked him into a hospital and he starved himself for roughly 3 months, while getting vitamins etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mostly yes.</p>
<p>The fat reserves contains lots of energy. However we need to get certain nutrients that cannot be produced from fat alone. Beyond a certain point everyone dies, fat or not.</p>
<p>If we instead give the persons a very limited amount of food the nutrients can keep both alive for longer, with the fat person likely living much longer than the slim one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Fat is just food that the body stored for later. Morbidly obese people can go for a very, very long time without intaking any food at all because their body just uses up the fat stores (the longest documented water fast lasted over a year with the manâ€™s starting weight being over 200kg).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
