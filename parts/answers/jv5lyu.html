		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The concept of citizen science is wonderful and it's great to see it in action here! I have 2 questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How do you manage authorship when it comes to the publication? From the article, it seems that there were a few data points that relied on the citizen scientists, but I can't tell if they're identified on the paper (I'm on mobile)</p>
</li>
<li>In biology people have also used crowd-sourced analysis to solve puzzles like protein folding, but citizen science hasn't really gained traction (I might be wrong here, but I haven't seen a lot of talk about it in the past few years). What has made Unistellar succesful in getting people to participate and contribute?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
