		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Repeaters and extenders are similar. Just hopping the wireless signal further. These can sometimes be on separate subnets / ssid. Extenders are like having a second router that is hardwired over Ethernet to the first. While repeaters use wifi to bounce (degrading speeds)  </p>
<p>Wireless bridge (or repeater bridge) letâ€™s your primary router handle all DCHP and subnets. This allows devices to communicate with each other more seamlessly. Usually done through the same SSID with roaming handled by signal strength. This mode leaves all secondary routers to act as wireless APs</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It can be more complex, but keeping it simple:</p>
<p>Repeater:  Takes rf signal and repeats the signal.   Generally has to be same channel, and can only repeat the signal as well as it can hear it. Will add latency to connection.</p>
<p>Extender:  Same principal as repeater, but operates on a separate channel.  Has to be in good hearing range of main rf signal or it wont work efficiently.   Can have a different ssid broadcasting while still being the same network.  Uplink can be wired or wireless.</p>
<p>Bridge:  Connects (bridges) wired infrastructure w/ a wireless (point-2-point) connection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.faceofit.com/bridge-vs-repeater-vs-extender/amp/" target="_blank">https://www.faceofit.com/bridge-vs-repeater-vs-extender/amp/</a></p>
<p>Repeaters, repeat. One listens to the core wifi network and sends the signal to device 2. Device 2 then acts like another access point you can connect to on the same network as the core network. Note, this is NOT an amplified signal or an amplifier, unless your equipment explicitly says so. That is the job of an amplifier. This signal has merely been repeated.</p>
<p>An extender is a bit confusing to interpret based off of the name. It works like a repeater, however the key distinction is that device 2 creates a new network you connect to.</p>
<p>A wifi bridge connects wifi-incompatible devices. Devices connect to the bridge via hard line and the bridge communicates with the wireless router. The connection to a network is via the bridge, and the bridge talks to the router on your behalf.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To make it simple, a wireless repeater enhances the range of your <em>wireless access point</em> (AP) by retransmitting all of its radio signals. </p>
<p>A wireless extender is the same thing with a different name, although it usually implies that it retransmits the original WiFi network name (SSID), too. A wifi repeater can also be set up like that, or you can create a new SSID.</p>
<p>Wifi bridge is slightly different. It is meant to connect two or more <em>wired</em> networks via WiFi. Like building a bridge between two islands heh. But in practice, it is trivial to create a Wifi Bridge that also works as a wifi repeater.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
