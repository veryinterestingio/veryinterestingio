		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sneezing is generally a semi-involuntary process that is caused by histamine release triggering nasal nerves to your brain to cause an involuntary muscle contraction/relaxation for you to expel air and mucous. The histamine release is caused by outside  stimulus like mucous or a nose irritant. There needs to be enough histamine to trigger enough nerve cells for your brain to send a signal for you to sneeze. If you start to build up histamine but not enough is released within a short amount of time, then you may feel it coming but then go away. Now this is a biochemical process but there is a psychological aspect where it can be definitely seen where you tend not to sneeze when doing important things or your in the middle of something, unless your sick and the histamine overpowers it . The science of sneezing is still widely researched and we are finding things out about pathways all the time in regard to sneezing, smell, and neural processing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
