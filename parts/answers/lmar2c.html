		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On the ISS the radiators are extremely efficient. They actually don't turn completely edge on to the sun,  because they could actually radiate away so much heat that the internal cooling loop (which is water based) could freeze.</p>
<p>They're also highly absorptive, which is important when the ISS is in the shade of the planet. The radiators actually turn so that they fully face the earth, so that the infrared coming from the planet can also help keep the panels warm enough to not freeze.</p>
<p>A simple form of the equation for black body radiation is:
P = AsT‚Å¥</p>
<p>P is the power radiated. A is the surface area it is emitted from. s (normally sigma, but I'm typing this on my phone) is Boltzmann's constant. T is the temperature of the surface. </p>
<p>In reality, this is actually a much more complicated problem. Typically, finite element software (similar,  mathematically, to software used to solve complex structural analysis) is required to do thermal analysis of any amount of complexity for space systems. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From the source below, each ISS radiator assembly (there are 6 total) pumps about 7000 kg of ammonia per hour and is able to radiate 70 kW continuously. The total area per radiator assembly is 23.3 x 3.4 meters. If I'm interpreting the document correctly, the ammonia begins it's journey through the radiator assembly at 3degC and exits the radiator at around -40degC. </p>
<p>The equations used for radiation are based on the Stefan Boltzmann law. The equations used for the convective heat transfer using the ammonia are in the field of &quot;Forced convection heat transfer in pipes&quot;.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Radiation does work really well when the desired cold temperature is around room temperature. It is less efficient for infrared telescopes where you want the detector to be at very near absolute zero. </p>
<p>The James Webb Space Telescope has over a few square meters of radiator (I forget exactly how much) to help cool the warmer detectors. They collectively dissipate about 1 watt of energy, or one old school incandescent Christmas tree bulb. </p>
<p>The coldest detectors (gathering mid-infrared energy)  can't use these radiators. They are actively cooled by a two stage refrigerator system using liquid Helium as the working fluid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
