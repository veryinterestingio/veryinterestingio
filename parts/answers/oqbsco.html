		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Acquired alcohol tolerance is caused by several different mechanisms. The first and probably most important is just behavioral compensation. Frequent heavy drinkers tend to automatically adjust certian kinds of behaviors and learn techniques, ways of acting and processing information, that make them appear less drunk to others and even feel less drunk themselves.</p>
<p>There are also chemical mechanisms of tolerance that can change in response to regular drinking, too, though. In the central nervous system, changes to the density of certain receptors and enzyme pathways will dampen the effects of ethanol. There's a fine line between these changes and behavioral compensation. They're really probably the same thing, but at different scales.</p>
<p>These mechanisms don't reduce the amount of alcohol, they just change the way the person acts in the presence of alcohol. However, there are also metabolic tolerance mechanisms, like the proliferation of cells in the liver that have upregulated production of alcohol dehydrogenase. This mechanism will lead to a faster breakdown of alcohol that enters the body and so prevent BAC from getting as high even if the same amount of alcohol is consumed.</p>
<p>In most cases, all of these mechanisms are happening in combination, though very heavy drinkers will eventually reverse their metabolic tolerance once liver damage becomes severe enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No</p>
<p>Their brain is adapting to higher levels of alcohol</p>
<p>Example:  I work as a nurse on a substance abuse crisis unit.</p>
<p>We once had a guy walk, under his own power, into our lobby to be assessed for admission.  You coukd smell the alcohol from 10 feet away.  We had him blow into a Breath-a-lyzer and he blew a 0.52%.  </p>
<p>That is 6.5 times the legal limit</p>
<p>Most woukd be on their way to a dirt nap as they approach 0.3%</p>
<p>For this guy, it was just a regular Friday night.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Studies indicate legal and medical checklists don't correlate that well with BAC, possibly because chronic drinkers are better at hiding their drunkenness.  <a href="https://academic.oup.com/alcalc/article/48/4/386/534528" target="_blank">Link</a>.</p>
<p>So it is hard to say.  Heavy drinkers believe they can &quot;hold their liquor&quot; but they are bad at estimating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Their BAC shouldn't differ from their usual range. Although their tolerance may increase meaning that that same BAC might not effect them as much. That aside, everyone is different, and their bodies respond differently. Hope that makes since.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
