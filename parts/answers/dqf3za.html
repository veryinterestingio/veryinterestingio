<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium</a></p>
<p>Titanium is the ninth-most abundant element in Earth's crust (0.63% by mass)[22] and the seventh-most abundant metal. It is present as oxides in most igneous rocks, in sediments derived from them, in living things, and natural bodies of water.[5][6] Of the 801 types of igneous rocks analyzed by the United States Geological Survey, 784 contained titanium. Its proportion in soils is approximately 0.5 to 1.5%.[22]</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can speak for the FnB industry in some measure where substitutes are being sought and used. My hunch is that if other industries find substitutes, running out of TiO2 wouldn't affect as much. Further, thanks to the current slowdown and the US China trade standoff, the overall TiO2 market seems to be headed for a slowdown, postponing the depletion.</p>
<p>Essentially, substitution (and/or process modifications) would be key to offsetting any after-effects of TiO2 depletion.</p>
<p>For what's being done by at least one player in FnB, check here: <a href="https://sensientfoodcolors.com/en-us/research-development/two-new-solutions-replace-titanium-dioxide/" target="_blank">https://sensientfoodcolors.com/en-us/research-development/two-new-solutions-replace-titanium-dioxide/</a> </p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's simply going to become more and more expensive until it is cheaper to recycle the one we dump rather than digging into a rather conveniently high concentration mineral deposit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If we come close to depletion and the price rises dramatically--and no suitable substitutes or recycling schemes are found--then the price may become enough to justify extraction from the moon, which appears to have quite significant supplies of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
