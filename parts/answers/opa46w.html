		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Testing kits that check for the presence/absence of a virus work best if your sample is likely to have a lot of virus in it.  There’s more virus deep inside your nasal cavity than in your mouth.  There’s still plenty of virus in your mouth to infect someone, but not enough to produce a conclusive positive on a test.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many studies showing that this is a viable way of detecting the virus. Some will actually show higher sensitivity with the saliva vs. nasopharyngeal tests. Meta-analyses say the two methods are not statistically different. Saliva collection is preferable because it is more comfortable for the patient and also doesn't require a healthcare professional in PPE to get a sample. Here is one of the earlier studies about it, there are many more by now <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320302139" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320302139</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can do saliva tests.  They are just as good as nasopharyngeal, but the Healthcare field can be pretty hesitant to spemd the time needed to validate a new collection method when there aren't any significant downsides to the NP collection.  Short term minor discomfort isn't going to make a healthcare system want to allocate some of its already strained resources for a new collection method.  </p>
<p>Remember when hospitals were experiencing a severe PPE shortage?  No good reason to pull PPE from personnel in the ICU to fix short term, minor discomfort.  As the PPE chain caught up, saliva tests began getting released and there are multiple healthcare systems that use them now.  They're just as accurate and obviously more comfortable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quantity vs concentration</p>
<p>There's a lot of virus in your mouth, but it's spread out all over your mouth. Low concentration makes it hard to pick up on a test.</p>
<p>There's a lot of virus deep in your nose, but concentrated in a small volume. Easier to pick up on a test.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
