<p>Let's assume the source of the earthquake is perpendicular to your position and at a fixed depth based on sea level.</p>
<p>Would you or buildings be less effected from the quake in Nepal (lets say 4000-5000 km above sea level) than beeing on german plains (at maybe 200m)? If so, how much/would it be significant?</p>
<p>I guess my question boils down to how much energy the waves lose while traveling through the rocks. As i understand, they don't have much room to 'soothe' before reaching the surface. Thank you.</p>

<p>The distance traveled by seismic waves does generally reduce the intensity, i.e., the waves attenuate as a function of distance and thus the seismic energy conveyed to a point is, in part, a function of the distance between that point and the earthquake source. This is why generally deeper earthquakes produce fewer surface effects and less shaking. However, in detail, <a href="https://wiki.seg.org/wiki/Seismic_attenuation" target="_blank">seismic attenuation</a> is complicated and distance is not the only consideration, so when we're talking about relatively small differences in distance based on different elevations of locations (small differences on the scale of the Earth or even the depth range of most earthquakes which are generally shallower than 20-50 km deep), things like material properties and the presence or absence of major discontinuities (which could increases scattering, see the seismic attenuation link above) can be as (or more) important as the distance traveled by the waves. As another example of the importance of material properties, consider papers looking at global heterogeneity of seismic attenuation (e.g., <a href="https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/206/1/241/2606522" target="_blank">Bao et al, 2016</a>). In short, with reference to just the added distance the waves have to travel, it's not going to be possible to say that generically that the added distance of being at higher elevation with respect to a fixed depth earthquake (i.e., the earthquake hypocenter is 10 km depth with respect to sea level and we're comparing the shaking at 0.2 km vs 4 km above sea level) makes shaking more or less intense without knowing more about where your comparing. You could say that if we assumed all other seismic properties were the same, that in the scenario above the added 3.8 km of distance would cause the waves to attenuate more, but this neglects an extremely important complication.</p>
<p>That complication is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_site_effects" target="_blank">seismic site effects</a>. Basically, the intensity of shaking at a location can depend a lot on the material properties (which is mostly what the wiki link focuses on) but also the topography/geology at the surface. Specifically, features that one might expect in high elevation, rugged areas (i.e., mountainous topography) have been shown to amplify seismic waves, basically increasing the intensity of shaking. Specifically, both isolated &quot;hills&quot; or peaks (e.g., <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0267726116304559" target="_blank">Poursartip et al, 2017</a>) and lots of deformed contacts between different types of rocks near the surface (e.g., <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013795218321240" target="_blank">Luo et al., 2020</a>) have been shown to significantly amplify the shaking at the surface in these areas. Depending on the details, these  effects can quickly outpace any &quot;benefit&quot; of the extra attenuation distance. As a tangible example, these types of seismic site effects have been demonstrated to &quot;pop&quot; large boulders (e.g. several thousand kg boulders) out of the ground and into the air briefly (e.g. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00288306.2012.698627" target="_blank">Khajavi et al, 2011</a>).</p>

<p><strong>No, definitely not, do not do this</strong>. In addition (and related) to the seismic site effects discussed at the end of the preceding section, a significant concern during (and in the time following) an earthquake in mountainous topography are earthquake induced landslides (e.g. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0038080620329929" target="_blank">Sassa et al., 1996</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0267726199000123" target="_blank">Rodriguez et al., 1999</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013795200000430" target="_blank">Papadopoulos &amp; Plessa, 2000</a>, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2007GL031337" target="_blank">Meunier et al., 2007</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X08004536" target="_blank">Meunier et al., 2008</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001379521100144X" target="_blank">Wasowski et al., 2011</a>, etc). The prevalence of these is likely in part related to the seismic site effects that serve to amplify shaking in rugged topography (this is discussed in the two Meunier papers linked). The risk of these are not restricted to during the earthquake. The amplified shaking (coupled with material that may already be near failure without shaking) can &quot;prime&quot; landscapes such that there can be large amounts of landslides that occur after an earthquake, during the first (or first few) major rain events that occur. This is discussed a bit in some of those linked papers above as well.</p>
<p><strong>In summary,</strong> seismic waves do attenuate (i.e., lose energy) with distance, but other factors can be quite important in this attenuation, so generally it's hard to say that the increased distance between you and the earthquake source from being at higher elevation would matter much. That being said, depending on the details, even if there was extra attenuation of waves from extra distance, this is likely overshadowed by the important seismic site effects in rugged, mountainous topography which tend to amplify shaking, leading in part to earthquake related hazards like seismicity induced landslides. All told, generally experiencing an earthquake in mountainous topography is more dangerous that in flat, low-lying locations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As opposed to /u/CrustalTrudger 's excellent and detailed answer, I think a practical answer can be given in brief:</p>
<p>If you had early warning for a quake, it would be good to put more distance between yourself and the source of the quake.  You can travel much farther, and much faster, laterally across the surface of the earth than you can vertically.</p>
<p>For example, it takes an hour to travel from Elbe WA to the Paradise Visitor Center on Mt Rainier.  That's an elevation gain of 4200 feet.  If you want to put 4200 more feet of rock between you and the source of an earthquake, you can drive 4200 feet in almost any direction in about a minute.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are truly a layman on this, I am impressed by your question. Wave trapping can cause amplification of certain energy modes in mountains or hills. There are a multitude of factors that also play into the magnitude of the potential amplification effect though, so there is no simple rule that says amplification will always be observed at these types of sites. </p>
<p>Also, I think the term you are looking for is &quot;elevation&quot;, not &quot;altitude&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Geology and geomorphology are very complex factors. I live in Christchurch, New Zealand and we had a 6.3 magnitude earthquake ten years ago, when I was also conveniently a geology student. Because of where the earthquake occurred (underneath basaltic hills) the energy from the quake had an almost amplifying effect on the soft ground of the city nearby. So itâ€™s not enough to say energy will dissipate vertically or laterally in equal measure, the real world has too many variables.</p>
<p>Also, as mentioned above, going up a mountain is a bad idea. People died on the hills in 2011, as a result of rockfall.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Indirectly, it makes a big difference.</p>
<p>At low elevations you are much more likely to have poorly consolidated sediments. Sedimentary basins can experience <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/37586" target="_blank">amplification of trapped seismic energy</a>, and <a href="https://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/abs/10.1680/geot.1993.43.3.351" target="_blank">liquefaction</a> is also a danger for buildings and infrastructure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
