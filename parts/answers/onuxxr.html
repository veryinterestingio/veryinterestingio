		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>TLDR: Your brain has a ridiculously complicated job, and adapts by automating as much as possible. Usually that helps, but sometimes that strategy misfires.</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Your brain is dealing with a HUGE barrage of incoming info, constantly. Every moment it's <em>receiving</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>touch, temp, stretch, and pain info from all your skin nerve endings</li>
<li>vision info from \~95 million light detectors in each eye</li>
<li>smell info from \~50 million smell receptor cells</li>
<li>taste info from \~10,000 taste buds</li>
<li>audio info from \~3,500 sound detectors</li>
<li>messages on position of every body part</li>
<li>messages on gut status (hunger, thirst, bowels, bladder) from abdominal nerves</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, it's <em>sending</em> instructions to all your involuntary muscles (digestion, heart, breathing), any voluntary muscles you're using, plus releasing regulatory hormones in fine amounts. On top of this it's also doing the higher-thinking stuff. Planning, imagining, remembering, anticipating, associating, every micro-decision.</p>
<p>All that to say, your brain is VERY busy. Considering it's basically a lump of fat in a bowl, it's completely spectacular that it works nearly as well as it does.</p>
<p>To help deal with that busy-ness, there's a few key strategies it uses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Filter stuff out. Your brain literally cannot process all the incoming info from the senses, so it prioritizes what seems important and ignores the rest. You're not always aware of your clothes touching your skin, or your own nose in view, even though all those signals are always there.</li>
<li>Finally the answer to your question: Automate as much as possible. We're hardwired to do things with the minimum necessary conscious thought. If you're good at typing, you're not thinking about each individual key press, which lets you type better. If you can play guitar well, you're not thinking about where each finger goes, you're thinking of whole chords and chord progressions. It's the same thing with whole body actions. When you're learning to skate, you 1st have to think of each stride. Eventually you can do it completely automatically, allowing you to focus on spinning jumps or hockey moves.</li>
</ol>
<p>This automation that automatically happens to everything we do repeatedly is KEY to how good humans get at doing things. It's a massive upside for human function over all. However it comes with a small downside - sometimes autopilot kicks on when you don't want it to. Your brain runs the &quot;put this in the fridge&quot; action-sequence when you're attempting to store your wallet. Or you wanted to stop at the store on the way home from work, but accidentally &quot;zone out&quot;, drive your normal route home, and are pulling into your driveway (the end of that auto-sequence and return to conscious thought) before realizing it. Crap! Small price to pay for being a mega-functional species running off a gelatinous supercomputer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had a health and safety lecture a few years back when I was working as an engineer on the construction site. Basically there are several different states in which your brain waves actually change:</p>
<p>Gamma waves - concentration/problem solving,<br />
Beta waves - active mind,<br />
Alpha waves - restful/relaxes,<br />
Theta - Drowsy/sleeping,<br />
Delta - Deep sleep.</p>
<p>Basically, when you don’t have to concentrate on a task (usually because you’ve done it so many times) you brain can actually enter Alpha mode. Often it happens when you’re driving a familiar route and you get to where you were going but can’t actually remember the journey.
It’s also a big problem on construction sites (hence why we had to attend the lecture) because tradesmen who are so experienced at their jobs that they don’t need to concentrate on it, like painters or plasterers, can end up walking off scaffolding or falling down holes because they’re entered into a meditative alpha sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its called  a heuristic a short cut for the brain so like with sight, we have to make a best guess about what we see due to past experiences. So what seems involuntary is actually a probable best guess from the brain to move a leg due lack of blood flow etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve had a long standing interest in this due to an event in my life when I experienced my body/ mind acting on auto pilot. I walked into a convenience store one morning and all at once I noticed 6 ppl laying on the floor, smelled this copper smell and could “feel” this wave of panic coming from my right but out of my view. Before any of this registered my body propelled me backwards back out the door just as gunshots started. I was halfway down the block in a sprint before my mind registered that I’d walked in on a robbery and surprised the gunman. Thankfully he missed and ran in the opposite direction but one of the victims did chase after him and started shooting at him. There were a couple of close calls like this. There’s a book titled Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell that’s an excellent resource on this ability and how to train it (spec ops does some of this)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
