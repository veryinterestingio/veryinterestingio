		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the volume of the cylinders of the car. for example, most cars in the EU are 4 cylinders. a 4 cylinder 1.6L has 4 cylinders, each one is 400cc big (0.4L). more cylinder space tends to equal more power and torque, since more fuel can go in to power the car.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gas enters your engine, goes BOOM.
This explosion moves the 'piston', how much this moves is measured in litres, and is known as 'displacement'.
The more litres your engine can move per boom, the more power it has available.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the <em>displacement</em>, which is the <em>change</em> in the volume of the cylinders as the pistons go up and down. If the volume of a cylinder varies between 2 and 3 liters in that process, the displacement of <em>that cylinder</em> is 1 liter. The displacement of the <em>engine</em> is that, multiplied by the number of cylinders.</p>
<p>Displacement is the most meaningful measure of <em>engine size</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Finally one I can answer!</p>
<p>A size of Litres is the measurement of the total volume of all cylinders in the engine.</p>
<p>The formula (a bit more than ELI5) is:</p>
<p>NoC <em> 0.7854 </em> Bore^2 * Stroke</p>
<ul>
<li>NoC = number of cylinders</li>
<li>Bore = cylinder size (usually a tiny bit larger than piston)</li>
<li>Stroke = how far the piston travels</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, litres (L) can be referred to as engine displacement, often measured in cubic-centermeters (cc) and cubic-inches (c.i.) in the states.</p>
