		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, price levels should go down, not up. It was hard and difficult to make the first iPhone; now, it's much cheaper and easier. As things improve - from machines to software to experience - the price of goods should decline. This causes a problem though, that John Maynard Keynes put this way (approx:) If people believe prices are going down, they will put off buying today to buy cheaper tomorrow. Makers won't buy raw materials, figuring they'll be cheaper in the future. Left unchecked, this 'deflationary spiral' can cause recession and depression. </p>
<p>Keynes' remedy was a 'little inflation'. If people believe that prices are going up, they will buy today instead of waiting. Similarly, makers will bid up the prices of raw materials and labour, with the expectation those will be more expensive in the future. The net result is more economic activity than in the deflationary case. </p>
<p>&quot;Stable&quot; prices are very rare, in the sense of all things staying the same, instead of the general price level. Some things go up, and some things go down, according to fashion, supply, and technology. The general price level can stay relatively stable for long periods of time, though. </p>
<p>In the US, from 1813 to 1913, the general price level <em>fell</em> by 38%. In other words, it only $0.62 in 1913 to buy what cost you $1 back in 1813. The decline was an average 0.48% per year. This is obviously good for people trying to live on savings or small incomes. </p>
<p>In 1913, the US got the Federal Reserve. What you could buy in 1913 for $1 would cost you $25.53 in 2013. Or, put another way, $1 in 1913 would only be worth $0.04 in 2013. Not very good for savers or people on fixed incomes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You really have two questions here. One is what causes inflation, which someone else will probably answer, but a bit on the value of goods and services:</p>
<p>The world has a certain amount of goods, land and stuff in it. There's also only so many working hours people can perform. The &quot;Real Economy&quot; in a way has a certain amount of physical things and actions.</p>
<p>Let's say the world has 10 000 cash, that transfers between people, is used to pay for goods and services. In a way, that cash describes or applies, is spread out in a way, across the goods, land and labor.</p>
<p>And the price of things really comes from the RELATIVE value between them. A bread costs 5 and an ipad costs 500, because of the work involved and how much people want each of them.</p>
<p>But let's say someone waved a wand, and all cash doubled.</p>
<p>Adam used to make a paycheck of 100, and went and bought a bread for 5. But now Adam instead has 200 in his pocket. So he decides that - hey- he's going to buy TWO breads, and eat particularly well.</p>
<p>But so does everyone else who usually buys bread. <strong>But the bakery does not have any more bread than before. There's only so much grain being farmed, so much flour made from the grain, so many loves of bread made from the flour, and this remains the same</strong>.</p>
<p>So suddenly there's the SAME amount of bread, but TWICE as many attempts to buy bread at 5.</p>
<p>Through various processes (like: people bidding over each other, the bakery raising prices until there's no longer excessive demand), the price of bread will rise to 10. At this price, Adam only wants to buy 1 bread, just as before, and the demand for bread matches the supply - so it <em>will not happen</em> that the amount of money increases and prices remain the same.</p>
<p>In a way, how many &quot;currency units&quot; a country has in their daily life is completely arbitrary. In the sense that in the US, bread could be 5 and ipads 500, and in another country it could be 50 and 5000. What matters is the amount of real stuff. The money just describes the real stuff.</p>
<p>About inflation, things are set up so that as the economy grows, the amount of money grows just a bit faster. Due to machinery, processes improving etc. the number of actual things grows over time, but the amount of money grows just a bit faster, causing a small bit of inflation. This is considered a good thing.</p>
<p>If the amount of money grows too fast whilst the physical economy is the same or shrinks, inflation will be high, and this is bad, it causes small-scale economic disruption and chaos in various ways</p>
<p>If the amount of money grows too slow or shrinks, whilst the physical economy is the same or grows, prices will actually decrease (deflation), and this is also considered bad.</p>
