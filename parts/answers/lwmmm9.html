		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain is like a trash can. Throughout the day it fills up with garbage, and at night that garbage is slowly removed. If you don't get enough sleep, only some of the garbage gets taken out. Over time, it builds up until your can is almost always full. A full can is bad and makes you fall asleep or hallucinate.</p>
<p>However if you sleep lots and lots, your trash-can can't get under 0% full. It will always only hold a certain amount of garbage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not getting enough sleep doesn’t let the body and brain finish its cycles. The damage and lack of sleep build up (debt)</p>
<p>Once the body is finished with the cycles, that’s it. It can’t store sleep to repair future damage and build future neural pathways. It can only work on what has already been done.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>FYI It’s not exactly true.</p>
<p>You can store up a very limited sleep surplus : it’s called “ prophylactic napping”. It’s essentially done right before an all-nighter. The benefit disappear if you wait. Also it will cover for one night at best.</p>
