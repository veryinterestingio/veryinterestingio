		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think I heard in some documentary about memory we have a couple different kinds of memory. Computers have perfect memory. You just type in a thing and boom. You’re taken right to it. Humans though have “contextual” memory in which they only seem to remember things when something related pops up. Our brains are so weird squishy things </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>unless you make a habit of rattling off lists of books, you don't have folder in your brain labeled &quot;books&quot;. you have memories of highschool which include reading <em>catcher in the rye</em> or the like.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ever since I switched to using the kindle (app) to read books, I’ve started reading a lot more (because I always have my book in my pocket).</p>
