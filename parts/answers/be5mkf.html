		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are other parameters to search for. Distant stars are tracked using two primary things:  &quot;proper motion&quot; (the angle and speed at which they move relative to Earth), and their Doppler shift (indicates whether the star is moving towards or away from Earth).</p>
<p>The &quot;proper motion&quot; is relatively simple to calculate, and is obtained by tracking the star over a period of time (some move <em>extremely</em> slowly relative to Earth). <strong>It will also tell the astronomer where in the sky an already-discovered star is going to be, based on where it was first observed, and where it will be now based on movement over time.</strong> So it's simple to discount what is believed to be newly discovered, if its location matches up with a previously discovered star already in the database.</p>
<p>The Doppler shift doesn't really come into play in this scenario, but is determined by how much the light from the star is shifted towards red or blue - if it's redshifted, it is moving away from us; if it's blueshifted, it's moving towards us. Much like sound waves are compressed when something comes towards us quickly, light wavelength is also compressed in the same way, meaning it looks &quot;more blue&quot;. It could be used to confirm a star as already discovered or &quot;new&quot;, should the location be similar enough to be confused.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The layout of the stars doesn't really change; stars do move relative to the sun and relative to each other, but in most cases it's only noticeable after hundreds, thousands, even tens of thousands of years. So if a certain star is halfway between two other stars, the Egyptians found it there too. </p>
<p>Because of how unchanging the sky is, we can make a coordinate system just like we have one on the surface of the Earth. There are &quot;celestial poles&quot; and a &quot;celestial equator&quot; and a grid with degrees and minutes and seconds. Every star and galaxy known to exist is plotted on this grid and assigned coordinates, and the entire world uses this system.</p>
<p>So if you see something in the sky, all you have to do is look up the coordinates and see if there's &quot;supposed&quot; to be something there. If there isn't, then...well, first you have to get your bearings and make sure your coordinates are right. Then you look at it again. Then you look at it the next night, and then the next. If there's <em>still</em> something there that we didn't notice, then you can call an observatory and see if they can see it there too. </p>
<p>By now, it's unlikely you're going to find a <em>star</em> or galaxy this way, but this is how amateur astronomers discover comets, by running into little fuzzy dots that no one has noticed before.</p>
<p>Planets are discovered a different way. All the planets in the solar system are accounted for (with the possible exception of one <em>very</em> distant candidate), so you won't happen upon one in the sky. We are discovering planets orbiting other stars all the time, but this takes special telescopes using special methods. We've only been doing it for 25 years so the catalog of these planets has been kept nice and tidy from the beginning; if you're looking at a star, you'll already know if someone has found a planet around it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know when you gotta send someone into your room to grab something and you go &quot;okay from the door, look 11o'clock, just to the left of the window&quot;?</p>
<p>Like that but the doorway is earth, 11 o'clock I think is based from our own direction (northern / southern hemisphere for up and down, eastern / western hemisphere for left and right), and the window is any stars around. It gets pretty specific because there's a lookout of stars but computers and accurate telescopes help keep everyone on the same page</p>
<p>Also generally speaking scientists are collaborative so they'd figure out real quick if another group was investigating the same area at the same time for anything interesting, or if a group had done so several years ago</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Astronomer here! I rely on the coordinates of the source. We have also done extensive surveys of the sky at many wavelengths. I just did a project looking at some interesting radio sources for example, so in order to see what the sources looked like in optical light I just entered the coordinates <a href="https://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/AladinLite/" target="_blank">here. </a> I was particularly interested in radio sources coming from within a few hundred million light years from us, and the “SDSS” catalog there for example is complete out to the distances I care about, so if I saw a galaxy at the coordinates I associated it with my radio source. If nothing was there, most likely it was from further away in a galaxy too far to be seen by the survey. There are also catalogs you can search for coordinates to find objects published in the literature, but honestly you save a lot of time by checking out the image before trying to make an association most times. </p>
<p>I hope that helps explain what an astronomer does!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
