<p>Nerves in your skin vs your mouth and throat.</p>
<p>Your internal body temperature is warmer.</p>
<p>And your skin is dry naturally, for the most part. Your mouth/throat is always moist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you look through ELI5, you might find a post about why people prefer to drink cold water than warm water. From memory, the gist is evolution. Warm water allows microorganisms to breed more rapidly than cold.</p>
<p>As for why we don't like being doused in cold water, (I'm sure you know, but this is ELI5) hypothermia.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't give you a real good detailed answer,</p>
<p>but part is that the inside of the body tends to be warmer so it can be nice to have some cooling, but the outside skins tends to be colder so the body tries to keep that warm (and therefore wouldn't like cold water on it if it were already putting in energy to be warm enough)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Volume is also a factor. A glass of water can be rapidly warmed up to be the same temperature as your body, and which point it stops feeling cold. If I poured a glass of water onto you (and somehow preventing it from all pouring off again!) it wouldn’t feel cold for very long.</p>
<p>That’s very different to if you get into, say, a cold bath or the sea, where there is so much water that your body can’t warm it up to the same temperature as you so it still feels cold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
