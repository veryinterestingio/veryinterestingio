		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Evidence in solar system dynamics is usually given of the form &quot;if this has happened, then this must have happened&quot;</p>
<p>If we see a huge crater with an ejecta blanket around it, we must be looking at the site of an ancient impact, for example. This isn't an explanation of what an impactor would be or anyone's personal feelings.</p>
<p>What we see in evidence for the Oort cloud is from several avenues of investigation. We know short period comets, those which have a period of less than 200 years, tend to be aligned with the plane of the solar system (their inclination is low). They did not come from a cloud, but instead from a belt - the Kuiper belt.</p>
<p>Long period comets, those we see in thousand-year orbits, come from random parts of the sky, their inclination is random. Knowing a longer orbital period is a much more distant aphelion, and the comets move more slowly at aphelion, so long period comets will dwell at aphelion, so forming the appearance of a cloud of them. This is fairly basic orbital mechanics, and very well understood.</p>
<p>The next bit of evidence comes from Late Heavy Bombardment. This was discovered during the Apollo missions, although the Soviets learned about it from their robotic sample returns too. The age of the oldest lunar material was significantly younger than anyone could account for. It was 3.8 billion years old, and nobody could tell us why.</p>
<p>This was the case until the Nice models, which showed that, in the early solar system, Uranus and Neptune swapped places during a period of instability caused by Jupiter and Saturn in a 2:1 resonance. Neptune crashed through the early (and very dense) Kuiper belt, scattering everything around, losing its own moons, capturing Triton, capturing Pluto and the plutinos, forming the scattered disc... Yet interactions from Neptune would indeed scatter objects around, and even to very high aphelia, but would only rarely give them enough energy to escape, so these highly scattered objects remained gravitationally bound. </p>
<p>Couple these scattered objects with the ones scattered during plantetary formation, then add in the effects of galactic tides, and their mutual gravity, and we get a slow, but steady, decline in aphelia and rise in perihelia: Their orbits tend to drift toward being circular. This, then, is the Oort cloud.</p>
<p>You won't see any physical evidence, there are no stone tablets or walking trees saying &quot;I am Oort&quot;. The formation happened billions of years ago and we can't time travel.</p>
<p>What we can do, however, is predict its existence and then go to find it. Sometimes this happens quickly: Le Verrier predicted Neptune, and it was rapidly found. Sometimes slowly: Gerard Kuiper had an inkling that there may be a belt just outside Neptune (he didn't do any dynamics work on it, though), from early work done by Leonard (1930), Edgeworth (1943) and Cameron (1962). Nobody actually found one until 1992, when 1992 QB1 was discovered and, six months later, 1993 FW.</p>
<p>Oort cloud objects will be significantly more difficult to observe than the Kuiper belt is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a final year Physics student so I'm sure there are much more qualified people here than me to answer your question, but to my knowledge there is one main reason for the existence of the Oort cloud - and particularly for distinguishing asteroids originating from the Oort cloud from those orginiating from the Kuiper belt and that is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Asteroids originating from the the Oort cloud enter our immediate solar system from a wide range of angles; they can effectively appear at any point in the sky whereas Kuiper belt asteroids tend to appear at relatively small angles to the ecliptical plane (the plane in which the planets orbit as well as the Kuiper belt). The fact that certain asteroids appear to be coming from all directions suggests we are surrounded by a spherical source of these asteroids. Therefore where we first see an asteroid in the sky gives us a big clue as to where that asteroid originated from.</p>
</li>
<li>The time periods (the time it takes to complete one full orbit) of asteroids that originate in the Oort cloud tend to be much longer than those that come from the Kuiper belt. Oort cloud asteroids tend to have time periods longer than 200 years or so (some of them being much longer than that) whereas Kuiper belt asteroids tend to have time periods of much less than that. Longer time periods suggest these asteroids are coming from further away and while it doesn't necessarily suggest we are surround by a shell of these rocks, it certainly suggests the source of these rocks is much further away from us than the Kuiper belt.</li>
</ol>
<p>I would guess that also the metal/silica and hydrocarbon composition of the asteroids in the Oort cloud would be quite different from those in the Kuiper belt due to the differences in their age at formation but I'm afraid I don't know of any evidence to support that.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I would presume that there are some asteroids that have entered our solar system from interstellar space - asteroids that are not bound by the gravitational pull of any particular solar system, and simply drift through space - but it is difficult to be sure of the origins of an asteroid if an orbit cannot be determined.</p>
<p>NB. This was typed on my phone so apologies for any typos or grammatical mistakes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
