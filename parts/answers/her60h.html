		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s multiple things going on. One is that buying something in an airport’s international area can be much cheaper for residents of certain countries. International terminals are sort of like international waters so there’s no import duties or taxes. Luxury goods tend to be taxed at a higher rate so that’s what’s at the airport. (That’s less of an issue now because of decades of trade agreements lowering import duties but some products are still heavily taxed in some countries.)</p>
<p>The stores are also sometimes just there for promotional reasons. People in an airport terminal are typically wealthier than average and are often killing time waiting for a flight. They might not buy anything at the airport but maybe they wander in, see something they like, and buy it from another location (or online) later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know a guy who forgot dress shoes for a big meeting so he had to pop off and drop $500 on some Italian shoe at one of those airport shops.</p>
<p>So with suits, same deal. Airline loses your luggage, you need a suit pronto or your going to lose the Pepsi contract! Probably only happens to 1/10000 people but guess what? 80000 people come through the airport a day. </p>
<p>Jewelry, I forgot a present, I want to buy some luxury items without paying tariffs, whatever. Same deal.</p>
<p>(the people using the services are probably a dozen steps up on the socio-economic ladder than most people and so a $500 shoe is a minor annoyance).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Airport retail space is very expensive (because space is limited and they're provided a valuable, steady supply of above-average income customers). As a result, everything in an airport is either priced higher than normal (food), or is a super high margin item like jewelry, cosmetics, cologne, designer clothes, alcohol, handbags, etc. Some of the super expensive, high margin items make so much profit off just a single sale that it only takes an occasional random purchase to keep them going. Notice how the super high end shops in malls (outside airports) are rarely crowded - they sell an &quot;exclusive&quot; product to the few people willing to part with so much money.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An example might be a watch.  Just like it was suggested, business travelers and tourists a like may want to take advantage of tax and or currency advantages while crossing boarders.  Depending on the country in which you live, luxury goods may be taxed heavily, so on a 10k Rolex, a 10% reduction in sales tax or difference in currency exchange rates vs. local pricing, you are seeing a 1k savings, if not more.  Same logic goes for high end luggage like Tumi where saving taxes could mean a nice meal out at your destination or when you return home. </p>
<p>That being said, you are still held to declare what you've purchased abroad and would be responsible for paying your own countries duty as you are importing goods.  Some will skirt this by not declaring and managing the evidence of purchase, but that would be illegal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
