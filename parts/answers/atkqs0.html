		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your phone switches to being powered directly by your outlet. If youâ€™re using a power bank then the regulator inside will simply stop providing current when it detects the battery is full. I am not an electrician so I may be outdated but I believe regulators can tell through a measure of resistance measured in ohms. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electricity works on demand, not by pushing like water. All the way back to the generator at the power plant, electricity is in the line just waiting for something to say &quot;I need some juice!&quot; Until then, electrical energy sits in the lines as electrons bouncing back and forth between molecules, ready to move again when needed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the charger. Most modern ones simply turn off the circuit so there is no extra energy. Older ones would turn the extra energy to heat which was wasteful at best and damaged the batteries at worst.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the battery. If it's lead acid like a car it turns to heat, boils the electrolyte, decays the lead. Then when it hits the right temperature, boom, explosion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
