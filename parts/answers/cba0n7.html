		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simple Answer: The law has not caught up with the issue yet. The term &quot;flushable&quot; has not yet been defined by the law. Thus the term flushable is open to interpretation. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They can claim it because the government hasn't yet banned it. They can be flushed in some systems, and some types degrade faster than others. The word &quot;flushable&quot; should be removed unless they are safe for all sewage systems. Other things which are not always flushable include facial tissues, paper towels, dental floss, tampons, pads, hair... basically anything except toilet paper and poo. I've flushed many of those things without causing a blockage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You are &quot;allowed&quot; to do whatever you want unless that act is specifically made illegal. It takes a lot (usually a significant risk of direct harm to another person) for an act to be made illegal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
