		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you live in very harsh climates, your immediate action has very direct impact on your community. Small families and tribes have to be very disciplined because nature is harsh - the need to store food, fuel and make adequate shelter requires very close knit and small communities. Since harsh weather typically means gathering food is also difficult - this makes distrust of outsiders almost a necessity for survival. All that and relative isolation too.</p>
<p>Warmer climates make it easier to support higher population densities. Interaction with outsiders are more common. Food and shelter are not as scarce/difficult. </p>
<p>This is an interesting question. Is there a limit to this? What adaptation are we seeing when cities today are super dense? Are people in big cities &quot;colder&quot; than people who live in smaller communities?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're conflating the issues of personal space and sociability. I don't think they're necessarily related.</p>
<p>In Canada, for example most of us (ignoring Vancouver / Toronto for now, because I have no experience of that, I'm from a medium sized city) are just used to having more personal space because we're spread out. Our houses tend to be big and they all have yards. I feel a bit claustrophobic in places like England where everyone lives packed together - and much more so in other countries I have visited, where people will just get right up in your face so you can feel them breathing.</p>
<p>This is particularly noticeable when queuing in some countries. If I'm joining a queue, I'll stand just under a metre behind the last person. This has gotten me weird looks in other countries I've lived in, where people line up so they're basically touching the person's back. I get wildly uncomfortable in these situations.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I don't think we're less sociable. We're super friendly and happy to chat with strangers. We just expect you to stay at arm's length. I want to talk with you, not breathe your air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm interested in ancient Roman/Greek history and I made the observation that what we call &quot;north&quot; and &quot;south&quot; today corresponds vaguely to the separation between the Roman Empire (the south, roughly : the mediterranean world + France and Belgium) and the non-romanised or partly-romanised lands and populations in the north (northern Germany, the northern parts of the English islands etc).<br />
Maybe this has to do with a deep penetration of Latin/Germanic culture ? Or am I totally delusional ?  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
