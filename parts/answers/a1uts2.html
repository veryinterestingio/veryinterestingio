		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To explain what cowboysauce means, each chemical reaction pair has a specific voltage that is dependent on the chemicals.  You cannot change it by making it into a bigger container or larger surface area.  That could change the current but not the voltage.  the only way to get more volts is to place the batteries in a row (in sequence), so each one adds a potential (a voltage), until you have the target total voltage.  Kind of like why a ladder has many steps.  Our legs can only go so high with each lift (just like a single chemical cell can), but if we put lifts in a row (cells in sequence), we can get up pretty high.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

You canâ€™t change the voltage without changing the cell chemistry so your only option is to put cells in series.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/comments/6196/preparing-for-the-iphone-next-rumors-analyzed/268082" target="_blank">a funny quote answering this question</a> from a tech site that I like: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>You don't just call up the battery fairy and ask her to set your battery to a certain voltage</strong>. Instead, a battery's terminal voltage is largely determined by the different compounds that you use as the anode and cathode, hence chemistry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are only so many materials available. You have to work with what exists. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>+1 to the previous guys comments on chemistry.</p>
<p>Also it's partly economics. If you sell a battery with 1.5 Volts it can be used in devices needing 1.5, 3, 6, 18 volts etc by cramming loads of AA Batteries in the back of a device. (I was going to say into the back of a Game Gear but didn't that take 6 C batteries?)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electrons like being on some materials more than others. The amount that electrons like being on a material has a limited range. Imagine the range going from 0 to 5. Now call the scale units voltage. The scale has to end somewhere and that end specifies the maximum voltage that a single battery can have. Other limitations with reactivity and cost limit what we decide to use, but there doesn't exist a pair of materials where electrons prefer one material 244 V more than the other material. We're limited.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
