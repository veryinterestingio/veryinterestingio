		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Investor confidence. You can borrow forever as long as people continue to think you will eventually pay it back. Japan is a technological and industrial powerhouse, and people generally think that even despite its insane debt-to-GDP ratio, their economy is still strong and continue to invest in it. Greece has no real major industry or exports, so it doesn't inspire a lot of confidence. So people stop investing, and the economy crashes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The income analogy isn’t great.  GDP is a measure of “income” for a country, and Japan has more debt as a percentage of GDP (236%) than Greece (178%).</p>
<p>There are three main factors: investor confidence, economic growth, and currency ownership.</p>
<p>On investor confidence, the vast majority of Japan’s debt is funded by Japanese citizens.  They believe in the country and are willing to buy bonds at low rates despite the high debt ratio.  Japan’s government debt is largely self funded by their private citizens.</p>
<p>On growth, consider a doctor who is a resident (making $50k) due to become a surgeon in six months (and then make $500k).  His/her income will increase quickly, and he/she would be a safer person to loan money to than another person making $50k who is at risk of losing their job.</p>
<p>The US, especially recently, has had strong economic growth.  Greece’s economy was stagnant, then shrinking, and is now growing slowly.</p>
<p>Finally, US and Japan own their currency where Greece is bound to the Euro.  Owning your currency allows you to print more money and increase inflation, which decreases your historical debt.  The downside here is that if you inflate too much, you risk investors demanding higher rates going forward to make up for the inflation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Japan is a middle-aged doctor who took out a second mortgage maybe they shouldn't have. They are still wealthy, still have a great, high income job, so people are willing take more chances loaning them money, even if the debt is starting to pile up. If worse comes to worst, they can always sell their vacation condo to make ends meet.</p>
<p>Greece is an assistant manager at Kinkos, who lied on a bunch of credit card applications and lived too large for a few years until it all caught up with them. Even though they owe less than Japan, even as a ratio to their income, their job is much less stable, so the interest is higher and their creditors are much less patient. They also live in their parents' basement, so they have no house to sell to get them out of trouble. And most worrying, they haven't assumed responsibility for the mess they made and spend most of their time blaming other people rather than trying to fix it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The debt composition is hugely different. Japan's debt is almost entirely internal. It is owed to Japanese citizens. Plus, it is issued in yen, which Japan has monetary control over. Plus it is an exports-oriented economy.</p>
<p>Greece's is the exact opposite. It's almost entirely external, owed to foreign institutions and issued to a currency it doesn't control + has a trade deficit economy.</p>
<p>So you kind of see why Japan's prospects of paying its debt are much better than Greece's
Debt to GDP ratio alone doesn't mean much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what people are saying elsewhere in this thread, while the US and Japan have high debt to GDP ratios they also have high total wealth which makes it clear that they can pay back all of their debt.</p>
<p>For instance, according to <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_wealth?wprov=sfti1" target="_blank">this</a> the US has a net worth of ~100tln dollars - more than Europe as a continent. </p>
<p>Japan has a net worth of 23tln.
These numbers are far larger than their debts, and make it clear that they can be paid back.</p>
<p>Greece has a net worth of 975bln dollars, which is less than 3 times their total debt and falling. This does not inspire investor confidence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
