		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say you go to school and get stabbed by the local bully every day.  Over time you evolve ways to deal with this or die. </p>
<p>Some species will evolve quick reflexes to dodge the knife. Better hope those that can dodge get around to producing offspring before the bully finally gets a lucky hit though. </p>
<p>Some will develop tougher skin to block the knife or bigger mass or quick healing to simply ignore and tank the blow.  Others will group up so the bully can only stab one of the flock.  Mass takes energy to maintain, so there'd better be a good food source around. </p>
<p>Others will use intelligence to craft tools like armor.  Hopefully there's some sticks or stones to make something with. </p>
<p>Others will simply accept their death, because their species goes from birth to making babies within a day, and they've already got the next generation cooking at home.  Individuals in this species will only live a day or two before dying, but the species will live on as a whole.  </p>
<p>It's all about how an organism deals with external threats.  Some are better than others at dodging these threats, and have a longer lifespan.  Others simply accept their short lifespan, considering it a design factor and evolve to reproduce often and early.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, there's the r/K selection theory that potentially explains it. </p>
<p>The purpose of life simply for a organism to reproduce and pass it's DNA on to the next generation. There are two different umbrella strategies for doing so according to the theory. </p>
<p>R-selected species tend to occupy ecological niches that are unstable or unpredictable, but have more than enough resources that can support large populations. Unstable basically means that the offspring of the species has a high chance of dying before it reaches reproductive age. So it basically resorts to a shotgun blast strategy for survival. Pump out as many kids as possible, that will grow to adulthood as quickly as possible, and if you're lucky, enough will survive to pass on their DNA. </p>
<p>Since these organisms grow so fast, and there's so many resources available, they can afford a high population without the need for a lot of parental involvement. So there's no evolutionary pressure there for a long life span. Examples of animals like this include mice, house flies, rabbits, and bacteria.</p>
<p>K-selected species tend to occupy ecological niches that are stable and predictable, but are close to or at the limits of the population they can support. Offspring has a high probability of reaching adulthood, but there's a lot more competition for resources. So these species use a strategy that will best allow their offspring to compete. </p>
<p>What they focus on is having their young in small litters that grow slowly, often to larger sizes than r-selected organisms, to make them stronger and thus better able to obtain limited resources. However, this slow growth strategy requires a high degree of parental care to ensure those young successfully reach adulthood. If the parent dies before that happens, it's likely their child will die as well. So there's a strong evolutionary pressure for these species to live at least long enough for their young to survive and thrive independently. And raise enough of those young to adulthood to maintain population numbers.</p>
<p>Take us humans for example. We take about 13-15 years to reach sexual maturity. So you need to at least double that for a parent to raise their child to adulthood. Since we only give birth to one child at a time (usually), and have a long gestation period, we need to live even longer to maintain or grow our population. Women can continue to successfully carry a child to term into their 30s without medical intervention. So they need to live until at least 50 to see a child born that late to adulthood. Which is actually what we do tend to see in pre-industrial societies with limited resources, and limited to no access to medical care. </p>
<p>Or course there are organisms that do buck this tend. Sea turtles                 for example have large numbers of young with high mortality rates, but they live a long time. Newer theories have also come out, but this is still offers a decent general explanation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Extrinsic mortality influences the optimal life expectancy for an organism. If you evolve in a very risky environment where you wont live very long because of external risks (predation/environment), it wouldn't be the optimal use of resources to invest resources in living for a long period of time. This is called Disposable Soma theory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For mammals, number of heartbeats per life is roughly the same for all species. Little animals need to beat fast to keep metabolism up and carry blood and oxygen (larger surface area to mass and smaller volume arteries relitive to body size are two big reasons). Bigger animals do not need to to beat heart as much.</p>
<p>Generally, a mouse and an elephant will beat their hearts the same number of times in a lifetime.</p>
<p>EDIT: it's about 1 billion beats. Humans are WAY off the chart.  Here is a quick link I found with graph at bottom. <a href="http://robdunnlab.com/projects/beats-per-life/" target="_blank">http://robdunnlab.com/projects/beats-per-life/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
