		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fish can be killed by lightning strikes and sometimes are. Swimmers can also be killed by lightning strikes.</p>
<p>Most of the fish are far enough away from the strike (because they are deep under the water) That the electrical energy has spread out and dissipated enough the fish won't get harmed.</p>
<p>The further you are away from a strike, the lower the change in voltage per unit of distance. Similar to how the further you are away from an explosion, the lower the pressure difference per unit of distance.  </p>
<p>I'd also speculate most fish probably run away from storms, as the lightning gets closer, it would be loud as heck in the water, and they would probably leave the area</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Voltage drops linearly along a resistor. If you apply 1000V to a 1m long resistor youâ€™d get 1V across each millimeter.</p>
<p>Current spreads across the cross section of a resistor. Double the cross area and the current through each part of it will be halved. </p>
<p>The ocean is basically a kilometer long, extremely wide resistor. The current will only be focused at the entry point and then quickly spread over a huge area. You are more or less spreading the energy of the lightning strike over a huge volume.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
