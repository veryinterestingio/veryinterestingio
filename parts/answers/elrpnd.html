		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a plumber in British Columbia, Canada, this is the code clause:</p>
<p>BC Plumbing Code 2018:</p>
<p><a href="https://2.2.2.5" target="_blank">2.2.2.5</a> Water Closets In Public Washrooms</p>
<p>- - - 1) When a water closet is installed in a washroom for public use, it shall be of the elongated type and provided with a seat of the open front type.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The reason we are given for this clause is that it is for assistants of disabled persons who may be required to help with the cleaning of their patient.  At least that is what they told us in school.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

For home use itâ€™s not necessary as there are fewer people using the same toilet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
