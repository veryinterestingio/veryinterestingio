		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Semen has three components:</p>
<p>seminal fluid - thick, sticky white stuff produced in the seminal vesicles</p>
<p>prostatic fluid - thin, clear, slightly bluish, slimy and viscous fluid produced in the prostate gland</p>
<p>sperm - actually a tiny proportion of the ejaculate, produced in the testicles</p>
<p>All three are mixed together at the last minute when ejaculation occurs. Their exact proportions depends on many factors, but in general:</p>
<p>the longer since the last ejaculation, the more seminal fluid is available</p>
<p>the longer time that sexual stimulation has occurred, the more prostatic fluid will be available</p>
<p>Ejaculations with a high proportion of prostatic fluid are thin and slippery and tend to sort of explode out of the penis. </p>
<p>Ejaculations with a high proportion of seminal fluid are relatively thick and tend to just sort of ooze out of the penis.</p>
<p>With age, the quantities of both fluids diminishes, and the force of orgasm with it, resulting in most ejaculations being a bit underwhelming. Still feels good, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ol>
<li>Buildup </li>
<li>Hydration levels</li>
</ol>
<p>A significant portion of jizz is not actually sperm and will vary depending on how well hydrated you are. </p>
<p>Additionally, as someone else said if you’re draining your reservoir a few times a day it’s not going to have much pressure behind it vs if you only do it a couple times a week and stay hydrated you might hit the ceiling.  Exaggeration but you get the picture.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Lobster prostates don't get old, they keep you busting nuts that hit the ceiling. Citrus is key, and fellationally speaking that means pineapple. Also celery. Just simple jizzonometry.</p>
<p>This comment section is a goldmine!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
