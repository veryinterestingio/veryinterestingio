		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The common cold is actually a collection of over 200 different viruses that cause similar and typically minor symptoms. It's a pretty significant undertaking to try to develop vaccinations against all of them, and their eventual genetic divergences.</p>
<p>It's not that difficult to cherry-pick a specific virus out of the pile and develop a vaccine against that one, unless the virus mutates rapidly.</p>
<p>If you'd like to read more about the common cold, <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/understanding-common-cold-virus" target="_blank">here</a> is some further reading.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>I'm getting a lot of similar questions. Instead of answering them individually, I'll answer the more common ones here.</p>
<p><strong>Q: 200? I thought there were only 3 or 4 viruses that cause colds?</strong> A: Rhinoviruses, Coronaviruses, Paramyxoviruses are the families of viruses that make up the vast majority of colds, about 70%-80%. It's key to understand that these are families of viruses, not individual viruses. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinovirus" target="_blank">Around 160</a> of those 200 are Rhinoviruses.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Does influenza cause colds?</strong> A: No, we call that <em>the flu</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can bacteria cause a cold?</strong> A: No, not really. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC104573/" target="_blank">Rarely</a>, a bacterial infection will be called a cold from the symptoms produced.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Does this mean I can only catch 200 colds?</strong> No. Not all immunizations last forever. See <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27158/" target="_blank">this</a> paper on the subject if you'd like to know more. /u/PM_THAT_EMPATHY outlined some details that my generalization didn't cover in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/fq1rkq/if_the_common_cold_is_a_type_of_coronavirus_and/flqfiue" target="_blank">this</a> comment.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Does SARS-COV-2 mutate rapidly?</strong> A: It mutates relatively slowly. See <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/fq1rkq/if_the_common_cold_is_a_type_of_coronavirus_and/flqpxr3" target="_blank">this</a> comment by /u/cappnplanet for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will social distancing eliminate this or other viruses?</strong> A: Social distancing is about slowing the spread so that the medical systems are not overwhelmed. It will not eliminate viruses, but it does seem to be <a href="https://qz.com/1824020/social-distancing-slowing-not-only-covid-19-but-other-diseases-too/" target="_blank">slowing other diseases</a> as well.</p>
<p>/u/Bbrhuft pointed out an interesting caveat that may provide a challenge in developing a vaccination. Their <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/fq1rkq/if_the_common_cold_is_a_type_of_coronavirus_and/flu016h" target="_blank">comment</a> is worth reviewing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;common cold&quot; is not a single virus.  It's a term we use to describe a whole lot of different viruses, some of which are rhinoviruses, some are coronaviruses, and others too, all with varying degrees of danger to health and wellness.</p>
<p>Some of these viruses mutate frequently as well so we can't make one single vaccine that will work for every infectious virus.</p>
<p>The SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 is a SINGLE virus that has a relatively stable genome (doesn't mutate too much).  So we are all over this.  This virus was made for a vaccine.</p>
<p>edit: Thanks so much for the gold, kind strangers!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a public health perspective, there are certain principles that are critical to justifying an immunisation program, which are roughly these:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the germ needs to be common, easily spread;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the germ needs to pose significant public threat;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the vaccine needs to be sufficiently efficacious; </p>
</li>
<li>And overall: the benefits of the vaccine need to outweigh the costs, to the individual AND the community (monetary, side effects etc).</li>
</ul>
<p>A justifiable vaccination program doesn't have to meet ALL of these criteria perfectly, but it does have to meet them to some degree. </p>
<p>Rabies for example: relatively rare, but a huge threat to anyone who contracts it. Very efficacious vaccine if used correctly. The vaccine has side effects and may be costly, but it is of great benefit to the individual to avoid contracting the disease, and to the community to limit the incidence, and healthcare costs associated with managing the condition. </p>
<p>Influenza: common, very easily spread. Causes significant mortality in certain vulnerable groups. The vaccine is typically not as efficacious as most others due to seasonal mutations and strains, but even if it does not prevent the flu it may reduce the severity. The vaccine is relatively cheap, and is well tolerated with few side effects.</p>
<p>Now, the common cold (which as others have said is not just one bug): very common, very easily spread. Mortality and morbidity? Most measured in productive time lost at a cost to individuals and society. Not a significant threat, rarely causes death even in vulnerable populations. Would a vaccine be efficacious? Well, there's so many bugs causing the cold and they change so often, it's very unlikely we could develop an effective vaccine. Risk vs Benefit? You might have noticed some people get a few cold-like symptoms after the flu vaccine - if the equivalent vaccine were to cause these or other side effects, the risk equals the benefit. Not to mention the cost associated with developing a vaccine each year to keep up with changing cold bugs.</p>
<p>COVID-19: Increasingly common. Very easily spread. Significant mortality in older people, and significant morbidity in other groups as well. This virus also has a huge cost to society - healthcare costs are astronomical, people are losing their jobs, the economy is going to be significantly affected. The efficacy, side effects and cost of any vaccine are yet to be determined. </p>
<p>In summary, as much as everyone would like not to experience colds 3-4 times a year, a vaccine against the common cold is not justifiable. A vaccine against COVID-19 is justifiable.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks for the silver!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something else worth mentioning is a vaccine isnt a cure. A vaccine isnt going to do a whole lot for someone who is already sick, but it can help prevent people from getting sick in the first place. We arent trying to &quot;cure&quot; COVID19, we are just trying to prevent its spread and to manage the symptoms in those who do get it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
