		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well I think there is two factors to it, 1 humans are pack animals so when you scream in pain it alerts others to danger, two a sharp shrill noise out of nowhere could get the aggressor or source of danger to loosen for a second and you to escape and all it takes is for it to work once for everyone else in your group to pick up on it that everyone who sees your group do it so on and so forth</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Screaming is an extreme manifestation of the <em>fight or flight response</em>, which is a series of mechanisms our body unchains when in danger or distress, triggered by the hormones adrenalin and cortisol, among others. </p>
<p>When we feel we have run out of options to overcome a dangerous threat, screaming is the last resort, its goal being either alerting a fellow congener so they can help us survive or hoping the strident noise will scare off or deter the predator.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't give you an ELI5 but as an emergency services worker and former childcare worker I can say that a rule of thumb is... if someone is injured and screaming it's generally not too bad but if they are really quiet or go from loud to quiet then it's a concern.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Screaming and swearing is shown to decrease the pain we feel and it is hardwired into our amygdala (I think). Maybe not amygdala but I remember it being very deep in our brain, along the lines of walking and running level hardwired into us</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
