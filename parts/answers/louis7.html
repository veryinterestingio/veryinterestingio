		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do you have a citation for the &quot;mRNA vaccines have faster rollouts?&quot;  They can be fast, but production differences are not incredibly significant. </p>
<p>The covid-19 vaccines are the first widescale rollouts for mRNA vaccines, so there's no real historical precedent.</p>
<p>The sinovac route I'd argue is faster. Grow up virus, UV/fornalin/whatever inactivate, assure inactivation, package and inoculate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sinovac began Phase I on <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7832443/" target="_blank">April 16th</a>, BioNTech/Pfizer on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2639-4" target="_blank">May 4th</a>. We don't know when they started work on the vaccines, but it couldn't have been more than a couple of months. That seems pretty fast in both cases.</p>
<p>Both finished Phase III in December, and both are supplying millions of doses a day now. So what precisely do you mean by &quot;rollout&quot;? Depending on which step you are talking about, I have three answers:</p>
<p>Getting to Phase I (i.e., initial development): they started work on it sooner.</p>
<p>Getting through Phase III: less stringent regulations, mass mobilization to find volunteers</p>
<p>Manufacturing up and running: Did you see them build that field hospital in like a day in Wuhan? Again, mass mobilization with government behind them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I recall correctly the Pfizer/Biontech mRNA went from platform IP to final version in the span of a weekend once China made technical information about the Coronavirus like it's genome public. Honestly the basic principles of vaccine design for either aren't rocket science. </p>
<p>The Chinese took whole unmodified virus and inactivated it with beta-propiolactone, a chemical which has been a default for inactivated vaccines since the 1950s/1960s.</p>
<p>Moderna and Pfizer copy/pasted the sequence responsible for coding the spike protein (the infection mechanism), printed off the messenger RNA for that sequence, and mixed it with a lipid based formulation to protect the fragile mRNA through to injection. The main substantive difference between the Pfizer vaccine and the Moderna vaccine is in the lipid formulation which makes one more shelf stable.</p>
<p>I'm being somewhat reductionist, but that's the design process in a nutshell. Pretty much everything beyond that is scale-up and safety /efficacy testing. China/Russia's main 'advantage' in rollout is that their governments were willing to grant approval once they passed early safety trials even without meaningful efficacy data.</p>
<p>In the West we're a bit spoiled for choice, and we wanted to go with vaccines that actually worked the best which means inefficiencies as we wait to see which cantidates we need to mass produce. Others are going to end up vaccinating whatever reasonably safe domestic option was available which streamlines the decision tree. And that shows through, it's why outside mainland China Sinovac's efficacy drops from a claimed 80% down to only about 50% in the hands of scientists without a finger on the scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Inactivated vaccines don't take too long to make. You're just treating the virus with chemicals until its dead. Considering Asia's history with coronaviruses, they're also quite prepared for this sort of thing. </p>
<p>Perhaps you confused inactivated with attenuated, which does take a very long time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
