		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Flu is global, so it's always influenza season somewhere. When it's summer in the Northern hemisphere, it's winter and flu season in the Southern hemisphere. In the brief periods between peak flu season in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, the virus is still circulating in tropical and semitropical regions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Summer in the northern hemisphere is winter in the southern hemisphere. There is evidence that lack of vitamin D related to lack of sunlight is a major causative element in lowering immune tolerance. Thus flu moves up and down across the equator as the seasons change. A major factor is farming of pigs and chickens in areas of high human populations. All of these things are taken into account when scheduling flu vaccines, but it's tricky.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
