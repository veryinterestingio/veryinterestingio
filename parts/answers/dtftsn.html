		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have a natural aversion to sounds that have high amounts of inharmonic distortion, such as some types of distortion from music studio hardware, or the distortion that vocal tracts make when we overload them by screaming.</p>
<p>It's something ingrained in our biology that this sort of sound triggers our fight or flight responses. And rightly so, these sounds are reserved in nature for situations of extreme distress, where a quick decision could make all the difference.</p>
<p>Whichever way this sound is converted from EM to audible frequencies, it's frequency content gives a very distorted sound. Kinda reminiscent to me of a distant, almost Human screaming.</p>
<p>That &quot;almost Human&quot; bit is important in my opinion, too. It sounds like something in distress, but nothing you could identify. It adds that feeling of the uncanny into the mix. It's another trick of the human brain to convert this sort of cognitive dissonance into a feeling of uneasiness, as demonstrated in the famous 'uncanny valley' effect. Your brain can't decide what on a single description or pattern that fits the information, so it bounces back and forth between ideas trying to fit it to something familiar.</p>
<p>This is why it's creepy as all hell. It's because you're wired to feel that way when you hear it.</p>
<p>Source: degree and dissertation based on scaring the snot out of people with audio</p>
<p>As an aside, during my research, I found that out of all the natural sounds I played to people, the distress sounds of certain breeds of tree frogs gave the strongest reaction. Still not sure exactly why, just something I observed.</p>
<p>Edit: as for why Saturn in particular sounds that way, it's down to the way in which these readings are converted to audible sounds. There's a mathematical structure to most pleasing harmonic relationships, but this sound just has frequency content grouped at 'bad' intervals, giving a horrible distorted sound to it. It's probably better explained by the process that the creator used to produce the audio files than it is by the original data.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to the already great explanations here. Saturn doesn't actually &quot;sound&quot; like this. There is no sound in space because there is no air. These files took the radio emissions given off by the planet over hours, converted them into sound and sped them up so hours of data could be heard in a few seconds. What you're hearing is a different interpretation of data.</p>
<p>If you go to NASA'S website they have files for nearly all the planets and some pretty cool events you can actually pinpoint (I think one of them involves Jupajup getting hit with a powerful solar storm). They're very interesting, and while they can sound a bit creepy, just remember it's just reimagined data. The planets aren't demon possessed or full of ghosts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
