<p><em>&quot;Before the 2009 launch of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), it was thought that the Moon’s surface did not change much on a human timescale, and that erosional processes took hundreds of thousands or even hundreds of millions of years to significantly alter the surface. Now, the LROC Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) meter-scale images are revealing small surface changes that are transforming the surface much faster than previously thought! From before and after images (temporal pairs) acquired by the NAC,</em> <strong>we identified over 200 impact craters that formed during the LRO mission.</strong> <em>These new craters range from several meters up to 43 meters in diameter.&quot;</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is sort of tangential to your question but NASA actually made their own impact crater for research purposes a decade ago. During the LCROSS mission they deliberately crashed a rocket stage into the moon so they could monitor the debris thrown up via satellites and learn more about the composition of the lunar subsurface</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not ‘recent’ from a human historical perspective, but the formation of the ray crater Giordano Bruno was witnessed by English monks in the 12th century. From Wikipedia:</p>
<p>Five monks from Canterbury reported to the abbey's chronicler, Gervase, that shortly after sunset on 18 June 1178, (25 June on the proleptic Gregorian calendar) they saw &quot;the upper horn [of the moon] split in two&quot;. Furthermore, Gervase writes:</p>
<p>From the midpoint of the division a flaming torch sprang up, spewing out, over a considerable distance, fire, hot coals and sparks. Meanwhile the body of the Moon which was below writhed, as it were in anxiety, and to put it in the words of those who reported it to me and saw it with their own eyes, the Moon throbbed like a wounded snake. Afterwards it resumed its proper state. This phenomenon was repeated a dozen times or more, the flame assuming various twisting shapes at random and then returning to normal. Then, after these transformations, the Moon from horn to horn, that is along its whole length, took on a blackish appearance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
