		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The juryâ€™s still out on this one. The disease is still only a year old, and not super-well understood. It might or it might not; and younger people might heal well within a year, but not-young and old people heal and scar at a much different rate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're asking this because of a recent post about 'COVID lungs being worse than smokers lungs' that was during an active infection. They clear up significantly after recovery, as a doctor on the thread stated. I cannot speak to the long term damage COVID actually causes though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's no good answer to this. It all depends and it's impossible to predict up front. Obviously if you have chronic lung disease like COPD or IPF, it's less likely that you will recover. But in general, it's hard to predict. Here are the important factors to consider: </p>
<p>- Severity of insult: if you have severe COVID, it will be worse than if you have a mild case. This is the product of host and viral factors. </p>
<p>- Host response: if you have a massive inflammatory response, that's what starts to kill lung tissue. Remember, your body is trying to kill the virus before it kills you. So all that cytotoxicity occurs at the level of your lung cells too. </p>
<p>- Healing: the key driver of recovery is whether you can heal after the insult. In patients with ARDS, it's really this stage that sets patients apart. Some people go on to heal and others go on to develop scarring. Hard to predict who goes down which path.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The hard line is whether tissue has been damaged and scarred or not; there is no recovery from scarred air sacs but transplant and any loss of lung volume is permanent. Other trauma generally will improve over time, although how much functionality you regain you would need a doctor to diagnose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
