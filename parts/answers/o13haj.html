		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our bodies maintain a very narrow range in concentration of sodium and chloride inside (intracellular space) and outside (interstitial space) cells. The only way to maintain this is through the diffusion of water down the concentration gradient. So as soon as the salty water hits the blood stream, your body will move water from the interstitial space into the blood,   then water will move from the intracellular space into the interstitial space in order to equilibrate the concentration. This can have deleterious effects on your kidneys as it now needs to remove the excess salt by producing urine, which requires water. So it will further dehydrate you. Your body will also try to compensate from losing all these fluids by constricting your blood vessels to maintain blood pressure which is further damaging your body. Eventually you can go into organ failure, coma, and death.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One job of your kidneys is to get rid of extra junk (like salt or urea) in the blood. Unfortunately they can only produce a certain concentration of urine, so for each gram of salt excreted you need to expend a certain amount of water. Human kidneys only produce a maximum concentration less than that of sea water, so you use more water to get rid of the salt than you gain. Some other animals, such as cats, have far better kidneys and can get away with seawater. Actual marine animals may also have specialized organs for salt removal.</p>
<p>There was a chap called Alain Bombard who experimented with drinking small amounts of sea water in addition to whatever else he could scavenge (fish blood, some rainwater...) when experimentally &quot;stranded&quot; at sea. In his experiments it worked, but he claimed that you needed to start on the seawater before severe dehydration. This is controversial. It <em>is</em> widely accepted that you can dilute sea water, say 2:1, with fresh water to extend your supply in many cases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physiologically: the salt content of average seawater will over come any positive gains from the water and cause the body to dehydrate even more</p>
<p>Psychologically: As anyone that has been to the beach will tell you, saltwater is not that tasty. If anything, I'd have to think the thought process is &quot;Here's water I can't drank and it taste nasty to boot.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
