		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is actually quite common to catch the virus multiple times a year but due to the existence of antibodies in your plasma the infection will be way more subtle. Thus you don't really consider it as bad of an experience. On the other hand there are more than 100 rhinoviruses that can cause upper respiratory infections leading to &quot;Common cold&quot; symptoms and you can catch one of those every day of the winter! :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what everyone else is saying, you have to keep in mind that everything is based on probability. It's not a binary thing. All of your infection fighting processes are feedback loops that need to be triggered and triggering them involves a certain amount of chance. There's a chance that the antibody you need to fight an infection is already in your blood, there's a chance that the antibody you need to fight an infection will take days to be generated, there's a chance that antibodies from a previous infection will be able to stop an infection, there's a chance that a new form of a virus will be different enough that the existing antibodies only weakly bind to the virus. </p>
<p>If your body quickly gets rid of the virus, you can have a short infection that's asymptomatic. Your symptoms roughly show up in proportion to how desperately the body needs to fight the infection. If only a few cells are infected before a B cell with the right antibody shows up, it might get eliminated quickly. If there's a massive infection before the right B cell with the right antibody shows up your body is going to have to fight harder to rid more virus particles from the system.</p>
<p>Also, your immune system isn't the only thing that's working towards keeping pathogens out. Your body has multiple layers of physical protection before a pathogen can reach where it needs to go. Your skin, mucous, hairs. All these contribute to attenuating the chance a virus can gain a foothold and start infecting your body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s not true that flu viruses mutate to multiple new strains a year. </p>
<p>On average, there are antigenically new strains of H3N2 every 3 years or so. H1N1 was antigenically stable for about 6 or 7 years before it needed updating. The B viruses also tend to need updating every few years. </p>
<p>Since there are 4 viruses in the standard flu vaccine (H3N2, H1N1, and two B strains) the vaccine as a whole needs updating most years, but not for all strains, often just for one. </p>
<p>So that means that you’re likely immune to most of the circulating strains each year, meaning that you’re less likely to be reinfected by a second strain even if you are susceptible to one. </p>
<p>Even if you were completely susceptible to all of the strains, it’s unusual for two influenza A strains to circulate widely in a single season. In the US <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/" target="_blank">2019-2020 flu season</a>, over 90% of the circulating flu A was the H1N1 strain. In 2017|18, it was mostly H3N2.  So just statistically, you’re unlikely to get infected by multiple strains in a season. </p>
<p>As another point, for a short time after you’re infected by one flu virus, you’re probably protected against many strains, because of non-specific immunity. This might only last a couple weeks, but if it’s in the peak of flu season that might be the highest risk time, during which you’re protected against a second infection. </p>
<p>But it certainly does happen. It’s especially common with influenza A and B, partly because they’re more different antigenically and partly probably because they tend to circulate at different times of year (B tends to peak well after A, on average). But people do get infected sequentially with H3N2 and H1N1.  It’s much less common to get sequentially infected by the same strain, because as I say you don’t typically get strain variation within a single season, but it can (rarely) happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What we refer to as the &quot;flu&quot; is actually a collection of viruses from the same two families (type A and type B) that have existed as far back as we know in recorded history. They exist in humans and animals in parallel, and they frequently jump between species. Not only that, the virus itself is capable of rearranging itself, and they are basically evolved to mutate more frequently. This is a contrast to the coronavirus that has a proofreading enzyme and doesn't mutate nearly as quickly. As far as we know right now, immunity to any strain of covid-19 gives you at least short term protection from all of them, and we are using this in therapies. Donated plasma is a current treatment in use in many hospitals for covid-19. Within the two subfamilies of flu, there are many different strains. You may hear terms like H1N1, H3N2, and some of them have more interesting names. This is when they've broken far enough away from the original model that they look like a new family of flu.</p>
<p>Despite what people think, your body doesn't &quot;Forget&quot; about a flu after you got it, and this was proven definitively in 2009 when the H1N1 pandemic happened. Usually very young and very old people are highest risk for fatal complications from the flu, but that was different this time. Young people and young adults were high risk, but middle aged and older people tended to have very mild cases. They found that there was a swine flu in circulation back in the early 70s that nearly everyone got, and the antibodies from that different infection 40 years before that was sufficient to turn the new flu into just a mild infection. Antibodies from flu shots exist for decades in your blood, and we noticed this years after we did the H1N1 innoculations where many people still showed strong resistance to the current H1N1 strains.</p>
<p>Another misconception, people think that the flu shot doesn't really work because it is frequently only 40-60% protective against the strains that end up circulating. In reality, this is because of the flu shot. Almost 40% of Americans get the flu shot, and it's very effective against the exact strains it protects you from (2 A types and 1 or 2 B types). They take the most common strains at the time, and make the vaccine months later for them, and it makes those strains very ineffective in penetrating the population because of an established herd immunity. We also focus on giving the vaccine to high risk people that would be most likely to spread it. Children, teachers, health care workers, etc... all strongly encouraged to get it. What we are doing is taking the strains that would have been 95% of the active strains, and reducing them to 40%.</p>
<p>It also doesn't give credit to the concept of cross or partial immunity. When you get one virus that looks a lot like another virus, the antibodies may frequently stick to the new virus despite not being specifically created for it. This can drastically slow the progression of the new virus or even offer immunity in some cases. This is seen in a small percentage of people who have HSV1 that seem to be resistant to HSV2 infections. It was the first vaccine for small pox (just live cow pox). It is also a reason that the flu strains given to the native american population during settlement by europeans were particularly deadly as they had no prior exposure to them. Also, I suspect that the reason 45% of covid-19 cases are asymptomatic will end up being because of a prior infection with a different coronavirus that 45% of people got at some point (there are several coronaviruses in circulation that manifest as the common cold). Even in a year with a bad match for the flu vaccine, the flu shot is shown to dramatically reduce your chances of going to the hospital with a severe case of the flu. </p>
<p>As to why you don't get the flu more than once a year, well you absolutely can, but the flu does isolate you for a long period of time and reduce your interaction with others as your symptoms are so unpleasant. It has a short incubation time, and a short season where it's very prevalent. Plus with the flu shot, it's just not nearly as common as it once was. In other words, it's just the odds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of the reason why there are multiple viruses in the vaccine is that when they start getting produced, scientists aren't certain which strains will be the big ones that go viral that year. This decision is made 6 months before the vaccines are ready to distribute and are based on samples taken around the world and sent to the WHO. It may be that some of the strains chosen don't end up going global, so you're unlikely to catch it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
