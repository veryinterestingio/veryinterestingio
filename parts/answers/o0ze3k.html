		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with how light interacts with matter.</p>
<p>To absorb light, you need to have things work just right.  You may have heard that light is quantized, what this means is that it only gets absorbed in specific chunks, one photon at a time.  And all the energy of that photon has to go somewhere.</p>
<p>It turns out there are a few different places for that energy to go, and since each color of light has different energy, those different absorption mechanisms affect the colors differently.  </p>
<p>Ultraviolet has the highest energy, it’s absorbed into the electrons in a material, kicking them up in energy or ejecting them from the atoms entirely.  Infrared light is absorbed into the vibrations of the atoms and molecules in a material.  For glass, visible light isn’t high enough energy to be absorbed by the electrons and too high to be absorbed as a vibration.  Remember, it’s all or nothing - you can’t absorb half a photon.  It gets a bit more complicated since you also have to absorb the momentum of the photon, and not matching the quantized momentum kick will lead to the photon not getting absorbed either.</p>
<p>Different materials have different thresholds for these absorption methods,  and a huge difference is whether things are metals or not.  Metals have completely different architectures for their electrons, but the basic concepts of “need to absorb a whole photon” still apply.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Materials are made of atoms.<br />
Each different type of atom, compound or molecule interacts with light differently.</p>
<p>This is mainly because of how their electrons are arranged around the atoms and molecules.</p>
<p>Some compounds absorb some frequencies of light and not others.</p>
<p>The atoms in glass used for windows don’t interact with visible light because their electrons aren’t arranged in a way to do so. But they do absorb UV. That’s why they’re good for windows!</p>
<p>Other glasses are good at absorbing X-rays and so are good to use in X-ray machines.</p>
<p>Things to google: electronic band structure &amp; optical absorption</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't a full answer, more a comment. But if glass didn't allow visible light through we wouldn't use it as a window - we'd find some other material. And since we don't see in infrared or ultraviolet then we don't care if our windows absorb those frequencies. Glass is a Goldilocks material for this reason.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A particular matter being transparent for a certain kind of light means that it is physically unable to tap into the energy provided at that the particular frequencies of the radition (&quot;absorption&quot;). Absorption happens when electrons in the matter resonate with the frequency provided. They can only resonate and hence absorb radiation when they are bound with the &quot;right&quot; strenght, like someone sitting on a swing: If you push in opposite directions too fast, the poor person will not move. If you push every other year, they will swing, but not gain energy either. But if you push just at the right times, they will swinger higher and higher... resonance!</p>
<p>Glass is transparent, because its electrons are either too stiffly bound (absorbing UV) or too losely bound (absorbing infrared), but non of them are able to absorb visible light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
