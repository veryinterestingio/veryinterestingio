		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A single wire that's thicker will be harder to bend. It will also fail entirely when it breaks.</p>
<p>Multiple thin wires will allow easier manipulation of the wire overall. Also if any part breaks, it's just a few strands that break (usually the ones on the outside of the bend). The break won't affect the wire because the current still travels alongside through the unbroken strands.</p>
<p>Tl;dr greater flexibility and more durable wires.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Multiple strands make the wire more flexible, allowing it to bend and flex more easily than a single solid conductor. Wires that don't have to move much, like the ones in your wall, will typically be a single conductor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the wires embedded in the walls and ceilings of your house that carry current to your wall sockets and light fittings usually have solid cores of copper. They are cheaper to make, and once installed will not be moved so there's little chance of a break happening. In the UK we call solid copper wire &quot;cable&quot; and the kind that goes from the wall to your hairdryer (with the multiple thin copper strands) &quot;flex&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off, every wire is a current carrying wire. Voltage is just the potential, and current is what goes through. Sometimes it's massive amounts, sometimes it's tiny little signal wire. </p>
<p>Second, residential wires are not exclusively stranded. I'm from Europe, and I haven't laid a single stranded cable in room installation, solid is used all the way. So, it's not a rule.</p>
<p>Now, stranded wires (so, multiple thin strands inside) have two big advantages, they are flexible, and they don't get damaged via bending much, much less. Imagine a solid copper rod. Imagine that you bend it, and the middle remains the same length, so the inside radius of the bend has to compress, and the outer radius needs to stretch to maintain the bend. Now, one of significant (and bad) properties of copper and aluminum alike, is that they &quot;work harden&quot;. These moved, stretching and compressing fatigues the material significantly (induces small cracks and weak points, ruins the properties of material), meaning that copper generally snaps pretty easily if bent like this... That's a problem. Broken cable carries nothing, and worse yet it may overheat and burn. Bunch of thin strands reduce this stress, as wires have to travel less when bending (imagine bending a 1mm wire compared to 1cm rod), and as such they reduce fatigue and potential damage.</p>
<p>The downside of stranded wire? It's more expensive and carries a bit less current (it has to be a bit bigger in diameter to achieve the same cross section due to gaps between individual wires). </p>
<p>I used exclusively solid in residential installation, it's mostly used in industrial as well, basically for every fixed install - where cable is laid/mounted, and doesn't move further. Fatigue is less of a concern in this case. Every cable that is to be dragged, moved or bent (such as an extension cord) should always be stranded wire as it's easier to work with and more resistant to damage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
