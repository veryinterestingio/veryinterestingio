		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Viruses, bacteria, pathogens and the like can be dramatically affected by external conditions. People may have started cleaning their homes more vigorously, or there may have been a sudden drop in temperature that stopped the virus from traveling as easily, or there could have been an asymptomatic carrier who died and thus stopped being the main vector.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this makes it nearly impossible to tell why many historical pandemics truly ended.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On a broad level, this phenomena still exists today under the name Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, a post-viral neuro-immune, muktisystem disorder (at least most frequently post-viral onset). It doesn't get much attention or funding in research, so it is still a major problem to this day. While individual viruses lead to long term illnesses with specific names like long-covid, the phenomena is still considered Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, occurring in outbreaks across the globe and history. Since there are few treatments and minimal research knowledge to offer today, it often gets treated as a &quot;throw away diagnosis&quot;, propagating the issue of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis getting ignored. However it is far from rare and impacts millions of lives in the 21st century.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read an article once ( <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/encephalitis-lethargica" target="_blank">this</a> isn’t it but covers much the same information) suggesting it was linked to Spanish ‘Flu. That survivors of the pandemic seemed to be affected. And given the complications seen with Long Covid it is an interesting theory. Cannot comment on the veracity of the theory, but interesting nonetheless. An old (now) film called Awakenings follows the treatment of the people affected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
