		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How can people get help in a timely fashion? </p>
<p>I have great insurance, but when a family member is severely depressed (and possibly suicidal,) getting an appointment to start medication takes about 6 weeks, and getting into counseling takes months. The wait list for actual psychologists and psychiatrists is even longer. This has actually happened to 4 people in my family over the last couple of years. Obviously that is too long to wait when someone needs this kind of help. I know there are emergency rooms and temporary psych commitments, but there seems to be a gap in care for patients that are in crisis but don't need hospitalization.</p>
<p>Thank you for doing the research you do. I am just worried that our system is wasting that work by not putting it to use where it is needed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In 2017, former director of the National Institute of Mental Health, Thomas Insel, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/05/star-neuroscientist-tom-insel-leaves-google-spawned-verily-startup/" target="_blank">confessed to the public</a>, “I spent 13 years at NIMH really pushing on the neuroscience and genetics of mental disorders, and when I look back on that, I realize that while I think I succeeded at getting lots of really cool papers published by cool scientists at fairly large costs — I think $20 billion — I don’t think we moved the needle in reducing suicide, reducing hospitalizations, improving recovery for the tens of millions of people who have mental illness … I hold myself accountable for that.”  </p>
<p>What is NIMH doing differently that will actually help people now compared to the 13 years Thomas Insel was leading the organization?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
