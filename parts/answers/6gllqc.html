		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>MLMs have a large focus on being independent and becoming &quot;your own&quot; business. To the participant you feel like you are cutting out the middle man. It's marketed as a cheaper and easier alternative to being a small business with room for &quot;unlimited&quot; growth. In reality only people who have large networks of people at their disposal will be successful and usually those people already have multiple MLM schemes working for them so to the people they sign up it looks like a good idea.  In reality the average person will sign up and reach a plateau before ever becoming profitable. This plateau is especially evident in cases where the product is specific and the larger push is upon signing up other people to make money. In companies where the product come first (and it's good products) growth and profitability can be achieved at a fairly low level because getting people to buy into a business that has products you'll actually use is easier than selling a crappy energy drink. </p>
<p>source. Every woman on my moms side of the family is involved in some MLM with varying degrees of success. If anyone has a way to explain to my mom how this is bad please let me know. I've been trying for years to get her to stop trying to sell everyone I know on anti radiation phone chips for years. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The <del>shear</del> sheer number of Companies that use MLM has gone up.</p>
<p>There is a good reason for this, technology (I am speaking from experience, I have built this tech before). It has made what was once a labor and capital intensive process into something that borders on trivial. </p>
<p>MLM's years ago used to make sellers their own warehouse, their own tax accountant... the process of getting into the game was somewhat costly and somewhat difficult. Technology has removed all of that, drastically lowering the bar to entering the MLM space. You simply need &quot;samples&quot; now, as the products will be shipped directly to the purchaser. </p>
<p>With most of the manufacturing being done in china, and the goods costing pennies on the dollar and having massive markups the profits from running one are insane. </p>
<p>Your seeing more people out there with MLM startups because there are more MLM's to join than ever. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did world financial group for a bit until I did the math and asked questions people started to open up to answering. Basically, it uses cult techniques that exploits your dreams. You're psychologically bias, you know you deserve and opportunity like this and you see how easy it is for others that are doing well, but you do not process the majority are failures since you're told all you gotta do is commit unlike &quot;the others.&quot;</p>
<p>I never pushed my &quot;business&quot; on others because I'm not a moron, it looks bad if you have nothing to show yourself. My immediate uplines and sidelines were morons that didn't understand that, there was a reason they were failures, having their little meetings everyday instead of out &quot;doing business&quot;. Mlm exploits hope and convinces you it's possible to be successful while still being in your own comfort zone, you don't gotta talk to strangers just talk to people you're friends with, except you lose your friends. </p>
<p>The first red flag was how scammy it sounds. I was basically stalked by my friend pushing it really hard. He tried to act smooth but he was obviously a moron that didn't know what he was talking about. I caved though because, clearly, he benefitted from having me being a part of it and I figured I owed him the shit since he recently helped me get a job at the time. He was so desperate.</p>
<p>I showed up, they say it has a membership fee of $100 to &quot;earn your business license.&quot; This was the next red flag. Right away, I asked who got the money and the guy says it goes to WFG. This was the red flag, world financial group already banked on me failing, this is their way to still make a buck. I dropped the $100 because &quot;why not, I have a job now and don't really need the money.&quot; Then they pushed this starter kit that varies in prices depending on who you're upline is. I paid full price, $100. The more competent uplines typically hand them out for free because they're confident in their training, mine wasn't.</p>
<p>They later pushed their insurance policy on me and sold it. I was new to being an adult, never once really thought about financial stuff, and I was open minded. They one on one push how to make money in the long term with sound arguments I agreed with, it's simple math. You get an insurance policy and a little extra and then your money grows with compound interest. It isn't a scam, it does work in the way explained. The red flag was when he pushed more than a minimum wage worker could comfortably afford. I did it anyways so I could have an early retirement. The math checks out, what he said was true that I would have a lot of money. The catch is he pushes you to sign without reading stuff, he fails to tell you how you get monthly payments of your money you have accumulated rather than a giant dump of cash, he failed to mention how difficult it is to get your money back and how trivial of a process it is. Odds are, you will have spent more money than you will ever get back in your retired life time, they're banking you die of old age before you get your money back. The guy also failed to mention how huge of a cut he gets depending how much I spend.</p>
<p>I eventually gain confidence from my friend bragging about how much money is waiting for him when he gets his license. His upline promises to give him a payout for some of the stuff once he earns his insurance license, but he ended up dying in the business after failing. It was just me left after awhile and the hardcore members of my immediate circle. I too would fail the law part of the insurance policy because of how terrible test teachers is in teaching Nevada law. I passed the other parts of the test easily since they had developed videos, but Nevada law is just an intimidating wall of text. After four attempts, I gave up. By the way, each attempt costs money. </p>
<p>My upline pushed me to take these tests even though I didn't feel confident because he needed a certain amount of people below him to be licensed so he gets to the next level. He even gave fake promises to pay for my test after I take it, but he never did and instead offered to pay for the next one as the &quot;payback.&quot; </p>
<p>One thing they push was us to go to the conventions. It costs $300 to attend this super important convention, it gives super important lessons and will change your life. When I showed up, ready to take notes, sleep deprived because the lines forced us to wake up early, all the bullshit, it was a disappointing experience. I was lucky, I got to stay in a nearby hotel for free because some people they really liked me gave me a pass. The convention was more cult like scams. The people never taught anything, just gave motivational speeches and stories, no real meaningful lessons except for one girl who gave her tips and advice. However, she was cut short for not being important like the others. I leave the convention with virtually no notes and $300 short of a profit. </p>
<p>I spoke to my peers within the hardcore dedicated circle within my clique. I hear their personal lives and learn what they sacrificed to be there, what they have gained from it. In spite being so good at what they do, they're not even middle class, they live with families and the likes. One tragic story one individual told me was the final red flag. </p>
<p>He tells me how he was a successful banker about to become a head that makes a lot of money. However, he was so passionate about WFG that he quit for it. He was so popular, he had so many friends. He was invited to every party, everytime. However, he said &quot;one day, people just stopped inviting me to parties... They were afraid I would just bring up my business every time.&quot; I asked, of course, would he. He said with a smile, &quot;of course&quot; then gives a slight defeated laugh. I asked if he had any friends that still talks to him. Uncomfortable to admit it, but he said no but that it's okay because world financial group is his life now, he is always doing world financial group and will never stop. This was the last red flag and that was when I stopped my insurance policy. </p>
<p>I tried to get the money I invested into the policy, I tried to go through the website and it had nothing, I called their support and they wouldn't help me. Basically, TransAmerica stole several hundreds of dollars from me. They didn't give clear comfortable instructions over the phone, something about mailing in a letter, it was intimidating to me at the time and I just gave in, I regrettably allowed them to win. I just allowed that money to disappear and pay for the insurance policy until it ran out. </p>
<p>I endured it for some time, might as well since I already spent the money. I learned a lot, but not the things intended to be learned. My established presence and surviving a year in this multi level marketing foundation was expensive but a rewarding experience. I learned people skills,  I learned finances in an important way, I was basically forced how to think about money management. I was forced to think long term and short term and because of it, I decided to cut my ties
With WFG. It worked for many, but not for me as that was what mattered. </p>
<p>I remember in the last days, my insurance policy finally died and my upline came rushing to me shouting &quot;Oh my god, RexDraco! Your insurance policy just closed and couldn't have at the worse time! I need x amount of policies under my name so I can level up! Can we do a meeting for a more affordable plan!?&quot; This was after him countless of time promising to help me get my money back, ending my plan (I had to google how to close it!!!) and all that. He was intentionally stalling and acts like I would trust him. I lied and said I have financial troubles and cannot afford any expenses. The truth was, thanks to world financial group, I was doing the best I have ever did in my life money management wise. Nobody in my family or social circle are on my level. Several thousands of dollars saved up into my account while at a minimum wage Pizza Hut job. When I quit world financial group, I had $3k in my bank and it would grow substantially faster because of the expenses.</p>
<p>Speaking of last experiences with these people, I claimed I couldn't afford to go to the next convention. They understood because I work at Pizza Hut. I asked how the convention was, they told me &quot;good.&quot; I asked if anything important was taught, they respond &quot;yes.&quot; I endure the meeting, went then to our meeting after the main meeting (everyone's upline wants to play big boss man and have their own meeting and accomplish nothing new). In the meeting, I sat their alone while nobody even acknowledges my existence. I calculated what I have invested and how long I have been in the business, how much I got in return, it was my last day I ever spent at WFG. I got up in the middle of the social gathering before the meeting, everyone acted as if I didn't exist.</p>
<p>So, you ask why people participate in mlm in spite one reason or another; the answer is simple though: these business platforms are designed like religions and target people vulnerable and need a way out, a change in life, a way to make their expensive dreams come true after years of hard work not paying off. You ask why they seem to exist in spite anti middle man platforms exists, it's because many products are cheaper through their members, sometimes exclusive items exists. It's also important to remember that people individuals trust are advertising their products for them. Amazon advertises a lot of things, but you will always buy shit your friends or family will say is a great product and helps they use it themselves. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is not an all encompassing sufficient answer to the original question so I'll try my best. I'm 30, been out of school for 8 years. It does seem to me that these scams (let's call a spade a spade here) do seem to be more common these days. I have been aware of these since I was a kid, but it was not &quot;out there&quot; like it is today.</p>
<p>1) technology. Internet and social media, as well as better screen printing for shirts, memorabilia and those stupid car signs I see everywhere</p>
<p>2) more bills for families to pay now. This is documented in other posts, but the cost of everything has gone up substantially faster than the rate of inflation or average income. New bills exist now that didn't before like internet and cell phones</p>
<p>3) the job market has been finicky with relatively high unemployment compared to pst decades among job seekers and underemployment, something that is hard to analyze but I see everywhere.</p>
<p>Ok. Technology. The internet, smart phones and social media open up new ways to communicate and advertise, increasing our exposure to others life's significantly while simultaneously decreasing our real social interaction. It's easy to see someone posting about how awesome their life is thanks to xyz pyramid scheme. Especially for certain demographics, like stay at home moms. It's well known that people's social media presence and their life don't exactly always Line up, and even knowing this some people fall into &quot;Facebook depression&quot; and see other people's post and think &quot;why isn't my life like there life ?&quot; even knowing that Everyone bs's social media. This makes some people more susceptible to listening to a sales pitch or believe they can make money working from home or whatever other bogus claims they make</p>
<p>Also, I never saw any of those car banners until maybe ten years ago, and I know t-shirts and memorabilia are now significantly easier to make and cheaper than ever.</p>
<p>Life has gotten more expensive at a faster rate than inflation and our incomes can grow. This leads people to be desperate and again these scams play into that vulnerability promising to help better people's life's</p>
<p>A lot of people are underemployed. Maybe they are full time but only work 30 hours a week. Maybe they are part time employees. Maybe they work two part time jobs. Maybe they are a stay at home parent who's been out of work for years and yearns to be contributing more. Maybe they are lazy and don't want to work a demanding job. For whatever reason I see underemployment as a problem, and a problem that has increased over my time working. For whatever reason there are people who want/need more and are looking for supplemental income. Again, these scams prey into that and couple this with my two other points you see a rise in the mlm.</p>
<p>So I agree it does appear that mlm scams are much more common now than ever before.</p>
<p>I talked to my mom who is 56. She echoed my point and added that she thinks there are social pressure on women to buy these products at &quot;parties&quot; and she has bought shit she didn't want because everyone else was and she didn't want to offend the host or be ostracized by the other women. She said this is nothing new but social media makes this far worse</p>
<p>Anyone got anything to add? My wife is a high school teacher in a low income school, and a grad student who works with undergrads in the summer term. She does a lot of advising and is highly respected for this. We are trying to find ways to talk people out of mlms and so I highly enjoy learning more about this</p>
<p>Example: student says she has heard you can make great money selling plexus. Asking the student if plexus seemed like something they would buy in the store was enough to get them thinking maybe this isn't a good idea </p>
<p>Edit: I live in an area with a huge descrepancy between have and have nots, and each of the two previous areas I have lived have been similar. My neighborhood is very nice and would fit in in all of the countries most affluent suburbs, but the are where my wife teaches could not be more different. Multiple students live on dirt floors. I think this discrepancy can contribute to the large number of people who participate in my area as much as anything else</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>MLMs grow because that is how the scam works. By getting more suckers to buy inventory in those hopes they will sell it you wash your hands of any risk. </p>
<p>It's literally that simple.</p>
<p>MLMs pray on a couple of human physiological traits that are beyond a ELI5 but simply put, they convince people they will become wealthy and independent by buying into the program. A major component of this is recruiting others to do the same and you reap the rewards of having done so. Most MLMs focus more on recruiting then sales because they don't have to worry about sales since all that risk is taken on by the member.</p>
<p>To be honest, MLMs should be illegal since they are glorified pyramid scam where they added products to make it legal. Thankfully Amazon and eBay are slowly killing off MLMs profitability however since MLMs focus all on proprietary products/brands, this erosion is slow.</p>
<p>I am not aware of any intervention groups or charities that work to help combat MLMs. Sadly MLMs spend a lot of money and efforts to combat bad press and are constantly adjusting there tactics to avoid  losing people. They will provide entire narratives and scripts for reps to use when confronted with negative opinions or anecdotes. Despite that, most people will burn out after a few weeks, months, maybe a year or so. By then they will have likely replaced themselves and or grown the MLMs rep base so the loss is meaningless to the MLMs. Most people will also stay on and keep trying out of shame and regret since it's likely friends and family will tell them it was a scam from the start and they don't want to be proven a failure. If you do confront some one about a MLMs they may be involved with or getting involved with, be sure to tell them you will always love them and appreciate them even if it dose not work out. </p>
<p>One of the more slimy tactics MLMs uses are meetups and conferences/conventions where they sell the culture. It's at these events they tend to find ways to tip over the more risk adverse members into committing an amount of money they would have normally not been comfortable spending. Almost all MLMs use this tactic and bake it into the system.</p>
<p>Again the Psychology of it is well outside an ELI5 but thats all an MLMs is, a way to pray of people and get them to buy way more than they need, or will ever sell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
