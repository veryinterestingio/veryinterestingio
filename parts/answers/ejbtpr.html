		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the vaccine.</p>
<p>The simplest to imagine are whole-cell vaccines against bacterial diseases: simply kill off the bacteria. Since they are dead they can no longer infect anyone - but they will still contain all the antigens (structures that antibodies can bind to) that will make the immune system recognize them, which will teach the body to fight them.</p>
<p>Other ones are more interesting. For example, the tetanus vaccine is an inactivated form of the toxin (tetanospasmin) produced by the bacteria that cause tetanus (<em>Clostridium tetani</em>) instead of the bacteria themselves. The toxin is a protein that can be inactivated by e.g. formaldehyde: this denatures the protein (imagine cooking an egg - heat denatures the egg white and turns it solid) enough to make it essentially harmless while still being recognizable by the immune system.</p>
<p>Many vaccines against viruses use another process, by first growing the viruses in the human cells that are their original hosts and then <a href="http://www.publichealthunited.org/vaccine-concerns-ingredients-part-2b-by-nina-martin-2/" target="_blank">passing them through cell cultures that they are not adapted to, like e.g. chicken cells</a>. Viruses are finely tuned, so as they adapt to those other cells, they start to lose the capacity to effectively infect the original human cells - but again, they will still contain all the bits that will make the body recognize them.</p>
<p>Then there are modern methods like recombinant vaccines, where you use modern gene editing techniques to create the specific antigens you are after.</p>
<p>As for how they can &quot;confidently determine the disease is ready to be used as a vaccination&quot;: testing, testing, testing and more testing. Testing in cell cultures. Testing in animals. Testing in people: clinical trials upon clinical trials to determine if the vaccine is safe, if it produces the desired antibodies, and then finally to see if it actually works in practice - and works better than any alternatives already out there.<br />
And then there is constant quality control testing of the product itself, to make sure that the plant is still making exactly what they think they are making.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many stages to vaccine manufacturing.
First, the antigen is generated. Viruses are grown either on primary cells like chicken eggs (e.g., for influenza) or on continuous cell lines like cultured human cells. Bacteria are grown in bioreactors. Similarly, a recombinant protein derived from the virus or bacteria can also be generated in yeast or cell cultures. After the antigen is generated, it will be isolated from the cells that were utilized to generate it. The virus could be required to be deactivated, perhaps with no later purification needed. The recombinant proteins need many operations that involve ultrafiltration and column chromatography. Lastly, the vaccine is formulated with the addition of adjuvant, stabilizers and preservatives as needed. The adjuvant will enhance the immune response of the antigen, the stabilizers increase the storage life and preservatives allow the use of multidose vials.
Combination vaccines are more difficult to develop and manufacture due to the potential incompatibilities and interactions among the antigens and other substances used.</p>
<p>Beside the active vaccine itself, the following excipients and residual manufacturing compounds are present or may be present in vaccine preparations:</p>
<p>Aluminium salts or gels are added as adjuvants. These are added to promote an earlier and more potent response, and more persistent immune response to the vaccine; they allow for a lower vaccine dosage.</p>
<p>Antibiotics are added to some vaccines to stop the growth of bacteria during production and storage of the vaccine.</p>
<p>Formaldehyde is used to inactivate bacterial products for toxoid vaccines. Formaldehyde is also used to inactivate unwanted viruses and kill bacteria that might contaminate the vaccine during production.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hmm might get buried but my job is manufacturing vaccines. My background is in biochemistry. </p>
<p>The one that we make is just the outer shell of the virus that would normally contain the viral DNA/RNA. To do this we use yeast cells to express the proteins that make up the outer shell and then it basically folds into the right shape on its own. The body then can recognize the outside of the virus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They grow the bacteria/viruses that cause that disease in a lab, in order to get more material, so that they can create more vaccines.
Then, they take a part of that germ culture and inactivate/impair it in order to make them unable to do any harm, while still triggering an immune response.
The weakening is done using heat, which causes the internal biological processes of that germ to collapse, thus killing it. You can also use some other methods in order to achieve this, such as using chemicals like alcohol, which causes the cytoplasm of the bacteria to coagulate, killing it.
Oh, and since the immune system doesn't require the germ to be intact, you can also break the germ apart and inject the remaining pieces of it. Afterall, in order to kill a bacteria, the immune system could attack only the cellular membrane, so just a piece of a germ's membrane should do the job.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
