		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't know if it should be counted as an opinion at this point. Along the good reasons, big companies participate more in the overall economy. By protecting big companies, you preserve more jobs, which lead to less crap to deal with. It also makes many things easier to manage (big companies already take care of producing and moving food along. If they fall, you need to supply all that. Which require time and effort that we can't do fast enough)</p>
<p>On the bad side, there is money. Often politicians are smart people that don't keep the large sum of money they make in a bank account. They invest. Usually in big companies that make big profits. So if these companies fall, so do their investment. Second, if a big company were to &quot;lose&quot; 100k $ on the desk of their favorite politician, their company might be put on top of the pile for those that need to be helped. The company lose 100k but gain 2M, the politician make 100k and the people that don't matter (AKA tax payers) lose the 2M.</p>
<p>There are pros and cons, simply put big companies hold a lot of power and importance in the everyday man's life some good, some bad, and losing them would change the shape of the world in an unpredictable way (note: unpredictable. Not necessarily worse. Not necessarily better). In these trying times, it is likely safer to keep the big ones alive than the small ones. But it might also prevent the small ones from ever coming back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a lot of factors.</p>
<ol>
<li>Bigger businesses tend to be easier to target. You know what their products are, what their pain points are, etc. With small businesses, there can be a lot of idiosyncratic stuff that makes policy intervention not work (or not work well) for whatever reason. Like, you want to create a policy that encourages some kind of particular efficiency in credit card transactions, but a bunch of small businesses complain b/c they're primarily cash and they don't benefit. But you don't want to promote cash transactions b/c then cashless small businesses complain they now have to stock the cash drawer, which introduces significant logistical difficulties.</li>
<li>Big businesses tend to benefit at least a little from anything that benefits a small business. So, benefits to them simply look bigger because they tend to scale those benefits.</li>
<li>Big businesses have lobbyists who can articulate exactly what they need and make those needs clearly known (related to #1).</li>
<li>Fewer interventions are usually necessary, making policy pushes (often expensive in terms of political capital) more efficient. Nobody has the time or will to pass 87 bills if 3 will do.</li>
</ol>
<p>The list goes on and on. None of these factors is usually a dealbreaker by themselves, but the total weight of them just makes catering to big businesses de facto more appealing. It always seems like a slightly more obvious, slightly easier, slightly more effective course of action.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At this point most people work for a big a business.  Meanwhile your small businesses are very dependent upon big business to survive (either to make the products they sell, or supply the equipment they need, etc.)  If you let the big businesses and economy fail, they'll take the small businesses down with them.  </p>
<p>As far as ignoring their own citizens needs in favor of big business, well the citizens aren't making multi-million dollar donations to campaign efforts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Democracy is shaped by those who show up.  Big companies can afford to have people who professionally show up (lobbyists) and are run by people who often run in the same social circles as the most powerful politicians, which makes it easier for their voice to be heard.</p>
<p>I’m not talking about corruption, I’m not talking about greed; I’m saying that you listen to the person who informs you of their issues more than those who don’t.</p>
<p>It’s also helpful that they represent far more jobs.</p>
<p>The weak don’t reliably show up and lobby their issues, they’re too busy being trampled on.</p>
