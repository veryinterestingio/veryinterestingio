		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The two primary reasons are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cooling of the smoke as it passes through water, making it easier to inhale.</li>
<li>Removal of <em>some</em> tar and other particulate matter from the smoke, making it feel less harsh.</li>
</ol>
<p>EDIT:  others have mentioned volume as well, in that usually a bong &quot;hit&quot; administers a greater amount of smoke/MJ quickly, as opposed to other smoking methods.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What the other responses are leaving out is the water filters out ash and some tar as it passes through it. Smoking any other way without any type of filter you are inhaling that ash and tar. This changes the &quot;hit&quot; making it less harsh.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first difference is the water. The water doesn't actually filter out as much &quot;toxins&quot; as most would think, but it does remove some of the water soluble stuff from the smoke. This has little effect on the hit though. The real magic here is the bubbling in the water. The more bubbles, the more surface area touching the water, in turn, cooling the smoke down considerably. This is why many new bongs have so many chambers and percolators. This is a big deal since that smoke can be very friggin hot, and nobody wants hot smoke in their throat. You can also try putting ice cold water in the bong. Def a noticable difference. I try to every time I smoke, especially if I got a new bag and really wanna taste it and rip it. You can even out tho whole thing in the freezer to chill the glass, but BE CAREFUL!!!! If the glass get reeeeeeally cold, it is more fragile.</p>
<p>Next is the chamber. The bigger ones being about the volume of your lungs. The chamber of a bong is WAY bigger the you're average hand pipe, or alternatively, a joint, which has none (unless you include your mouth). This allows you to pull up a huge hit before any of it really hurts your throat. Basically, shooting all the smoke into the lungs at once. These chambers sometimes have ice catchers in them as well, cooling the smoke down even more!!!!</p>
<p>Try smoking with a dry bong, or with warm water. .  . . . It's painful. The smoke is hot and harsh, making that big hit burn like a mf. Also, try filling the chamber up with smoke, then just let it sit there for a few seconds before inhaling (for science) this part I don't quite understand, but the smoke goes stale and it tastes like ass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The water is a filter for small particulates.  If you smoke through a small bowl you are getting some burnt leaf in your throat.  The water also cools the smoke rapidly.  If you add ice to the water, this affect is exaggerated.  So you have cooled and filtered your smoke making it far more pleasant.  This allows you to smoke a significantly larger amount in one “hit” compared to a bowl.  Making it less harsh also allows you to hold it in longer furthering the absorption of the chemicals in the smoke. </p>
<p>Sending the smoke through more water exaggerates this affect.  However many double or triple percolating devices sacrifice water volume for more passes which id say isn’t necessarily better.</p>
<p>A joint is the worst way to get High.  You are inhaling hot harsh paper which makes you less able to get your chemicals out.   Also you lose weed to the air.  Joints can be used for social occasions, but if you’re at your house use a vape or water percolator. Far better for your lungs. </p>
<p>True ELI5:  Water cleans and cools the smoke allowing you to smoke more faster and get higher.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most simple answer is the water cools down the smoke coming through a bong rather than a joint. The heat from the smoke is really what makes people cough. It does filter it slightly but it’s more about cooling it than the filtration</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
