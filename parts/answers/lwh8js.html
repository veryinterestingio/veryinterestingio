		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the most part, not really. As u/captglasspac says, post-infection administration of a vaccine may encourage a faster immune response.</p>
<p>There is one very notable exception - rabies. Because the rabies virus has a <em>really</em> long incubation period (around 12 weeks), post-exposure vaccination is an effective treatment against the only disease with a mortality rate of over 99% if left untreated. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/rabies.html" target="_blank">Check the CDC statement</a>.</p>
<p>... Actually, there is no <em>other</em> known treatment for rabies. It's a scary disease.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabies%20vaccine" target="_blank">Rabies vaccine</a> still works if it's given soon after an infection - but it needs to be given before the virus reaches the brain.</p>
<p>Looked around a bit more: In mice, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25785602/" target="_blank">an Ebola vaccine works up to a day after infection</a>.</p>
<p>Note that these are relative to the infection time, not the time when people (or mice) feel ill.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The HPV vaccine injected directly in to the lesion is starting to be used to treat recalcitrant skin warts. Works by immunomodulation. Basically it’s like, “hey this is the thing I’m telling you to be scared about, kill it.” So the body is like, “ok.”</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tetanus is another case where the vaccine is the appropriate medicine. Basically the tetanospasmin toxin is intense enough that it'll cause symptoms before it's present in sufficient concentrations to generate an immune response. Also the symptoms take a little bit to kick in, and due to the nature of it getting into cuts, we often know that there's a significant risk of it pretty quick -&gt; we can give the vaccine days before you'd even get symptoms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
