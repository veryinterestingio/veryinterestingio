		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A big part is that it's being addressed better and in greater numbers now. </p>
<p>Like down syndrome and autism were likely present for a long time. They were not counted for a long time because they weren't understood, and it's believed that's what the stories of changelings comes from.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a few factors.</p>
<p>The simple answer is 'they're not'. Stuff like this simply wasn't diagnosed back in the day. You were either sane, or you were put in the madhouse. And if you happened to get really violent when you got drunk and beat your wife, that was just part of being a man. And if you twitched after coming back from the wars, you were weird.</p>
<p>There's also the argument that the modern world puts much greater social stresses on people. For most of history, most of the population lived on farms, or in small towns. Even cities wouldn't have the kind of population density we see today. As such, life for introverts presented much less in the way of social pressure back then. </p>
<p>(This also explains the increase in autism diagnoses. While there were plenty of 'changelings', many people on spectrum were pretty comfortable in the life of a peasant. They wouldn't get bored with repetitive tasks, and would almost never have problems with overstimulation.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I work in a school in the US, I am going to have an unpopular opinion and say it’s getting worse. I see way more kids now with mental health issues than ten years ago, and teachers who’ve been doing this longer say they’ve seen it get much worse recently.</p>
<p>I admit it may be a temporary increase on a graph that stays relatively stable though. This is also my opinion!I think what’s causing it in kids are a few things:</p>
<p>-childhood traumas and early life disruptions</p>
<p>I think that kids who have early trauma or their lives are disrupted or uncertain in childhood makes them more likely to be anxious or depressed because they have no control over what’s a major factor of their lives</p>
<ul>
<li>too much safety and parenting/teacher hoovering </li>
</ul>
<p>Kids can’t make mistakes or solve their own problems because adults are setting up these bubble lives where nothing can happen or if it does someone rescues you. You have to fail hard or get hurt to learn how to handle something and learn that you can take care of yourself and a small fracture learning to skate isn’t really that bad. </p>
<ul>
<li>stressful political and environmental climate </li>
</ul>
<p>Parents stress is contagious, if they’re holding their breath because the mine they work at, farm or car factory is talking layoffs the kid can pick up on that. If the president is saying racist things kids pick up on that (I had an 8 year old cry during the election because they thought they were going to be deported for not being a real American because they were adopted from South America..). Students worry if they can afford college, or if they do can they get a job? Will their job be there or automated/outsourced? Can they afford student loans and a house one day? Will climate change kill them or destroy their homes?</p>
<p>-opioids </p>
<p>In my area everyone knows someone who is or was an addict. Most know someone who died of an overdose. I’m not just talking about who you imagine to be an addict but teachers, fireman, A DOCTOR, the social worker, parents, college admissions administrators.. no kid feels like “this can’t happen to me or my family” because it’s everywhere and you’re just waiting for news on the next death. So many kids are being born addicted right now I am nervous for the future.</p>
<p>All these things kids are aware of, all of it they feel powerless to. I’m not saying every child will have mental illness because of this, but I think it’s driving the numbers higher. </p>
<p>Probably the mandatory lock down shooter drills we have to do aren’t helping kids feel secure and safe in schools either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
