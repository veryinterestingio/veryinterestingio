		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Processors each have their own language. In technical terms it's what's called an &quot;Instruction Set Architecture&quot;. It defines the words that that a computer uses to do things. For instance one computer might have use &quot;ADD 2 2&quot; to compute 2+2. While another computer might use &quot;SUM 2 2&quot;. When someone writes a piece of software like a video game, it gets compiled for a specific instruction set architecture based on the platform it's going to be used on. When a program is compiled, it gets turned from the programming language (C/C++ for instance) into the language of the processor. You might hear this called &quot;machine language&quot;. So code that's been compiled for one processor type can't run in a different processor because the machines use different languages.</p>
<p>Another way to think of it is you want to tell someone hello. You could chose to say it in either Russian or English.  If you say it in Russian, the English speakers won't understand it, but if you say it in English, the Russian speakers won't understand it. Your choice of language is like compiling the software.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll expand on the language metaphor that others have used. An &quot;architecture&quot; determines how the hardware works at a very basic level. It's the language that the computer thinks in. </p>
<p>When you emulate another kind of computer, there's basically one level of indirection going on. The emulator is creating a digital version of a different computer, for example a nintendo 64, that has to have all the different hardware of that computer in digital form. The languages that the two computers think in might not have a 1-1 mapping for words though. If I translate english to spanish, I can't just go word by word. I have to consider the different grammar and adjust accordingly. That translation process takes time. Similarly, the digital hardware being emulated has to actually be running on the physical hardware of your actual computer. So the instructions are essentially being interpreted twice. First, they are interpreted by the emulated computer, and then translated to your computers language after.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm. </p>
<p>Architecture is basically how that computer runs at the most basic level.</p>
<p>All a computer is, is a bunch of really high tech light switches, on and off. Where it gets complicated is to figure out how they should be flipped and how to convert that into lets say a document, or a picture, or even a fully functioning video game.</p>
<p>So to do that we have to give the computer instructions. We would call that a program or a programming language. The catch is, it's really freaking hard to actually tell the computer which switches to flip exactly when. What we do instead is tell it on a more human understandable level what we'd like it to do (do some addition here, print a message here.) When we write those instructions for the actual game, the computer then converts it into what is called machine language, which is basically telling it what switches to flip when.</p>
<p>Now here's the catch. In the same way that every car and vacuum cleaner brand are different, so is every model of computer. And in the case of computers, it REALLY effects what order the switches will be flipped in.</p>
<p>In some cases, it can be a big enough difference that you can't get old programs to run on new computers.</p>
<p>Now this is really a bigger problem with older programs running on newer things, because they were written for older computers which ran on older computer parts that used different machine language. So when we update them for new computers, even though the human readable part of the code works, when it gets translated to the machine code, the newer computer is essentially speaking a completely different language and can't understand the program. So to get it to work we have to make significant and difficult changes to either the program that emulates the software or the software (game) itself. Most people, unless they are the original company who owned the game, don't have access to the human readable code, because companies only sell the games in machine readable form to protect their product from pirates and other reasons. So when you're emulating an old game and it's not working because of the system architecture, it can be a really difficult problem to solve, because you don't always know exactly what part of the program is causing the issue</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Consider different architectures as different creatures. One (let say it is A-creature) with strong 6 legs and strong 2 arms, specialized to live in forests and climb trees, another one (B-creature) with 2 legs and 8 arms, specialized to live in flatlands. Consider a game is a dance. If a dance invented in B-creatures tribe and is performed heels over head, A-creature may perform this dance, but it will be slower and a bit clumsy, than if this dance will be performed by a B-creature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you were a kid you probably played with some &quot;construction&quot; toys, such as Lego, K'nex or Meccano. The idea of the toys is that you have some basic parts that you can combine to build something, like a small vehicle. You can make whatever you like, so long as you can build it with the parts you have and some kind of blueprint to follow.</p>
<p>Now, let's say you have a blueprint for a Lego model helicopter, but you and your friends only have K'nex. The Lego blueprint is mostly worthless, but you <em>could</em> design something that looks very similar and has the same functioning spinning blade. In order to do this, you need to know how lego works and probably be pretty good with K'nex too, there's no simple way to convert the blueprint. The result might be pretty good, but sometimes, some parts just won't be the same because it's physically not possible. You also need to design and print the new blueprints and instructions for your friends, which takes a lot of time.</p>
<p>This would be called &quot;porting&quot; the blueprint, it's tedious and you need to do it once per blueprint you want to play with. Hopefully, at the end of the day, you can throw the old Lego blueprint away and everyone can use the new K'nex blueprint to this helicopter without needing the Lego.</p>
<p>However, when I said there was no simple way, I lied. What you could also do instead is to figure out how to <em>build Lego bricks out of K'nex</em>.</p>
<p>Think about it, if you came up with a K'nex blueprint for all of the basic Lego bricks, then you'd be able to build <em>any</em> Lego blueprint without needing to port it. Genius! You just need to build the bricks you need from K'nex and then fit them together according to the Lego blueprint directly.</p>
<p>However, there's a huge drawback, you need a <em>lot</em> more K'nex than you needed lego and therefore it takes a <em>lot</em> longer to build. The same would also be true if you were to try the process in reverse: converting K'nex blueprints to Lego by building K'nex pieces out of Lego bricks. This is an unavoidable problem with the method: emulating one &quot;architecture&quot; in another by simulating the smallest parts is a very easy way to accurately cover all blueprints, but it is also very inefficient. You may be able to take shortcuts that let you use a lot fewer pieces, sacrificing the ability to accurately build some models, but it's still not anywhere near as fast.</p>
<p>For the sake of this analogy though, you need to assume that kids are now thousands of times faster at building stuff than they were before but that the process of porting blueprints manually is <em>very</em> difficult.</p>
