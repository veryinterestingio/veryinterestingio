		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For substances that are perceived as acutely toxic to the stomach, you will throw up immediately (e.g. syrup of ipecac will irritate the gastric mucosa). For substances that trigger the CTZ (described in another post), they will induce vomiting a little bit later because the substance needs to enter the bloodstream first and cross the blood brain barrier.</p>
<p>For the remainder of &quot;things that make you sick,&quot; - which is largely limited to infections - they will often produce a 'toxin' of sorts (e.g. C. diff) which only is released once the substance makes its way into the small bowel/colon (remember, food doesn't sit in your stomach for very long. Very little absorption happens there). Bacteria that aren't killed off by the stomach acid will multiply rapidly in your GI tract. So by the time the bacteria/virus/toxins start to cause their damage, they are well in their way into the small bowels. You can't purge your bowels north, so you purge them south.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body vomits when it senses various different threats. These threats can take the form of toxic chemicals or stress hormones in the blood, swaying motions, or an upset stomach. Chemicals and hormones are detected by the brainâ€™s chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), swaying motions are detected by the inner ear, while an upset stomach is identified by the vagus nerve. Once the signal for a need to vomit arrives at the CTZ, it sets off a chain reaction.</p>
<p>In the Brainstem - The chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) receives a stimulus that might warrant vomiting. The vomiting centre begins a choreographed sequence of actions.</p>
<p>The  Salivary glands -  Your mouth suddenly begins producing extra saliva. This is slightly alkaline and forms a buffer to protect your mouth and teeth from incoming stomach acid.</p>
<p>The Diaphragm - You take a deep breath to avoid getting vomit in your lungs, then the diaphragm contracts in a few short pulses, squeezing the stomach to create pressure.</p>
<p>The Glottis - The glottis closes, sealing the airway. Nothing enters or leaves the lungs. Diaphragm contractions without vomiting cause dry heaves.</p>
<p>Abdominal muscles - The abdominal muscles contract to further increase pressure. The pyloric sphincter at the bottom of the stomach is held closed. The only way out is upwards.</p>
<p>The Skin - The sympathetic nervous system raises your heart rate and makes you sweat across your whole body, to shed the heat from this sudden exertion.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Commenting for the diarrhea bit:</p>
<p>Diahrrea is when your body throws up out your butt. This is why it's mostly water. If your body detects an irritant or some other pathogen it will signal to have your body fill your intestines with water, flushing out whatevers inside. This is why diahrrea causes dehydration. Your body uses a large quantity of water to flush your guts out, so it doesnt have time to be absorbed by your intestines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>u/jiggity_gee had the best ELI5 answer for this</p>
<p>So your bowels are like a long train track and your food is like a set of cars on the track. Transit time between Point A, your mouth, and Point B, the chute, is a bit flexible but normally operates on a regularly scheduled basis.</p>
<p>When you eat, you put cars on the track and send them to Point B. As these cars go to Point B, they lose passengers (nutrients) at various points in the thin tunnel portion (small intestine). The journey isnt complete and the journey has already altered the shape of the car pretty significantly giving a rusty color. Once in the larger portion of the tunnel, the cars are checked for stray passengers and are hosed down a bit so that transition out of Point B isn't so bad. Sometimes, the train cars park juuust outside the gates of Point B so they can exit at the best time for the operator (toilet).</p>
<p>Now, all of this goes fucking nuts when you load a bad set of train cars at Point A. The track sensors located everywhere along the track, detect this alien set of cars and sends a distress call to the Supervisor (your brain). The Supervisor wants to handle the situation without having to phone the Manager (your consciousness) about the craziness on the tracks and also wants to make sure you never know it was on the tracks. It has to make a choice now: send it back to Point A violently and somewhat painfully risking tearing the tracks, or send it to Point B as fast as fuck? Depending on where it's located on the track, it'll choose the best route.</p>
<p>Let's use the destination Point B. The Supervisor hits the panic button and puts all the train cars that are on the track (in your body) on overdrive. The tunnels are flooded with water and lubricant to speed all the cars up and get them the hell out of there as quickly as possible. Cars collide with each other, and previously well formed cars are just flooded with water and lubricant that they are just a soggy, shadowy reminder of their former glory state.</p>
<p>The Media (pain) hears about the car collisions immediately begins filming live the high speed, flooded train cars out of control. They want to knos how an alien set of train cars were put on the tracks and they want someone to pay for such carelessness. The Manager is just watching the horror unfold on Live TV but cannot do anything to stop it, because the Supervisor was deaf and he had not installed a means of communicating with him after hours in the office.</p>
<p>I hope this answers your question.</p>
<p>TL;DR when you get diarrhea, everything gets pushed out, one way or another. There are no passing lanes.</p>
