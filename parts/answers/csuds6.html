		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 2 things that make you sleepy, your bodies circadian rythm and and a chemical build up, lets call it internal clock and sleep pressure. If you plot it in a graph, the sleep pressure will keep building more and more till you sleep, then it will drop. Your internal clock looks like a wave-ish. It will keep going as normal, regardless of you sleeping or not.</p>
<p>In a graph, the further apart these two things are, the more sleepy you get. Because your internal clock doesnt care if you sleep or not, what happens is during the day, you internal clock ends up closer to your sleep pressure than it did earlier that morning. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what you describe as 'too long'.  </p>
<p>If over the course of a day or two, form what I read from Matthew Walker's &quot;Why We Sleep&quot;, there is basically two things that come into play. However, since this is ELI5, all you need to know is that our circadian rhythm doesn't care whether or not we had fallen asleep last night. It will convince you to be at full wakefulness all the same at certain times and this is what is your 'second wind'.  </p>
<p>If over the period of what is becoming an exceptionally long time, as another user said, we start producing adrenaline as a response to the stress the body is feeling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
