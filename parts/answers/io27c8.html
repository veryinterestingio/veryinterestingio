		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neuroscientist here.</p>
<p>Your ass is not a thermometer. It senses changes, not real absolute values.</p>
<p>Here is an experiment anyone can do. 3 buckets. (1) gets hot water on your tap. (2) gets normal temp. (3) gets cold water plus some ice if youre feeling spicy.</p>
<p>Dunk your hands in 1 and 3 for a minute. Then duck both into 2 and see how the temperature feels. Same temperature,  different change.</p>
<p>Anyway, your ass is the same.</p>
<p>New warm seat feels warm because your ass cold and not used to the seat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because if we were just sitting there, we already know what the temperature is and are already acclimated to it.  </p>
<p>When we sit where someone else is, however, we do not expect that and it's the fact that it does not match what we were expected to feel that gets our attention.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has nothing to do with the question who has sat there before, if it was yourself or somebody else. The point is the temperature difference between your ass and the seat. If they have about the same temperature you don't feel anything, if the seat is colder than your ass it feels cold, if it's warmer than your ass it feels warm. Regardless of who caused the 'seat temperature'.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
