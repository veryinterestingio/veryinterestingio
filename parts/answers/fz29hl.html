		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let‚Äôs say you are in a huge classroom and a pencil sharpener is in one corner of that room. Ever time you need to sharpen your pencil you need to walk all the way to that corner, sharpen it and then comeback to your seat. And if there are more people wanting to do the same, you have to wait your turn and it will take longer.</p>
<p>Now imagine each row has their own sharpener, it will take less time and less people in the queue. It will be faster.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs how the content is served. Instead of everyone going to one place to get their video content, they just go to the place which is closer to them which will reduce time to serve you the video content.</p>
<p>Replace ‚Äúplace‚Äù with data center and ‚Äúsharpener‚Äù with video file. There are thousands of these data centers spread across the world and the same content is replicated across all these data centers. Also, like someone else that mentioned the folks that provide you internet service host these content directly as well to make it even faster.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all there are a LOT of servers. They actually give them away to Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to put in spots that are close to large numbers of users. Netflix knows where they are (the ISP tells them) and what's on it. So when a user nearby watches something the server has Netflix will direct them to that machine to let them watch it.</p>
<p>Through analytics and statistics Netflix knows what is most popular and will fill up the server with what is most popular to ensure it has those files ready.</p>
<p>Second, the servers themselves are designed to be fast. They have SSD hard drives for the really popular stuff, MANY spinning hard drives so that each one has its own mechanism that moves to get data ready, and there are several fiber-optic connections into the server to go to the network. This results in a machine that can get data from disk out the network really easily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
