We are subconsciously used to seeing minor eye movements so when they are absent, our mind alerts us that something is wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5: The same neural pathways that control complex muscle-memory functions, also control facial muscle movements. You can have one, but not the other.</p>
<p>Note: Far from an expert on this, and I'm not sure a five year old would understand the above sentence, but there was a chapter in a book I read several years ago about Joe Montana and his premotor cortex. It basically argued that most NFL quarterbacks have that same &quot;vacant&quot; stare because they can <em>also</em> put a football seventy yards down the field at a specific point with two seconds notice, thanks entirely to repetitive training. </p>
<p>It was in a book called The Mind's Sky by Timothy Ferris. Not sure if the book would hold up after this many years, but it seemed like a sound explanation at the time.</p>
