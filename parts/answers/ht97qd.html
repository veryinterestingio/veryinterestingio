		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The TL;DR version is that with the exception of the next ice age (which we have effectively delayed through anthropogenic climate change), there is no systematic change in the period of these natural events. However, the fundamental problem with the question is that very few naturally occurring events are anywhere near periodic, so the concept of an event being 'overdue' itself is problematic.</p>
<p>The idea of events being 'overdue' usually comes from a fundamental misunderstanding or misuse of the concept of a <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/FS-036-98/text/what.html" target="_blank">recurrence interval (or return period)</a>. We use recurrence intervals for a variety of natural processes (e.g. floods, earthquakes, etc) but these are best thought of as probabilities of an event occurring (or the probability of a given magnitude of an event being exceeded), not periods. A classic example is the 100 year flood. The 100 year flood <strong>does not</strong> imply that a flood of that magnitude will occur every 100 years, instead it implies that there is a 1% chance every year of a flood of that magnitude occurring (<strong>EDIT</strong> see everyone jumping on my stats error in the comments and why I should not write answers when I’m half asleep <del>(so the probability of at least 1 of said floods occurring in 100 years is 100%)</del>. Floods are pretty close to being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution" target="_blank">poissonian</a>, meaning that there is a fixed probability of a given flood event happening at any time and it is totally independent of the past history. More concretely, if you had a 100 year flood last year, the chance of having another 100 year flood this year is still 1%. (A caveat to the idea of none of these changing, because of climate change, in some areas the statistics of floods are changing, so what use to be the 100 year event may now be the 50 year event, etc).</p>
<p>Earthquakes are not poissonian (even though they are sometimes modeled as such), there is a time dependence to the probability so the chance of a given magnitude earthquake occurring in a given location increases (generally) as time since the last event increases. How this probability changes through time can be approximated through the recurrence interval, but faults and earthquakes are extremely complicated systems and the process of an earthquake occurring changes the system (i.e. they are not periodic). Recurrence intervals are determined as the average of the time between events and it is extremely uncommon for the time series of earthquakes on a particular fault to be evenly spaced in time. To explore why interpreting a recurrence interval as a period is problematic, lets imagine a scenario where we have a history of the last 8 earthquakes with a magnitude of 5 or greater which occurred on a fault. For our hypothetical earthquakes on our hypothetical fault, the time since the last events for each earthquake from oldest to most recent are 12, 72, 18, 60, 50, 45, 95, and 60 years. The recurrence interval of a M&gt;5 on this fault would be 51.5 years (the average of the time between events). In this scenario, it's been 60 years since the last event, so are we overdue? Half of the events had times between events longer than the recurrence interval so how do we know we're not in one of those periods? This becomes even more problematic when we realize that we very often only have a few events to extrapolate from and it is always possible that our record is incomplete. So why do we even bother with recurrence intervals? Well, they are still very useful for understanding relative hazard and estimating probabilities, e.g. if the time since the last event was 50 years, the probability of another event is very different if the recurrence interval for that earthquake magnitude on that fault is 500 years vs 60 years.</p>
<p>The last part of this is kind of a form of confirmation bias. Using earthquakes as an example again, on any given segment of a large fault system, there will almost certainly be portions of that fault where the time since the last event is greater than the recurrence interval. There will also likely be other portions of that fault where the time since the last event is less than the recurrence interval. Will that latter section of that fault get discussed by anyone but geologists working on that fault? Probably not, so the only thing the general public hears about (or listens to) is news about are areas that are 'overdue'. That is not to minimize the risk, earthquakes happen and the time since the last event coupled with the recurrence interval (along with things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_gap" target="_blank">seismic gaps</a> and more detailed information that I won't get into here) can tell us about the relative hazard of particular system. However, when someone starts talking about a geologic being 'overdue', big flashing skepticism lights should start going off in your head.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simply put, that isn’t the case. None of those things, or those sorts of things, have any meaningfully predictable periodicity. That’s not to say that none of them are periodic in the sense that they happen repeatedly over time, just that there is no apparent predictable pattern.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In his book on the Permian Extinction event, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B012J5RF2Y/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1" target="_blank">When Life Nearly Died</a>, Michael Benton first talks about the history of Paleontology and then takes some time to address this belief.</p>
<p>It's not true.  There is no regularity to mass extinctions or natural disasters.  Human beings simply like the idea of predictability and will see patterns in anything. Reputable scientists will entertain these ideas, like Nemesis or Galactic Bow shock, etc etc, but fail to account for the lack of actual regularity and even more damning evidence.  In particular Nemesis and GB rely on the idea that periodically more asteroids would impact earth, however of all the Mass Extinctions in the fossil record, only one has been conclusively linked to an impact.</p>
<p>People take comfort in the idea of predictability.  We like to believe that there is a plan, a reason, no surprises.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to comment on the Cascadia Subduction Zone example because it's the one I feel sufficiently qualified to speak on and because from what I understand of your question this example is representative of other examples as well.</p>
<p>We aren't actually overdue for that. Based on historic geological evidence of a couple events that we can see evidence of, that event happens once every [ballpark length of time]. This ballpark has a 500 year spread and we're only a couple decades in to that spread. Meaning that if it happened 20 years ago, it would have been the earliest geologists would say it was reasonably expected to happen, and it can happen 450 years from now and still be in the reasonably expected time bracket.</p>
<p>I don't know as much about your other examples but I believe they fall under a similar category. Geological events don't happen on a timer, but based on pressure and movement that can change over long periods of time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
