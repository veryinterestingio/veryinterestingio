		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why is the UNFCCC's Common Reporting Format, or CRF as we used to call it, so poorly developed? I worked in the field of climate change for 2 years as a scientist tasked with the annual reporting of GHG emissions to the EU and UNFCCC from the transport sector in my country. I'm sorry but the portal is absolutely attrocious and buggy. This tool is an essential component of GHG emissions reporting for every country in the world, its efficacy and stability is imperative imo.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How can we prevent industries to bypass laws by for exemple just changing a label on a wrapping.</p>
<p>The one I have in mind is the plastic bags, still being in circulation because they now print &quot;100% reusable&quot; or &quot;100% recyclable&quot; on it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
