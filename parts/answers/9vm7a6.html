		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Chinese government is a strong advocate for local ownership of companies.  Ford and Starbucks, and anybody else for that matter, have to make a teaming arrangement with a local company.  These local companies expect to be able to make 50% of the decisions without contributing 50% of the capital.  The result is a board/management arrangement where you either have half of the people not have much real experience or twice as many people in charge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main difference is simply market access. The Chinese economy is effectively a closed economy, with foreign companies either outright barred or severely restricted from operating in many industries. In the industries in which foreign companies are allowed to operate, they often must do so in a joint-venture with a Chinese partner, where the foreign company is restricted to owning 50% or less of the Chinese entity (the automotive industry is a good example). </p>
<p>Additionally, for many industries, foreign companies are required to invest both capital and transfer technology to Chinese competitors to receive their business license, in essence funding their own competition. </p>
<p>Finally, and most importantly, there is no separation between the Chinese state and Chinese economy. Many of the largest Chinese companies are State-Owned Enterprises, and the large independents are defacto wings of the government; with many provincial and city governments being major investors or board members outright. This means that a foreign company is not competing against true independent actors, but the government itself. </p>
<p>This creates enormous moral hazards, and results in arbitrary law enforcement, lack of IP protection for foreign companies, selective enforcement of business regulations etc </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a massive cultural difference between China and the US. Products designed to appeal to the US market might completely flop in China.</p>
<p>Starbucks’ menu, store equipment and supply chain is optimised to produce “affordable” coffee. But Chinese people don’t drink much coffee, what’s “affordable” in the US is still expensive in China, and Starbucks’ other items like cakes/desserts are also not popular.</p>
<p>Starbucks tried to adjust to the China market by including teas in their menu, and even bought Teavana and converted some stalls to tea outlets. But the tea market was far too oversaturated in China for them to enter and they basically left after a few years. You can easily find a dozen tea/bubble tea chains in the same street, all of which have lower prices and more options.</p>
<p>Ford is a similar story. There are so many car brands competing in the Chinese market that they have been squeezed out. Within China, Ford’s cars have no differentiating factor like reputation, brand image or customer service. They are forced to compete on specs and price, which is tough when Japan and Korea are right next door pumping out cars nonstop.</p>
<p>General Motors has managed to succeed in China, showing that it is possible for an American company to break into the Chinese market. But they have had a Long time to build up their customer loyalty and differentiate themselves from the competition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Western companies typically play by certain rules and in a relatively free market economy. Chinese companies play by Chinese rules (in which stealing other peoples stuff is &quot;clever&quot; instead of &quot;unethical&quot;) and the Chinese government forces foreign companies to partner with Chinese companies and neither the Chinese companies nor the Chinese government have any interest in having the foreign company succeed.</p>
<p>This is not a judgement on Chinese culture, but rather an attempt to point out a significant cultural difference. Western rules of &quot;fair play&quot; are no better or worse than Chinese value of &quot;cleverness&quot;, just different.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
