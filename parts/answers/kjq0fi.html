		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>they have different shaped brains. </p>
<p>where humans have one giant group of nuerons in a ball in our skulls, an octopus has a smaller ball in its head and then a bunch of neurons (brain tissue) in its arms as well.</p>
<p>they also aren't able to squish up completely. they have beaks, which are not flexible and compressible. so they can only squish down to that size, which is big enough to prevent any brain squishing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
