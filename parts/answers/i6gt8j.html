		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simple answer is there were serious consequences to both the environment and human health. There were marked increases in cancer rates noted, not just in Nevada, but across the midwest. Test site workers and downwinders (communities down wind from the test site) sued the federal government. To date more than half a billion dollars in compensation has been paid out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yeah there is a reason Nevada is the state with the highest percentage of land still owned by the government. There are large swaths of Nevada where people really are not supposed to go because they are government property, and  Radioactive. There was a film that was accidentally filmed down wind from a test site and it caused people who worked on the film to develop cancer at a much higher rate than normal movie staff called The Conqueror.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My grandfather was in the Marine Corps (stationed at Camp Pendleton) and was involved with the nuclear testing in some capacity. When he was discharged from the military, he worked at a steam plant back home. They had a Geiger counter (not sure the reasoning) that they were testing, and his body could set it off with the radiation he absorbed from being involved in it. He developed cancer in one of his kidneys which later spread to his brain. There were others stationed with him that died of cancer as well. There was little to no government assistance, even so far as telling my grandfather that he had the 'wrong type' of cancer. He passed away shortly after they caught the cancer in his brain. He was very intelligent, hard working, and the most genuinely generous man I've known. There's not a day that goes by that I don't miss him. RIP, Gramps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The people exposed to the plume of radiation from those tests were referred to as &quot;downwinders&quot;. My 6th grade math instructor died in her 40s due to the illnesses caused by that exposure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
