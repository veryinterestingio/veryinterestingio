If you've ever heard a low quality youtube video, you know the pop I mean. Basically it smooths out the audio.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s called a pop filter and is supposed to help soften certain consonants. When you sing you are typically louder than you are talking and certain things like s’s become more sibilant and p’s and b’s become more explosive (they’re called plosives after all). The filter is supposed to help regulate those sounds. Otherwise you may get a good volume on everything else but the words ending or starting with an s, b, p, whatever are ungodly loud and stick out against everything else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hold your hand in front of your face and make a 'p' and 'b' sound. You'll notice that a puff of air comes out when you make those sounds. As you might know, air blowing into a microphone is a no bueno, so these filters stop that air from reaching the microphone without entirely cutting out the frequencies that you want to hear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you say certain letters, like 's', or 'p', a puff of air comes out of your mouth. If you're talking to me from a normal distance, the puff of air dissipates before it can get near my eardrums. I only hear the vibrations that you create with your mouth and voice box. But if you speak directly into my ear, or into a microphone, the puff of air will hit my eardrum, or the membrane in the microphone which fulfills the same function. This puff is picked up as a (relatively) loud noise, which sounds similar to someone (briefly) blowing in your ear (because, well, that's basically what it is).</p>
<p>One way to stop this from happening is to sit or stand further away from the microphone. But that's not a great solution because it also makes the recorded sound weaker. So a better way is to put this little filter between your mouth and the microphone. The filter lets vibrations through very well, but catches and dissipates these little puffs of air before they hit the microphone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
