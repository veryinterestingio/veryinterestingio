		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The languages spoken across the globe are evolved and influenced by and from one another. it has always happened and is still happening.</p>
<p>In many cases silent letters are vestigial components of things that were once spoken out loud or came from a different language. </p>
<p>Escuela is École is School is Schule. Four words to describe the same thing in different languages that inhabited relatively small landmasses.</p>
<p>Like a game of telephone</p>
<p>For example in english, the letter H, especially when in the front of a word, can be dropped without losing the meaning. ''ow are you? 'Ave you 'eard the news?</p>
<p>This is an example of how dialects form. You change the phonetics while the written word stays the same, or sometimes tries to adjust but doesnt quite work because of other existing writing rules.</p>
<p>So spelling writing (when it comes to silent letters) is a long messy process that people try to create rules to describe but those rules will almost always fall short of the complexity of humam language</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>What’s the point of adding letters that won’t be pronounced?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You're looking at this backwards.  The letters aren't added, the sounds have been dropped.  It's easy for sounds to drop in a variety of situations, if you pay attention when you speak you'll probably catch yourself doing this.  It often occurs with weaker sounds, combinations of similar sounds, or clunky combinations of sounds.</p>
<p>H is often lost as an example (in multiple languages not just english).  Taught is pronounced taut, the h sound is hard to make with the &quot;t&quot; sound, try to pronounce the &quot;g&quot;, &quot; h&quot; and &quot;t&quot;.  It's hard to make or hear, especially when speaking quickly so it was eventually dropped from the word.  Same with herb often being pronounced &quot;erb&quot; (edit: in American english) and I'm sure you can find more examples.</p>
<p>But the written language evolves differently and hasn't changed to reflect this.  It might at some point as it has in the past (such as contractions like should've).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my understanding they are leftovers from old versions of the word. It's very apparent when you look at the english version of the same word. For example, &quot;répit&quot; has a silent T at the end, but if you look at &quot;respite&quot; in English it's clear where that T comes from. Also, often that silent end letter becomes not so silent if you look at the feminine version of the same word: &quot;petit&quot;(small) becomes &quot;petite&quot;, &quot;rond&quot;(round) becomes &quot;ronde&quot;, it even lets you figure out how to pronounce the feminine version of a word even if you've never seen it. Another instance of this silent end letter becoming not so silent is when you string words together and the next word starts with a vowel. In the phrase &quot;un petit arbre&quot; (a small tree), the ending T is pronounced. (Although with this the sound and the letter don't match all the time! &quot;un grand arbre&quot; (a large tree) is pronounced like it's spelled &quot;grant&quot; but because the feminine version is indeed pronounced with a D sound it's still spelled with a D). Sometimes when the word doesn't have an ending silent letter we even slap one on so we can pronounce it! &quot;Rit-il&quot;(does he laugh) becomes &quot;rira-t-il&quot;(will he laugh) with a tacked on T that shouldn't have been there!</p>
<p>As a native French speaker, at least French have rules for pronounciation. You can find a word you've never seen before and figure out how to pronounce it if you know the rules. English doesn't have that. For me the hard thing about French was verbs. In English you add an S for the third person in the present, you add -ed to make it in the past, and you add words (will, had, would, etc...) to create other tenses. You have a few dozen irregular verbs that won't end nicely with -ed but you can list them all on a page and the weirdness stops there. In French you have 6 different verb endings for each tense, and it seems like the list of irregular verbs has no end!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not that the letters were added, but rather, pronunciations were dropped. French is particularly notorious for this. I'll comment on French separately.</p>
<p>In the case of English, and likely these other languages with silent letters, those silent letters were probably pronounced at some point, and then the pronunciation got lazy and dropped the letter from the pronunciation.</p>
<p>All the Greek terms imported into English that start with ps are spelled with the letter psi in Greek, and in Greek, you are supposed to start the sound with the p sound. We have one letter which does the combined consonant sound: X. The X sound is equivalent to ks, and we don't find it weird, but we never start words (at least not native words) with certain combined consonants. Anyway, words like psychology and psalm and psoriasis didn't have an initial silent p, it's just that we got lazy in teaching and correcting this pronunciation, so the p sound got dropped.</p>
<p>Even words like pterodactyl aren't technically supposed to have silent p's. The Greek word root 'pter' means 'wing'. We see this in words like helicopter. The word isn't made up of 'heli' and 'copter'. The proper breakdown is 'helico'+'pter' (spiraling wing). With this word root breakdown, &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbn0Bnt3iDs" target="_blank">cyclocopter</a>&quot; (a type of drone whose rotors tumble in a cylindrical movement) should actually be cyclopter.</p>
<p>Terms like &quot;tsunami&quot; are right at the cusp of losing the pronunciation of the t. A lot of people still pronounce it, but a lot of folks are dropping the t sound or blunting it so much you barely hear it. This term is Japanese, and in Japanese, the first syllable of this term is &quot;tsu&quot;, with the ts pronounced the ts in &quot;tootsie roll&quot;. Again, Americans tend not to pronounce initial polosives followed by fricatives.</p>
<p>The word &quot;knight&quot; used to have the k sound pronounced. As for the gh, it used to be pronounced like how Germans pronounce ch.</p>
<p>Words like &quot;walk&quot; used to have the l pronounced, but people get lazy and parents don't correct their kids pronunciation with sufficient rigor to preserve these things.</p>
<p>There are some examples where complicated and annoying pronunciations persist, and I can't say for sure why. In Britain, they keep saying &quot;maths&quot;, whereas nobody in the US says that because the ths combo is like nails on a chalkboard. But we drop the s, rather than spelling it with the s and simply not pronouncing it, because terminal s can indicate plurals, so leaving it off and referring to all of mathematics as one unitary &quot;math&quot;.</p>
<p>Long story short, it comes down to this: English standardized its spelling before undergoing major changes in pronunciation. Here is the video from LangFocus that covers the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqLiRu34kWo" target="_blank">English spelling weirdness</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
