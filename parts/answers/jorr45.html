		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The antibacterial soaps have an antibiotic in them that's completely unnecessary because of how soap works. All it does is contribute to antibiotic resistant bacteria. Regular soap disrupts the outer shell of the bacteria cell. The antibacterial soap is technically different but it's just a marketing gimmick that could be harmful in the long run.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is triclosan, an actual antibiotic. It makes no difference as to how well the soap cleans, and no difference to the spread of bacterial infections. It does, however, breed bacteria resistant to triclosan.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Regular soap actually works quite simply - all it does is make everything water soluble, so you can was it away with water.  Why is this good?  If you have something like a ceramic plate (a smooth surface), bacteria can’t really stay there, because there’s nothing to hide in or eat, so it gets washed away with the water.  Without soap, things like oils and grease would stay on plates and provide a home/food for bacteria (This is why plates with imperfections in the glaze can be dangerous).<br />
Antibacterial soaps also do all this, along with applying poison to the bacteria in the area.  This is important if you need as little bacteria as possible, such as washing hands before surgery, because hands aren’t as easy to clean (we naturally produce oils, and also have lots of places for bacteria to hide) and introducing bacteria to the body through the chest cavity is harder to deal with compared to the digestive tract. </p>
<p>Most antibacterials are not necessary in everyday life if you clean with normal soap and have a healthy immune system.  Things like bleach are also better to use as antibacterials, because they can’t develop immunity to it (bleach is like melting someone in acid while antibacterials is like poisoning their wine), but because bleach can also be harmful to us, there are still times where antibacterial soap is important/the only option.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Triclosan and triclocarban are the most common compounds used as antibacterials in soaps. However, other common antibacterial ingredients in soaps include benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, and chloroxylenol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi. I’m not a chemist but I worked at a company that made hand soap. Most, antibac soaps use(d) triclosan as the active agent. This requires some alcohol to help it mix with the soap and for that reason, antibacterial formulas can actually be more drying on your hands. This is no bueno because dry, cracked skin has more places for bacteria to hide. Mild soaps are always (ALWAYS) a better option.  Anyway, what really matters is technique when you’re washing your hands. So unless you’re scrubbing in like a surgeon, you’re getting little to no benefit from the antibacterial ingredient in the soap.  Alcohol based Hand sanitizer is more effective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
