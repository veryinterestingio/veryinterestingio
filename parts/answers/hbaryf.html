		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>None of these responses seem at the ELI5 level. Let me try:</p>
<p>&quot;Stress&quot; is your brain thinking there is a threat and telling your body &quot;do what you have to so you can get through <em>right now</em> and we'll sort it out later.&quot; So your body floods itself with chemicals that it thinks will help you overcome whatever threat the world has thrown at you - this is when people talk about &quot;super human strength&quot; for example.</p>
<p>The goal of this is to fight off a bear or out run another predator. These chemicals that get dumped into our body are highly toxic to us in the long run, but what does that matter if you die to this threat <em>right now</em>? </p>
<p>The issue for public health is that your brain is setup for living in the wild and doesn't know that an unexpected meeting with your boss is not a threat to your life. So now we have a situation where we are constantly dumping toxic chemicals into our bodies for prolonged periods which causes all the problems you mentioned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stress <em>is</em> physical. </p>
<p>Oh sure it can have a psychological cause, and colloquially those might be what the word is used for, but what it actually is is a heightened state of activation of the sympathetic nervous system, the body's fight or flight response. </p>
<p>High blood pressure is an intended feature of the sympathetic nervous system. It helps get blood to your muscles if you're trying to outrun a lion. </p>
<p>Maintaining high blood pressure for months or years in a row isn't great for your heart. </p>
<p>All the blood vessels going to your digestive system get partially shut off since really if you're running away from a lion you don't have time to worry about digestion right now. Do <em>that</em> for too long and your stomach lining might not be able to rebuild itself as fast as your stomach acid is dissolving it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, I know what you mean, but it’s still worth saying: psychological things are still physical since our brain is a physical organ. The fact that something is psychological does not make it any less physical or biological than something in our body. </p>
<p>There are a lot of scientific ideas about how exactly stress works, but the main and most popular one is that stress increases activity in something called the HPA axis (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal_axis" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal_axis</a>). This is just a network of communication between the hypothalamus in our brain, the pituitary gland in our brain, and the adrenal glands on top of the kidneys. </p>
<p>The short summary is that stress leads our brain to release chemicals like vasopressin and corticotropin-releasing hormone. After traveling through our bloodstream from our brain to our adrenal glands, these chemicals tell the adrenal glands to release chemicals like adrenaline and cortisol. As anyone who has experienced a flight/fight/freeze response in extreme fear knows, adrenaline and cortisol both can have strong effects on the brain and body (fast breathing, fast heart rate, increased alertness, dry mouth, and other things). </p>
<p>The stress response is great in the right contexts since it helps us survive. However, extreme or prolonged stress can disrupt the HPA axis in a way that contributes to things like heart disease, diabetes, fatigue, immune disorders, and depression. I’d also recommend watching <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eYG0ZuTv5rs" target="_blank">this</a> video or reading the book <em>Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers</em> by Robert Sapolsky (an expert on stress in the brain) if you want to learn about the biology of stress more deeply.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, I need to ask to clarify and put in simpler terms of what people are saying:</p>
<p>So the “stress” or pain in my chest area is not just me imagining it, but a physical reaction? (I don’t have high blood pressure and heart diseases, yet.)</p>
<p>Ex. When I feel hurt emotionally/breakup, my heart hurts literally.
Ex. When I procrastinate and can’t focus on finishing schoolwork, I feel a clenching feeling in my chest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you experience stress, your body will respond by preparing for danger, it is designed to do so. It is a great system for when you think a lion may be near.</p>
<p>Increased cortisol heigtens your alertness, adrenaline increases heartrate. You are ready for fight or flight. You're basically a racecar in the red. Like racecars, your body is not designed to be in the red all the time. Stuff starts breaking down after a while.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
