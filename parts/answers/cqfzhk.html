		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Much like a smartphone, your body will go to sleep when there are no new inputs.</p>
<p>When you are on a bus, your senses will give you the same repetitive inputs. The streets will flow by, the AC and engine adds a constant white noise, you're seated and not moving, and the smell... well you hope the smell doesn't change. Any repetitive input going to your brain will eventually get ignored and your brain will start going into a low energy state. The fact that you fall asleep quickly when closing your eyes on a bus is because you were already been on the bus for a while and got used to all the repetitive sensory data.</p>
<p>When you go to bed, you have a lot of new changes. You are lying down, you wear different clothes, you feel the pressure of your covers, you go from bright to dark, noisy to quiet. All of these are new sensory inputs that your brain needs to get used to before going to sleep. God forbid if your brain starts thinking about other things! Those 10 minutes to fall asleep on the bed is your brain getting used to the new senses of being in bed.</p>
<p>One way to shortcut going to sleep is to be exhausted mentally and physically. Your brain will skip many steps and quickly activate sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I’ve actually read a bit about this because I’m a structural dynamicist (acoustic, shock, and vibration). From what I understand, our brains have low frequency delta and theta waves—something like 0.5 to 8 Hz. This frequency just so happens to correspond to automotive vibration. </p>
<p>Ford even recognized this and built a baby vibrating car seat that mimics road vibration. This is why babies fall asleep during a drive. So in other words, driving can actually make you sleepy. </p>
<p>As to why you stay awake once you’re in bed, there are probably multiple physiological and psychological reasons: stress, anxiety/worries, and the obvious —&gt; caffeine too late in the day, but I’m not an expert in this area.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have read somewhere that vibrations you feel while you travel by road is at a certain frequency that induces sleep. That was an article from years back. I'll see if I can find it.</p>
