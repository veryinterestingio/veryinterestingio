		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Touchscreens usually have an oleophobic coating on the surface. </p>
<p>Phone screens are designed specifically for touch input interaction. Smartphones and laptops with touchscreens have an oleophobic coating on the glass which repels oils and allows for easier cleaning. This oleophobic coating can, of course, wear off over time, meaning finger oils will become progressively more difficult to keep off the screen as the phone ages. I've also seen some devices where the oleophobic coating wasn't applied evenly, and you could tell where finger oils stuck more visibly around the edges of the screen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s actually the other way around. Touch screens have an oleophobic coating to resist the oil from your fingers from bonding with it, which makes fingerprints easier to wipe off.  Laptops usually don’t have this. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two types of screens: matte and glossy. Laptops can have both. Matte screens are hard to clean because they are delicate and do not, in fact, have any &quot;coating&quot; - glossy ones do, usually glass in modern laptops, and it makes them easy to clean. Contrary to common misconception, this glass doesn't &quot;make colours pop&quot; - good screen panels behind the glass do that, and they are just as good when matte. What this glass <em>does</em> do is make the laptop screen highly reflective and thus unsuitable for working in brightly lit environments. For that reason, most modern business and gaming laptops use matte screens. All touch laptops will be glossy because the digitizer layer needs to be covered with glass. Some non-touch laptops will be glossy because manufacturers are dumb. All smartphones are glossy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
