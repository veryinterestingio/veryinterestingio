		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For <del>temperature</del> HEAT in the atmosphere you can look at <a href="http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/people/faculty/djj/book/bookchap2-8.gif" target="_blank">this chart</a>. As you can see, generally tends to decrease, and at no point is it hotter than at ground level, except when you factor in sunlight, where <del>temperatures</del> HEAT may reach 128ºC. Even then, that's VERY far from the 1700ºC this guy mentions.</p>
<p>This leads me to think he's talking about heat during reentry, not during ascent. How does stuff (the pieces actually made to survive it) survive reentry? There's multiple things to factor in:</p>
<ul>
<li>You're coming at ludicrous speeds, this compresses air and heats it up (it's not due to friction, like most people believe)</li>
<li>That same compression can separate the heat from the ship (Depending on the general shape anyways, not all of them do this), thus you don't need to survive the full temperature, just a fraction of it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even then, there's multiple ways to survive such temperatures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ablative shielding: A shield made of little particles that will fly off when hot enough, thus taking the heat away with them.</li>
<li>High temperature resistant materials: Carbon-Carbon and ceramics (both used on the Space Shuttle) come to mind, they have really good heat absorption capabilities. They'll absorb and store the heat and slowly dissipate it away. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp9Yax8UNoM" target="_blank">This video shows the ceramic tiles in action.</a></li>
<li>Active cooling: Used on some rocket engines and proposed for the SpaceX Starship, cool liquid circulates trough the material, absorbing the heat and carrying it away.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope that clears it up.</p>
<p><strong>Edit, adding extra stuff to complete this post:</strong></p>
<p>There's temperature, and there's heat.</p>
<ul>
<li>Temperature is a measure of how much energy individual particles have.</li>
<li>Heat is a measure of how much energy is contained by all the particles in a given volume.</li>
</ul>
<p>The thermosphere and exosphere are incredibly sparse (as in the opposite of dense), so even though individual particles hold a lot of energy (Temperature), there's not enough of them in a given volume to effectively transmit that energy to a body (as heat). Given this conditions, the only way those particles have of heating something up is trough radiation, and countering this is as simple as making them out of [heat] reflective materials.</p>
<p>You can actually calculate how hot sunlight can possibly make a bulk object at a given distance from the sun, using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law" target="_blank">Stefan–Boltzmann law</a>. It's a simple formula and I don't think it breaks the 5 years old theme. We need to know the equilibrium temperature of a body, which is the temperature in which the body radiates heat at the same rate it gets heated up, in this case by the sun and particles in the exosphere/thermosphere.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Equilibrium Temperature = Temperature of the sun (580ºK) * (radius of the sun / distance to the sun), so:</p>
<p>T = 5800K * (695000km / 1.5x10^(8 km))</p>
<p>T= 395K</p>
<p>395K =  122º Celsius, or 251º Fahrenheit. Your satellite is not going to get hotter than about 250ºF.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Super important edit 2:</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>/u/RapidCatLauncher, /u/deja-roo and others (tagged only the two of them because they actually explained stuff) have pointed out that the definitions provided for temperature and heat are not accurate. While I do agree with that, the reason I left them uncorrected is because I do believe they explain the stuff better than the real, factually accurate definitions for those two words. I of course invite you to read their corrections in the replies below (that's why I tagged them in the first place). Lastly, /u/NogodsaMan provided the best TL;DR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since other explanations seem way too confusing, the temperature can get to 1700 C, but theres not a lot of particles at that temperature (thin atmosphere) and so the hot particles are barely actually transferring much energy since there’s so few of them to do so </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What everyone else said about heat transfer in extremely rarefied atmosphere is correct, but the bigger issue is why argue with a flat earther?  There's literally no facts, evidence, proof, etc. that would change his or her mind.  On the other hand, I'd ask how they know the exosphere is 1,700 degrees C.  I assume it's from some information they learned online or in a book that was determined and published by some sort of science-based organization (NOAA, NASA, etc.).  Unless they went up to the exosphere and took some measurements themselves, they're relying on data provided by an organization that undoubtedly reports the earth is not flat.  Why would they believe that information and disbelieve the information those same organizations say about the earth being a sphere?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>if you put your hand in water thats even 105degrees, you'll be extremely uncomfortable and any higher will risk burns.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Yet, you can hang out in a sauna at temperatures upwards of 190degrees Farenheit, even though it contains a small amount of dissolved water (humidity), the lower density of water in this situation demonstrates how it reduces the ability to transfer that heat to an object.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As for proving air pressure drops in the exosphere, well, that can be demonstrated for yourself with as little as an elevator trip up a tall building.  Obviously something more extreme starts to risk our health, you cant exactly stick your head out the window of an airplane or something, so you would have to trust the pressure instruments at that point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
