		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>KFC put a lot into marketing. Christmas in Japan is a fun, commercial holiday. Closer to valentine's in its seen more as an adult and romantic holiday then religious or for kids.</p>
<p>The marketing worked, they offered much higher quality meals on top of the normal stuff, and so people liked it and it became a thing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>KFC was an early fast food restaurant to open in Japan, in the 1970s. One thing they started doing early on was to have a statue of Colonel Sanders outside their restaurants. At some point, someone started putting red Santa hats on Colonel Sanders, which made him look a bit Santa-like. This made people start to link KFC and Xmas, and the KFC marketers started advertising KFC as a great Xmas dinner meal. Xmas has no religious connotation in Japan as there are very few Christians. It’s more of a romantic holiday, and there aren’t any other traditions this would conflict with. So the advertising campaign was enormously successful and now KFC has become an Xmas dinner tradition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Extremely clever marketing in the 70's, since Japan didn't have any specific tradition leading <em>up</em> to Christmastime or New Year's with mealtime because there were so few Christian families, so they marketed and directly associated the KFC colors (white and red) to the already established festive colors of red and white, targetting families with a slogan 'Kentucky Christmas'.  </p>
<p>Essentially there was an already existing gap that they capitalized on. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Take the western tradition of a turkey dinner and swap in the more readily available chicken. Japan didn't really have any Christmas traditions, so this worked pretty well as an advertising campaign and helped make KFC a strong part of the tradition.</p>
<p>Rudolph the red nose reindeer was originally advertising for Montgomery Ward, so it isn't even like Japan is all that strange.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're all missing one of the big reasons. Even today, most Japanese kitchens do not include ovens. They do have a small broiler for fish though. </p>
<p>As the post war Japanese were starting to emulate many things about western culture, like the idea of making a Christmas holiday of their own, they had no way to bake a turkey. </p>
<p>This is when KFC jumped in the fill the need. This was a void there that they filled and continued to successfully grow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
