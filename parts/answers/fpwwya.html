		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hand surgeon here.</p>
<p>There are different kinds of skin graft. Partial thickness. Full thickness. Neither contains nerves. They do contain nerve endings, but those don't end up being useful. The underlying tissue (recipient bed) supplies the nerves, and they re-grow into the skin graft and provide sensation.</p>
<p>(Interstingly, they DO contain hair follicles, and the hair will continue to grow no matter where it ends up being placed)</p>
<p>Sensation is not always normal in the end, but it's usually pretty good and often perfect in the end result, though that does take months to occur, and it depends why it was initially done. If for a burn, there's a chance the nerves were damaged by the burn and sensation may be decreased. </p>
<p>There ARE types of grafts like free flaps that do include nerves, and when they take, if they do correctly, the brain interprets signals from them correctly, as being from their new (recipient) location.</p>
<p>(Second side-note: These free flaps also do unusual things. Say you take one from the groin or thigh, for example. If the patient gains weight in the donor location (abdomen/groin or thigh) they will also correspondingly get &quot;fat&quot; at the recipient site. This is occasionally a problem.)</p>
<p>However, a rotational flap is something different and has different results. In a rotational flap, especially like a digital neurovascular island flap (which is a historical procedure and rarely done anymore) a part of a finger (for example, since I'm a hand surgeon) is literally peeled off with the nerve and artery and veins, and tunneled, without completely detaching it, to a new location on a different finger. This was the one exception to the above rule, and these grafts often DID confuse the patient - they would feel the sensation as being on the old finger where the graft used to be, even though it had been moved. There was minimal &quot;cortical reorganization&quot; for these, so the brain did not re-interpret them as being in their new location. This is one of the main reasons we don't do those anymore. </p>
<p>We still DO perform other rotational flaps, such as the first dorsal metacarpal artery flap. Which is where we take index finger skin and move it to the thumb. Those work pretty well, and sensation generally gets reorganized.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
