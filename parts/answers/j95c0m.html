		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To get a nice clink sound,  vibrations and shock waves have to be able to shoot through the material without being scattered or absorbed.  Chimes and bells rely on this plus extra stuff to sound nice.  The extra stuff is that sound waves that happen to match the size and shape of the chime survive a lot longer than those that don't, so you can pick the chime sound by picking the size and shape.</p>
<p>concrete is complex inside, with lots of small surfaces where different materials with different properties touch.  Glass, metal, ceramic are much less so.  Those surfaces scatter the sound waves which then also interfere in complex ways, making the sound dull.</p>
<p>Wood, I think, does this a bit, but also has the problem of not being very hard and stiff.  If the material isn't hard and stiff, the sound waves get absorbed very fast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sound travels through something like wives travel through the ocean. Something glass or metal is like the open ocean, where waves can just go through. Wood and concrete are like the ocean around a rocky island. When  waves come, they crash on the rocks, so the waves get really splashy and don't go by like they do in the open ocean.</p>
<p>Edit: there was a typo. I'm not going to fix it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Glass and metal have much lower damping than wood or concrete. When you hit something it sets up a vibration in the material. For a low damping material the vibration moves through the structure without being reduced much, bounces off the surfaces and back many times before being dissipated. Certain frequencies are transmitted better than others, so they tend to last longer than others, which results in a pure tone, or perhaps that pure tone and its multiples, which is still a pleasing sound. You hear this as an extended ringing. Wood, on the other hand, damps out the vibrations pretty quickly, so all you hear is a short sound that has a wide range of frequencies, which sounds like a thunk.</p>
<p>Bonus: drumheads go thunk because the overtones are not whole number multiples of the fundamental. Linear structures like guitar strings, xylophone plates, and organ pipes produce whole number harmonics. Drumheads fixed at the edge of a circle don't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
