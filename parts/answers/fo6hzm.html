		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When light passes through an aperture, each point of out-of-focus light (what photographers call bokeh) takes on the shape and size of that aperture. If you took a near-sighted member of each species and put them far away from a point-source light, each of them would see it as a different shape. A cat would see a vertical slit shape, a goat would see a rectangle, and so on.</p>
<p>Why is this useful?</p>
<p>Let's take the cat for example. The vertical bokeh created by their pupils means they see things with a vertical blur to them and the horizontal remains sharp. If their prey tends to flee sideways, this means they can let more light in their eyes while still seeing exactly where their prey is going.</p>
<p>There are similar evolutionary reasons for the shapes other irises take.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It doesn't change the way shapes are perceived, but it does alter the way depth of field and how wide you can see.</p>
<p>Round pupils: Dominates among foragers and large animals. Probably so common because it's simple and it's capable of detecting details over a relatively wide area.</p>
<p>Vertical slit pupils: Dominates among small ambush predators, especially nocturnal predators. It allows the pupil to greatly alter its size, so it can function in both daylight and nighttime and it gives small predators an advantage in detecting how far away something is due to its depth of field effect (meaning that they can precisely determine how far they need to jump/strike to hit their prey).</p>
<p>Horizontal pupils: Most common among herbivores. Gives a very wide horizontal viewing field, for maximum awareness. Among grazing animals the eyes are capable of rotating in their sockets so that when the head bows the pupil can rotate to remain horizontal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As you can see, the image is not really affected much by iris shape. Just the out of focus parts are a bit distorted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see some responses involving photography and apertures.
The eye itself physically captures one thing objectively. Like photography, it comes with inherent distortions. Unlike photography, the image is imperfect due to the biological make up of the eye. The brain then interprets and distorts that captured image in many ways objectively and subjectively (vision). Subjective vision and objective photography are very different.</p>
<p>In terms of subjective vision of the animal, the image would not be noticeably differently shaped.  The main reason being that an image is only clear when the ray of light passes straight through the center of the lens and hits the center of the back of the eye. Light hitting the back off-center is noticeably more blurry. You can see this yourself by going to the parking lot and looking at a car's license plate. Try to read the license plate of the car directly adjacent to the one you are staring at. Even though the characters are fairly big, it will difficult.</p>
<p>Light can get to the back of the eye in a variety of orientations. Even if the pupil is oval shaped, light can refract off peripheral parts of the lens to reach all parts of the back of the eye (perhaps with different intensities). However, the image is only clear when the ray of light passes straight through the center of the lens. You can see this yourself by taking off your glasses and obliquely rotating them. You can also shift the glasses off center to see the effect. Try and keep it the same distance away from your eye. The aberrations will be more prominent if your glasses are stronger and may be more difficult to detect otherwise.</p>
<p>A way to test objectively the image that reaches the retina would be to perform a Humphrey Visual Field on a patient with iris coloboma (keyhole iris). A Humprhey Visual Field presents various intensities of light at many specific spots of the visual field and the patient clicks a button if they perceive it. I did a quick google search but was unable to come up with an actual visual field. </p>
<p>Source, am vision scientist, also recommend Q.E.D by Richard Feynman as an intriguing and accessible short book on part of the subject.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The shape of the visible image is defined by the photo-sensitive panel (retina in the eye, CCD in a camera). The shape of the aperture affects the shape of the focus. A narrow aperture gives better focus with less light and a broad aperture more light with less focus.</p>
<p>So a vertical pupil will have good focus for things across the image (eg: easy to distinguish tree trunks in a forest) but poor focus vertically (eg: the branches off the trunks will be blurred vertically).</p>
<p>So things are crisp along the narrow axis and smeared along the broad axis but the shape of the image itself depends on the shape of the retina.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
