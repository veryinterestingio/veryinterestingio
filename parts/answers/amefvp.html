<p>Yes, on standing you use fewer muscles than walking, in which you use a variety of muscles and there's a 'rest' period for inactive muscles.</p>
<p>Yes, on standing the blood pools in your lower limbs and while walking this is less so.
But the two main reasons that haven't been mentioned yet are: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Certain areas of your feet get less blood supply as you stand (and put pressure on them). Constantly putting up with decreased blood flow is quite a lot difficult for any tissue, particularly muscles. While walking the pressure is transient, and the pressure effect is not constant to fatigue as fast.</p>
</li>
<li>Walking can be done 'automatically'. As in your brain just automates the walking process. Standing in one place, especially if you must be very still is a much more active process. Proprioception, vision, your vestibular system, motor and sensory (with associated reflexes) all need to be co-ordinated to make you stand still.</li>
</ol>
<p>All this makes standing for a long time much more painful. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What a lot of people don’t realize about standing or sitting is that you’re still using your muscles to maintain that particular posture. However, because there’s not much motion, you’re really using the same muscles for hours on end, which can create discomfort, soreness or fatigue. Comparatively, when you’re walking around, you’re alternating between multiple groups of muscles, leading each group to split the amount of time being active </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading somewhere that a lot of it has to do with blood flow. When you're standing, sure there are some smaller tonic muscle contractions happening to keep you stable but for the most part, your larger muscles aren't contracting a whole lot - this means that all of the work in pumping blood out of your legs is done by the heart. When you're walking, the larger muscles help out with this by squeezing veins as they contract, forcing blood upward. So there's more blood flow when you're walking then when you're standing. That in turns means more oxygenated blood getting to tissues and more metabolic wastes being removed from tissues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off, even standing in place you are still using muscles to merely avoid falling to the ground, you just don't notice it because it's automatic. Since you are staying still, you are constantly using the same muscles, while if you walk you'll alternate between different ones and they get brief moments of rest.</p>
<p>Second, blood is pumped at high pressure from the heart and flows in thick, resistant vases (arteries), but then vases become really thin (capillaries) to allow oxygen and nutrients to pass to the surrounding cells, so to avoid making them burst, pressure gets a lot lower. Blood then gets large, elastic vases (veins) and for the most part, it has to flow upwards to get back to your hearth. There are several mechanisms that contribute pushing it back up, one of them is muscles contracting and &quot;squeezing&quot; the veins. If you aren't moving, this can't happen and more blood pools up in your legs, causing discomfort.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is joint pain. In joints like knees, staying still means all the load is constantly put in the same points, eventually causing discomfort. If you move however, the load isn't always in the same spot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
