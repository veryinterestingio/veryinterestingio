		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In macaques, displaying the teeth can mean a lot of different things.<br />
If the mouth is completely opened, giving perfect view of the canines (almost like a strong yawn) it's usually aggressive. Displays of just the front teeth are often submissive or fearful. The teeth can also be visible during lip smacking (which is a soothing behaviour) or playface.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Excuse me for not providing any sources, but a theory I read about 5-6 years ago stated that long before inventing vocabulary, smiling was the best way of communicating something like &quot;Ahhh, it may took me a while but now I understand what you are trying to say&quot;. The theory was based on experiments in which participants' reactions were recorded when they were requested to cooperate on solving complex-problem games without speaking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
