There were large portions of the past, such as <a href="http://www.scotese.com/newpage12.htm" target="_blank">during the Cambrian</a> where the northern hemisphere was essentially a giant ocean, and all the land was concentrated in the southern hemisphere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is just due to where the landmass is now.  It hasn't always been that way, nor has the amount of land stayed constant.  Think of continents as &quot;giant Earth floaties&quot; of lighter bulk rock, that just slowly flow around the surface of a &quot;liquid in the very loosest sense of the word&quot; sphere of dense liquid (plastic) rock and metal.  This is called plate tectonics.</p>
<p>The position and characteristics of continents and oceans at any given point in time cause big changes in climate and weather on the scale of millions of years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This leads me to ask...</p>
<p>Have we always had roughly the same total amount of landmass? For simplicity sake that the North America continent and all surrounding islands is 100kg. Furthermore, let's assume the world's total land mass as it sits right now is 1000kg. What fluctuations have these occurred since pangea? Like has the world grown an Australia since the dinosaurs?</p>
<p>Feel free to comment on surface area as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I’m understanding. It is by chance. What I mean is we know how, but not necessarily why.</p>
<p>Earth’s crust (where we live on) is divided into tectonic plates. Some are big and some are small. The big ones are north american plates, south american plates, eurasian plates, and so on. The smaller ones are indian plate, phillipines plate, arabian plate, and so on.</p>
<p>These tectonic plates “float” above astenosphere. Basically a layer of earth filled by magma. Imagine a piece of cardboard float above water, just with much much higher density.</p>
<p>These plates are also divided into two: continental plate and oceanic plate. Because oceanic plates are heavier they sink lower to astenosphere, that’s why they’re in lower position, hence covered with water. If you remove all water from earth then earth would covered by one single landmass.</p>
<p>Because they float, they move around (Also thanks to gravity and convection heat). Some are pushing away from each other, some are drawn to each other. One example is Himalaya Mountains. It was formed because Indian plate collided with Eurasian plate.</p>
<p>You’ve probably heard of Pangaea, the supercontinent. A time when Earth is covered by one continent and one ocean. You see, the Earth didn’t begin like that. At first it wasn’t unlike today, several continents and several oceans. But because they move around they formed into a single continent, by chance. And they they got separated again, forming current day earth, by chance.</p>
<p>So basically, earth is random.</p>
<p>I’m sorry if my explanation is inadequate. I have degree of geological engineering but I wasn’t a good student and english is not my first language.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s like being in a bubble bath and wanting to know the reason most of the bubble islands are around your right knee instead of your left knee at this moment in time.<br />
There are reasons why if you were to look back at a time-lapse of it, but no grand overall reason. It’s arbitrary in shape and in the moment in time you made that observation.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
