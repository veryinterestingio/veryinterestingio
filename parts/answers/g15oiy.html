		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Connective tissue disorders like Ehlers-Danlos can cause chronic hangnails because parts of our bodies can be too stretchy, allowing the skin around the nails to easily separate and cause various issues. I get hangnails all the time. It's also why my cuticles bleed whenever I get manicures, ugh.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cut a 45^^0 V in the middle of the fingernail.  Right at the apex of radius of the nail.  Right in the middle so you leave a small gap at the end of the nail.</p>
<p>This will cause the nail to desire a closure of that V.  It will take time, though.  3-4 weeks.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I know this sounds funny.  I get that.  I am 59.  I had huge troubles with big-toe hangnails when I was around 15 from athletic pursuits.  A neighbor Dad taught me this.  I have always had a small V on my big-toe nails, and I have not had a recurrence of the dreaded ingrown nail.  Not in almost 45 years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For immediate relief, try taking a sterilized safety pin and tucking little pieces of Q-Tip ends into the affected corner of the nail, until it &quot;jacks&quot; the nail upward, away from the skin.  This will also help to push the inflammation out and away from the cuticle, and you can get a clipper on that edge that's digging in.  Pour 91% Isopropyl all over it.  Ice it.  Cut that snaggle-fucking edge of the nail as soon as you can get a clipper edge underneath it, and you will feel immediate relief.  Keep that sucker clean.  Ice again to deter more swelling and bleeding, if shit comes to grunt.</p>
</li>
<li>Good luck.</li>

Its 12 different oils in 1, smells nice, and is a whole lot more sanitary than oils that come in bottles. It also doesnt make your fingers feel slippery when its on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
