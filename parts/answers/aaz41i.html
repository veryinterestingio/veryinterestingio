		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is a result of a stress hormone called Cortisol, one of your fight-or-flight responses that your body decided to kick off as a response to recognizing you need to continue functioning past your normal operating limits.</p>
<p>Cortisol sets forth a reaction that increases your blood sugar so you have more available energy, blocks insulin so the blood sugar levels remain increased, and increases your heart rate and blood pressure for faster oxygen delivery.</p>
<p>All of this makes you feel more awake and alert when you would have otherwise felt tired a few minutes ago. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That 'second wind' is when your liver gets off the couch and helps your muscles work.
It rides a bike known as a Cori Cycle to do this.
A liver can't really pedal a bike very well, so the 2nd wind doesn't last very long.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just like your blood has hemoglobin to carry oxygen, your muscles have myoglobin (the red stuff that comes out of meat that everyone thinks is blood) for the same purpose, but it holds on to the oxygen more tightly than blood for emergencies.</p>
<p>When the level of oxygen in your muscles drops below a certain point due to heavy exercise, the oxygen stored in the myoglobin is released which allows your body to produce energy more easily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This goes back to the caveman times, when things were a lot more dangerous and closing your eyes for too long at the wrong place at the wrong time could mean you end up inside something you don't want to end up inside. If you're staying awake, your body thinks &quot;Ok brain, you're staying awake and since you've been ignoring my message to go to sleep for a while, you must be staying up for a good reason, so here is a chemical cocktail to help you with that&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
