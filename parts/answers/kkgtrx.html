		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a 100m race they have to start at rest on the start line. It takes a while for the runners to get up to speed. However in a relay the runners are allowed to start behind the relay points and get up to speed before they are passed the baton. So they will already be at speed for the entire 100m.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they can get a running start rather than starting out of the blocks. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th leg runners all have a box within which the baton can be passed, but they are running at full speed when their 100m stretch starts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
