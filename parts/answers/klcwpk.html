		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A good portion of the city was excavated before the 1960s but they didn't do a great job so for the remainder of the city the majority is being left untouched and only small areas are being excavated so there will be more areas for the future as more advanced techniques are available</p>
<p>There was a lot of damage done by the early excavations which did a bad job of preserving the site for the future so they're moving a lot slower now meaning there should be steady small discoveries for years to come</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pompeii was pretty humongous - it was a city and the <a href="http://www.italia.it/en/discover-italy/campania/poi/the-archaeological-site-of-pompeii.html" target="_blank">archeological site</a> covers about 66 hectares (163 acres) of which 49 hectares have already been excavated. So it's pretty huge and there's lots left to be discovered. Nearby Herculaneum has only had about <a href="https://www.inexhibit.com/mymuseum/herculaneum-archaeological-site-naples/" target="_blank">20% excavated</a> due to being covered by a pyroclastic flow which buried the city under about 25 m (82 feet) mud, compared with 'only' 11m (36 feet) ash and pumice that covered Pompeii.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pompeii was buried under a volcanic eruption. It can't be searched like a modern city can be searched, it has to be carefully dug out and excavated so that the digging isn't damaging anything. Only then can they photograph and note whatever they found.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
