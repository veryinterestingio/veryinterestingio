		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many metrics to compare. For example, Human eyes take up only 5% of our head, eagle eyes occupy 50%. The back of their eyes is bigger and flatter, physically allowing for a bigger picture on their retinas, which are  more densely covered in light detector cells (cones). Eagles see clearly for up to 5x further than a human with perfect vision.</p>
<p>As to colors, we humans can see three basic colors with three different types of cones. Eagles see four. Every color is more vivid, separation between shades is sharper and ultraviolet light can be seen. Humans with a tetrachromatic mutation reportedly see 100 million colors - a hundred times more than normal. It's likely similar with eagles.</p>
<p>Even their field of vision is about double to that of humans. We only win with our ability to see in the dark, as eagle eyes have such a large number of cones, that they only have a low number of rods, which work in low-light.</p>
<p>Edit: Eagles have four types or cones, not five. Thanks for the correction!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Is it sharper, so sharp that it can so details from really far away?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is probably the most correct way to put it. Imagine trying to read a sign from far away, you can't tell what's written on it, you only see a black line. An eagle would be able to tell the letters apart, but it's not like it's zoomed in: if they read the sign, they don't sacrifice the rest of their field of view to zooming, they perceive their whole view as zoomed in, all at once.</p>
<p>The explanation behind is that they have a higher density of photoreceptors. Let's simplify things and imagine black and white vision (not shades of grey, just black and light, 0 and 1). If you look at two dots far away, the light coming from both dots ends up hitting the same photoreceptor in your retina: your brain then can't understand there are two dots, because the same neuron lights up for both. An eagle retina instead has denser photoreceptors and their eye is structured so the light is spread on a larger surface, so the light coming from the two dots can hit different receptors and their brain can tell the difference.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are the colors brighter?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They have 5 cones instead of 3, so yes. Each cone can distinguish well a certain wavelenght. It's fairly similar to the example above, but with colours. Let's say you are looking (closely) at two spots with a very slightly different shade of red: in your retina, the two shades of red make the same set of receptors react in the exact same way, so your brain can't tell the difference. An eagle retina instead reacts in different ways, so they can make up the difference.</p>
<p>Finally, they have more neurons dedicated to figuring out what the retina is picking up. Something useful to understand the consequences of this is the concept of the blind spot: the human eye has a spot where it can't see (just google &quot;how to find my blind spot&quot;), your brain fills up this spot with what is around it, so that you never notice it. Your brain is constantly doing some processing to refine the image your eyes are picking up, kinda like a photographer using photoshop to improve their pics (try googling &quot;checkboard illusion&quot; to see an example). More neurons dedicated to vision are needed to process all the additional informations, but they are likely also able to do more processes like the ones i mentioned above, in a better way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eye doctor here.  Well, human eye doctor.  It looks like most of the posts here are on the physiology of the eye, which are very very relevant however, one part being largely ignored is whatâ€™s known as visual processing.  Birds in general dedicate a tremendous amount of resources and physical brain matter to vision as it is extremely important for flight and in the case of raptor type birds, extremely important for hunting.  Not only do they have more of a % of brain matter dedicated to vision, but ounce for ounce, birds have more neurons than humans do too.  On top of all of this, bird metabolism is faster than humans and body temperature runs higher allowing their brains (adapted for the additional heat) to consume more glucose and use everything mentioned above on TURBO.  Birds are absolutely amazing creatures.  If I recall from my ornithology courses, the pigeon actually has better vision potential overall than the eagle so itâ€™s kind of a misconception.  Pigeons are a far less sexy topic to talk about than Eagles though haha.  Especially in America! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a great question.  As you deduce, OP, &quot;better eyesight&quot; is a concept that really depends on what you're measuring.</p>
<p>For some attributes (color contrast, fine-grained sensitivity, pattern recognition), human vision is actually the best out there.  For example, human eyes can perceive single photons.  That's a pretty neat trick.  (Also the basis for certain historical scientific discoveries.)</p>
<p>We don't emphasize those things very much because of familiarity -- instead we get excited about visual capabilities that other animals have that we don't have, and so we talk about how much better their vision is than ours.  Maybe it's because of low-light sensitivity, or breadth of view, or ability to see underwater, or (as in the case of eagles and other birds of prey) high visual acuity.</p>
<p>So, whenever anyone says &quot;X has the best vision in the animal kingdom,&quot; you always have to ask on what basis.  For eagles, it's visual acuity -- they can see detail at long distances that you would have trouble seeing unless you were much closer.</p>
<p>But ask an eagle to see through camouflage, and they won't do as well as we do.  (Not that they're bad at it... we're just really, really good at it.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
