<p>FM radio is like communicating by changing the color of a light. Many things block the light making it dimmer, but few things can change its color easily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a flute player playing in heavy winds. AM would be if the player sometimes played a given note, and sometimes would be silent.</p>
<p>If you were far away it would be hard to properly distinguish when he was silent and when the wind blew too much.</p>
<p>FM would be if he played continuously but switched notes instead. It would be much easier for you to &quot;lock on&quot; to the flute and distinguish one note from the other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way that FM extracts the information from the signal means that it can only &quot;hear&quot; one source at a time.  AM, on the other hand, hears everything on the frequency.</p>
<p>Suppose you have two radio stations at the same frequency.  With FM, you will only hear the stronger station (called the capture effect).  With AM, you will hear the weaker station in the background.</p>
<p>With AM, the noise you hear is other things that emit interference on that frequency.  This might be general static, another weaker station, the characteristic dit-dit-de-dit of a GSM phone, the whine from a trolleybus or anything else.</p>
<p>With FM, the only interference you will usually here is a sort of cutting in and out with weak stations.  Note that, while the effect is all-or-none, it is not a digital signal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because interference can only change the amplitude of a signal, so amplitude modulated signals can get a lot of noise from interference, which will be converted to sound</p>
<p>FM doesnâ€™t suffer nearly as bad interference because the noise only comes from other noise around that is powerful enough to be heard over the sound from the station or when then signal is too weak to be picked up properly</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>AM waves are wide, so they can travel further. FM waves are thin, so you have to be close to the source. So, the FM waves are clearer in most cases compared to than AM waves (unless you live close to an AM station).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
