However, in the introduction to the study, previous research has found that number to be around 55% &quot;Depending on the applied definitions, the prevalence of suicidality amounts to more than 55% in patients with predominant MDD (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6007240/#CIT0002" target="_blank">Asnis et al., 1993</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6007240/#CIT0031" target="_blank">Schaffer et al., 2000</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6007240/#CIT0034" target="_blank">Sokero et al., 2003</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6007240/#CIT0039" target="_blank">Zisook et al., 2009</a>).&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From my own professional experience (I'm a mental health counselor) I'd say that in my outpatient work it's about \~%50-60. But like the other poster said, &quot;suicidal thoughts&quot; are broad. Very different form &quot;suicidal ideation&quot; which is a more serious step.</p>
<p>Also, one thing to keep in mind is that lots of people have fleeting thoughts about dying, even people who don't meet the criteria for MDD. </p>
<p>I always encourage an active discussion with my clients when they feel comfortable because it 1) lets me accurately assess risk, and 2) lets the client explore some of those thoughts in a safe space that often times puts them at a place of ease and has those thoughts back away naturally. </p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, talking about suicide does NOT increase a person's risk and many people often feel at ease when they can express what's going on for them. I've been able to keep quite a few of my clients safe by having a frank discussion with them about their risk and safety planning with appropriate referrals or follow-up services.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Having worked in mental health, we asked patients at every appointment whether they were having suicidal thoughts, and I can assure you that it is <em>not</em> 100%. It's of course higher than it is in the overall population, but I've had a hard time finding an actual validated percentage. This is probably complicated by the fact that suicidal thoughts range from passive escape fantasies (&quot;I just wish I didn't have to deal with this anymore&quot;), suicidal ideation (&quot;I've thought about killing myself but I haven't thought about how I would do it&quot; ), and suicidal ideation with a plan.  </p>
<p>Just FYI: to diagnose MDD, you need the presence of at least five depressive symptoms, <em>including depressed mood or loss of interest,</em> for a minimum of two consecutive weeks: decreased appetite and weight or increased appetite and weight, insomnia or hypersomnia, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, psychomotor agitation or retardation, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, and suicidal ideation and behavior. So you HAVE to have one of the first two, but all the rest are optional.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! Friendly neighborhood Suicidologist here. While specific numbers on this can be hard to pin down for various reasons, here are some things to consider. Depression is very common and about 20-25% of the US population will have symptoms of depression and anxiety over the course of a year. Of that group, it’s not uncommon to have suicidal feelings. These can range from vague thoughts that it might be okay not to wake up tomorrow to very intense urges to take immediate and highly lethal actions to end your life.
Other posters on this thread have noted the issues one might experience if they share their suicidal thoughts. In addition it is also the case that many healthcare professionals (research says around 90% or so) may not ask or may not competently assess and assist someone with these feelings. It’s a real problem in our health care system and leads to challenges for people who report their suicidal feelings. It also discourages many from ever sharing.
In all, our best estimates in the US are that about 8-9 million folks have very high risk and intense suicidal feelings each year. 1-2 million will act on those feelings, and 45-50K are likely to die by suicide.
It is important to keep in mind that the vast majority of people who have suicidal thoughts and feelings do not go on to attempt or die, and most people who have intense feelings and attempts survive and go on to recover.
That being said, suicide is still the 10th leading cause of death in the US and worldwide. And even if it doesn’t kill you, suicidal feelings are excruciating and people deserve good care and relief from that potentially lethal emotional pain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
