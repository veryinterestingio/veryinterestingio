		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even when they &quot;rock out&quot; they're still maintaining the basic tempo of the music, just as you would if you changed from counting &quot;1, 2, 3, 4&quot; to &quot;1, &amp;, 2, &amp;, 3, &amp;, 4, &amp;,&quot; twice as fast, or even &quot;1-e-&amp;-a, 2-e-&amp;-a...&quot; four times as fast. The first would commonly be called quarter notes/beats, the second are eighth notes, and the third are sixteenth notes. But the overall speed/tempo stays the same. All of the '1's happen at the same time. </p>
<p>Also, the drummers know the tempo of the song from the beginning, as they're the ones who set it. So even if they go into a 20-minute drum solo with multiple tempo changes, they will still go back to the original tempo before the band continues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't matter if the drummer appears to go nuts, to them it's controlled. If it's a live show, there is a good chance they're wearing in-ears which will play a constant click track at the tempo of the song, maybe even layered with backing track cues, extra instruments, random fx etc. anything to let you know where you are on that odd occasion you get lost. Even without in-ears, drummers tend keep time with their (typically) left foot on the hi-hat pedal, while others are capable of counting internally, which is different from mentally. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone in a (good) band needs to understand time and where the beat is. The bass and drums together usually drive the time, with the bass often being more important for the time depending on the genre. But if the bass and/or drums stop playing or go crazy, all of the other musicians should still know how to stay in time.</p>
<p>Keeping the beat and playing in time is a skill all musicians, regardless of their instrument, learn.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a number of ways. Some drummers have internal metronomes and stay on top of the beat without any further tools. Some drummers count in their head. Some ride the flow of the music.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
