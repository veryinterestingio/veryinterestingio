		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You could elect yourself CEO.   You could elect whatever board of directors you wanted to help you run the company.   You could hire and fire the president of the company, or any of the other management personnel.  You could make any major or minor decisions regarding the running of the company.   </p>
<p>But with that being said, autocrats don't last very long in the business world.   They tend to make bad decisions or get so caught up in minutiae that they run the company into the ground.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You effectively control the company. You could sell it if you want to. You control decision making.</p>
<p>That said, usually, the founders of a company own the majority share since the founders decide how much stock is sold off. Most founders would keep enough shares to retain control.</p>
<p>One way to do a hostile takeover of a company is to pay a premium above market value to acquire majority shares or to use shareholder's voting rights by proxy for example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a reasonable number of things you are not allowed to do. There are laws that protect 'minority shareholders' but you could basically make all the decisions (as long as they were not made to ripoff the other shareholders').</p>
<p>As an example you could not agree to sell the entire company to your husband for a dollar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>It has failed many, many times and many charters declare no one can own more than 49% of the shares for any amount of money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
