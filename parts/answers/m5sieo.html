		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit: Even knowing all this, <strong>the most important thing is that you get vaccinated.</strong> No vaccine is perfect, but herd immunity is pretty damn good. I would encourage people to get the vaccine that is available to them the soonest. The really cool thing about J&amp;J is that the vaccine is stored at normal refrigerator temperature, which makes distribution much easier, especially to low income or rural areas!</p>
<p>The antibodies are, in some ways, different. Both the Moderna/Pfizer mRNA vaccines and the J&amp;J adenovirus vaccines encode the spike protein, so their T cell and antibody repertoire will all cover the same protein. The big difference lies in the delivery method and the dosing schedule.</p>
<p>Moderna and Pfizer use mRNA delivered in lipid nanoparticles. The nanoparticles get eaten by immune cells, which then use the mRNA to produce the spike protein and display  it to T cells and B cells (antibody producing cells). The lipid nanoparticle isn't really recognized by the immune system, so it can easily travel through the body until it is eaten by its target cells. Once it enters the cells, however, there are mechanisms that detect foreign RNAs that usually protect against viral infections. This serves as a danger signal that boosts the immune response, which leads to more T cell and B cell memory and improvement in the efficacy of the antibodies. Since the mRNA isn't recognized until it enters the cell, you can boost people with a second dose, which causes the immune system to make even better antibodies and even more memory cells.</p>
<p>J&amp;J uses an adenovirus that's been engineered to express the COVID spike protein. This works essentially the same way as the mRNA, except the virus infects muscle cells which then produce the spike protein. The major difference here is that adenovirus is SUPER immunogenic, so while you mount an immune response against the spike protein you also mount one against the virus itself. This happens before (and during) the virus enters the cell. This means that you can create a strong response to the spike protein with only one shot, but it also means you have a strong anti-adenovirus response. Since the response is so strong, you would actually mount a defense against the booster shot so quickly that the virus could never get into your cells to produce spike protein. Without the boost, you have less improvement in your antibodies and less memory development in B and T cells. But since the first response is so strong, you can get away with it.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: Boosting makes the response better, which you can do with mRNA vaccines. But adenovirus vaccines are so intense that you can get away without boosting, with admittedly less efficacy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A bit of a simplified primer is required here. So, in utero, the body pretty much makes a random assortment of antibodies to various possible targets. This obviously is not ideal as there is a possibility of attacking itself. In the thymus, all the cells which produce antibodies  directed towards self are eliminated and what is left, is basically what we have to face with all future 'threats'.</p>
<p>Any part of the spike may be target, therefore by the host immune system as a consequence of the above. Any failure to make antibodies (or ramping up production that clonal line of antibodies) would suggest that that clonal line to any part of the spike had been removed previously by the body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just fyi about the T &amp; B cell thing. you'll make both in response to the vaccine. B plasma cells are what actually make the antibodies via clonal expansion but T memory cells are what actually are going to remember the disease next time you're infected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answer in this thread is pretty close but I wanted to make some clarifying points. B cells develop and mature in the bone marrow. As they mature, they undergo positive and negative selection to ensure they are capable of producing antibodies and that those antibodies they produce do not recognize self antigen. At this point, the antibodies expressed by the B cell are low-affinity and not specific to a given pathogen, but rather generalized for a more immediate but less effective immune response. Upon exposure to a foreign antigen, a B cell will process and present the foreign antigen to a T cell, at which point the T cell will express cytokines telling that B cell to differentiate and begin producing antibodies highly specific to that pathogen. It takes time for the B cell to figure out how to make a high affinity antibody, so it iterates for a while. </p>
<p>Effectively, so long as the spike protein produced by both the mRNA and J&amp;J vaccines is identical (which it should be at least pretty close), the theoretical antibody affinity should be identical. </p>
<p>Regarding why efficacy isn’t 100%, it’s hard to say for certain, but I believe current suggestions indicate improper administration playing a factor (as well as any comorbidities that would suppress immune function), though it’s possible genetics also have a role </p>
