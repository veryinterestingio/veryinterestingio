		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don’t have my giraffe anatomy books with me because I’m traveling, but, if the esophagus of the giraffe is anything like that of the horse, I suspect this isn’t a huge problem (at least not with water...improperly chewed feed might be a whole other problem though).</p>
<p>First of all, coughing and having something stuck in the esophagus are two different processes. The trachea and the esophagus split off from the oral cavity. In most species, if something is stuck in the rear oral cavity or trachea, a cough might be elicited to remove it. When something is stuck in the esophagus, some species might still cough but there would not be air to force it out.</p>
<p>Regarding esophageal anatomy, some species (like horses) have an esophagus that is partially striated muscle (skeletal, voluntarily controlled) and partially smooth muscle (involuntary). Other species, like the dog, have entirely skeletal muscle on their esophagus (have you ever seen a dog swallow a bone whole?).</p>
<p>When something is stuck in the esophagus, species with all skeletal muscle in their esophagus might just voluntarily swallow more often to try and propel the bolus along. Species with partially smooth muscle will also swallow more often, and might have involuntary contractions move the bolus along.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Speaking as a vet, a giraffe is a ruminant. Which means - in layman’s terms- that they can and do ‘chew the cud’. So they eat leaves. Chew a bit. Swallow. Gets to the stomach - 4 chambers. Gets further digested. But needs a bit more breaking down those tough plant fibres. So. Later on they will get a bolus from the stomach, travels up the oesophagus, and into the mouth to be chewed again. Then swallowed again. Chocking is rarely seen in ruminants, for this reason. It’s seen in domestic ruminants because we feed them odd stuff or they have access to eat a large potato. In terms of true choking - a foreign substance into the trachea - yes, a giraffe wouldn’t have the lung capacity to expel anything more significant than a bit of water. But they can and do cough. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
