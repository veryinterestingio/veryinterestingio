		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a correlation between temperature and intensity of light. Astrophysicists use the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertzsprung%E2%80%93Russell_diagram" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertzsprung%E2%80%93Russell_diagram</a>). Temperatures that high are measured using this correlation. It's also important to understand that those measurements come with a margin of error usually proportional to the scale. So it's more likely that the temperature was 5.5 trillion °C, give or take a few billion.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Particle physicist here. The previous answers work well for stars and similar objects, but not for high energy collisions. For high temperatures the radiation that has been mentioned is not regular radiation any more, it is new particles being produced. While you can measure these it is difficult to measure the temperature that way.</p>
<p>Imagine you have some box with an unknown temperature. You throw some ice in it. If it stays ice then the box must be below the freezing point. If it melts then the box must be above the freezing point. If it is above the freezing point you throw in some wax, e.g. from a candle. Same here, but this time the melting point is higher. If that still melts, throw in some iron. Does it still melt? Repeat this with many different substances and you get an idea how hot the box is.</p>
<p>At the LHC, where this record temperature has been achieved, the temperatures are way too hot for regular materials, they would all evaporate. But luckily there are other things we can use: There are elementary particles that like to form pairs with a somewhat strong bond between them. If it is cold these pairs stay together. If it is hot they tend to break apart - similar to melting ice, just at much higher temperatures. We can measure the energy needed to break them apart and we can measure how many do break apart. We can also do this with many different types of pairs and get a good estimate for the temperature. The best thing? These particle pairs are produced in the collisions - they come with their own thermometer, basically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<ul>
<li>
<p>temperature is a measure of energy (or ELI8: a statistical measure of kinetic energy of particles)</p>
</li>
<li>the temperature you are quoting was not really &quot;recorded&quot; in the way we normally record normal temperatures, it was technically created in CERN's Large Hadron Collider, and the energy of those collisions was more or less the equivalent of that temperature.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So let’s remember what temperature measures: the average kinetic energy (which depends on mass and the velocity squared) of the material. So if you have the same gas, the hotter one is the one which, on average, has faster particles. That means, if you get a collection of really fast/high energy particles, that collection will have a high temperature. </p>
<p>This is where particle accelerators, like the LHC at CERN, come in. The whole point of those is to get particles moving really fast then run them into each other. When they collide, you can detect the energy of the resulting matter using built in detectors that track the products of the collision (basically just asking “how hard did this particle hit me?” in a bunch of different ways). There is a relationship between the measured energy and the temperature, so when you measure the energy, it’s really easy to convert to temperature. This particular case that you are referring to was from lead-lead collisions resulting in a quark-gluon plasma at the LHC.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
