		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you draw a sphere in space by putting test masses (at &quot;rest&quot;), or galaxies, all around its surface, then as the universe expands there are more cubic meters inside the sphere as time goes on.</p>
<p>But, a few remarks on your other comments:</p>
<p>- We do not as yet have evidence that space itself is quantized.  That probably requires a unification (theoretical and experimental) of gravity and quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>- There is the possibility that the &quot;dark energy&quot; is indeed a &quot;vacuum energy&quot;, ie intrinsic to space and quanta, but that's at the conjectural level since any computation gives a energy density (for the dark energy) that is 10\^120 off the real answer.  Even in cosmology, that's a miss.  But yes, in that model, there's an energy density associated with every cubic meter of space, and as space expands there's more energy.  It turns out that that's okay in General Relativity, because there is no requirement that the global energy be conserved in GR.</p>
<p>- The expansion of the universe is not &quot;due to dark energy&quot;... but we think that the acceleration of that expansion (ie speeding up with time) is due to dark energy.</p>
<p>- I believe (but would appreciate expert backup on this) that *if* space is quantized, then the expansion of space would require more bits of quantized space to be created, rather than expanding the size of the quantized bit.  The latter idea seems like it would require time-evolution of fundamental constants in physics, which would lead to terrible time-dependence of all sorts of phenomena, which I very strongly suspect we can rule out given our observations of phenomena from long long ago (ie very distant objects, the plasma of the CMB, etc).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All we know is that measurements tell us that objects are moving farther apart from each other at large scales. The mechanism by which this is happening is unknown, hence the term 'dark' energy.</p>
<p>It has something to do with space itself, because it appears to be uniformly distributed across the universe. That's why a cosmological constant hypothesis is the most popular currently. </p>
<p>But do not fall into the trap of thinking it means that new 'bits of space' are being created between two objects and pushing the apart, at least not in the traditional sense. </p>
<p>Remember, if you start speeding towards a distant object, such as a distant star, general relativity tells you that the space between you and that star starts shrinking from your point of view. At 90% the speed of light, the distance between you and that object is almost 2.3 times shorter. But from the star's point of view, it remains the same (minus the distance you already covered getting to 0.9c).</p>
<p>So if there's a finite number of 'bits of space' between you and that star, then you and the star will not be able to agree on the exact number. And for the same reason you won't be able to agree on how much space has expanded via dark energy by adding those 'bits of space' between you and the star.</p>
<p>Hence the source of dark energy must be something more complicated than that. If we could quantize spacetime itself, perhaps we might be able to answer that, but so far we still lack a theory of quantum gravity for us to try.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm very surprised to see no mention of redshift here. While it's absolutely correct to say that the answer to this is not known for sure, the fact that light is literally and demonstrably stretched as it traverses large distances in space implied that it's the existing space itself which is expanding, as opposed to new &quot;units&quot; of space being added. Red shift happens because as photon travel from point A to faraway point B, they are physically being stretched as they travel, which increases their wavelength and makes them redder than they were when they left their point of origin. That wouldn't happen if new units of space were merely being created for the light to traverse, but it makes a lot more sense if the space itself - and therefore, anything contained within it - is also being stretched.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have read through the comments, but like space, there is more now than when I started. I have so many basic questions that I do not see addressed here. </p>
<p>In my oversimplified view of the universe, since the Big Bang the primary thing that changed is space. There was none, then there was a lot all at once, and there continues to be more every day. Matter is just along for the ride. How did space suddenly come into existence? </p>
<p>If space contains any kind of intrinsic energy, what does having more space mean for conservation of energy? </p>
<p>What can that energy do? Can it do more than cause expansion? When it is near matter, can it increase the mass/energy in and around galaxies, and help curve spacetime so they rotate faster?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
