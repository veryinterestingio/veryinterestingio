		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally there is no issue with refueling on modern cars while it is running. The only issue is the EVAP system can test while you are refueling. The EVAP system monitors and controls the capture and burning of fuel vapors in the tank. Gasoline is always creating vapors and those vapors are stored and burned when the engine is running under certain conditions. This system is also why you should not top off as liquid fuel can damage the components. The test is to verify the system is sealed so no vapors are leaking into the atmosphere. If it runs while you are refueling it will set a code and turn your check engine light on. Then you have to go get it cleared if you know that is what caused it or pay to have someone try to diagnose a “ghost” concern.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can.  In fact, it's a standard military technique.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_refueling" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_refueling</a></p>
<p>However, it creates risk that is simply unnecessary in ordinary life and likely wastes gas in the case of a car or boat.  Why would you want to leave an unattended vehicle running to stand next to the exhaust pipe and breathe more exhaust than is necessary?</p>
<p>For instance, if you leave a car running while you refuel there is the potential that someone accidentally bumps it out of park and suddenly you have a moving vehicle plus fuel spraying everywhere.  Or if you have a manual, that you forget to set your parking brake to refuel while it was running (because it would need to be in neutral).</p>
<p>Plus there are some issues with modern car monitoring systems and such....but mainly it's just more dangerous than fully shutting down the vehicle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of things we do are Policies and not Technical reasons to prevent unlikely situations that could have catastrophic results.  It is very very unlikely a car is going to ignite a gas station pump and set off the fuel tanks.  We have those rules in place because its not super inconvenient and it completely prevents it from occurring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trucker (USA) here. Half us don't shut off the truck when we fuel, unless we're going to check the oil or something. There are signs saying to shut the engine off but it doesn't seem to matter. The reasons we don't are varied: laziness, climate control, air loss, electricity usage. People will mention winter and &quot;not shutting truck off&quot; but in reality the hot engine is only off for 5-10 minutes while fueling so even in the coldest winter (err... someone from International Falls, MN might correct me) those 5-10 mins wouldn't be a big deal if the truck has been running for hours already.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You absolutely can. </p>
<p>The reason we turn off our cars at the gas pump is for safety. Not for motor function. </p>
<p>It's a long shot but on a hot still day it would be possible for gas to spill on the ground, gas to vaporize and get in the air, a car could then backfire (or the exhaust so hot it's above the flashpoint) and that could ignite gas vapors. And that could cause a fire, and fires and fuel stations don't mix.</p>
<p>Again, super unlikely. Very rare that it would happen. But that's why.</p>
<p>Edit: just learned this: In super cold areas (I mean like -45°) it's actually normal practice to refuel with the engine running, as in those temps, leaving the engine off even for a few minutes is enough for the oil to freeze and the car to not start again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
