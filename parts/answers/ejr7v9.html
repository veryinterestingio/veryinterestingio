“Split thickness skin grafts” are partial thickness slices of your skin. The donor site will heal the skin because there is still a partial layer of skin left behind that includes hair follicles and sweat glands, which is where new skin cells come from.</p>
<p>“Full thickness skin grafts” are what they sound like: full thickness. The skin cannot heal upwards from the bottom and would need to heal inwards from the sides. So when surgeons take full thickness skin, they suture the wound edges together. Then it heals like any surgical incision or cut you get.</p>
<p>Split thickness is more common because you can take very large grafts and the skin will heal. You can’t take large full thickness grafts because you wouldn’t be able to sew the edges together with a wound so large. Also full thickness skin grafts have a more difficult time “taking.”</p>
<p>You may be asking regarding split thickness skin grafts: why make a new wound just to cover an existing wound? Because the kinds of existing wound we do this for won’t heal well by itself. If you put a skin graft on it, the existing wound will heal well, and the new wound will heal well.</p>
<p>Edit: since a lot of people are mentioning meshing I thought I’d add a blurb about it too. We often mesh split thickness skin grafts. This serves two purposes: 1) the graft can cover a larger surface area, and 2) fluid that would otherwise build up under the skin graft has a place to escape. If that fluid stayed there the graft would not stick and it would die. Meshing the graft does cause more scarring and contracture when it heals, and so it’s not well suited for cosmetic areas like the face or mobile joints like the hand. If we don’t mesh the graft I have to stick a syringe in it every so often to suck out the fluid that builds up underneath.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a very common procedure in plastic surgery to cover clean, non-infected wounds that are too large to heal quickly on their own. Generally, we now only take split thickness skin grafts. This means that not all layers of the skin are taken. It essentially is like a large scrape, and skin from underneath and around can generate new skin cells to grow in. The area that the skin is taken from heals like a scraped knee. Looks bad at first, but it looks a lot better a couple of months to year later. Some people heal so well that you can’t even tell where the skin graft came from!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Burn ICU nurse here. Not really related to OP’s original question but we recently had a case where the surgeons harvested two small skin samples (each about the size of a postage stamp) and sent them off to a lab to have sheets of skin grown. It took about 2-3 weeks for the sheets to grow and then they were packaged and shipped back to our facility. They were able to grow enough skin to cover an entire adult’s leg and half of his abdomen. Many patients with large burns end up dying from infection because there is only a small area of skin left to harvest donor sites from and it can take months of surgeries to fully close the skin. This new lab technology (the brand was called Epicell) allowed us to close about 20% of a 70% burn with just one surgery. Pretty amazing to be a part of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Broadly there’s two types of skin grafts - full thickness and split thickness. Full thickness means you’ve harvested the entire dermis and skin can only grow back from the edges of the wound and so these are almost always closed primarily (the edges sutured together to close the wound which is only possible when you have sufficient laxity).</p>
<p>What you’re alluding to is a split thickness graft which takes the entire epidermis and a variable amount of dermis. Because some dermis is left behind the skin can regenerate across the area from where you’ve harvested the graft. The thickness is generally between 10-18/1000ths of an inch - back skin is thicker than the skin on the back of your hand for instance. </p>
<p>Split thickness donor sites still do leave scarring - looks like road rash because really that’s in essence what it is. As mentioned in other comments, grafts are often fenestrated or meshed to allow for greater coverage with a smaller graft and to reduced hematoma/seroma formation which can cause graft failure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
