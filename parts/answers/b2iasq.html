<p>Think of it like looking at a tv from the side. You can see the picture but it tends to be brighter when you look at it dead center. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Take an apple and breath on it. That thin mist on the surface of the Apple is about how thin the atmosphere on earth is. There is only a couple miles of air between you and the sun at noon. But at sunset the sun travels through thousands of miles of air, since the horizon is many many many miles away. And air, like clouds, blocks sunlight. Ever look at the sun on a cloudy day? It’s not the same color as sunset but it’s kind of the same brightness and this is why.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The light scatters as it reaches the atmosphere. This means the photons collide with atmospheric particles and ions, changing direction and lowering in energy. The reason the sky is blue is because the majority of blue light is scattered within the atmosphere, while the longer wavelengths of yellow, green, red etc make it to the Earth. </p>
<p>Now, as others have said, when the sun is closer to the horizon the photons have to travel through a much greater distance of atmosphere. This allows the longer wavelengths of light more time to scatter, so less light is reaching your eyes. The energy of the photons reaching you doesn’t decrease much, but the intensity is much lower because there’s fewer photons in general. </p>
<p>Fun fact, sunsets are red because the light has to travel so far that all wavelengths of light scatter way before reaching you, and what you see is the lowest energy photons scattering (because they’re least likely to scatter). </p>
<p>When you see a red sunrise it could mean the light is passing through a storm (or another dense atmospheric phenomenon) which is where the term “red sky in morning, sailors take warning” comes from. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one has mentioned this yet, but when the sun is really &quot;low&quot; looking in the sky, you're not actually looking directly at the sun. You're looking at the way its light is bending around the curve of the earth. The sun actually &quot;sets&quot; before what we see as &quot;sunset.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
