<p>And you'll have a roof vent or ideally one vent for each branch of the sewer line to vent out sewer gases and to equalize the pressure in your sewer lines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If drains went straight down, they would be directly connected to the sewer line, and all of the smells and dangerous gases could get directly into your house. Traps keep a water &quot;block&quot; between the sewer line and the house. Sinks, showers, tubs, and even washer drains all have traps. </p>
<p>Until the 1940s, some houses were built with whole-house traps, a single trap outside the house that prevented gases from getting in and allowed the &quot;straight-down&quot; drains that you have asked about, but they have not been allowed by most building codes since then because they were difficult to maintain. The current P-traps or S-traps are better at creating a higher velocity of water thus somewhat cleaning themselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The water stops smells coming into the house from the drains.</p>
<p>In addition, toilets don't need to block often, and don't in most countries. Most people don't need to own plungers! Most toilets in the world work by throwing a whole heap of water onto the waste, which pushes it down the toilet. The waste pipe can be wide, so doesn't get blocked.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://pottygirl.wordpress.com/2011/01/30/why-do-american-toilets-clog/" target="_blank">in the USA, toilets use a siphon action</a> to suck the waste into the drain. This means the toilet waste pipe must be as narrow as possible, so gets blocked more easily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
