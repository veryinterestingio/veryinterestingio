		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The mass of a black hole is all in the singularity, so it gets weird if you talk about its literal density.</p>
<p>But you can define a sort of effective density using the event horizon radius. This &quot;density&quot; would be rho=M/(pi*(4/3) R^(3)), where R is the radius of the event horizon, and M is the mass of the black hole. Taking out the constant terms, this &quot;density&quot; is proportional to M/R^(3).</p>
<p>However, the radius of the event horizon is directly proportional to the mass. It's R=2GM/c^(2). If you plug that into the formula for &quot;density&quot;, you actually get the density is proportional to 1/M^(2) or 1/R^(2). That is, the &quot;density&quot; of a black hole actually <em>decreases</em> as you increase the mass. Each time you add more mass, you increase the volume by a larger factor than you increased the mass by.</p>
<p>This is related to why supermassive black holes have &quot;gentler&quot; gravity than smaller black holes. While the total gravity from a big black hole is of course bigger, a smaller black hole will tear you apart before you reach the event horizon, while you could actually survive passing the event horizon of a supermassive black hole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
