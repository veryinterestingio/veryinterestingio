		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Could be anything from somatic dysfunction to nerve compression, chemical imbalance (ie lack or excess of electrolytes) or a transient ischemic event. </p>
<p>In normal “healthy” people, meaning they have no serious underlying diseases present, those sharp twinges are most likely due to muscle spasm or somatic dysfunction, which is a fancy word for saying that your body is a little out of whack in a certain area (tight muscles, fibrosis of tissues, lack of blood flow, etc). These events are common in pretty much everyone and occur mostly due to normal daily activities. How much pain these things cause in each person is variable, from totally unnoticeable to moderately painful. Some people will even mistake chest pain for a heart attack when really they are just having pectoral muscle spasms. </p>
<p>In people with underlying disease (obesity, heart failure, diabetes, significant atherosclerosis) these pains are more likely to be associated with a more serious issue like vessel spasms, blood clot/embolus, narrowing/hardening of the arteries, etc. </p>
<p>If these types of pains happen infrequently like every couple weeks then it’s nothing to worry about. If you notice pains with normal daily activity or especially upon exertion it’s probably a more serious issue </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
