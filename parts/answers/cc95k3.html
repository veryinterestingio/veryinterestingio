But at the edge of space, light gases are more concentrated than down here - that is how helium can move up, all the way into space, where it's blown away by solar winds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Diffusion + wind have a far stronger effect than bouancy differences</p>
<p>Or to imagine an Eli5 picture.. the gas molecules of the atmosphere are like you've got different grades of flour in a bucket.   Jostling these doesn't necessarily cause them to separate out because the jostling randomly jumbles them up much more strongly than the difference in weight of each grain - so it remains randomly distributed.  But add to that that you're stirring the whole thing over and over at the same time (i.e. like the wind) and you have a constantly randomising mixture similar to the atmosphere</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Sun.</p>
<p>During the day the Sun adds a huge amount of energy to the atmosphere, on that side of the Earth.  This uneven heating causes pressure differentials that power the wind.  Wind mixing overcomes the relatively small density differences, keeping the atmosphere mixed, except in enclosed spaces.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It does. It's particularly notable when the gases are those other than the standard air mix of nitrogen, oxygen, CO2, and argon. Plus water vapor.</p>
<p>For example, if you open a manhole, the hydrogen sulfide will be near the bottom, because it's heavier than air. If the space has carbon monoxide in it, it could be near the top, as it's slightly lighter than air. CO2 is heavier than air, which is why you can use it to create a a ground fog. Methane is lighter than air, but flammable vapors of organic solvents tend to be heavier. </p>
<p>This is super important because you have to know where to look for these things before sending workers into confined spaces. Stratification of gases is a key understanding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is the weather in the atmosphere that  that mix it so close to the ground it is quire uniform. But if you start to look at it at higher altitude there is a clear stratification and it is the heavy that is at the bottom  <a href="http://wordpress.mrreid.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/atmosphere-composition-all.png" target="_blank"><a href="http://wordpress.mrreid.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/atmosphere-composition-all.png" target="_blank">http://wordpress.mrreid.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/atmosphere-composition-all.png</a></a> </p>
<p>In caves and other location with limited wind you can get heavy gasses collected at the bottom. It can be dangerous for human that explore caves and  even human build stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
