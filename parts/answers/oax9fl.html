		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The rapid heating and expansion of cool air creates sound. This is why lightning produces thunder, as the sudden (massive) change in heat causes a huge disturbance in surrounding air, which we hear for miles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When a gas is hot, it’s molecules are vibrating/moving around super quickly. When a cooler gas is introduced, the hot gas wants to share its energy with the cold one, so the hot gas encourages the colder gas’ molecules to vibrate faster. The hot gas will vibrate slower because of this, but all the gas wants to be the same temperature/energy level. </p>
<p>With the rapid change in vibration speed, some of that gas gets compressed together. Gas doesn’t like to be compressed, so the molecules move away from the source of the pressure. Several layers of compressed gas will do this very quickly, which creates the ‘sound waves’ you’re familiar with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sound = vibrating air.</p>
<p>Anything that moves air, makes a sound.</p>
<p>Hot air moves up while cool air moves down, so a fire makes sound too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blowing a flame is nothing but heating the air molecules around it. When gases are heated they get attracted to each other. The cooler molecules move towards the core of the flame, get heated up. This rapid movement of molecules results in vibration, inturn sound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
