		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ant colonies are like human cities. And just as human endeavour continues 'round the clock, so does the activity of the humble ant colony. The bulk occurance of human activity however skews sharply towards daylight hours, with only a fraction of the population engaging in e.g. night-shifts, or panicked essay-crisis all-nighters (preach!). Is there a similar circadian skew in ant activity?</p>
<p>Well, it partly depends entirely on the species, and partly what they're doing.</p>
<p>When it comes to foraging, most ant species forage 24/7. Some species however, many living in hot and/or humid environments (such as <em>Messor pergandei</em>, a desert harvester ant), are often more active outside the nest during the cooler hours of evening and night [1]. In contrast, others prefer the day and sometimes indeed even specialise in high temperature activity. Saharan silver ants (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saharan_silver_ant" target="_blank"><em>Cataglyphis bombycina</em></a>) make a living primarily snatching other animals that succumb to the high daytime temperatures of the desert. As the early afternoon develops and temperatures approach their height, ant-nomming predators scuttle off to seek shade thereby presenting a short window of opportunity where the proverbial dinner table is open to plunder. Silver ants scoot out at the ant top speed record (~2.2mph, equivalent to you running ~447mph) to grab anything and everything they can before continuously rising temperatures make it too hot (&gt;53Â°C) for even the ant to handle (check out [this clip from BBC's <em>Africa</em>] (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCaVvHeI8jU" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCaVvHeI8jU</a>)) [2]. Their whole shtick kinda' reminds me of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdh5rX67UHU" target="_blank">'bio-robots' at Chernobyl</a>. Yeesh!</p>
<p>Circadian-associated foraging aside, are there any other day/night differences in ant activity? Well, not really. The overwhelming bulk of most ant activity takes place at all times: cleaning, rearing young, tending to the queen etc. As such, ants generally don't have a circadian-associated sleep cycle. Oh, and speaking of sleep, yes, they do! One study demonstrated fire ant (<em>Solenopsis Invicta</em>) workers cumulatively 'sleep' approximately ~4 hours a day over an average of ~253 microepisodes, each episode just over a minute long [3]. Queen ants 'sleep' almost twice as long (around ~9.4 hours), over ~92 'sleep' batches each ~6 mins long. They do this at fairly regular intervals 24/7, with no skew towards any particular time of day.</p>
<p><strong>So, in short:</strong> though some species forage outside at different times, the overwhelming majority of ant activity, particularly inside the colony, takes place 'round the clock. Ants do sleep, but in regular short batches all day/night long.</p>
