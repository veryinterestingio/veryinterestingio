		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're not cutting off blood flow when this happens. If that were the case your limb would turn purple and eventually die due to a lack of oxygen.</p>
<p>Under normal operating conditions nerve endings are synchronized, firing off and receiving signals from the brain in unison. Nerve endings regularly fire off a &quot;hey I'm here&quot; signal and the brain regularly sends a &quot;signal received&quot; response, which prompts it to send another signal. It's a constant back and forth communication. When you position your body in a certain way you pinch a major nerve, preventing efficient signal transfer to and from the brain. When the nerve endings lose connection with the brain they get unhappy and start randomly firing trying to get a response. When you reposition and that connection is restored then your brain is flooded with random signals from that limb which gives you the pins and needles feeling. After a few minutes everything has resynched and returned to normal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You feel like you're going numb because you're putting pressure on a nerve, blocking its signal from the rest of the body. When you take away the pressure, it starts sending signals again, but more intensely as it wakes back up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
