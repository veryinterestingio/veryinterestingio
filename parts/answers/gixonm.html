		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi :-)</p>
<p>All batteries have a nominal voltage, but the voltage changes depending on how full the battery is (and depending on the load).</p>
<p>So your 4.2 volt phone battery will have 4.2V at full charge, and cuts off at 3.3V (as discharging it further will damage the battery). This is not completely linear, but the software accounts for that.</p>
<p>Under heavy load (e.g. video, wifi, full brightness) the voltage will drop quicker.  Or if the battery's outside and cold. This is the reason why you can sometimes turn your phone back on with a few percent of charge left after it shut off.</p>
<p>As for how it's done: There are certain chips and components (e.g. bandgap voltage reference); The simplest is a &quot;Zener diode&quot;. You can build a very simple circuit to deliver  something like 1 Volt as reference Independent from the battery voltage. A microprocessor can than compare the voltage to the battery. If you have a $5 multimeter and like to tinker, you can try :-) Zener diodes are dirt cheap, a few cents a dozen. Or if you are into Arduino/micro-controllers, many micro-controllers have a reference voltage built-in, so you can indeed check your battery status for your DIY projects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your phone battery is a bumpin' club in a Saturday night. When you charge it, that's like people going in. You can only charge it so much because there is a maximum capacity. But you also use energy, too, which is like people leaving the club. Phones are complex and always on, so people can come and go at any time in any amount.</p>
<p>That's where the bouncer comes in. The bouncer stands by the door and carefully counts everyone going in and coming out. They know the club's max capacity and stop letting people in when they're near it.</p>
<p>Because they were counting each individual, they can give you a decently precise estimate of what percentage full the club is at any point.</p>
<p><strong>BONUS</strong></p>
<p>The bouncer NEVER leaves the door. They never actually go in the club. When it finally dies down Monday morning, and they see the lights shut off inside, they can consider whatever that head count is to be &quot;empty.&quot; Then when it's at absolute peak time on Saturday, they can watch to see when the people going in can't actually get in, and they update that count to be &quot;capacity.&quot; That gets them a really good idea of percentage full at any time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of a battery like a air container. Electronic devices like your phone require a specific pressure (Voltage) to run and consume a specific amount of air per second (Amperage). </p>
<p>A battery can only be charged to a certain voltage or be drained to a certain voltage before it gets damaged. So in our example the air container has a maximum and a minimum pressure. </p>
<p>You simply read the pressure and look how far it is from maximum or minimum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
