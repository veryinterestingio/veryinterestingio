		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;idea&quot; of Adobe Flash was to give websites access to functionality that previously only installed programs had.  This reduced the need to install a bunch of programs and avoided conflicts from having a bunch of programs installed that you weren't using any more.</p>
<p>Alas, this is also exactly what malware wants to do.  The Adobe people can't do the obvious things, like restricting dangerous capabilities, because that undoes the purpose of the program.  That's why many security people say the only safe thing to do with Flash is not use it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Adobe Flash was built in a time when they didn't have to worry about making secure code. It got super popular, and when they <em>did</em> start worrying about secure code, it was too late to go back and change it.</p>
<hr />
<p>Story time:</p>
<p>Back in the days Before Google (BG), personal computing was going through a wild transition. The emergence of CD-ROM technology brought the concept of &quot;multimedia&quot; into people's homes. Instead of just text or pictures, applications could now use video, audio and animation to provide information.</p>
<p>A plucky little company called &quot;Macromedia&quot; capitalized on this by developing a tool called &quot;Director&quot;, which allowed people to create multimedia applications for distribution on CDs. It proved to be quite popular. </p>
<p>Back then, the Internet really wasn't a thing yet--the closest you could get were services like CompuServe, Prodigy and America Online--walled-garden subscription services providing access to curated information over the telephone at per-hour rates. You didn't have to worry about large-scale viruses or whatnot. So Macromedia didn't really worry too much about building Director in a &quot;secure&quot; manner.</p>
<p>Then, all of a sudden, the World Wide Web became a thing, thanks largely to the Netscape Navigator browser, which for the first time, gave Normal People‚Ñ¢ an easy way to use the Internet. The World Wide Web is based around HTML, which at the time, was great for text and pictures but really couldn't do much else. Netscape came up with a solution to that problem: plugins! You could attach little bits of software to the Navigator browser which could be used to play videos, show animations, basically do anything HTML couldn't handle.</p>
<p>Macromedia looked at this and thought &quot;hmm, what if we made a plugin to let web pages have small, fast, scripted animations on them?&quot; And they did, taking their Director technology and making a plugin called &quot;Shockwave&quot;, which later got pared down into an animation plugin called &quot;Shockwave <em>Flash</em>&quot;.</p>
<p>Shockwave Flash proved amazingly popular. It became a de-facto plugin you simply <em>had</em> to install as soon as you got connected to the internet. It became Macromedia's flagship product, taking over from the Shockwave product that it was derived from. So much so that they dropped the &quot;Shockwave&quot; name and it just became &quot;Macromedia Flash.&quot;</p>
<p>Flash's popularity was so great that web developers began relying on it to build entire websites, with increasingly glitzy animations, complex scripting, audio and more. This was still back in the heady late 90s/early 00s, before anyone knew what &quot;Blaster worm&quot; was, and what a &quot;buffer overflow&quot; was. Responding to web developer demands, Macromedia crammed more and more features into Flash, not really caring about security at all, just performance. And in turn, developers were using it for things it was never designed for. Huge, complicated applications were built entirely in Flash. 3D games, video players, and more. Flash handled it all, but Macromedia never thought about security because they never had to.</p>
<p>Then, in 2003, the Blaster worm hit (a worm is malware, but it doesn‚Äôt do anything bad to the machines it infects; its only purpose is to ‚Äúworm‚Äù its way from machine to machine). It didn't target Flash, but rather a &quot;buffer overflow&quot; vulnerability in Windows. But it wreaked so much havoc all over the world that it forced software developers to start thinking about how to develop their applications more securely in the face of new threats on computers that suddenly had fast, permanent internet connections (broadband had started to become a thing in the early 00s, with cable modems and DSL coming into homes. Before that, home computers largely stayed offline until you connected manually over a phone line using a 56kbps modem).</p>
<p>Because of these new malware threats, Microsoft literally spent two years re-writing Windows from top to bottom to better deal with them. So did Netscape, and a host of other companies. But Macromedia didn't. And neither did Adobe (Adobe purchased Macromedia in 2005). Instead, they kept patching Flash to fix new vulnerabilities as they were discovered.</p>
<p>Flash was a victim of its own success. Adobe didn't want to re-build it from the ground up, because they were afraid that doing so would break a whole bunch of existing Flash apps. And the fact that it was installed on damn near every internet-connected machine made it an attractive target to attack, and amplified the impact of any exploit.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Flash is the Swiss Army chainsaw of web application. It can do many things, while spewing smoking, making loud noise, and if you do it incorrectly it will cut off your arm.</p>
<p>It's difficult to explain at then end of it's life cycle what it can't do (Besides run on mobile). For instance I believe if you are running Flash it can act as a mail server, and thus send SPAM messages, it can save files to your hard disk, it can do practically anything, which makes it impossible to secure correctly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
