<p>They seem to indicate that higher humidity leads to larger particles and that leads to quicker gravitational settling.</p>
<p>So the viral loaded cough particles collect moisture and sink to the ground faster in higher humidity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s not completely clear, but the leading hypothesis is that humidity affects the virus structure (both the protein and the lipid components), so that under the wrong humidity conditions the virus particles are less stable and become inactivated more rapidly. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is assumed that temperature and humidity modulate the viability of viruses by affecting the properties of viral surface proteins and lipid membrane … The results indicate a striking correlation of the stability of winter viruses at low RH (20–50%), while the stability of summer or all-year viruses enhanced at higher RH (80%) … temperatures in the thermal comfort zone and low RH condition, typical indoor winter features in temperate climates, slow inactivation of influenza virus. More recently, an analytical chemistry approach revealed that the low-temperature condition promotes the ordering of lipids on the viral membrane and contributes to the stability of the influenza virus particle </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Few weeks ago, I realized that places with lower elevations has higher rate of positive cases and I thought that air behavior might affect the transmission of the virus and it's safer on places with higher elevations. But looking at this study, it only means that it is possible for places with higher elevation to contract the virus later than the peak of cases. And now that there is a possibility of a second wave, I think higher places are more risky to be in right now</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
