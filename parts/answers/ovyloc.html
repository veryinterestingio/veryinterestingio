		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A couple of good answers already in this thread covered the &quot;always day&quot; part. What hasn't been answered so far in this thread is the second part of the question: always night. I think the answer is no.</p>
<p>The closest to it would be the L2 point. It's similar to the L1 that one of the other comments described, but on the other side, i.e. farther away from the Sun, at about 1.5 million km from Earth in the outwards direction. From this point, if you do the math, the Sun is supposed to look slightly bigger than the Earth (in angular diameter terms - of course the Sun is a lot bigger but it doesn't &quot;look&quot; that big as we're so far away). So, if you were observing from that point, the Sun would look like in a constant annular eclipse.</p>
<p>So, this isn't exactly a &quot;constant night&quot;, but the amount of sunlight is significantly reduced by Earth's shadow.</p>
<p>Just like L1, it takes a lot of energy and time to reach L2, so also in this case don't expect any space stations to be put there, only satellites. An additional difficulty specifically for L2 is that power for solar panels is reduced. You could, however, orbit L2 in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_orbit" target="_blank">halo orbit</a> to get constant sunlight.</p>
<p>(That wikipedia link also contains a nice diagram showing the locations of L1 and L2).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes this would be an orbit with an inclination of slightly over 90 degrees. This is called a sun synchronous orbit. Not only is it a polar orbit in which the sun doesn't set during one orbital period. But due to the equatorial bulge of the earth the orbit also processes around just quick enough for the axis of rotation to always point at the sun.</p>
<p>Why did they not launch the iss into this orbit?
An orbit like this requires more fuel to reach than the 51.6Â° orbit that the iss is in now. This orbit was chosen because it passes roughly overhead of it's launch sites, of which baikunur is most north.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, the ISS as it currently exists cannot do either. Its ability to change its orbital height and/or inclination is very limited. But in theory we could build a new space station in an orbit that's high enough and inclined such that Earth would not eclipse it on every orbit, just like the moon is not eclipsed by Earth every month even though it goes &quot;behind&quot; Earth from the sun's perspective.</p>
<p>Being constantly in Earth's shadow is much more difficult. Basically it's only possible at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#L2_point" target="_blank">L2 Lagrange point</a>, which is unstable, so propellant must be expended to stay there for longer periods of time. It would, of course, also make it impossible to use solar panels to generate power for the spacecraft's systems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The interesting thing about this question is that both the &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; camps are equally right. Yes, there is a specific kind of sun-synchronous orbit that would work, as might the L1 and L2 points, sorta. No, the ISS cannot reasonably move into those orbits. Yes, given infinite fuel, it would eventually be possible. No, it would be more efficient to de-orbit the ISS, build a new one, and launch it into an always-day orbit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it could.  There are points in space where a spacecraft needs minimal propulsion to stay 'still' relative to the Earth and Sun called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point" target="_blank">Lagrange Points</a>.  L1 is a point where the gravitational forces of Earth and Sun are almost completely cancelled out by each other.</p>
<p>NASA's <a href="https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/content/dscovr-deep-space-climate-observatory" target="_blank">DSCOVR satellite</a> is at this point now along with a handful of other satellites.  The ISS could sit at this point and always be in sunlight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
