		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very roughly, 1 in 10,000. This recent paper determined about 2 in 10,000:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Results: Out of 133,266 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, 243 persons (0.18%) had at least one subsequent positive swab ≥45 days after the first-positive swab. Of these, 54 cases (22.2%) had strong or good evidence for reinfection.… No deaths were recorded. Viral genome sequencing confirmed four reinfections out of 12 cases with available genetic evidence. <strong>Reinfection risk was estimated at 0.02% (95% CI: 0.01-0.02%) and reinfection incidence rate at 0.36 (95% CI: 0.28-0.47) per 10,000 person-weeks.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>—<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33315061/" target="_blank">Assessment of the risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in an intense re-exposure setting</a></p>
<p>But that was in an “intense re-exposure setting”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Considering the strength of the force of infection, estimated at a daily probability of infection exceeding 1% at the epidemic peak around May 20, it is all but certain that a significant proportion of the population has been repeatedly exposed to the infection, but such re-exposures hardly led to any documentable reinfections.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>so I think half that is more likely for normal scenarios. </p>
<p>Also:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>None were severe, critical, or fatal; <strong>all reinfections were asymptomatic or with minimal or mild symptoms.</strong> These findings may suggest that most infected persons appear to develop immunity against reinfection that lasts for at least few months, and that reinfections (if they occur) are well tolerated and no more symptomatic than primary infections. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And one incidental observation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comparing these incidence rates suggest that the “efficacy” of natural infection against reinfection is around 1–10/200 =~ 95%. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 95% natural immunity is strikingly similar to the vaccine immunity we’re seeing with Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question, can someone who has already contacted COVID-19 actively spread the virus without becoming infected themselves? For instance I know a lot of people that have the mindset of &quot;well I've already had it so I can go to restaurants and bars&quot;. Can those individuals be actively spreading the virus to others who may not have it yet?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not exactly a statistical analysis of reinfections, just a large-scale collation of individual reports, but this site has detailed analyses of some 30 confirmed reinfections and 2,000 suspected reinfections:</p>
<p><a href="https://bnonews.com/index.php/2020/08/covid-19-reinfection-tracker/" target="_blank">https://bnonews.com/index.php/2020/08/covid-19-reinfection-tracker/</a></p>
<p>It's only 30x better than an anecdotal news article about one particular victim of reinfection, but at least the evidence is rising from &quot;I've only heard of one or maybe two unique cases, maybe they had a false positive test or mistaken identity or something&quot; to the level of &quot;it's extremely rare but sometimes possible.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would just like to add that reinfections by the same virus are not that rare. Generally, once you overcome an infection, your immune system remembers it and provides long term immunity, very often lifelong. The best example are chicken pox, it is very virulent so sooner or later almost everybody gets it,  usually as children. After that you are immune and should never catch it again. Yet I know people who had chicken pox twice. One has had immunity problems her whole life, defficiency, allergies and even anaphylactic shocks, but the other person is relatively healthy immunity-wise, no major chronic illnesses. Sometimes it just happens, a reinfection is not unique to covid, and generally the reinfection is much milder, people who have died from covid reinfection were battleing cancer or other major health issues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
