		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to some of the above.  During that period in Earth's history, caribou were an exceptionally abundant and easily exploited resource. There were available from central France all the way across to Eastern Canada. Simply following caribou herds over generations could get human populations from Eurasia to North America with a pretty good lifestyle and plenty of food throughout the intervening centuries.</p>
<p>Also, during the time that humans were doing that migration, the climate was pretty hospitable. Although humans are tropical primates, we operate really well in the 40 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit range. Go visit some of the backpacking and other outdoor living-type subs and you'll see that early spring and late fall in temperate areas are the preferred activity times as far as temperature goes. In fact climate change is destroying communities in the Arctic regions presently, because it makes it harder for people to live up there when it's so warm. Food availability in abundance, in addition to ease of transportation are some of the major present changes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Opportunity. It may be cold as shit in Siberia, but because it's cold as shit, most people don't want to go there, which means you probably won't get invaded and anything you can grow or hunt is yours to do, cos there's no one else hunting the same food. As long as you can survive in an environment, life will find a way to get there, even life that has a concept of &quot;fucking freezing&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not like someone was sitting in a tropical island then went 'welp, time to move to the arctic&quot; people lived at the edge of cold regions, got better and better at dealing with cold and migrated bit by bit. Like no one moved from somewhere it was 80 all day to somewhere the temperature is 5. They moved from a place the temperature was 5 from somewhere it was 6, who had previously lived somewhere it was 7 or something.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The big game animals of the African Savanna existed along side humans as humans evolved into apex predators, those animals had/have an inborn fear of humans. As human populations migrated north over many generation they encountered animals that had no clue as to how dangerous those skinny little things could be. They were pushovers to human predation. Humans are really good at working smart rather than working hard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
