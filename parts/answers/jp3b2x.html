		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When whole blood is donated, it’s separated into its different components (red cells, plasma, and platelets). The anti-B antibodies in a type A person are only in the plasma.  So, giving A red cells to an A person or an AB person is safe because it’s only the red cells. The same goes for O blood. It’s universal because it’s just the O cells. A plasma can only go to A and O people because they’re the only ones who can handle anti-B antibodies.   O plasma can only go to O patients because it does have anti-A and anti-B. Does that make sense?   </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One point of clarification.  Blood group O donors are the universal red blood cell donors because their red blood cells do not have A or B on them.  Blood group AB donors are the universal plasma donor since their red blood cells have both A and B on them, their plasma lacks A and B antibodies.</p>
<p>In the ABO blood group system, you make antibodies to the blood group substances you do not have.  Everyone makes these antibodies because A and B are present in the environment on bacteria and other things, not just on red blood cells.  For the other blood group substances, such as D which makes you Rh positive, you need to be exposed to someone else’s red blood cells to make the antibody.  This happens with transfusion or pregnancy</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They can! Take TRALI for instance <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali" target="_blank">https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali</a></p>
<p>They have to screen your blood if you've been pregnant before, because the antibodies from baby and mommy's blood cross contaminating during the birthing process can actually cause a recipient of the mother's blood to react badly to the antibodies, sometimes lethally so. I'm a regular plasma donor and also gave given birth 3 times. Had to get screened every time.</p>
<p>But like others have said, it's rare for these things to be a problem</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From /u/FoxTofu:</p>
<p>In some blood types, it's like the blood cells are wearing little hats. If you get some blood cells wearing hats and you don't normally have them, your body is like, whoah, these shouldn't be here, and it attacks them. Type A only likes type A hats, and type B only likes type B hats. Type AB is cool with either kind of hat. Type O doesn't have any hats itself, so the bodies of Type O people will attack A or B or AB blood cells. People with A, B, or AB blood types are ok receiving the hatless Type O blood cells.</p>
<p>The positive and negative refers to Rh blood types. Rh blood types are like the cells have mustaches. Rh+ types, they've all got mustaches but they're ok accepting blood cells with no mustaches. Rh- types, they don't want any of those stupid mustaches. Maybe they could tolerate it a bit, if it's an emergency, but really no mustaches would be better. So an AB+ person is cool with blood that has any kind of hat and mustaches or no mustaches, so they can take any kind of blood, while an O- person can only accept blood with no hats and no mustaches.</p>
<p>There are other accessories that affect blood type, representing more detailed blood types. For surgery and stuff usually ABO type and Rh type are all that matters, but for some transplants you really need the closest type possible, like blood with the exact same hat and facial hair and jewelry and clothes and haircut. That's why people who need kidneys or bone marrow will sometimes ask lots and lots of people to check if they're a potential match, and maybe never find anyone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do. Blood is usually cross matched and typed in order to minimize risks, but it’s still really common. Blood transfusion reactions are so common that you check vital signs at very close intervals assessing for fever or early signs that kidneys are strained. Frequently they are premedicated, and even with some reactions, we will cautiously proceed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
