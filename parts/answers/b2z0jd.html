		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's mixed studies on this but the general consensus is yes. Barring an extremely high fever where it's causing damage to your body, lowering a fever will have either no positive effect on your body, or a negative effect. It's primarily to make you more comfortable. As the vast majority of fever-causing illnesses don't cause lasting damage, most people would prefer to say, feel sort of sick for a week instead of really sick for 4 days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a hot question in research right now.  However...yes, it does appear that in some circumstances the lack of fever can help the little critters survive - the heat typically weakens them.  This can - of course - backfire and the fever itself can cause damage itself (e.g. if you've got a 105 fever  you want to knock that down....period).</p>
<p>Ultimately it's a comfort trade off in <em>most</em> situations.  Since your bug isn't life threatening then you're adding days of discomfort by not taking the fever reducer, or sometime of feeling generally sick at the level you do on the ibuprofen.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Artificially reducing your temperature via antipyretics such as tylenol or ibuprofen has been shown to prolong your viral shedding by up to two days.  It also makes you more likely to spread your illness as you are contagious for longer, but feel better so you take your influenza with you to the grocery store to grab snacks.  I had the flu last week and only took ibuprofen once when I had a fever over 103F and profound body aches.  Took a small dose to take the edge off but otherwise let me fever simmer around 101-102.  Fever broke after 48 hours and I stopped shedding the virus by day four.  I work as an urgent care physician assistant so I reswabbed myself for the flu for science.  </p>
<p>The basic explanation is this:  your body is raising your core temperature as an immune response.  The virus can only replicate in a specific temperature range.  Even a threw degree elevation is enough to denature the virus so that it cant continue to spread as readily.  By taking the fever reducing medications, you are hindering your immune systems attempt to contain the infection, which causes you to be symptomatic even longer.  You should monitor your temp and make sure that it does not rapidly spike or go above 105F as febrile seizures and brain damage can occur at these levels.  Otherwise, if you can tolerate it, cowboy up and let your body do its thing so you can go back to being a functional human being two days sooner than you would if you were inhaling ibuprofen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Your underlying premise is slightly incorrect. The body isn’t “raising its temperature to fight infection.” A fever (or a rise in temperature) is a byproduct of the inflammatory and immune response that the body has against infections like bacteria or viruses. This inflammation and immune response leads to a rise in the body’s temperature, and doesn’t actually help the body fight the infection. </p>
<p>Medications like Advil bring down fevers to help us feel less miserable by, in part, blocking the inflammatory response and therefore the rise in temperature, but they don’t in fact block the immune response which is actually fighting the infection. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
