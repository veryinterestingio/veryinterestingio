		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Goosebumps are basically the result of evolution. Humans used to have a lot more hair, so getting goosbumps would puff up the hair to create more insulation and pockets for heat, like a bird that puffs up its feathers. So basically, goosebumps used to equal heat. Now we're mostly hairless it's not as necessary, but shivers and chills still get your muscles moving, so a slight increase in internal heat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you get scared, your body will puff up its hair to make you look a little bit bigger as a reflex.  These are known as goosebumps.  Like when dogs will puff up the tuft of hair on their backs when they see another dog they don't like.  The bigger you look, the higher the chances are of whatever is scaring to leave you alone.  It's an old evolutionary tactic that doesn't serve us much use now, as we don't have much hair anymore, but is preserved in our physiology.</p>
<p>In the context of a fever, your body wants to raise its temperature to fight an infection.  Foreign invaders don't like the high temperatures and it will also activate some of your other defense systems.  Think of the change as your internal thermostat being turned up.  Your body temperature is now lower than the thermostat temperature, so you <strong>feel cold</strong> and get the chills, even if the room you're in hasn't changed temperature.  Your body, feeling cold, will start doing things to generate and conserve body heat: shivering, constricting blood vessels, warmth seeking behavior, etc.  You may be bundling up in a blanket with a sweater while everyone else is comfortable in a t-shirt because your body is colder than it's desired temperature.</p>
<p>Slightly off topic from the question, but when the thermostat drops back down after the battle, your body is now higher than its target heat.  You will <strong>feel hot</strong> and start sweating.  This is what is known as your fever &quot;breaking.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We used to have a lot of fur, and when the hypothalamus sensed you're getting too cold, it straighted the hairs, giving you a furry portable blanket, and another reason is fear, sometimes you get chills when you are scared, and thats because when you puffed up your fur you looked a lot bigger, which helped scare off predators, because SIZE DO MATTER in the nature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you mean the physiological mechanism of the chill we get when we are sick,  it is involuntary muscle contractions (shivering) and cold feeling that occur in order to help raise the body temp to the new set point of fever.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
