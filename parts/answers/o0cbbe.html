If something with 10% the mass of Earth approaches Earth with a relative velocity of let's say 3 km/s the impact will change Earth's velocity by 300 m/s, or 1% of its orbital velocity. Earth changes its velocity by more than 1% during each orbit from the small eccentricity it has.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The same can be asked about the Moon's orbit, since the Moon originated from that same early collision with Theia, and now it is also in a nearly-circular orbit! That is due to something called tidal circularization, where the tidal forces of the central body act on the satellite in a way that the eccentricity is decreased with time, and therefore the orbit becomes circular <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stanton-Peale/publication/228687644_Origin_and_Evolution_of_the_Natural_Satellites/links/00b4953ad93377c674000000/Origin-and-Evolution-of-the-Natural-Satellites.pdf" target="_blank">Source</a>. I'm not sure if the collision with Theia had a significant effect on the Earth's orbital eccentricity, but, if it did, it could have been circularized again with time due to this effect. </p>
<p>Another interesting thing is that the Earth's eccentricity varies periodically with time over tens of thousands of years due to the gravitational forces of the other planets, namely Jupiter and Saturn, which is one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles#Orbital_eccentricity" target="_blank">Milankovitch cycles</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think one point not mentioned in other posts was that the object, named Theia, was theorized the be at the L4 Lagrange point.  It's orbit was unstable and eventually drifted towards Earth, likely impacting tangentially to the Earth's orbit at fairly low impact speed.  This minimized the orbital change considering it's large size.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Theia is estimated to have been about the size of Mars. Mars has only 10% the mass of Earth. It's also thought Theia was in a similar orbit to Earth, meaning the impact speed was relatively low.</p>
<p>The result is Earth's orbit is not significantly altered. This is backed up by calculations of impact effects.</p>
<p><a href="https://impact.ese.ic.ac.uk/ImpactEarth/cgi-bin/crater.cgi?dist=10000&distanceUnits=1&diam=6100&diameterUnits=2&pdens=4000&pdens_select=0&vel=11&velocityUnits=1&theta=45&wdepth=&wdepthUnits=1&tdens=2750" target="_blank">https://impact.ese.ic.ac.uk/ImpactEarth/cgi-bin/crater.cgi?dist=10000&distanceUnits=1&diam=6100&diameterUnits=2&pdens=4000&pdens_select=0&vel=11&velocityUnits=1&theta=45&wdepth=&wdepthUnits=1&tdens=2750</a></p>
<p>(I admit I am curious about the impact speed generally given for the Theia impact, since it's well below Earth's current escape speed.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The only way for random things to rotate around a sphere in 3 dimensions, is if they all rotate more or less in the same plane, with a circular orbit.</p>
<p>That's why galaxies look like disks (except in the center, where still a lot of collisions happen), and all planets also rotate in the same plane around the sun more or less.</p>
<p>When a solar system is formed, random debris is just floating around and colliding with each other. Things in the primary orbit started gathering mass from that debris, and make that orbit stronger until almost all other debris is gone. Then only the masses in the orbital paths remain, either as planets or as debris bands (the rings around saturn for example).</p>
<p>So if a colision would have slung us out of that orbit, earth would have started colliding with other planets, and not much of earth would be left.</p>
<p>It's actually more likely that the collision you talk about helped us get into the surviving orbit (just by luck and because we know earth is still around).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
