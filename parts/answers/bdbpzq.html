		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A zero-altitude reference surface is defined.  Depending on the body and the usage, this surface might be a sphere, spheroid, or ellipsoid whose dimensions are taken from average measurements of the planet's dimensions.</p>
<p>The reference surface for large solid bodies with slow rotation (e.g. Mercury, Venus) are often simply spheres with the average radius of the planet.  </p>
<p>For faster rotaters (Earth, Mars) an oblate spheroid is more appropriate.  This shape approximates the equatorial bulge caused by planet's rotational momentum.</p>
<p>For a <em>tidally locked</em> fast rotater (Io, Europa) an ellipsoid usually provides the best fit reference surface.</p>
<p>For the gas giants, the convention has been to define zero altitude to be the atmospheric depth at which the pressure equals 1 bar (100 kPa).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Altitude can mean distance above sea level, or just distance above the ground.  For the most part either meaning will only really be useful for aircraft or probe landings (in which case you care about the latter).</p>
<p>For spacecraft you're usually dealing with orbital mechanics, in which case what you care about is the distance from the center of the planet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
