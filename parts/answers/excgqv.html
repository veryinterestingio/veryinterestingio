		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The effect is different based on the type of antidepressant or anti-anxiety medication, and even then it's not universal across people.</p>
<p>Some medications can cause erectile dysfunction. Some can actually cause premature ejaculation. Others result in delayed or difficult to achieve orgasm.</p>
<p>Proper sexual function requires a lot of different neutotransmitters in your brain (e.g. serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, etc.) to all be working exactly in the right balance.</p>
<p>Different antidepressants or anti-anxiety meds alter one or more of these neurotransmitters in different ways. While that may cure the problem, in some people it can also result in different kinds of sexual dysfunction as a side effect.</p>
<p>Note that these medications can alter the effects of every kind of pleasure/reward system. Antianxiety meds in particular tend to cause weight gain, and we're still not entirely sure why.</p>
<p>The good news is that the result is almost always reversible if you stop taking the medication. If you can't live with the side effects, there's often a different kind of medication that you can try instead. (A SNRI instead of a SSRI for depression, for example.)</p>
<p>It's not uncommon for patients to go through 2-3 different ones before they find a drug that helps their condition but doesn't have side effects for them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most common anti-depressant is an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor), which essentially increases the effects and concentration of serotonin. Serotonin also has an inhibitory effect on ejaculation. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you orgasm your brain has released a good amount of serotonin. To &quot;complete&quot; your orgasm, the brain suddenly reuptakes (absorbs, kind of) a lot of that serotonin.</p>
<p>Now a very large number of anti-depressants are Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI's). They do exactly what their name says, they limit the brains ability to Reuptake serotonin.</p>
<p>So when on SSRI's your brain can't &quot;absorb&quot; the serotonin needed to come to orgasm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
