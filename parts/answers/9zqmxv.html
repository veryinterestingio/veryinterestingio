		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people are commenting on examples of lost breeds, not extinct species. </p>
<p>There are few examples, since it would be more common to adjust the breed, instead of letting them go extinct. Domesticated animals are such useful tools that it would be uncommon for an animal to become extinct without the people using them to also be eradicated, which would also eradicate records of such animals.</p>
<p>The only true example of an extinct domesticated mammal I can find is the Fuegian dog. A type of domesticated canid which is a dissident of the Andean Fox. The Fuegian dog was a domesticated animal of indigenous South Americans. Their culture was impacted dramatically by contact with Europeans, which may have contributed to the loss of their canine companion.</p>
<p>Edit: /u/skytomorrownow also commented on a native dog species. This is probably pretty common, since the domestication of canids was fairly universal, and the loss of these animals after colonization, and eradication of the culture, would also be common.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They are similar to the African Bush elephant but were more docile because African elephants nowadays can't be tamed. Much like, Miley.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The aurochs was at least partially domesticated. Remains of wild aurochs intermixed with other cattle species (zebu in southeast eurasia, etc) in domesticated herds have been found across india, europe, and other parts of asia and the middle east. The aurochs gave rise to several strains of cattle that we have now, but was not fully domesticated. Individuals existed in farmed herds and in the wild. It's now extinct, with the last ones dying out by the 1500/1600's. The lineage remains but the original animal is extinct.</p>
<p>Edit: here's a study abstract concerning the domestication of various cattle species, including the aurochs, across eurasia and the middle east: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4445560/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4445560/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
