		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To preface this answer: information about a medium travels at the speed of sound in the medium. So if you change the conditions of a flow at one point, the effect on the medium travels at the speed of sound upstream in the medium.</p>
<p>If you imagine a venturi nozzle and a flow condition where the speed of sound is achieved at the throat, and your downstream flow is travelling at greater than the speed of sound, any disturbances downstream of the throat won't propagate upstream. Picture yourself splashing around in a river where the flow travels faster than the wave speed; no one upstream of the river will be able to see your splashing around. Now there are two ways to achieve a choked flow scenario from here: </p>
<ul>
<li><del>Increase the pressure upstream of the throat</del> <strong>EDIT:</strong> Forcibly increase flowrate upstream of the nozzle  </li>
<li>Decrease the pressure downstream of the throat.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you try <del>increasing the pressure</del> forcing the flowrate to increase upstream of the nozzle (perhaps by increasing power on a compressor), you end up forcing air to get to Mach 1 before the throat. If you picture it does that instantaneously before the throat, because of how supersonic flow behaves it will actually decelerate to subsonic flow just downstream of the Mach transition. And speed up again and slow down again, etc. etc.. This just creates a bunch of shocks in your convergent nozzle where heat is generated but the flow doesn't speed up. And once it gets to the throat, it hits mach 1 anyways and accelerates in the divergent section.</p>
<p>If you decrease pressure downstream, on the other hand, you get a situation of underexpansion at the outlet of your pipe system. Unlike subsonic flow where the information about the new reduced downstream pressure propagates through the system quickly and stabilizes the flow pressures and velocities, the underexpansion remains at the outlet in the form of an expansion fan. Remember: information can't travel in a medium faster than the speed of sound, and if the flow travels faster than the speed of sound, the information downstream never propagates to the rest of the system.</p>
<p>EDIT: Changed &quot;increase pressure upstream&quot; to &quot;increase flowrate upstream&quot;. Your behavior from the reservoir leading up to the throat will not depend on absolute pressure of the reservoir.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you already have the necessary background, only the last two paragraphs need to be read.</p>
<p>Choked flow is the condition where a decrease in pressure downstream of nozzle does not cause an increase in mass flow through the nozzle. </p>
<p>In a rocket nozzle, the pressure gradient between the combustion chamber (before the nozzle inlet) and the nozzle exit accelerates the gas. The high pressure from the combustion chamber essentially shoves the gas to the lower pressure at the nozzle exit.</p>
<p>The converging-diverging nozzle is designed in such a way because at subsonic speeds, a fluid will increase in velocity when it is pushed into an area that is shrinking. At supersonic speeds, the opposite is true - an increase in area that the flow can pass through causes an increase in velocity. This relationship is derived through momentum conservation, mass conservation (continuity), and the isentropic equations for a perfect gas.</p>
<p>At the first part of the nozzle, which is converging, subsonic flow speeds up. When the flow reaches the throat, where the nozzle switches from converging to diverging, the flow will be at Mach 1 (if a high enough pressure difference between nozzle inlet and exit is achieved). Once the flow is Mach 1 at the throat, it will accelerate to supersonic speeds through the diverging section.</p>
<p>Now, to answer your question. At some point, before pressure at the nozzle exit goes to zero, the flow at the throat of the nozzle will become Mach 1 and thus the flow in the diverging section will be supersonic. The fastest way information can travel in a fluid is at the speed of sound. The ‘information’ that the nozzle exit had a lower pressure than the nozzle inlet is communicated by molecules bouncing off each other starting from nozzle exit to inlet. But when flow is supersonic, no Information is communicated upstream, molecules won’t interact in such a way that information can be carried up supersonic flow.</p>
<p>Thus, the gas at the converging section of the nozzle has no way to tell that exit pressure has decreased if the flow is already supersonic. The information being sent to it in the form of molecule interaction making its way upstream does not occur. So we should expect no changes in the flow conditions, and this includes no changes in mass flow. When flow in the diverging section goes supersonic, choked flow occurs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The speed of sound is just the speed at which a pressure wave travels through a medium. One of the characteristics of choked flow is that a further decrease in downstream pressure does not increase flow rate.  This is because the pressure wave cannot travel up the choke point, so no pressure change information makes it past the choke.</p>
<p>I like to think of it like some type of flow event horizon, where information (pressure waves) cannot travel between the choke point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It flows because the fluid behind it pushes it (applying pressure) and the pressure reduces when it actually moves.</p>
<p>When it's flowing at its speed of sound, that basically doesn't happen anymore - the fluid behind can push as much as it likes, but the increased pressure never makes it to the fluid moving in the constriction (because sound is simply moving pressure), ergo the fluid doesn't flow any faster despite increased pressure, which is the definition of choked flow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The shock wave, pressure wave, also known as sonic boom, has no where to go once the air, or fluid, is flowing at the speed of sound through the nozzle restriction, because the speed of sound is the maximum rate that any pressure wave can flow through a fluid.  The nozzle basically builds up pressure wave after wave as the speed increases, until all the waves are stacked up and merge in the nozzle restriction.  One may find some Schlieren photography of this on line, perhaps ... </p>
