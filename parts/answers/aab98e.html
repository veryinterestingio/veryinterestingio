<p>TL/DW. sounds have inherent overtones.  Harmony is based on them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Harmonious tones are the result of overlapping frequencies. </p>
<p>Every tone played by an instrument (or voice) is composed of multiple frequencies, and if two tones share a lot of frequencies, humans can sense that instinctively in the way our brains perceive sound. Your ear is filled with arrays of tiny hairs of varying lengths which each vibrate to specific frequencies (sending nerve signals), so two tones which share frequencies set more hairs of different lengths vibrating.</p>
<p>Musical scales are built up of tones that share varying levels of harmony, i.e., shared frequencies. For example the &quot;dominant&quot; relationship (interval) is the strongest harmony. This is the first two tones of &quot;Twinkle Twinkle Little Star&quot;. The two tones naturally sound good together in sequence or overlapped. Other intervals in the scale are progressively less harmonious, and the scale contains enough tones to be useful without being cluttered with unharmonious tones. When we hear &quot;wrong&quot; tones, it's because they share few frequencies and do not blend. The closer two tones are in frequency (within the range of on octave, or twice the freqeuncy), the less they harmonize. So two tones that are next to each other on an instrument normally don't sound good together. And two tones that are even closer - like the same note on two guitars that are not tuned to each other - sound horrible. It's like watching two sets of turn signals that are slightly off in frequency.</p>
<p>So, while musical sense does depend to a degree on training and repeated exposure to the scale through hearing melodies (tone sequences), much of it is instinctual and based on the physics of sound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wow, lots of very wrong explanations in here already. Short version: the vast majority of it is cultural and we simply get used to certain sounds. Traditional Asian music is tuned very differently from Western music and would sound out of tune to us in the West. That would mean different harmonies and melodies etc.</p>
<p>As for where these preferences originally come from on a super basic level, the theory is that it comes from the overtone series. When you hit a note on a piano string, you’re hearing the fundamental frequency plus a set of other “notes” that are also ringing subtly. The major scale is somewhat derived from the stronger overtones in that series, and sounds pleasant because it comes from this “natural” phenomenon. That’s the current theory anyway, nobody has really proven it and it’s unlikely there’s any way to do so. If you go back in music history, the first use of harmony was basically singing a 5th above the melody all the time (in Gregorian chant). The fifth is the first and strongest overtone in the series (after the octave, which isn’t considered a harmony). So that’s a bit of simple evidence for how harmony developed in the very early days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wish my friend who is a music cognition researcher would come weigh in (he's not into reddit though, so I'll try and add some value to the conversation).</p>
<p>First though: music is NOT universal. It is not a universal language, in any way shape or form. The Baby Einstein/classical music making your kid smarter is *not* a thing. This is a very eurocentric idea.</p>
<p>Rhythm, tone, pacing (beats per minute) - the 'basic mood' of the music may be conveyed across cultures because of the way that people speak. But the way the notes relate to each other and how phrases are resolved to invoke a specific mood or feeling are more learned.</p>
<p>Think of Stravinsky's 'Rite of Spring', at the time that it was introduced, it was cacophonous noise, the notes didn't relate to each other 'right', the phrases didn't resolve 'right'. It was 'new age bullshit noise' at the time. Now, though, most people on reddit hear that music and think of Dinosaurs and volcanoes and stuff (from Disney's Fantasia)- that's our context for the music. And even though it sounds different, we still hear it as music.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>...that's about all I've got. Correct me if I'm wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people here are saying it's completely or mostly cultural. I disagree. Yes, the nature of the sound and the familiarity with the different scale and note systems play a part, but the basis is physical - how do certain frequencies react to one another. You don't have to learn to know if two tones work together, you can hear it by the oscillations they create together, what kind of wave they are combined. Not to say that what is or isn't a pleasant or unpleasant oscillation is completely universal, but they still aren't 100% arbitrary. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
