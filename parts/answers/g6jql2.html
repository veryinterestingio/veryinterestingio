		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know coffee is meant to be hot (excluding cold brew) and you expect it to be hot, so being room temp means it is colder than you expect and your brain labels it &quot;cold&quot;. Water, by contrast, people generally prefer iced or at least chilled, so it being room temp makes it hotter than expected, and so it is labelled &quot;hot&quot;. This is because the brain is bad at judging number values of things like temperature, but is very good at comparing things to reference points. Another example is if you put one hand under hot water and the other under cold water, then put both in lukewarm water, the first hand thinks it is cold, while the second thinks it is hot. This time, your brain is comparing new info to old info, rather than new info to expected standards.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it doesn’t match with usual experience. </p>
<p>Water is experienced at many temperatures for consumption, washing, etc. Coffee is made hot and most often consumed at least warm. Anything colder than that is unusual and our brains are telling us that something isn’t right. </p>
<p>Though coffee is the same as water physically, other senses, especially smell, are being used by our brains to measure what is “usual”</p>
<p>That being said, “usual” isn’t the same across all people. Someone who often drinks iced coffee probably will react to a hot cup of coffee that has been allowed to get cold a lot differently than someone who normally drinks it hot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
