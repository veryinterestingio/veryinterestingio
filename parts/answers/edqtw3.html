		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light moving between different mediums (air, water, glass) gets a little bit bent; this is why drinking straws look bent when put into a glass. When the glass pane is smooth, the bend is minimal, since it only transitions twice (in and out). When it breaks, the glass becomes super rough, and air and glass get jumbled up. Now light is making that transition hundreds of times, so it gets all bent out of shape. All of the colors sort of blend together, giving a ‘white’ appearance. This is also why snow is white.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The path of the light changes. The same way light will stay in an unbroken strand of fiber optics.</p>
<p>Glass is the medium In which the light travels. When that is broken so is the road on which that light is traveling. </p>
<p>We could get all technical but this is the simplest way of saying it. Same thing will happen water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A simple glass object and air both tend to be uniform enough for light to pass through uniformly ('see-through')</p>
<p>You're right. The mediums are the same, so light still passes through. But the cracking through the glass is a irregularity in the transition between these mediums, hence an irregularity in the image you'd see if the form were perfectly regular (no crack)</p>
<p>It  might be hard to remember how differently light behaves around form changes in glass objects because we keep the edges of windows covered up.</p>
<p>Instead, examine the top, sides, etc of a plain drinking glass. These ends of the form may be fairly simple shapes, but aren't simple see-through the way the rest of the surface is (doing dishes would become extra difficult with nothing to see).</p>
<p>You might picture the cracks in a glass cube or window as many adjacent 'tops and bottoms and sides of drinking glasses'</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Glass and air have different indices of refraction. In optics, there is a well-known law called the Snell-Descartes law (or law of refraction) that dictates at which angle will a light ray be refracted when switching from two mediums with different indices of refraction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sin(a1) / sin(a2) = n2 / n1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the glass cracks, some rays of light are refracted several times in the crack, creating a white image in the crack (light refraction is the same phenomenon that causes prisms to decompose white light).</p>
<p>NB : if the glass is very thin (like the glass of a phone screen for instance), then the cracks won't be nearly as visible as when the glass is thick (like in a drinking glass, or a window).</p>
<p>TL;DR : light bounces around in the crack causing it to show as white instead of transparent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
