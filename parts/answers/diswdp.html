		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All modern day technology does is expedite the math involved in the design and construction of buildings. The math itself already existed - architects were versed in physics, mathematics and geometry so that they could properly measure all the distances/weights/amounts and ensure everything was both designed properly then placed properly during the actual construction.</p>
<p>It's why architectural planes and diagrams exist, as well as why architecture utilizes so many models. Once everything was properly diagrammed and modeled all you had to do was multiply measurements to scale and you got the exact coordinates and distances for <em>everything</em>. All we've done is switch the diagrams to digital, the models to 3d graphics and the math to calculators. A lot of older tools are still employed to make certain everything is level and properly placed. Outside of that, a lot of hard work is the answer.</p>
<p>This is the son-and-grandson-of-architect-but-not-architect explanation. An actual architect can probably explain it better.</p>
<p>EDIT: Well I did not expect this to blow up! I've learned a lot, thanks everyone for the discussion!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Victorian Era engineers often built things with huge safety margins. (Not sure how strong to build that support? Make a good guess and multiply that by ten.)  That's why the Tower Bridge is still cookin' along, not to mention that the Thames embankment sewer structures were only recently outgrown after 150 years of service.</p>
<p>Also, you can tour Europe and see examples of Cathedrals that, in their builders' desire to build taller and more elegant churches, exceeded the limits of material physics and had to be reinforced... or taken down, if they didn't outright collapse. Check out Beauvais Cathedral, for example. </p>
<p>FWIW, I'm not deliberately beating on the French here (yes, I am). I'm merely citing examples near to mind and one should not take this to mean English engineers are any better than their French counterparts (they are). </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also dont forget they often got it wrong - many buildings and cathedrals collapsed during construction and had to be rebuilt (e.g. Lincoln Cathedral in 1237) . There was a lot of trial and error and rules-of thumb.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
