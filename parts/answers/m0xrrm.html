<p>The way we sit normally?  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's actually the way we walk. Specifically, as humans evolved to walk upright, our pelvis and the muscles that make up the butt changed from our nearest ancestors. This change was necessary to facilitate our evolved form of locomotion, which isn't seen in any other mammal.  </p>
<p>Rather, our buttcheeks evolved to support our upright walking, which ultimately hide our anus compared to other mammals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have it backwards. The &quot;hidden butthole&quot; is a tolerated side-effect of something that <em>is</em> advantageous, not something with its own advantages.</p>
<p>We have large butt-cheeks because walking on two legs requires big gluteal muscles in that location. It makes using the restroom harder and less sanitary (animals usually don't need to wipe). But the tradeoff is worth it for the advantages of walking upright, so evolution had no &quot;reason&quot; to change it further.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
