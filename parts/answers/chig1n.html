		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The question is: who does the indicting? The President has plenary power over the executive branch. He would be the boss of anyone who would be tasked with indicting him for a crime. It wouldn't make any sense.</p>
<p>Who is the President <em>not</em> the boss of? Congress. That's why the clear course of action to control the head of the Executive branch is impeachment, not having a subservient member of the Executive prosecute his own boss.</p>
<p>(The President is not the boss of the Supreme Court either, but the Supreme Court does not have the power to set its own course of action; only Congress can do that)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is based on an opinion from the Office of Legal Council (OLC), which is that it would make it too difficult to do his job. They think this could be unconstitutional. You can read about it here if you want to wade through a 40 page pdf: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/olc/opinion/sitting-president%E2%80%99s-amenability-indictment-and-criminal-prosecution" target="_blank">https://www.justice.gov/olc/opinion/sitting-president%E2%80%99s-amenability-indictment-and-criminal-prosecution</a></p>
<p>It is just an opinion, although it is one written from some high-ranking lawyers. I don't really follow the logic of it, but I guess that's why I'm not a high-ranking lawyer. </p>
<p>Anyway, the OLC's job is to figure out legal stuff for the Justice Department. It would take an actual court case in front of the Supreme Court to tell us if they were right or not. But since the Justice Department would be running the prosecution, and they think they'd lose, they won't start such a case.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is an actual set rule, that's why Nixon resigned and then was pardoned by Ford for &quot;any crimes he may have committed&quot; during the time he held office.
Basically, it would be super difficult to ever actually charge someone who was recently president, because resignation and pardon from your vice president is really easy and completely legal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5: Because that would be like using an employee trying to put their boss in timeout. Its not likely to happen. It would be like asking the manager to fire the boss.</p>
<p>Its not a tradition, but a rule. That rule can be changed either by the employee or by the rule maker.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Not ELI5: A sitting President cannot be indicted because it conflicts with the Separation of Powers envisioned by the first three Articles of the Constitution. Separation of Powers says that there are three branches of government, each performing checks and balances on the other two branches. The President is the head of the executive branch of government and is granted the power to carry out--or &quot;execute&quot;--the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text" target="_blank">laws</a> passed by Congress.</p>
<p>To execute the laws, the executive branch relies on the expertise of departments and administrative agencies (e.g. &quot;Department of Defense&quot; or &quot;the Environmental Protection Agency&quot;). At the highest levels of the executive branch you have &quot;the Cabinet&quot; or department heads like the Attorney General who is the head of the Department of Justice and the Secretary of Defense who is the head of the Department of Defense. The AG and other department heads serve &quot;at the pleasure of the President,&quot; meaning the President may generally hire and fire them as he pleases, for whatever reason. More broadly, the collection of executive departments, offices, bureaus, and agencies are known as &quot;the administration&quot; (as in &quot;the Trump/Obama/Bush administration did X...&quot;). Congress has passed on <em>a little tiny bit</em> of their constitutional rule-making authority to these agencies because not all Congresspeople are experts in the subjects of every law they pass. &quot;Laws&quot; in the administration context are known as &quot;Rules&quot; or &quot;<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text" target="_blank">Regulations</a>&quot; or &quot;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/atr/horizontal-merger-guidelines-0" target="_blank">Guidelines</a>&quot;. So, the administration sits in between Congress and the President-- parts of the administration <strong>both make and execute laws</strong> (and in some cases also perform judicial functions too. Talk about power!).</p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation brings criminal charges against government officials, public organizations, and private individuals. In short, it is the prosecutor of <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18" target="_blank">federal criminal laws</a>. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is a bureau within of the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/agencies/chart" target="_blank">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ). Also within the DOJ, the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) used some of its congressionally delegated rule-making power to make some rules governing the internal operations of the DOJ in <em>very limited</em> circumstances--when considering whether the DOJ can criminally charge (i.e. &quot;indict&quot;) the President for wrongdoing. <a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/2000/10/31/op-olc-v024-p0222_0.pdf" target="_blank">These rules basically said</a>: &quot;we think the Constitution says we can't use our prosecution powers to indict our boss, Mr. President. That's neither wise nor permissible. Its not wise because he can fire the manager, Mr. AG. So Mr. AG won't charge the boss because he doesn't want to get fired. Its not permissible because <em>that would be using the criminal justice system as the vehicle or the method to remove the President</em> when the Constitution <strong><em>EXPLICITLY</em></strong> says the President can <strong><em>ONLY</em></strong> be removed by Congress through impeachment, not through the criminal justice system.&quot;</p>
<p>In essence, the OLC made a rule that it couldn't do something that Congress <em>may</em> have told it to do. It made this rule because it interpreted (judicial function!) such an act would be an improper exercise of its law enforcement power. It reached this conclusion be reasoning that what it would have to do--criminally charge the President--is ultimately Congress's job to do.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The very short story is that he is in a position to block a guilty verdict.  He can fire the prosecutor or pardon himself.  The justice department doesn't prusue charges where there is little or no chance of a guilty verdict.  This isn't a rule but more common sense to not waste resources that could be better used elsewhere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
