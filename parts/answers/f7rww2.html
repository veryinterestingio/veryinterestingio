		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add to the other answers here that your own poop is much less dangerous than other people's poop. I definitely don't recommend eating anyone's feces, but your own has bacteria that you already have in your gut, whereas ingesting (other people's) fecal bacteria is one of the most effective ways to get many diseases from them. That's how cholera and hepatitis A spread, for example. You can't give these diseases to yourself.</p>
<p>But still, like other people have said, your poop is made of stuff that your body wants to get rid of, so at best, eating it is making your body go through the same process again. At worst, it can poison you, because you're getting too much waste material in you at once.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not everything natural is safe. Not everything yours is fine for you.</p>
<p>Feces are waste, chemicals that your body expels because they are dangerous if they build up inside. If you eat feces, you are putting back old waste while you produce new waste.</p>
<p>It's like not throwing out the trash. At one point the house will be full of it and full of problems.</p>
<p>Also, bacteria from the intestine are specific from the intestine. In the mouth they can start infections</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are making the mistake of thinking that just because something is in our body, it should be safe. It isn't.</p>
<p>Our bodies contain all kinds of stuff thats deadly dangerous to us. We live because we have specialized location on our body where those things need to be stored. </p>
<p>Fecal matter is poisonous. Full of bacteria that can and will kill us but our intestines are specially designed to handle them and prevent them from spreading through our body and killing us. </p>
<p>Stomach acid is similar. It can burn your tissue, even burn holes in your tissue and cause significant internal damage, but our stomachs are equipped to contain the acid (most of the time) and prevent it from mixing with tissue that isn't protected against that acid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fuel in a car is fine in the tank as it is. But if it were combusted there like it was in the engine your car wouldnt come out looking as pretty. Same applies to your body. Your fuel is used elsewhere in your body and produces chemicals that are harmless at that part of your digestion system but would cause harm in earlier parts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
