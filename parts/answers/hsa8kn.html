		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>12 hour time is a <em>very</em> ancient system that traces back to the Mesopotamian empires.</p>
<p>They had a cultural fixation on the number 12, used a base-12 numerical system, and divided up most things into 12ths whenever possible - including day and night.</p>
<p>The 12 hours of day and 12 hours of night system spread throughout Europe and the Middle East and has defied multiple attempts to change it over the centuries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dividing the 24-hour clock into two periods came about because of sundials. For a couple thousand years, sundials were the main method of timekeeping, so you could only keep accurate time during half the day. The changeover happened at noon (at the sun's highest point) because it's an observable, universal frame of reference.</p>
<p>Mechanical clocks kept the division because it's simpler to make a 12-hour clock than a 24-hour one. Obviously the system is obsolete in the age of electronic timekeeping, but it's still a well-established system that most people are familiar with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Clocks, for about 600 years, were principally mechanical and had what amounts to an analog display: a circular dial.</p>
<p>Making clocks which cycled through in twelve hours was easier, the twelve-hour dial was easier to read, and everyone <em>knew</em> whether it was morning or night so there was really no difficulty with them.</p>
<p>There were, from time to time, other sorts of clocks built: some which had 24-hour dials, some of which showed weekdays, some of which ran counterclockwise.  But most clocks worked the same way.</p>
<p>Now that it is cheaper - at least in the sorts of quantities we produce - to make electronic clocks with character-based displays, the twelve-hour format may well die out.</p>
<p>Give it another hundred years.  We'll see.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
