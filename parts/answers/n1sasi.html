		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Containers filled with oxygen are generally not transported on board aircrafts as they are considered combustible and may pose a risk to the planes. Oxygen behaves differently to nitrogen and other inert gases. It is very reactive. Even a small increase in the oxygen level in the air to 24% can create a dangerous situation. It becomes easier to start a fire, which will then burn hotter and more fiercely than in normal air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Compressed oxygen is actually really dangerous as others have mentioned. I'm a nurse and get incredibly frustrated when I find O2 cannisters free standing...they need to be in proper storage racks. God forbid there comes a time one tips and hits the floor the wrong way, we'd be toast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Liquid oxygen is actually quite heavy and airplanes is not able to carry as much weight as trains and boats. Not only is the oxygen quite heavy but it requires thick tanks and cooling equipment in order to transport it which is also quite heavy. And of course if something were to go wrong and the liquid oxygen were to spill out there are few ways of preventing the airplane from crashing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
