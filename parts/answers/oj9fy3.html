		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Only your literal brain itself doesn't have pain receptors. The scalp and muscles outseide the skull do, the meninges (layers of support tissue around the brain) do.</p>
<p>Your brain shrinking slightly from dehydration and therefore pulling away from the inside of your skull can cause pain.</p>
<p>You brain swelling from an impact/injury/infection/tumor and pressing against that same lining tissue can also cause pain.</p>
<p>Neck tension carried into scalp muscles can cause headaches too.</p>
<p>Etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pain is a sense to tell us something is wrong, what is wrong, how to do something about it and a really strong motivation to do something about it.</p>
<p>Headaches are localised on the brain so you know something is wrong with your brain. There are many receptors around the inside of the skull which say that, but we perceive it as the brain hurting because thatâ€™s the part of your body it wants to say is wrong.</p>
<p>You can get pain from amputated limbs because your brain is just stuck on the fact something is wrong, even though there are no nerves.</p>
<p>Emotional pain has a physical sensation because something is wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
