		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a geologist, yes coastlines are being eroded by the sea, in a normal rate of sea level rise, total land mass will not really decrease since the eroded sediments will be deposited to another part along the coast (see Longshore current) so along the coast there are sites of erosion and sites of deposition.
Our problem today is the high rate of sea level rise, which can be affected by many factors, melting of ice included. Another reason for decreasing land masses is too much groundwater extraction that causes highly populated areas near the coast to sink.  </p>
<p>Another thing:</p>
<p>Structures built perpendicular to the  coast also prevent deposition of sediments, that is why one area is being eroded but the sediment is not being replenish because it is blocked by these structures</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The situation is dynamic. Because the earth still has a large molten mantle, the continental plates are also moving. In some places, they push against each other and one plate rises while another is pushed under it. This causes things like mountain ranges and the land generally to rise. There is also volcanic activity in the ocean that creates more land (new islands). </p>
<p>Of course, in the long, long time frame, the earth eventually cools and maybe this activity ceases. But at some point, the sun is also going to become a lot larger and start to boil off the oceans (and consume the earth eventually). So what happens to &quot;land&quot; at that point is probably not very relevant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some parts of coastlines are being eroded away by the sea, yes, but usually the material that gets eroded away at one place is re-deposited somewhere else along the coast, so the overall amount of land area doesn't change much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
