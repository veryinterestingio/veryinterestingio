		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hormones. </p>
<p>Growth Hormone is released in cycles, you get bursts of it during sleep, so kids growing up overnight is actually kind of true. </p>
<p>Growth hormone secretion is also increased by a number of other factors, most notably from testosterone and estrogen, which are increased during puberty. Other causes of increased growth hormone would be eating (insulin and glucagon both increase growth hormone), and exercise.</p>
<p>But like someone else already said: these things are occurring pretty consistently (that growth hormone increase is occurring every night), so the 'bursts' we see are probably just our own perception when we see that someone's grown an inch and we hadn't realized it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Few of these answers address the &quot;why&quot; component, so I'll give this a shot. Biological anthropologists have debated this for quite a long time and it's an interesting concept because very few other animals have similar periods of slow growth followed by &quot;growth spurts&quot;.</p>
<p>You're right that growth is punctuated in humans. Humans undergo rapid growth until around the age of 4, then much slower growth until around the age of 12 when humans undergo a period of rapid growth for a few years before growth gradually slows to a stop (usually around age 20). The best explanation for this has to do with brain development. Kids have big heads, and your brain is basically done growing (about 90% done) by the time overall growth slows around age 5. Brain growth isn't everything, though. It's just a lump of meat until you train it. The period of slow growth is hypothesized to give you a long window to learn things without needing the same amount of resources as an adult. In groups where this occurs, you'd have smaller, immature kids running around who are easier to feed until they're smart enough to be sort of useful at which point they grow into full-sized adults.</p>
<p>The ELI5 version is, kids are stupid and it's easier to teach them stuff when they're small. Keeping them small a little longer is advantageous in the long run.</p>
<p>Edited to add: the ages I've cited are approximate. They vary by sex, nutritional status, stochastic variation, and a bunch of other factors. Your mileage may vary, but the overall pattern of an adolescent growth spurt is a human universal which occurs in all populations. It seems to be hardwired in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not well understood.  In short, it's likely that you evolved in such a way as to accumulate resources (fat/minerals/vitamins) during slow-growth periods that are then consumed to fuel fast-growth periods. If you grew too fast all the time, you wouldn't naturally have enough food to sustain the growth and you might waste energy resources producing growth hormones at a time when your body simply doesn't have the resources to do anything about it. Sustained food availability is something the human species didn't have until maybe 100 years ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see you phrased your question as a why, not a how. Very well done, though it's much trickier to answer. </p>
<p>Growing in spurts is not unique to humans. It's actually how almost all organisms grow during development, so this question is much broader than human biology. Why should any organism grow in spurts vs continuously? The answer is related to 1 food uncertainty, and 2 the benefits of regulation.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If food comes in discontinuous spurts, it is best to concentrate growth (resource intensive) during the times food is most abundant/secure. This is why plants with seasonal access to light only grow in that season, and why tropical plants grow nearly continuously (though still a difference between night and day growth rate).</p>
</li>
<li>Regulation of growth is good in general because it is one of the most complex things an organism can do. Growth has the highest potential for things to go wrong, grow out of control, or grow incompletely. Any one of your 35 trillion cells could start growing uncontrollably if just the right failure in regulation occurs. It then follows that you would want to limit growth only to the places and times it must occur to prevent cancers or other failures that become more likely when every cell in the body is allowed to grow continuously.</li>
