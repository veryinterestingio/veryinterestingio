		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We didn't evolve in forests full of trees to climb.  We evolved in grasslands to walk across.  As such we are the most dominant species on the planet in persistence hunting.  There is now one species of sled dog that is superior to us in endurance, but we specifically breed it to be that way.  </p>
<p>Two legs saves a ton of energy to move.  A mix of slow and fast twitch muscle fibers makes us able to hike all day and yet still have enough explosive speed to kill effectively.  We were the zombie horde of our evolutionary era: relatively slow and weak, but never stopping.  In fact, there are still tribes in Africa today that hunt using the exact same method</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Primarily because of the way we move. Primary locomotion of the other apes you listed is via their arms. Hominids evolved to have better movement in their legs and an upright posture and walking gait. It's likely our legs are comparatively as strong when compared to those apes as their arms are compared to ours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We use more energy to keep our minds going than any other animal. The human brain is about 2% of weight but uses over 20% of our daily calories. During the formative years 5-6 the brain can use 60% of your daily calories. Some chess masters have reportedly burned 6,000 calories and never move from their chair, The evolution of the human brain has robbed us of most of the physical attributes common in primates.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We also lack the ability to flex our entire muscles at once, chimps can still do this. Our bones and ligaments arenâ€™t strong enough to withstand the force of our own muscle mass firing at 100%.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
