		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In nature Uranium is 99.3% the 238 isotope that has a half life of 4.5 <em>billion</em> years and is incapable of sustaining nuclear fission.  It's less radioactive than dirt on its own.</p>
<p>Nuclear reactor fuel and nuclear weapon cores need to be heavily enriched to get at that other 0.7%.</p>
<p>Similarly, Thorium is 99.98% 232 isotope with a half life of <em>fourteen billion years</em>.  It will undergo fission (fizz?) if provoked in a fast-breeder reactor but will not do so by itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes!</p>
<p>There are beaches around the world where the sand contains significant portions of radioactive minerals. In Brazil, there's hundreds of miles of beaches containing monazite, a thorium ore. One beach, Guarapari, has radiation levels of 175mSv per year - compare that to the safe limit for nuclear workers of 20mSV per year.</p>
<p>In Ramsar, Iran, local limestone is radioactive, yet has been used as a building material. Some areas have levels of radiation as high as 250mSV per year.  Similar conditions exist in Yangjiang, China, where monazite is incorporated into the sand and clay used in their buildings.</p>
<p>There are even radioactive hot springs, such as those found in Paralana hot springs, Australia. Bathing in radon springs used to be thought to have health benefits, until we found out how damaging radiation actually is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The source for most &quot;natural&quot; radiation exposure on Earth are places with high concentration of uranium ores. It's not the uranium itself that is very radioactive — it has a very long half-life — but over the billion or so years that it's been sitting around the planet it has been decaying. The result is that a place that has had uranium in it for a billion years has a billion years' worth of uranium <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decay_chain#/media/File:Decay_chain(4n+2,_Uranium_series\).svg" target="_blank">&quot;daughter products&quot;</a> in it as well. Some of those are much more radioactive than uranium itself. Most troublesome from a human perspective are the radon daughters — all of those little short-lived things at the end of the linked image. If radon is allowed to concentrate to any great approximation then it is basically a fairly-radioactive gas. If you inhale this, it increases your lung cancer risk. </p>
<p>This is why uranium mines must be very well-ventilated if they are going to be safe to work in, as well as factories that deal with uranium ore, and why radon gas is a hazard in some basement dwellings: small amounts of uranium are present in many soils and rocks, and that means small amounts of radon gas is being released by said soil as well. Normally the dose you'd receive from this is negligible, but if your basement has very poor ventilation and is in a place where there is more radon than usual, it can reach levels that are associated with increased cancer risk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What most people don’t understand about radioactivity is that there’s an inverse relationship between activity and halflife. So precisely because Uranium 235 has a long halflife of around 700 million years, it’s activity is quite low. Fresh, unused nuclear fuel is quite safe to handle. Uranium is a toxic heavy metal though.</p>
<p>Also, it’s not Uranium’s radioactivity per se that produces energy, but it’s ability to fission and sustain a chain reaction, where the fission of a nucleus goes to induce fission in other nearby Uranium nuclei.</p>
<p>By contrast, used nuclear fuel will have lots of different fission products, for example Iodine-131, which has a half live of about 8 days and is consequently much more dangerous in the short term than Uranium.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
