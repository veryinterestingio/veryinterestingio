		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>In several conferences and journals - obviously I can only address those that I have participate<del>s</del>d in - a framework for peer review is almost non-existent: there is a loose process, undefined review objectives, total lack of transparency to and from all participants, etc. which leads to an inability to identify any contribution from the peer review process, and a worrying lack of accountability.</p>
<p>Is there a formalisation (or more?) of the peer review process, not only on paper but in terms of tooling, that can be used to quantify and make visible the contribution of the process itself, and what kind of adoption can we expect to see, realistically? If not, do you think that absence is a good thing?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have two questions:</p>
<p>1) Do you think open review processes (i.e. journals where the reviews and response to reviews are published along-side the article) increase the trustworthiness of the review process?</p>
<p>2) Is there any indication that level of anonymity during/after review (i.e. double blind vs anonymous reviewers vs all names revealed throughout the process) influences the perception of trustworthiness?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This paper from January that identified HIV inserts in 2019-nCoV (SARS-COV-2) was withdrawn due to peer review process or political pressure? If it was withdrawn as a result of peer review why did the scientists not rectify the problems in their methodology and repeat the analysis and publish a new version of the paper? Is that not what is suppose to happen during peer review?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
