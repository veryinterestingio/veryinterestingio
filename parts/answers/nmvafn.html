		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ol>
<li>If we are living in a false or meta-stable vacuum, is it possible for humans to actually trigger the event of changing the higgs field to a more stable vacuum?</li>
<li>The universe is accelerating right now, is there any possibility that this change at some point? Or lets say, could those galaxies find a stable spot like our solar system?</li>
<li>Isn't it a law of physics that no energy is lost, how could the end look like everything is to decay into nothingness? Where is the energy gone?</li>
<li>Is it possible that complete nothingness to be instable? (and trigger another big bang?)</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is it possible our universe is stuck in an infinite loop of expansion, decay, expansion, decay etc?</p>
<p>That is following the &quot;end&quot; of the Universe, there would be another &quot;Big Bang&quot; and all the permutations of chemical interactions play out again and again, perhaps resulting in different universes each time or resulting in the exact same universe being created</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ul>
<li>
<p>What theory in physics do you consider the most mind-blowing?  (Can either be experimentally verified or highly speculative, because those can be fun too) </p>
</li>
<li>I'm a high school teacher, so any advice for current science students?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Katie, thanks for joining us today! I'm writing this for my grandfather, whom I gave a copy of your book a few months back. He says and asks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'd like her to know that I read <em>The End of Everything (Astrophysically Speaking)</em> and found it to be tremendously interesting, informative, and surprisingly entertaining. Is she working on another book? What major research is she working on?</p>
