		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it is reflected back to the laser as well. The description says that &quot;50% of the intensity of each reflected beam is transmitted/reflected towards the screen for observation&quot;, so the other half would be transmitted back towards the laser. It's just not shown in the figure, since it's not the thing that you want to observe.</p>
<p>Apparently it's a bit more subtle than this though.
In <a href="http://pmaweb.caltech.edu/~phy003/labs/interferometryhandout5hqM1.pdf" target="_blank">this description</a>, they note that &quot;the beams recombine back at the beam splitter, so some of the light is directed toward the detector while some is reflected back toward the source&quot;, but then they say that by adjusting the distances carefully, you can set up constructive/destructive interference, so that all the light ends up on the screen. I guess that's where the interference pattern comes from? Like, there would be one set of bands on the screen, and if you look at the area near the laser that should be a complementary set of bands which add up to the original light intensity?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you have two otherwise identical beams incident on a beamsplitter, the intensity at the two output ports depends on the relative phase of the incident beams. This is the key idea of &quot;light being a wave&quot; - you might be familiar with the double-slit where light overlaps in free space resulting in interference. A beamsplitter here is simply a method to get very good overlap between beams, which makes these interference patterns more obvious.</p>
<p>You can think of the Michelson interferometer in two parts. First, one beam is incident on the BS, along with vacuum on the second input port. The result is a splitting of the incident laser beam as you would normally think, with intensity going into both output ports - importantly, with a fixed relative phase (pi) at both ports. </p>
<p>Second, the split beams are reflected back into the BS. If they have traveled the same path length, their phase will still be fixed at a pi offset, which will result in perfect constructive interference at one of the ports (laser or screen). If the path length between the two arms is different such that you get an additional phase shift of pi, then there will be destructive interference at the original (and constructive at the other port). Changing the path length gives you interference fringes between the two ports.</p>
<p>Light can go back into the laser depending on the relative phase.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A beam splitter has the beam splitter one one side of a glass block in this set-up. Light going from left to right or bottom to top in the diagram must first pass through the glass before hitting the beam splitting. Since the glass, air interface is at an angle to the beam, the beam refracts according to Snell's law. Light coming from right to left or top to bottom hits the beam splitter first and can thus reflect without first traveling through the glass and refracting. However, the part of the beam that transmits through the beam splitter will still refract as it passes into and out of the glass. This bem is not shown, as it end up back at the laser (see below). There are other beam splitters which are a cube with the splitter part set at a 45 angle crossing the cube so that the beam enters the glass  perpendicular to the plane of area so it won't refract.</p>
<p>Light does reflect back to the laser. The diagram  just isn't showing the beams that recombine and go back to the laser after reflecting off the mirrors. Let's say the beamsplitter is a 50/50 and the mirrors are 100% reflective. The laser emits some power of light, which we set to 100. When that initial beam hits the beam splitter, 50 of it is reflected to mirror 1 and 50 of it is refracted to mirror 2. Let's call these beam A and B, respectively.</p>
<p>Beam A bounces off of mirror 1 and returns to the beamsplitter. At the beam splitter 1/2 of beam A is transmitted through to the detector and the other 1/2 reflects back to the laser, thus there is 25 of the original beam going to the detector and 25 going back to the laser. </p>
<p>Beam B bounces off mirror 2 and returns to the beam splitter, where 1/2 of beam B is transmitted through to the the laser and 1/2 of beam B is reflected to the detector, thus there is 25 of the original beam going to the detector and 25 going back to the laser. </p>
<p>So 1/2 of the original beam (25 from beam A and 25 from beam B) combine at the detector, and 1/2 of the original beam combine at the laser. The numbers aren't actually correct, because some light refects at each surface of the beam splitter and the mirros also absorb some of the light, but the principle applies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the original Michelson experiment the beam splitter was described as a &quot;partially silvered mirror&quot;. Basically some of the light got reflected to the 90 degree turn whereas other photons/light passed through the mirror because the reflective coating wasn't 100% effective/applied</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
