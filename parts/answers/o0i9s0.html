<p>At <del>0 C</del> let's make that 1 C the required pressure to solidify is ~630 MPa. In Earth's gravity, each 10 metres of depth increases the pressure by 1 atmosphere, ~0.1 MPa.</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>about 63 kilometres</strong>. And it'd be <strong>Ice VI</strong>, a tetragonal crystal structure with a density ~1300 kg/m^3.</p>
<p>This however neglects change in density with depth. It's also quite sensitive to temperature, just 10 or 20 degrees C could halve or double the required pressure to solidify.</p>
<p>On Europa the pressures will be lower than that due to the lower gravity. From the water phase diagram we can see there's a fairly narrow temperature range, from about 252 to 270 Kelvin, where increasing pressure goes ice-water-ice, therefore allowing a subsurface ocean with ice both above and below. But impurities in the water could significantly alter such ranges.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You've got a bunch of technical answers about depth and feasibility, but I figured you might also find this article interested, it talks about pockets of solid water existing as stable hydrous minerals and exotic ices deep in the crust of the earth. As well as having some interesting details on the depth of the crust beneath the mariana trench that might be interesting to some trying to figure out if a water column this deep could feasibly exist on earth.</p>

<p>Apparently we've also discovered diamonds with pockets of exotic high pressure ices trapped within</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water would have to be about 100km deep (~63 miles) to create a pressure of about 1 gigapascal at which point liquid water changes to ice VI (ice 6). Saltwater changes these depths and pressures a bit, but overall pretty similar. This assumes the water has constant density (not 100% true) and is approximately 0C. But should be reasonably close.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are asking in practical terms, on Earth... this does not happen. Water when normally frozen has a lower density than liquid, and in high pressure situation therefore, you can actually cool water down slightly by increasing pressure. Liquid water is at its most dense around 4˚C, so actually the ocean pressure causes water below a certain depth to normalize to that temperature.</p>
