		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cloud is called a pyrocumulus and it is not specific to nuclear blasts - large forest fires and volcanos can cause it too - with a slightly different shape. It is very similar to the classical storm cloud - the cumulonimbus. Hot air rises and expands. Expansion cools it down. Eventually it reaches an equilibrium level and starts expanding horizontally until it starts falling down (oversimplification).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The initial cloud IS ball shaped - if you watch high-speed film of the initial milliseconds of nuclear explosions, you can see that. The ball-shaped cloud is much hotter than the air around it, and (because it's an explosion) it expands rapidly. That makes the cloud much lighter than the air around it, and it begins rising, like a hot air balloon would, but much faster, since it's much hotter and therefore much lighter.</p>
<p>The &quot;stem&quot; of the mushroom can be thought of as like a column of smoke rising from the detonation site. I say &quot;like&quot; smoke, because, while there's probably some smoke in that column, it's actually hot, turbulent, dusty air, heated by the energy that the ground absorbed.</p>
<p>Mushroom clouds are associated with detonations on or near the ground; detonations at higher altitudes generally don't have the iconic mushroom cloud.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
