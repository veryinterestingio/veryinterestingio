		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are not hiding the license plate itself as that is pretty much already in the public. What you are hiding is the link between the license plate and the rest of the information about that picture. A picture usually contains a lot of information such as when and where it was taken as well as lots of contextual information. By publishing that image not only are you linking that license plate to that information but you are spreading it around for the entire world to see. And some people might object to this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To avoid being caught up in any open source intelligence.  It’s a way of tracking and identifying.</p>
<p>So I’m selling a car on kijiji / Craigslist / fb marketplace etc.  I post a pic and now my contact phone number, postal code (zip if your American), my plate and car are all now publicly open and linked.</p>
<p>Driving around is just a car and plate but not anything else (not residence nor phone number).  That info is only available to police if they run my plate.</p>
<p>Some awesome stuff happens on r/osint ; it’s amazing to learn what we’ve lost in privacy and how easy it can be to link people to pictures.  Never take your privacy for granted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some good answers hear, I will also add this although it may be specific to the UK: </p>
<p>If you steal a car, you can put fake number plates on it to avoid detection. The best way to do this is to copy the number plates of a car with the same make, model, year and colour. </p>
<p>People will even steal a car and swap the plates over with another car. This leads to innocent people driving around the car they own with stolen plates on it and being pulled over for driving a stolen car.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because of pranksters online will see their license plate and anonymously call the police and be like hey I saw  license plate fjk-342 run a school bus full of disabled children off the road earlier and I wanted to report it. </p>
<p>Sure this same thing could be done out on the road but there's hundreds of more license plates for someone to see so the chances of someone turning in your license plate would be so much slimmer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
