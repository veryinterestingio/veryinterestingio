		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OK, there are some iffy answers already.  I work in the headphone business, here is the real story. </p>
<p>Active noise cancellation uses microphones to listen to incoming noise, then uses the speaker in the headphone (same one that plays your music) to play the same thing, but inverted.  This means that if you were looking at a graph of the sound wave, the heapdhone would be playing the same sound wave, but flipped upside down.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, it works because when you mix the two sound waves, -1 + 1 = 0, so the noise is cancelled out.  This isn't done via some trickery that fools your ear, the sound is really cancelled out. So there is some actual protection from loud noise. </p>
<p>This can be done to a limited extent on speakers, but the answer on that is basically no.  The reason is that you can only cancel sound when the two sound waves overlap perfectly.  To the extent the overlap isn't perfect, the noise isn't cancelled. </p>
<p>In a headphone, you can make the two waves overlap pretty well, because you're only concerned about a very small space inside the headphone.  The microphone hears a sound, and you can predict really well what it's going to look like 3cm away next to your ear. </p>
<p>With speakers, you're sitting like... 3m away from the speaker, and the speakers may be a few meters apart.  Also, unwanted noise can be coming from any direction.  If you don't know where the listener is, and you don't know where the noise is coming from, active cancellation in this fashion is basically impossible. </p>
<p>It could maybe be done with an array of microphones, an array of speakers, and some kind of position tracking for the listener, but it's wayyyy harder than it is with headphones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The music isn’t being cancelled just the static of outside noise.   </p>
<p>However, they may help you to keep the volume of the music lower than you usually would have, which could help.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and no.
The thing that harms your ears is the 'amplitude' or energy of the sound wave. If your headset is cancelling properly, then the sound waves will be reduced in amplitude. See <a href="https://gadgetsmalta.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Untitled-4-e1538122098423.png" target="_blank">this</a>. If it's reduced in energy, then it's less damaging to your eardrums. </p>
<p>Next, the principle of sound cancellation relies on being able to 'overlay' sound waves. If you wanted a whole room to do that, you'd need some way to overlay a sound wave that looks like it's a horizontal plane (noise) with another wave that is being emitted from a source (anti noise). In other words, you can't overlay these. However, in headphones, the noise is coming from one direction (the side that isn't your head) to your ear and the anti noise can also be only broadcast in one direction (into your head) so that these are in the same physical direction to be overlayed. </p>
<p>If you can solve this physical problem, you could earn a lot of money noise cancelling whole rooms!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You say “damage wrought by audio hardware”</p>
<p>I’m not sure what you mean by that. It’s just the volume of the sound that causes hearing damage; doesn’t matter if it’s from audio hardware, or a gunshot.  </p>
<p>In principle, they would protect hearing by allowing you to enjoy music at a lower volume.  </p>
<p>Also in principle, active noise canceling would reduce the damage caused by a loud external sound.  </p>
<p>As for the second question: yes there are noise cancelling speakers for rooms and cars.  Just google noise cancelling speakers</p>
<p>However, noise cancelling works best in earphones because it works by making a cancelling sound that is “out of phase” with the sound arriving right at your ear.   In a room, the noise is bouncing all around in different ways depending on where you are, so it’s harder to generate a cancelling signal that works equally well (if at all) everywhere in the room.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
