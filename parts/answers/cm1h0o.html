		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cancer is a failure in growth regulation that results from mutations.  The way tumors develop is these damaged cells divide and make daughter cells that are likewise damaged.</p>
<p>Cells that divide a lot are more prone to cancer (like skin cells)</p>
<p>Heart muscles don’t divide much so they don’t copy their dna mistakes and make damaged daughter cells.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Along with what everyone is saying about how heart cells divide slow, their microenvironment (stroma) is also not conducive to cancer. Brain cells also divide slow, but the supporting cells are where we see most brain cancers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One theory that I haven't seen mentioned is that cancer cells are largely anaerobic, but heart cells don't &quot;want&quot; to function anaerobically because lactic acid in the heart is worst case scenario.  Possibly this has something to do with heart cancer being so rare along with other reasons given here as responses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cancer is the corruption in cell production, the more production there is the higher the chances of some cells being malformed. </p>
<p>The heart is one of those places in the human body that aren't constantly going through cell replacement or growth as for example skin cells which suffer a lot of damage from the environment leading to constant healing. </p>
<p>It's like flying, if you've never flown the chances of you ever being in a airplane crash are null but if you fly every day the chances go up significantly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
