		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, living conditions would be a bigger factor than genetics as how tall people get within the specified time period (50 years). It is said that North Koreans are, on average, three inches shorter than South Koreans due to poor living conditions in the North.</p>
<p>Things like better nutrition, better healthcare and lack of corporeal punishment on women and children with sticks thinner than your thumb all lead to taller people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
