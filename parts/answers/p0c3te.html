They can however rest at the surface for extended periods of time in order to continue breathing. It is thought that they shut down half of their brain at a time to let that half rest while the other half keeps them at or near the surface and breathing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Whale brains have two hemispheres like humans, but they’re less connected than the human brain. When they sleep, one hemisphere shuts down like normal sleep, but the other remains somewhat active. The active hemisphere keeps track of regular survival functions like surfacing for breath, eyesight for danger, etc. They’re still not fully alert, which is why they can still be hit and killed by ships in their sleep. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of &quot;half right&quot; answers here.  Yes, the half-brain explanation is an important component but it's important to remember that whales and dolphins have a different relationship and time scale with water than we do.</p>
<ol>
<li>The way humans sleep isn't totally natural.  (Fall out for 8 hours).  Most animals sleep shorter periods of time, more often.  Whales often sleep o only 30 minutes or an hour at a time.</li>
<li>Whales can &quot;hold their breath&quot; for huge stretches of time without distress.  Oxygen isn't stored in the lungs.  It's stored in the blood stream and the muscle fibers.  A whales entire body is designed to warehouse massive amounts o oxygen. Whales have a LOT of blood-like 5x more than humans by bodyweight volume. They camel up massive amount of oxygen in their blood stream and muscles  and so their sense of &quot;holding their breath&quot; is very different from that of a human.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some whales regularly stay down for hours and not drowning is like asking why the average person doesn't suffocate in the time period between breaths.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
