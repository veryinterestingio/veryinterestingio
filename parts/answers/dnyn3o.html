		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Explained in very simple terms: Look at the Afar region of East Africa as a modern day example. It is a very, very slow process that takes millions and millions of years. There is no ‘crack’ as you might visualize it - it’s more of a slow spreading apart, like taffy getting pulled. Eventually it gets so thin that lava begins to erupt and, because it sits so low, will get filled with water. So no, there is no big crack that separates the plates, and the separation itself was not violent (geologically, at least) or rapid at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The process that broke up Pangea is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rift" target="_blank">continental rifting</a>. A good modern analogue is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_African_Rift" target="_blank">East African Rift</a>. The EAR initiated ~30 million years ago and still hasn't reached the point of transforming to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-ocean_ridge" target="_blank">mid-ocean ridge</a>. Some rifts transition quicker, e.g. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_California" target="_blank">Gulf of California</a> went form a rift basin to a spreading center in ~6 million years. Generally speaking, the rate of extension within rifts will be a few mm/year to a few cm/year max, so the break up of Pangea was not some sort of catastrophic event. Some of the most catastrophic part of rifting is the in the earliest stages. Some (but not all) rifts initiate with an eruption of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_basalt" target="_blank">flood basalts</a>, an event for which we have no modern analogue. Depending on the exact geometry of the rift that develops, eventually the floor of the rift will lower enough that it can be flooded by neighboring oceans and this could be somewhat catastrophic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
