		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Besides a general “taste,” flavours also have an “intensity.” I would imagine two medium but different flavours (salty peanut butter and sweet jelly) go well together, or even one intense and one light flavour. But two really intense flavours with different tastes would clash and cause the brain to perceive an unpleasant sensation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's more of a matter of balancing and complimenting flavors. Salt goes so well with sweets like caramel and chocolate because there are taste receptors in your mouth that essentially unlock when there's salt involved and they allow you to notice more flavors in the combination. However, if there's too much salt it can become overpowering because there's way too much of that flavor to where it's not longer complimenting the sweet. But when you mix something like m&amp;m's and spaghetti there's too many different flavors that don't really compliment each other. So even though your taste receptors are opening up from the saltiness of the spaghetti, the amount of different flavors like the spices in the spaghetti can conflict and make you taste weird things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
