		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the coffee ring effect. The water at the edges evaporates quicker (as the drop is fattest in the middle, so a surface area thing). Water, carrying the coffee suspension with it, then travels to the edges where the volume decreased. Now you have even more coffee suspension on the edges (because that doesn't evaporate with the water). When the drop fully evaporates, edges look darker because more coffee suspension is in the periphery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marangoni_effect" target="_blank">Marangoni Flow</a> is what you’re looking for!</p>
<p>The Coffee Ring Effect and Red Wine effect are subsets of this effect.</p>
<p>Essentially faster evaporation at the edge causes a surface tension difference which causes flow along the surface which carries the suspended particles with it (because they tend to be at the air/water surface as it minimises the free energy of the system).</p>
<p>The bit that some people find confusing is that the water evaporating form the edge of the ring is replaced by other surface liquid, rather than interior liquid being “exposed”. This is is what causes the edge of the evaporation ring to be generally pinned in one place too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm guessing it's the surface tension of the water making it slightly convex (not perfectly flat) which makes the lightest particles floating on top fall to the edge. As the puddle dries and gets smaller, there are fewer and fewer particles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is the bubble evaporation process. This has to do with the surface it fell on. If the surface (floor) has similar distributed properties (like all wood or paper) then the surface is more “homogenous” which makes the evaporation process differ. </p>
<p>In this process, the heat moves up and around the bubble, following the surface of the liquid and ending at the point where the air, bubble and surface connect (triple contact line TCL). This creates the ring.
Otherwise, if the surface is heterogenous, like most tiles, you won’t get the same ring effect. In this process, the heat moves up from the floor, around the bubble and back to the starting point. This distributed the coffee evenly across the surface that is in contact with the fluid. </p>
<p>Look up nanodroplet evaporation and inkjet printing for some info.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
