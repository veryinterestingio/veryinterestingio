		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different kinds of plants or meats will decompose pretty similarly, and what you're smelling is the beginning of that process. So even though everyone's is a little different the end result is not so varied. But you definitely have variations in how household garbage smells, too; e.g. diapers are certainly distinct.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The stink is the result of decomposition by bacteria, fungi, etc and they produce the same end products. Compare it to how you eat a lot of stuff for energy but you converted is with oxygen to primary carbon dioxide and water.</p>
<p>A common  smelly product of decomposing stuff is hydrogen sulfide that you think of as rotten eggs</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So Um just to piggyback rather than make a whole new thread, if you’re smelling something nasty does that mean particles of that nasty stuff go into your nose and into your tastebuds? </p>
<p>If you smell poo in a public toilet does that mean you’re actually tasting poo particles. </p>
<p>Also does holding your breath stop this process</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
