		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the building material, but in general once water starts getting in a building will start to deteriorate fairly rapidly.</p>
<p>Social factors accelerate this - people break windows of abandoned houses (either just for vandalism or to break in and see if anything is worth stealing), letting the elements in, and things go downhill from there.</p>
<p>In a slightly more immediate sense - unconditioned spaces left alone (say 1 year timeframe) are very susceptible to mold getting a foothold, which can require fairly extensive remedial work before they’re safe for human habitation again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A house will remain in good condition if they are kept dry. When you let moisture in fungus and mold start to grow, wood rot. Water that gets in among stones will expand when it gets free and can crack them.  </p>
<p>So one option is a lot of ventilation like often is the case in a barn. Another is like the house we live in has a lot less ventilation but is kept dry by heating etc.</p>
<p>The well-ventilated building will just need the roof to remain intact and as long as the lowe par do not start to rot they can remain intact for a very long time.</p>
<p>A building with worse ventilation is more efficient when you like to keep it warm or cool. Some moisture will get in some way and then you start to get stuff that grows. When it results in leakage from the roof the building will deteriorate quite quickly.</p>
<p>Another part is simple maintains where wee repair broke part of the roof, cracked windows, cleaning the gutters, etc so small damage that is simple to fix could have an enormous effect in the long run. You pain and/or clean the outside, replace the part that gets damages </p>
<p>Another is that other humans have an effect abandoned property in simple way like leaving the door open to let in moist air and water in or by breaking a window or worse. So a simple thing like that can have a huge effect in a relatively short time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because when people live in a house, they usually notice problems like leaks, or animals getting in, and usually fix them. They also do maintenance that can prevent those problems from happening in the first place, such as cleaning roofs and gutters, repainting when paint peels, and so on.</p>
<p>If someone just lived in a house but did absolutely none of those things, the house would deteriorate almost as rapidly as an abandoned house.</p>
<p>I say <em>almost</em> because just by keeping windows and doors closed most of the time (which even the most careless person would probably do), you’ll prevent things like animals and extra moisture getting in, which will slow down deterioration somewhat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have given good ELI5’s, but if you’re interested in a bit more reading, there was a book about 12, maybe 13 years ago called The World Without Us. It had a nice style of writing and looked at how different aspects of human culture would breakdown quite quickly, and others would last for ages (things like Bronze, plastic and huge structures like Giza and Mt Rushmore).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
