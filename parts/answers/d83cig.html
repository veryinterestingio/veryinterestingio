		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the same as how the Earth looks flat even though we know it's a sphere. If the curvature is gentle enough, you can only see it on a really large scale. It's only e.g. near black holes and neutron stars that it gets strong enough to be visible.</p>
<p>But in a sense, this is sort of a backwards argument. General Relativity was derived with the <em>assumption</em> that space-time is a &quot;locally Euclidian manifold&quot;. The theory is built from the observation that space-time appears to be Euclidian on small scales. But <em>why</em> this is the case is a matter of very speculative theoretical work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is generally the case if what you have is differentiable.</p>
<p>For any differentiable manifold you can locally (if you restrict yourself to a small region close to a point) approximate it well by the tangent space. You can actually track it down to a simple curve in two dimensions. If it is differentiable you can pick a point and draw the tangent to the curve through that point. Then if you restrict yourself to a small region, the tangent will be a very good approximation (&quot;how good&quot; can be mathemtaically quantified in terms of Landau symbols o, O etc.).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is &quot;begging the question&quot;, somewhat. Euclidean geometry was developed in response to what we can do and observe as humans. So in a sense, it's like asking &quot;why was the Declaration of Independence signed on Independence day?&quot; The other answers have done a great job of explaining how Euclidean geometry is almost perfectly accurate in the local realm in which it was theorized.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An axiom of general relativity is that spacetime is a 4-dimensional smooth manifold with a Lorentzian metric. A &quot;manifold&quot; is precisely an object that looks locally like Euclidean space. So the theory does not explain why spacetime is locally Euclidean; it's just an assumption with no proof. </p>
<p>Why is the assumption true? Well, if you trust GR as an accurate model of the real world at suitable scales (and there is plenty of evidence to support that), then its fundamental premises must be true. We really don't have any justification for assuming the basic structure of spacetime beyond that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1, As others pointed out, in General Relativity spacetime is  4-dimensional smooth manifold, so you can always restrict yourself to a space small enough so it looks flat.</p>
<p>2, Gravity is very weak. An object on a table near me won't curve the spacetime in a measurable way. Only significant contribution for everyday life is from the whole Earth (and Moon). This not the case for example for magnets which will significantly affect the electromagnetic field in their vicinity even if the magnet is small.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
