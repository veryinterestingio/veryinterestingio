		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A volume knob or wheel is an example of a device called a <em>potentiometer</em>, which is a device that adjusts the voltage going down a wire by increasing or decreasing the electrical resistance.</p>
<p>If the resistance increases (if you turn the volume knob down), then less voltage makes it to the speaker, the cone vibrates less intensely, and the sound is quieter. The opposite is true if you turn the volume up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends.</p>
<p>On purely analog devices audio is just an electric signal. When you adjust the gain you are controlling how much electricity you are letting through, like a water tap.</p>
<p>On digital devices this is more complicated but, generally speaking, when you press the volume buttons you are also controlling how much electricity is being sent to the speakers although not directly. Some code is interpreting your actions on the volume buttons and then this either results in the digital audio signal having less amplitude, or controlling the analog amplifier, or both.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sound travels through your electronic device as a very small electrical current. Think of this current as “flowing” like water. </p>
<p>When the volume knob is all the way up, all of the water is allowed to pass through it, but as you turn the knob down, less and less water is allowed through. The amount of “water” coming through = volume.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have talked about potentiometers but OP asked about a &quot;wheel&quot; (which is not a knob) and a button.  The &quot;wheel&quot; is known as an encoder. It's a device that has many different positions. The device tracks which position the wheel was at and which position it has moved to. So it knows which direction the user is turning the wheel. If they turn it clockwise, then the system will send a signal to the amplifier to increase the gain (volume). If the user is turning it counter-clockwise then it will send a signal to lower the gain. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is what allows the user to continuously turn the wheel in a given direction. A regular knob has a fixed range and will only turn up to a certain point.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As for buttons, it's the same idea, there is a button for &quot;up&quot; and button for &quot;down&quot;. The system decides to increase the gain or lower the gain simply by which button is pressed. This is why you can have a touch screen with a volume slider . It's all digital information.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
