		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason is your anus and rectum have a very robust vascular supply (arteries, veins, lymphatics) compared to other parts of the body. This allows for your white blood cells to get to the infection easily, attack it quickly, and clear the debris quickly so bacteria cannot grow unchecked. That being said, peri-anal abscesses (pus-filled infected regions around the anus/rectum) are definitely a thing that require surgery to drain. Not so fun.</p>

<p>Edit: Also, just a point to clarify: your large intestine (colon) doesn't go that low, it ends about 12cm from your anus, then you have the rectum, and then the last couple centimeters are called the anus. Edit2: ...so I hope you aren't actually scratching your colon</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not an MD, but, the GI tract constantly grows new cells and sheds them, which works well as a defense against infection. Itâ€™s why chemotherapy affects digestion so harshly, the dividing GI cells are targeted along with cancer, because they are dividing so rapidly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
