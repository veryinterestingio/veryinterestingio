		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd say what key is that its not that its derivations remained, its that they developed.</p>
<p>The roman empire was massive. But it feel, with Latin being the dominant language all over.</p>
<p>Now when it collapsed it broke into separate kingdoms. With time comes change. However the kingdoms would not change uniformly. The comparative isolation meant local dialects began to evolve into new languages with a common base.</p>
<p>Now add in that they each had to deal with outside political forces. The Spanish had more north africans to deal and trade with meaning they would be more affected by them than the eventual french would be by their respective non-latin neighbours. Over time they all developed differently, creating derivations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the Roman Empire covered most of Western Europe, everyone spoke Latin. But every city spoke its own slang dialect, affected by the nearby locals, and all those versions were a bit different.  No big deal, they could all still speak with Rome and with each other, sort of.</p>
<p>Rome declined and fell between 400 and 476 AD. Now there was no central point of reference. The various dialects, now also affected by whoever was invading in those days, grew apart.  The only people speaking Classical Latin by now were monks and priests, who prayed in it.  But lots of people spoke a dialect, by now a bit changed over 400 years. By then, Classical Latin sounded to them like Shakespearean English sounds to you now.</p>
<p>400 years later in 842AD, the dialects were different enough from each other and from Classical Latin that you needed translations. See the Oaths of Strasbourg ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oaths_of_Strasbourg" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oaths\_of\_Strasbourg" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oaths\_of\_Strasbourg</a></a> ) which were written in Latin AND Gallo-Roman (a dialect partway from Latin to French) and you can really see the difference by now.</p>
<p>And by the way, the Oaths are also written in Old High German, which was as close as anyone got in those days to English. It's a direct ancestor. So if you want to know how far French has changed since the Oaths of Strasbourg, it's about the same as the difference between Old High German and modern English.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the monks and priests kept Classical Latin alive (though the pronunciation of that changed some too), and nobody had spoken it since the fall of Rome.  Then again, nobody has spoken Old High German since the 10th century either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
