If you are in a place, like a transport hub where there are loads of people bringing in new strains of disease you will get ill more often, also the environment can weaken your immune system, so if the climate is harsher or if there is more pollution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the things about colds is that they aren't all caused by the same virus, or even the same family of viruses. Adenoviruses, coronaviruses, and rhinoviruses, among others, can ALL cause colds.
