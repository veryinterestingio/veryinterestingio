		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With medicine it's because they lose effectiveness over time. They don't spoil or anything, just get less effective.</p>
<p>Shampoo and toothpaste are similar - they might separate, losing consistency and usefulness. </p>
<p>Basically mixtures can fail over time. They shouldn't hurt you but they might not be helpful.</p>
<p>EDIT: Gonna toss an edit as some people have chimed in and provided some really important information that might not get seen</p>
<p>Second edit: looks like I read about tetricycline toxicity in all of this and my brain went &quot;Tylenol&quot;. My bad.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Looks like antibiotics and prescriptions can fall into the &quot; don't take past the date&quot; group too due to over-time toxicity increases</p>
</li>
<li>Some things might grow mold, like opened shampoos</li>
</ul>
<p>Honestly the Tylenol thing seems really important, as I'm sure nobody would consider it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The expiration date is means the company tested the product to be stable for that period of time. After that, they are not responsible any more. However, I do work in a cosmetic company and I can tell you that a shampoo can be used well after its expiration date (usually written 3 years). as long as the aspect and appearance looks ok. Even if the aspect is not fine, it won’t hurt if you use it, it just means it wont be as effective anymore.
For medicines i cant comment, nor my area.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Medicine is usually because it loses effectiveness as it gets older. Shampoo and toothpaste etc is usually expiration date for the packaging rather than the product - the manufacturer didn’t verify that the plastic bottle (or whatever) is tight after that date.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>some medications can lose a bit of potency over the years and so the expiration date is used to show how long it will be full strength for. Other medications such as liquids might run into other problems such as settling out of solution, tastes going off or even the packaging becoming defunct.</p>
<p>With shampoos and cosmetics, there sometimes isn't a date, but usually it is a best by date letting people know that defects might occur to long after that date such as smells going off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cosmetics are tested using stability testing.  You generally don't want to use cosmetics past the exp date as the preservative system can lose strength over time.  Spreading something filled with microbes over your skin can make you sick if it gets in a cut etc</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
