		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Taken from another ELI5 post
Found the original person who composed this credit goes to U/giggity_gee</p>
<p>So your bowels are like a long train track and your food is like a set of cars on the track. Transit time between Point A, your mouth, and Point B, the chute, is a bit flexible but normally operates on a regularly scheduled basis.</p>
<p>When you eat, you put cars on the track and send them to Point B. As these cars go to Point B, they lose passengers (nutrients) at various points in the thin tunnel portion (small intestine). The journey isnt complete and the journey has already altered the shape of the car pretty significantly giving a rusty color. Once in the larger portion of the tunnel, the cars are checked for stray passengers and are hosed down a bit so that transition out of Point B isn't so bad. Sometimes, the train cars park juuust outside the gates of Point B so they can exit at the best time for the operator (toilet).</p>
<p>Now, all of this goes fucking nuts when you load a bad set of train cars at Point A. The track sensors located everywhere along the track, detect this alien set of cars and sends a distress call to the Supervisor (your brain). The Supervisor wants to handle the situation without having to phone the Manager (your consciousness) about the craziness on the tracks and also wants to make sure you never know it was on the tracks. It has to make a choice now: send it back to Point A violently and somewhat painfully risking tearing the tracks, or send it to Point B as fast as fuck? Depending on where it's located on the track, it'll choose the best route.</p>
<p>Let's use the destination Point B. The Supervisor hits the panic button and puts all the train cars that are on the track (in your body) on overdrive. The tunnels are flooded with water and lubricant to speed all the cars up and get them the hell out of there as quickly as possible. Cars collide with each other, and previously well formed cars are just flooded with water and lubricant that they are just a soggy, shadowy reminder of their former glory state.</p>
<p>The Media (pain) hears about the car collisions immediately begins filming live the high speed, flooded train cars out of control. They want to knos how an alien set of train cars were put on the tracks and they want someone to pay for such carelessness. The Manager is just watching the horror unfold on Live TV but cannot do anything to stop it, because the Supervisor was deaf and he had not installed a means of communicating with him after hours in the office.</p>
<p>I hope this answers your question.</p>
<p>TL;DR when you get diarrhea, everything gets pushed out, one way or another. There are no passing lanes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>Edited to add:</em> Well this was popular! Cool! I'll take this opportunity to recommend Wikipedia for a <em>first pass</em> at understanding health issues. I double-checked this post with the Wikipedia articles <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose_intolerance" target="_blank">lactose intolerance</a>, [milk allergy](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk</a> allergy), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactase" target="_blank">lactase</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose" target="_blank">lactose</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>There's a difference between <em>dairy allergy</em> and <em>lactose intolerance</em>. Often the one that causes fast diarrhea is lactose intolerance, not dairy allergy. Dairy allergy can be much, much worse.</p>
<hr />
<p>Dairy allergy is a person's immune system responding to milk proteins as if they're a harmful germ. It works the same as any other serious food allergy.</p>
<p>Lactose intolerance is when a person doesn't produce lact<strong>a</strong>se, a protein that breaks down milk sugar (lact<strong>o</strong>se). This is actually normal for most adult mammals; most mammals don't drink milk after infancy. But adult humans from some parts of the world <em>do</em> produce lactase, and so we have cuisines that use a lot of milk and milk products in places like Europe and India. People whose ancestors came from Europe, India, or some parts of Africa are much more likely to be able to drink milk without a problem; people whose ancestors came from East Asia are more likely to have a problem.</p>
<p>(Because lactose intolerance is actually normal, some people refer to the opposite as <em>lactase persistence</em> instead. They're saying that we need a word to describe the unusual condition (adults drinking milk), not the usual one (only babies drink milk). However, if you're living in far northern Europe where almost everyone has lactase persistence, and you don't, you're the one who will have trouble with the local food.)</p>
<hr />
<p>Dairy allergy can cause anaphylactic shock, which can kill; it can also cause rashes, hives, shortness of breath, and other allergy symptoms, <em>and</em> bowel trouble too. It can take anywhere from minutes, to hours, to a week after eating/drinking dairy products before the allergy symptoms actually kick in.</p>
<p>Lactose intolerance is the one that usually makes people have diarrhea, gas, burps, nausea, etc. shortly after drinking milk (within 30 minutes). What's happening is that the undigested lactose feeds bacteria in the intestines, which produce gas.</p>
<hr />
<p>Some people with milk allergies are okay eating baked goods or other cooked foods that are made with milk. This is because cooking causes the proteins to denature, or bend/break at the molecular level. Don't ever assume this if you know someone has a milk allergy, though; ask them if they can eat those things. As I said above, milk allergy can kill.</p>
<p>There's also a way to work around lactose intolerance: add lactase to milk. This is what the &quot;Lactaid&quot; brand of milk does. Fermented milk products such as yogurt or kefir are made with microbes that eat the lactose and turn it into acids; this is why yogurt is sour compared to milk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You’re actually asking two questions here. First, allergies usually cause a reaction to a foreign body called an allergen, which your body reacts to, causing hives, itching, etc. second, dairy. Some people are lactose intolerant, which is what you’re describing. They aren’t allergic to dairy, it’s just that they can’t absorb the lactose in their small intestines, which causes much more water to remain in the small intestines, which gets propelled through and becomes diarrhea</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
