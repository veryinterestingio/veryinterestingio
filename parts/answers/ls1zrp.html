This makes them most ideal for accelerating small probes in space. You can't provide the thrust to, say, launch from Earth or accelerate a large probe, but you can provide a small amount of continuous acceleration for a very long time, because you can continuously power the drive without using very much fuel. So the idea is that you can use this to get probes across the solar system quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>A few missions have started to use ion thrusters in space, but it's still quite new and not extremely widespread.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
