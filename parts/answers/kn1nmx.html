		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How about ELI15? Inflation is about not just the quantity of money circulating but also the speed at which it circulates.</p>
<p>This speed, in aggregate, has gone down massively. A lot of the newly printed money is actually just sitting on deposit at the central banks - partially as a result of the post-2008 requirements to hold a lot of cash in case of another credit crisis.</p>
<p>The zero and negative interest rate policies are to try and speed up the velocity of money - but it's like pushing on rope once you get below zero as banks are not able to pass the negative rates on to customers. </p>
<p>Fundamentally, inflation is based on people's expectations and nobody expects inflation to go up, so it doesn't and there's not much more that the central banks can do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interest rates are like a barrier between a 5 year old and food. If the kid eats the food, he inflates in size. Lowering interest rates is &quot;accommodative&quot; policy, like making it easier for the 5 year old to get to the food. The question is, is the 5 year old hungry? If not, then you just have a low barrier and no eating nor inflation occurring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is inflation, but it's in the things that you're not buying or paying attention to. Food and other consumables don't get super expensive because if you have a surplus of money you will not consume more food if you already eat well. The surplus of money goes into assets like stocks, real estate, bonds, etc.</p>
<p>Edit: got on my PC where I can expand more on this. It's harder to type on the phone.
Basically there are 2 definitions of inflation: one for the plebs and the real definition.
The definition for the plebs is the one based on the CPI (consumer price index). They take a basket of goods and measure how expensive it becomes in time. When the basket becomes more expensive they even change the definition of that basket to keep it line with that 2% inflation rate. Now you might be ok with this definition if the only thing you want in life is to consume and you have 0 interest in buying assets. </p>
<p>The real definition of inflation is &quot;an increase in the supply of money&quot;. The supply inflates. When the supply inflates because people borrow more with 0% interest, the prices also inflate. But as we've seen, the prices for food and other consumables doesn't inflate that much, so what happens with the money then? It goes into assets as I've mentioned previously. The result is that if you actually believe the &quot;pleb&quot; definition for inflation and you actually think it's only 2%, by the time you decide to invest in assets, you'll discover that you're priced out because they are too expensive for you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interest rates dont set the rate of inflation.  Inflation changes as the ratio of money to goods and services available for purchase with that money changes.  Same money but more goods?  Deflation.  More money but same amount of goods?  Inflation.  Small increase in money but larger inceease in goods: deflation.  Large increase in money but small increase in goods: inflation.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One explanation that I’ve heard (but don’t know if it’s true) is that due to demographic shift people are afraid of being poor at old age because the relatively small amount of taxpayers won’t be able to pay pension of a relatively large amount of pensioners. This might push people to save up more and consume less than it was previously common which slows inflation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
