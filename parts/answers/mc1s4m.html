		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with scales. Consider the key of G minor. The first note in the scale is G. The second is A. The third is B flat. So why not say A-sharp? Well it’s confusing. The A isn’t sharp, the B is flat. </p>
<p>Same thing with D major, in orders: D, E F#, G</p>
<p>It’s the F that’s sharp, not the G that’s flat. There is a natural G in D major, but not a natural F.</p>
<p>So, in conclusion, the flats and sharps are named for the notes they alter within a scale.
It would make reading music really hard, because every time you wrote a G in a D Major scale , you’d have to watch for a flat (if you used G-flat instead of F-Sharp) or a natural sign (negating the flat) </p>
<p>Also, this would have made writing music a lot harder, too. When all this was decided, music had to be written by hand. Having both sharps and flats was simply easier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Using equal temperament, yes they are the same thing. In earlier temperament systems, there is a difference between A# and Bflat. In the 18th century, some harpsichords (called enharmonic harpsichords) actually have split keys for flat or sharps. Understanding the tuning temperament is key to understanding this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever seen a play where the same person plays two different roles? You are given the context for each role by their costume and setting. </p>
<p>The same note (frequency) has a different role based on its context of the piece. So sometimes it will appear as a flat others a sharp.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They actually aren't the same. Back in the day, there was a difference between an Eb and a D#. They are only synonymous in our modern standard tuning system. The note we choose as Eb/D# is right in between both of them, so it's slightly detuned when used as either of the two.</p>
<p>That detuning is so small that it's pretty easy to get used to but if you actually go to a classic concert where they tune everything so that it's best for the key of the piece they're playing, you'll notice that the harmonies feel more pure and rich than what you usually hear. However, if they were to play a piece in a different key with that tuning, some intervalls would sound terrible. Standard tuning avoids this issue by making all keys sound okay-ish.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
