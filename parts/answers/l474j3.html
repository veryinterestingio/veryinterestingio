		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, when a ray of light hits something, it can basically do one of three things:</p>
<p>It can go right through, with a slight angle that reverses when it comes out the other side, like light passes through glass or water.</p>
<p>It can bounce off at an angle, like light does with a mirror or a bright piece of colored plastic.</p>
<p>Or it can get &quot;eaten&quot; and heat up the object, like when light hits something dark.</p>
<p>Objects are different colors because light is different wavelengths, and some wavelengths get eaten while others pass through or get bounced off.</p>
<p>A solid &quot;red&quot; object is red because green and blue light get eaten more than red light, while red light bounces off more than green or blue. A transparent &quot;red&quot; object is red because green and blue light get eaten more than red, while red passes through more than red or green.</p>
<p>Now, infrared and radio are also just different &quot;colors&quot; of light that we can't see; think of a radio antenna or a WiFi receiver as a kind of &quot;eye&quot; that can see those colors, while a transmitter is like a &quot;lightbulb&quot; that blinks in those colors.</p>
<p>Walls happen to be &quot;transparent&quot; to radio even though they're &quot;solid&quot; to visible colors, just like a stained glass window is &quot;transparent&quot; to some colors and &quot;solid&quot; to others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Without getting too in the weeds, electromagnetic waves aren't always bothered by solid surfaces.  </p>
<p>Take light for example....it doesn't go through traditional walls...but it does travel very freely through glass, another solid surface.  </p>
<p>WiFi/Bluetooth/other ranges of electromagnetic waves are able to travel through what we call walls (solid surfaces that light can't even pass through), similar to how light travels through glass.  </p>
<p>Another example is infrared. The infrared wavelengths that most thermal cameras detect are blocked by most glass, but other (shorter) wavelengths of infrared, such as from sunlight or most infrared heat lamps, passes through most glass....and coatings can be added to help block it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everything is made of stuff (even air) called atoms. Every atom is basically surrounded by electrons. Electromagnetic waves can go through some things and not others because of how the electrons are arranged in the stuff and how they interact with each other. Something that is not transparent for one portion of the electromagnetic spectrum may be transparent for another part. Whenever an electromagnetic wave moves from one material to another, it will bend a little bit as it travels forward or it might just bounce back in the direction it came from. When it can just travel through, that stuff is transparent for that particular electromagnetic wave. </p>
<p>For radio waves and others like it, walls are see-through (like glass is for optical waves).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think a good analogy would be standing outside a nightclub. You only hear the bass (low freq sound waves) while most higher freq sound is either absorbed by the walls or bounced back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
