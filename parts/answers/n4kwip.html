		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thatâ€™s a polyadenylated (poly(A)) tail. When our cells make RNA, it is processed to add a string of adenines to the end. This tag helps other parts of the cellular machinery recognize the mRNA for transport out of the nucleus. It also helps control gene expression because another enzyme gradually shortens the tail, and once it grows too short the RNA is degraded. Since SARS-CoV-2 is made in human cells, it has this tail added.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Normal mRNAs in your cell have something called a poly A tail, a string of adenines that are added during the maturation of the molecule. </p>
<p>The general consensus is that the tail is between 100-200 As long. When the mRNA is set to be degraded, it goes through a tail shortening process until it's 10-15 As long and is then (usually) sent to be degraded.</p>
<p>Any RNA floating around in the cell without a poly A tail won't get turned into protein. Viruses obviously want their mRNAs turned into protein so they either genetically encode the tail or use some other trick to get translated into protein.</p>
<p>SARS2, like most coronaviruses, is using the strategy of genetically encoding its tail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why is the sequence data not grouped into factors of 3? I thought codons were always groups of 3 base pairs. e.g. </p>
<p>29461 tgctgcagat ttggatgatt tctccaaaca attgcaacaa tccatgagca gtgctgactc </p>
<p>where each grouping is 10 base pairs (instead of e.g. 9 or 6)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
