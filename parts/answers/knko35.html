		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Straight lines and squares are not as common in nature as other shapes. We can recognize that something with straight lines is more likely already looked over by people or is put by people. Something tossed could have dangerous things under it like a snake or something, less chance that there is danger when something is completely flat folded. One possibility.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The world, in general, just isn't made of straight lines. Humans are extremely visual creatures with excellent eyesight, and something being straight or precisely shaped is simply very noticeable to us as a species. It's very easy to pick out a straight line in a world that's otherwise formed with extremely random patterns.</p>
<p>We like straight lines because they actually give us a survival advantage. A straight spear is easier to use and less likely to break. A clean, flat surface is easier to work with than a bumpy, dirty floor. Boxes can more uniformly fit objects inside than an awkwardly shaped container. </p>
<p>We've adapted as a species to like straight lines, because straight lines literally help us survive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ol>
<li>
<p>It represents work, subconsciously it's harder to relax when you know there's work to be done</p>
</li>
<li>Visual processing takes a lot of energy and the more shortcuts the brain can take the better, straight lines and solid colors are easier to just extrapolate without paying specific attention to.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pattern recognition is easier. You have mental schemata in your brain (blueprints) of every object you encounter. The closer what you look at is to one of your schemata, the more at ease you are because that means you donâ€™t need to use extra cpu to process it. A folded piece of shirt is what most people associate a shirt with (or a hanging one) as opposed to it laying crumbled on the floor and thus could be whatever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
