		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The back end of the fan is drawing air from all around it, while the front is pushing air in a sort of 'beam', so the actual volume of air that the back moves is the same as the front despite its lower velocity. If you were to build a cylinder that comes out of the back of the fan then the air would move at roughly the same speed as the front.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
