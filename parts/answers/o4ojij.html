		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh there's heaps. The periodic table is just for baryonic matter made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Anything made out of other subatomic particles won't make it into the periodic table. It doesn't include muons, neutrinos, or anything else in the <a href="https://home.cern/science/physics/standard-model" target="_blank">standard model of particle physics</a>. In particular, if dark matter really is some currently undiscovered subatomic particle (and there's good reasons to suspect it is), then like 80% of the mass of the universe is made up of matter that isn't on the periodic table.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there are something called exotic atom, I don't know if they're specifically called a matter by scientist but here we go :</p>
<p>Positronium : when there is electron bound with positron (antielectron). Can be made into molecule called positronium hydride (PsH)</p>
<p>Protonium (Pn) : proton bound with antiproton</p>
<p>Muonium (Mu) : positive muon bound with electron</p>
<p>Pionium, neutronium, and so on</p>
<p>Some paper predict that these exotic matter are able to form molecules with each other</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star" target="_blank">Neutron stars</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_condensate" target="_blank">bose-einstein condensate</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole" target="_blank">singularities</a> are all exceptions. Dark matter, which can only (so far) be observed through its mass, also likely fits into this category. Finally, like the other commenter said, all subatomic particles would also fit your question (i.e. neutrinos, gluons, etc).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
