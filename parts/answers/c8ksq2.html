		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because of the general anesthesia. General anesthesia and the intubation process can make people vomit or regurgitate, and since you're unconscious and your normal reflexes are suppressed, you could aspirate stomach contents into your lungs, which can be fatal. Also for surgery on part of the digestive system itself, obviously you don't want food in there while surgeons are operating.</p>
<p>As for emergency surgery, doctors will determine the risk of performing the surgery right away vs the benefit of waiting. Usually if it's that serious that you need emergency surgery right away, they're just going to do it. Aspiration is pretty rare anyway, so if you can avoid it, fine, but if you're gonna die without surgery, they don't really have a choice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anesthesiologist here.  When you are put to sleep under anesthesia you lose your gag reflex and cannot protect your own airway.  If food or drink is in your stomach, it can come up your esophagus and the gastric contents can be aspirated.  That is the reason you are told not to eat before surgery.  If the surgery is an emergency, the patient is considered to have a full stomach and special precautions are taken which is called a rapid sequence intubation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are already a lot of good answers here but not sure if they are ELI5 answers. Ill give it a try. </p>
<p>When you go to sleep from anesthesia there is a big chance you will puke and then suck your puke into your lungs. This is bad. If your stomach is empty the chance of pukeing is much smaller. </p>
<p>For emergency surgery, or when your stomach is mot empty, we put you to sleep a different way but the risk of inhaling puke is super high. </p>
<p>Therefore: empty stomach for anesthesia is the safest. Emergency surgery is called “emergency surgery” for a reason and we deal with the added risks. </p>
<p>Cheers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For emergency surgery - for example where there is a risk to life or limb - where a patient hasn't fasted and there's a risk of aspirating (breathing in) the stomach contents, the idea is to get their airway protected by the breathing tube as soon as possible.  </p>
<p>The 'rapid sequence induction' technique differs to a normal general anaesthetic induction - the muscle relaxant used is extremely fast acting in order to paralyse/intubate them as soon as possible - we also apply pressure to a certain spot on the neck (cricoid cartilage) to close off the oesophagus and reduce the chance of regurgitation. (Although the efficiency of this is pretty debatable, I believe it is still widely used, at least in the UK.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>you fast so none of your stomach content will go into your lungs. That is a major risk during operation.
if you have an emergency and need immediate operation, the risk is probably worth it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
