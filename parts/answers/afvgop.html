		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, ELI5 version, your body doesn’t know how to fix itself so it keeps trying to get everything out. That “chest kicked in by a horse” feeling (or fell-ing, no judge I’m bad at spell check too) is your lack of anything to push out. So all you’re doing is pushing with no substance. Think lifting up a box you thought was going to be heavy, but then is empty. It throws you off and can really hurt, except instead of throwing the box to kingdom come with all your force going out the force goes to you. Which hurts!</p>
<p>Sounds like you may be experiencing this now, if you keep getting sick with nothing coming out (or bile coming out) for over 12 hours please go see a doctor. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you lift heavy weights for a long time, your arms would get sore and you'd want to rest them. Now imagine instead of resting them, you were forced to keep lifting weights. It would probably hurt.</p>
<p>The same things happening with your abdominal muscles and chest, you've contracted the muscles more than they're designed for and they start to ache. Only instead of resting them, they continue to uncontrollably contract as your body carries on trying to vomit. The abdominal muscles contracting also temporarily makes your chest tight as you can't breath while your muscles are contracted trying to vomit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
