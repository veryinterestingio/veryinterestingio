		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of people trying to technically explain why instant back transfers can't happen. In the UK we have instant bank transfers including between different banks. So no matter what explanations people throw at you, yes it absolutely is possible. All it needs is the will to implement. In the UK it happened because there was a bit of a public/newspaper/consumer watchdog outcry over this when it used to take days. I didn't hear of any banks going through significant hardship making the switch and it all happen fairly rapidly.</p>

<p>Edit: Having found the link above, the technical process to implement the system took about 2 years. The process from initial government proposal and consultation to awarding a contract took 9 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Banks also don't seem to have sufficient incentives to speed it up, especially as they can benefit from interest while the money is in transit.</p>
<p>Get your politicians to make a law limiting how long the transfer may take and you'll see that it <em>can</em> be done in minutes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
