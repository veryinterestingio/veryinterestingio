		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vítamín D is a hormone created by the skin as a reaction to ultraviolet radiation.</p>
<p>The skin cells absorb the UV and photolyzes protovitamin D3 into previtamin D3 (two compounds necessary for the creation of the essential hormone).</p>
<p>Pre-D3 then isomerizes into Vitamin D3, or else is further photolyzed into lymistrol and tachysterol.</p>
<p>Using sunscreen or living in Arctic areas can affect the body's absorption of UV light and the creation of Previtamin D3, lowering Vitamin D3 in the blood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The body naturally produces a precursor substance, dehydrocholesterol. That substance is biologically inactive and the body cannot naturally do anything else to it. It gets concentrated in the outer layers of the skin and left there. </p>
<p>Dehydrocholesterol is a somewhat complex molecule with four rings of carbon atoms. When it is struck by UV light, one of the rings splits at a certain place, and opens out to be a crescent rather than a circle. The unbound carbon atom on the end then binds to hydrogen atoms from the surrounding water. </p>
<p>The resulting molecule is vitamin D3. </p>
<p>After it's changed, it is no longer inert. The body is able to &quot;grab&quot; it with enzymes and use it in biological processes. </p>
<p>The important thing here is that the light is a necessary part of the process. Organisms do not have any biological tools or enzymes that can turn dehydrocholesterol into vitamin D. The reaction requires UV light to break that one chemical bond, and the natural source of UV is direct sunlight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D#Biosynthesis" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin\_D#Biosynthesis" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin\_D#Biosynthesis</a></a> </p>
<p>In short, in certain types of cells in the lower layers of the skin, 7-dehydrocholesterol is converted via UV light (present in sunlight) to a kind of &quot;pre-vitamin D3&quot;, which then spontaneously converts into Vitamin D3 itself. </p>
<p>The reaction sequence is shown here:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocyclic_reaction#Electrocyclic_reactions_in_biological_systems" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocyclic\_reaction#Electrocyclic\_reactions\_in\_biological\_systems" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocyclic\_reaction#Electrocyclic\_reactions\_in\_biological\_systems</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, it has to do with the 7-dehydrocholesterol contained in the skin. (It is firstly produced in the liver). As UV light penetrates the skin, 7-dehydrocholesterol transforms into previtamin D3 by a process called photodissociation( a process which needs energy, and UV radiation contains enough of it).
Afterwards, previtamin D3 spontaneously isomerizes to Vitamin D3 , which is called cholecalciferol. This compund can then be further metabolized in liver and the kidneys...
interestingly, Vitamin D can only be produced by phtodissociation. Even in laboratories for commercial use the precursor has to be exposed to UV lights to be produced.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
