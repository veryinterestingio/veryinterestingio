		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We do it with electrical muscle stimulation. Targeted electricity through pads attached to the body, which cause intense contractions and subsequent micro tearing. I can't find the video, but I think it was Kai Greene(professional open bodybuilder) who trialled it in combination with his exercise and saw a marked increase in muscle gain. Obviously other people have, too, but I think bodybuilders are the best gauge of it as they're constantly monitoring growth of all their muscles and know how any changes to their routine affect it. </p>
<p>tldr; check out EMS(Electrical muscle stimulation)
