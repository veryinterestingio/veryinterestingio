		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are descended from scared little monkey-like creatures that used to be hunted and eaten by snakes and cats and eagles and bigger monkeys. </p>
<p>Accordingly, we have inherited from our ancestors a subconscious capacity for sensing: “There’s something watching me!”</p>
<p>It’s like an alarm system in your brain, always running in the background, that sets off a gut-feeling when it detects what might be eyes trained you. </p>
<p>In modern humans, this same alarm system is now mostly used to watch out for other people looking at us, since other people are a much more common concern for us these days than predators are. </p>
<p>Either way, sometimes that alarm system goes off by mistake. And you get a gut-feeling like you are being hunted or watched, but actually you are not. Certain drugs and mental health conditions can make this alarm system go totally haywire, and that’s “paranoia”.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are sensitive to cues that indicate we may be under the observation of a dangerous human or a prey animal.</p>
<p>Some of these sensitivities are innate, and some are learned through experience. </p>
<p>These cues include changes to the soundscape, air pressure, the behavior of others, situational likelihood, and so on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes someone <em>is</em> looking at us and following us, but probably not for the egocentric reasons we imagine.</p>
<p>When you turn around to look behind you (on a street, for example, or at the movies), people behind you will often reflexively look at the face (yours) that has just appeared in their line of sight, thus maybe giving you the impression that you are being watched. They weren't looking at you before you turned around and they aren't looking at you after you turned away again, but for that second or two they looked at you. And if you look back again and the same people reflexively look at you <em>again</em>, you may really start thinking you're being watched. </p>
<p>And if the people glancing at you when you turn around happen to be walking the same way you're walking but some distance behind you? You might get the feeling you're being <em>followed</em> and watched, when they only happen to be headed in the same direction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Supposedly a built-in survival tool from the beginning of time when we weren't at the top of the food chain. When out hunting, humans weren't the only predators out there. Our nervous system is in tune to subtle changes in our surroundings whether we consciously acknowledge these signals or not. Some people are more &quot;anxious&quot;/&quot;paranoid&quot;/&quot;on edge&quot; than others when it comes to this. It also depends on when you get this feeling. Is it always when you're away from home and in a crowded area? do you get it at home? situational? Often? rarely? Does it impact your day to day life? </p>
<p>I must admit the last time I got this feeling, it wasn't wrong. I was at a trail head taking a break and hadn't seen anyone around. Went to put my water away, dropped the bottle and bent to pick it up. Got a weird feeling I was being watched. Glanced up and a guy had appeared out of nowhere just standing there staring right at me. Gave me the creeps. </p>
<p>I rarely get the feeling these days compared to when I was a kid. But I had that feeling as a kid when I was doing something I wasn't supposed to be doing, particularly at night when I was supposed to be in bed. Makes sense I had that feeling. These days I rarely get it and when I do it's because someone is usually watching me or happens to be staring off in my direction. Now if someone could explain why I heard my name being whispered from the dark behind me as I watched tv late at night in the basement as a child, that'd be nice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
