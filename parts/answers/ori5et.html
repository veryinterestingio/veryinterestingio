		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In humans, the natural ratio between males and females at birth is slightly biased towards the male sex, being estimated to be about 1.05 or 1.06 or within a narrow range from 1.03 to 1.06 males/per female born. </p>
<p>Males usually exceed females at birth but subsequently experience different mortality rates due to many possible causes such as differential natural death rates, war casualties, and deliberate gender control.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This is not due to selectively aborting females, killing females at birth, etc.  It's been noted by scientists for centuries in country after country.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
