		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes this is possible. Chimerism happens when two fertilised eggs fuse together, creating an individual with two different genetic backgrounds. Chimerism usually splits down the middle of the body, so if one of the genetic backgrounds was colourblind, then one of the eyes of the individual would be too. I'm not sure if it has ever actually been recorded though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's possible as others have mentioned.  But be aware that the brain combines what the two eyes see, and it can correct for differences between them.</p>
<p>One 'cure' for colorblindness is to wear glasses with one lens having a red tint.  That makes red seem unusual to the viewer -- it's dark in one eye but bright in the other.  At first that's confusing (and causes severe headaches) but after a while the brain adjusts and is able to see the color red by combining the inputs from both eyes.</p>
<p>So if you're colorblind in only one eye, you're only going to notice that when viewing objects with one eye at a time.  Whenever you're viewing with both eyes, the brain will combine the inputs to give you the best possible vision.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
