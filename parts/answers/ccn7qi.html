		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends entirely on what kind of sizes you want to talk about, as there are far more light asteroids than heavy asteroids, but in general the answer is &quot;really really far away&quot;.</p>
<p>Note that the total mass of the asteroid belt is only 4% of the mass of the Moon (<a href="https://www.universetoday.com/32856/asteroid-belt/" target="_blank">1</a>), while being spread out over an insanely large volume (approx. 10 trillion trillion cubic miles; <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/dawn/mission/faq/" target="_blank">2</a>). The estimated distance between asteroids of at least a mile in size is 1.9 million miles (<a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/dawn/mission/faq/" target="_blank">2</a>). For this reason, space missions beyond the asteroid belt do not even worry about passing through the asteroid belt, as the probability of crashing into an asteroid is estimated to be less than 1 in a billion. So no, you would not be able to see other asteroids 'near' you, if you happened to be standing on one (or indeed holding onto one)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The asteroid belt has an estimated 1 million asteroids with a diameter of at least 1 km. As rough approximation for its volume consider a ring with a radius of 2 AU to 3 AU and a thickness of 0.5 AU. That is a volume of 0.5 pi (3^(2)-2^(2)) AU^(3) = 8 AU^3 = 2.6*10^25 km^(3). Per kilometer-sized asteroid we have a volume of 2.6*10^19 km^(3), that is a cube with a side length of 3 million kilometers.</p>
<p>A 1 km rock at 10 times the distance to the Moon? You'll need a telescope to see that at all and a spacecraft and course-correction maneuvers on the way to have a chance to fly there.</p>
<p>There are notable exceptions, of course. Ceres can be visible to the naked eye over a distance of maybe 1 AU, Vesta is smaller but brighter, it would give a similar range. A few more larger objects have relevant ranges. </p>
<p>You will see asteroids with the naked eye once in a while - mainly as very dim objects, millions of kilometers away. They will be moving so slowly over the sky that you'll have to take pictures over several days and compare them to distinguish them from stars.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Real asteroid belts aren't like in the movies. Passing through the asteroid belt wouldn't be like the Millennium Falcon dodging between asteroids.</p>
<p>In fact due to the sheer scale of space, you could pass through the asteroid belt and not even realize you'd done so. Most asteroids are far enough away from one another that you wouldn't be able to see any neighboring asteroids without a good telescope.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>This is only tangentially related to your question about asteroids, but if you're looking for a fairly close scale of space (scaled to the moon being one pixel on your screen), try the following:</p>

<p>The asteroid belt would start around 418,000,000km in. But since they're all drastically smaller than the moon, the result in this visualization is pretty anticlimactic. lol</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
