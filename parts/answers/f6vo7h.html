		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is partially due to the fact the airways are still irritated from the effects of the illness, and partially because the flu weakens the immune system and allows additional infections.</p>
<p>It is, in fact, relatively common for more vulnerable people to develop bronchitis or pneumonia after a flu. This is why almost every source you ask about flu symptoms will tell you to see a doctor if your cough lasts too long, or if your fever disappears for a day or two and then comes back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Last spring I had a cough that lasted 6 weeks after a viral  sickness, it was a dry cough and the Dr said it could last up to 3 months. He prescribed a medication to numb the lung/airways because the cough was irritating the lungs causing me to continue coughing... self perpetual loop. One week on the prescription and I was perfectly fine.</p>
<p>Medicine was Benzonatate Cap 100MG</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everybody's answering relating to productive coughs (dispelling the leftover mucus, basically). What about the dry coughs? The coughs that start with a &quot;tickle&quot; in the throat and doesn't cough up any sort of mucus?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
