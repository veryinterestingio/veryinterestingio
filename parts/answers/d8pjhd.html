		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I want to know if anybody else’s elementary schools had assemblies where people were selling stuff—late 90’s.  I can remember an assembly with curly no-tie shoelaces and one with a baton  thing that you juggle with two sticks.  At least the baton assembly involved someone doing cool tricks, but an entire assembly that was a shoelace sales pitch? There were other products that I can’t quite remember. Why would schools allow people to try to sell things to elementary students? Did the schools get a kickback?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everything that /u/WRSaunders explained.</p>
<p><strong>Plus</strong>, in order to get really good at it, you need to be able to work equally well with both hands.</p>
<p>This forces not just hand-eye co-ordination, but hand-eye co-ordination <em>on each side of your brain</em> plus <em>between the two sides of your brain</em>.</p>
<p>Apparently, developing these bi-lateral connections as a youngster leads to benefits in other areas of life.</p>
<p>Can't find the referenced papers, but it was an odd-enough fact at the time that I remembered it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
