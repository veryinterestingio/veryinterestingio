<p>Just because at point X in time no people are sick, doesnt mean that there are no carriers of the virus or items/places with viruses or bacteria on them. Someone goes exploring a ruined castle, or visits an old demolished house, or comes in contact with a rat that came in contact with something from an old area etc etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add a useless tidbit, one reason smallpox was able to be eradicated was because there is no other known vector for the virus other than humans.  Get rid of it in all humans, it's gone (except for stockpiles of virus in government labs for future germ warfare ^(just kidding)).</p>
<p>Other diseases preventable in humans may have other hosts that can re-infect humans even if the disease is supposedly eradicated.  The lesson:  ever vigilant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're referring to the measles outbreak that recently came up in Oregon and Washington they recently traced back patient zero and identified them as someone who came from outside the country (they didn't say exactly where). This is a common way that a previously wiped out disease can come back. Unless it's wiped out everywhere in the world it has a chance to spread again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason we managed to eliminate small pox (like it's extinct GO HUMANS) is more due to luck regarding the nature of the virus. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Small pox had two really nice (perspective is important) properties:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>1)  Carriers did not exist. This meant that if you contracted small pox, you would show symptoms. The symptoms of small pox were (past tense WOOOO) so distinct that you could quickly identify an outbreak and react with mass vaccinations. Since you could easily identify everyone who had the disease you can isolate and treat. This is not the case with many other childhood diseases. For example, Polio in 90+% of cases manifests as a fever and other non-descript symptoms. Fevers are common to many many illnesses so it takes longer to figure out what is going on. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>2) Small pox only infected humans. This one is huge. If only humans can be infected, than you can ensure that all sources of the virus are contained. It's much much harder to stop a disease or virus from spreading when mice, birds. and other animals can carry the virus, get on a ship and spread it elsewhere. This is actually the main reason why rabies is still a thing. We have a super effective way to prevent the onset of symptoms (and certain death) but we can't control all the vectors (bats, dogs, raccoons) so it's still a thing we need to be aware of.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The human ability to travel is a big factor. Lots of underdeveloped countries in Asia and Africa don't have vaccines for things like polio and thus people are still contracting and transmitting them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
