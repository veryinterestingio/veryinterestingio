		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wolves are noted for their genetic plasticity.  Canines in general seem to be very adaptable to a wide range of environmental pressures, including selective breeding from humans.  The famous domestication study with Russian foxes further exemplifies this.  Most animals are nowhere near as plastic, including domesticated cats.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Darwin says it’s because of their nocturnal rambling habits. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, cats, from their nocturnal rambling habits, cannot be matched, and, although so much valued by women and children, we hardly ever see a distinct breed kept up; such breeds as we do sometimes see are almost always imported from some other country, often from islands.</p>

<p>In other words, because the main use for cats has been to let them roam free and hunt by themselves, people haven’t generally kept them for selective breeding - they’ve bred randomly by themselves when they’re out alone.  Dogs, in contrast, have generally been kept kenneled up and it’s been possible to breed them to specific standards. </p>
<p>Also, “The Nocturnal Rambling Habits” would be a great name for a band.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to others discussions of degree of human control over mating, there's also a fundamental biological difference in how much the bones/other structures of dogs and cats shift from when they're young to when they're mature. Puppies and dogs have very different cranial bone ratios (just think of the face of a puppy vs the face of a full grown dog). Cats, on the other hand, have pretty much the same ratios from when they're born to when they're fully grown. Thus, it's much more likely that you get a random mutation that effects phenotype in dogs as they have way more moving parts that you can easily see the changes of.  </p>
