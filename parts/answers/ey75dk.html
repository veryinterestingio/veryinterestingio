Stroke order is also important in maintaining the right shape and balance of all the parts of a character.
I've seen dyslexia in Japanese writing manifest in such a way that these parts get shuffled around or stroke order gets totally screwed up and the character looks totally unbalanced.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The causes of dyslexia vary between languages. Being dyslexic in one language does not necessarily mean you will feel the same effects in other languages. In fact, there have been studies on this exact topic. The brain abnormalities in those with dyslexia in china can be and often are different from those in the west. It's also true that dyslexia might manifest in different forms within a single language, jumbling letters or having things such as dyscalculia as well where even numbers are mixed up. For instance, my brother at 19 cannot effectively distinguish the letters p,q,d,b, but has absolutely no issues reading Chinese in school.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few different kinds of dyslexia. One of the most common kinds is <em>phonological</em>, which means it makes it hard for people to &quot;sound out&quot; words. For example, if you had phonological dyslexia and read the word &quot;cat&quot;, you would have trouble sounding it out as &quot;c&quot; + &quot;a&quot; + &quot;t&quot;. This kind is a big problem for people who speak languages that use alphabets, because alphabets work by having one letter (more or less) for each sound, and if you have trouble putting sounds together from letters, then you'll have a lot of trouble reading an alphabet.</p>
<p>But there are other ways of writing that aren't alphabets. The two main ones are called <em>syllabaries</em> and <em>logographies</em>. Syllabaries work by having one letter for each syllable: for example, in Japanese, the word for &quot;cat&quot; is ねこ, pronounced &quot;neko&quot;, where ね makes the <em>ne</em> sound and こ makes the <em>ko</em> sound. Logographies, on the other hand, work by having one letter for each word or idea: for example, in Mandarin, the word for &quot;cat&quot; is 猫, pronounced &quot;māo&quot; (which is adorable), where 猫 stands for the whole word. It can be a bit more complicated, but these are generally how they work.</p>
<p>Now, if, like 猫, one character stands for an entire word, then you only need to recognize the character, without needing to sound out its individual parts. If you have phonological dyslexia, and have trouble sounding out words, logographies won't be an issue, because there's no actual sounding-out-ing going on. It works in the reverse way, too. Certain kinds of dyslexia can have an effect on how you read logographies without having an effect on how you read sound-based systems, so you can read English just fine but struggle with Chinese.</p>
<p>Finally, there's also a difference between <em>shallow</em> and <em>deep</em> writing systems. A <em>shallow</em> writing system is one with very phonetic spelling, where the letters correspond very closely with the sounds of a word, e.g., Italian or Spanish. A <em>deep</em> writing system is one where the spellings don't match up too closely, e.g., English or French. Dyslexia is much more common in a language with a deep writing system than a shallow one.</p>
<p>This can all get really interesting with a language like Japanese, which makes use of both syllabaries (which are sounded out) and logographies (which are not sounded out). The word for &quot;cat&quot;, for example, can be written either with the hiragana syllabary, as in the ねこ example above, or with the kanji logography, as 猫, using the same character as in Chinese. If you have one kind of dyslexia but not the other, you may have trouble with reading the syllabary, but <em>not</em> with reading the logography. Worse, Japanese has a shallow syllabary - i.e., the sounds of the letters are very close to the actual sounds of a word - but a deep logography - i.e., the sounds of the kanji characters can be quite random and difficult to figure out - so the rate of dyslexia for the syllabary is 2-3%, while the rate of dyslexia for the logography is 5-6%.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey friends, EN and JP speaking dyslexic here. </p>
<p>EN (UK) is my mother tongue and in that language my dyslexia manifests as words looking as if they are the word I expect to see, even if they aren't. Reading can be annoying and often takes a while. (Lots of &quot;what?&quot; And rereading.)</p>
<p>In JP (my second language) I don't seem to suffer the same issue at all. Kanji compounds don't switch around at all and I have no problems writing or reading any of the alphabets. In fact I'm a translator!</p>
<p>So I guess at least for me, I don't have dyslexia in Japanese?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dyslexia varies across language barriers Chinese-speaking children with dyslexia have a disorder that is quite different,  I would say it’s more complicated than in English speakers, the differences we see in the brain as well as the performance in visual and oral tasks.</p>
<p>English dyslexia is what’s referred to as a “phonological disorder,” which means people meaning that people have trouble detecting/manipulating the sound structure of spoken language, which causes problems in linking speech sound to the alphabet letter.</p>
<p>dyslexia in Chinese speaking sufferers is really two disorders: a visuospatial deficit and a phonological disorder combined. Which is
sound and visual perception disorder combined.</p>
<p>To expand on the two terms a bit more, “The ability to see an object or picture as a set of parts and then to construct a replica of the original from these parts”
And “the inability to correctly form the sounds of words” .sufferers do not use some or all of the speech sounds to form words as expected for a person of their age.</p>
<p>You can observe this impact using Brain scans dyslexics show lower activity(weaker activation)in the Part of the brains that deals with sound perception (visuospatial processing).You would also notice less activity in brain’s left middle frontal gyrus (the area we believe is used for remembering visual patterns)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
