		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Couple of reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, salt. Most seafood lives in salt water, which means they're naturally saltier than other meats you eat.</p>
<p>Secondly, Trimethylamine. This is the chemical responsible for that pungent, unmistakeable &quot;fishy smell&quot;. All fish, crustaceans and I believe molluscs that live in sea water contain a chemical called Trimethylamine Oxide, which exists to balance out something called osmotic pressure. Basically, when you have two bodies of water separated by a permeable membrane (such as the membrane of a cell), water will move across that membrane so that there's the same &quot;concentration&quot; of water on each side. Salty water has a lower concentration of water than normal, which means that if something were to live in salty water, some of the water inside its cells would leak out into the sea. This causes cells to shrivel up and die, and kills the animal. To prevent this occurring, cells produce Trimethylamine Oxide, which is basically just there to make the concentration of water the same on the inside of the cell as it is in the seawater, to prevent the animal shrivelling up. Trimethylamine Oxide is harmless and has no effect on the taste of the meat. However, when the animal dies, bacteria starts to convert TMAO into TMA, which means that the way a fish smells is a strong marker of how fresh it is. Fresh fish actually tastes a lot less fishy than old fish, because it has much less TMA in it. If you were to compare fresh fish, you'd notice that they actually have a lot of subtle differences that are usually overpowered by the TMA. I strongly recommend finding some fresh fish text time you're in a harbour town. Tastes fucking great.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just a correction, animals that live in salt water are NOT saltier than those living in fresh water. They excrete the excess salt in their urine. Otherwise the chemical balance in their cells would be lost and they would die.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For all the cooks and fisherman raging at me in the comments saying that (insert fish name here) DOES NOT taste exactly the same as (insert fish name here), I'm not saying it does. There are obviously differences. I've never lived in a coastal city so I'm sure my fish isn't super fresh. But, there is a common &quot;seafood taste&quot; that most seafood I've experienced have, which has been explained pretty well by people that have taken the time to explain it.</p>
<p>Again, not saying all seafood is the exact same, saying that most have a similarity and was asking about that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see that a lot of people here say that they don’t taste the same at all. Personally I don’t like eating any fish, shellfish or other living thing from the water. For me they all definitely have the same kind of taste in them. When I talk with others about it they don’t know what I’m talking about.</p>
<p>Could it be some biological thing? Like how some people enjoy the taste of coriander while others say that it tastes like soap.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
