		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two reasons for this, and both reasons are due to a particular chemical in most toothpastes called <em>sodium laureth</em> (or lauryl ether) <em>sulfate.</em></p>
<p>This chemical is something known as a <em>surfactant</em> -- that means it helps in producing a lather, or a foam.</p>
<p>Due to its chemical shape, it blocks your tongue from picking up sweet tastes. Due to its chemical <em>nature</em>, it breaks up fatty molecules on your tongue which mediate the pick-up of bitter flavors.</p>
<p>The one-two combination of suppressing sweet flavors and amplifying bitter ones means that orange juice, among other things, tastes really really bad until the SLS goes away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your tongue is full of very small holes. These holes are different sizes. When you eat food, the tiny bits of the food fit into different holes. What holes they fit into determine how they taste. Sweet foods fill the sweet holes, sour foods the sour holes, etc. </p>
<p>Toothpaste temporarily blocks the sweet holes so sweet foods can't get in there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure why people are talking about it affecting taste buds, sure it alters taste, mostly from the mint, but you shouldn't underestimate the role that PH plays in things. </p>
<p>Toothpaste is a base, with a PH as high as 8. Orange juice and other citrus juices are acidic with ph's as low as 3. When you mix an acid and a base together you get salts, and these salts can taste bitter. </p>
<p>I guess a good experiment to see how much of it is acid/base reactions, and how much of it is due to toothpaste altering your sense of taste would be to brush your teeth, and rinse repeatedly for several minutes until all traces of toothpaste are flushed away along with the minty taste, and then drink some OJ. </p>
<p>If it tastes normal, then toothpaste isn't changing your tastebuds temporarily and it's not due to surfactants or what not. </p>
<p>If it still tastes off then it's likely not acid/base reactions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
