		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is the classic MACHO idea. Dark matter is either &quot;Massive Compact Halo Objects&quot; (MACHOs) or &quot;Weakly Interacting Massive Particles&quot; (WIMPs).</p>
<p>There are both theoretical and observational problems with MACHOs, which is why they are essentially ruled out. The Milky Way should have maybe 10x as much mass in dark matter as in stars - so, even if each black hole is like 10x the mass of our Sun, you'd still have hundreds of billions of them around. These may not be directly visible, but their gravity should bend light a little bit. In particular, when a black hole happens to exactly line up with a background star, the black hole acts as a bit of a lens to amplify the light of the background star a little bit. This actually works for normal stars too, and we've detected a number of these &quot;microlensing&quot; events. However, if there is a huge number of black holes around, we should expect a <em>lot</em> more microlensing events. The current rate sets a limit on the abundance of MACHOs, and we don't see anywhere close to the required amount.</p>
<p>Theoretically, it's also a bit tough because dark matter can't be distributed the same as the stars, which are mostly in the disk. The dark matter gravity potential comes out very naturally if you let particles collapse into a roughly spherical configuration. But these black holes should all form from stars, which means they should all be in the disk where the stars are. To get the right gravity potential shape, you need to spread out the black holes in a weirdly artificial way - you have to invent new mechanisms for moving black holes further out. And that gets harder to explain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In order to detect matter far away, either we have to see an effect of its mass, (gravitational lensing, affecting the orbit of a visible object like a star)</p>
<p>Cold matter too diffuse to form black hole, or star, has to be illuminated by a star to see it, like nebula. </p>
<p>If it's too diffuse, not illuminated, and not affecting some thing we can see, then we have no way to detect it.</p>
<p>It's possible there are clouds of gas not detected, or detectable.</p>
<p>Clouds of neutrinos that do not intercept Earth are also going to be difficult to detect. </p>
<p>And lastly dark matter may simply not exist. It's existence is a theory to account for differences in perceived, and theoretical expansion.</p>
<p>There may be a an effect or force we aren't aware of that accounts for the difference without &quot;mysterious matter we can't detect&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
