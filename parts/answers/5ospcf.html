		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oil doesn't all come from the desert. There is a <em>lot</em> of oil in the arctic circle. Alaska has a lot of oil, as does Norway, and many places more. There's also a lot in jungle areas as well.</p>
<p>As to how it got there, well, the surface of the Earth is significantly different to how it was 500 million+ years ago. Oil, often referred to as &quot;fossil fuel&quot;, comes from fossilized plant material, animals (like dinosaurs, though little oil would actually be dinosaurs), and microbes in the oceans. While these dead things went further into the crust, the surface of the Earth changed: the climates changed, the tectonic plates moved, etc. So places like Saudi Arabia, the North Sea, Venezuela changed on the surface, but the fossil fuel was still there. </p>
<p>What you're probably confusing is that a lot of the world's oil comes from the Middle East because it is very easy (relatively speaking) to draw it to the surface, but the most of the oil in the Earth isn't <em>in</em> the Middle East.</p>
<p>Edit: and there's a lot of oil in Oceans, too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the case of oil, a special set of conditions has to apply for it to be formed and preserved in the subsurface:</p>
<ol>
<li>Source of organic matter (marine plankton/algae ➡️shale)</li>
<li>Deep burial (heat and pressure) ♨️⬇️</li>
<li>Reservoir rock (eg sandstone)?</li>
<li>3D Structure to trap migrating oil?</li>
<li>Seal to prevent it leaking out?</li>
</ol>
<p>Much of the (now) desert area of the Middle East was a stable landmass for long periods of geological time where the 5 conditions could be met, resulting the giant fields that you mentioned!
But giant fields are found in many other areas as well as offshore - they are just often more technically challenging and expensive to produce</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason middle eastern oil is so sought after is the ease of access. The oil in that region is typically found very close to the surface. Compared to other parts of the world, like the Gulf of Mexico, its practically accessible with a straw. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is actually a ton of oil in the oceans. But considering the Earths climate has changed from say 65 million years ago, those desert places could have been home to an abundance of life which over time had died and turned into oil. Also it's easier to go out drilling in the middle of no where than in the middle of a forest, since you would have to clear the environment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
