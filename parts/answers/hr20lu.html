		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The voice is a harmonic sound, meaning it produces frequencies in a harmonic series.  Lots of sounds are harmonic, so we've learned to hear the entire harmonic series as &quot;one sound&quot;, since it all probably comes from a single sound source, and the pitch is the frequency the series starts on (also called the fundamental frequency.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very few sounds have a single pitch. Maybe monotonous &quot;beeps&quot; from a computer, but that's it. Most other sounds, including by instuments and voices, are a moltitude of frequencies added together. The pitch you perceive comes from the dominant one, the strongest (loudest) in the bunch. </p>
<p>In harmonious sounds, most other frequencies are multiples of that dominating frequency. In cacophonic (bad sounding) sounds, that's not the case.</p>
<p>(This, by the way, is what makes a note from, say, a violin different from the same note from a trumpet. If a sound was just a frequency, they would be the same.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The note we hear is described as the &quot;fundamental pitch.&quot;  There are multiple overtones that sound along with the fundamental that end up giving the sound its unique timbre.  A flute sounds like a flute because it has few overtones.  A saxophone sounds like two trains crashing because it has many overtones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The pitch we perceive is <em>usually</em> the one with the most power. You can view this in a spectrogram, where the brightest lines are the perceived pitches. <em>When the harmonic series of a fundamental tone is played without that tone, we still perceive that tone because our auditory systems fill in the gap.</em></p>
<p>Edit: nope my first answer was not true, thanks for the correction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different frequencies are what gives everything &quot;timbre&quot;. I.e, it is what makes a guitar sound like a guitar, a flute a flute, and Bob like Bob. The base, root frequency is what we perceive when we hear a &quot;pitch&quot;. But it is the unique combination of harmonics on top of this frequency that makes things sound differently from each other. A pure sine wave frequency, which can be produced on a computer, sounds very robotic without any characteristic</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
