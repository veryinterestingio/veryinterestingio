		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That sugar would make it harder for the plant to uptake water and minerals. I don't believe plant roots have the proper imbedded proteins to uptake sugar. It would just sit on the soil for bacteria or something else to eat instead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Done reasonably it seems it may be beneficial to desirable insect populations and microbes. The plants don't need it and don't really seem to care. Obviously you can poison a plant with nearly anything in excess.</p>
<p>Rice seems to have better pathogen defense when treated prior to infection, so sugar water has vaccine like effects here. Interesting stuff.</p>
<p>The source of sugar doesn't really seem to matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is no, but the long answer is yes. </p>
<p>The discrepancy is an interpretation on what you are actually asking. As others have noted, putting sugar into the water source won't make the fruit sweeter, so that's why the short answer is no. But the things you put into the soil, the availability and quantity of nutrients, the microorganisms, will all alter the flavor of the final fruit.</p>
<p>Actually, one of the most common items used to make fruit sweeter is dolomitic lime. This isn't a cure-all for making sweet fruit, but soil tends towards the acidic side and many fruits grow better with a neutral pH. Also an acidic quality to the fruit certainly takes away from the perceived sweetness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are looking for a good way to sweeten a fruit put cotton seed meal on it when you plant it.  Farmers use that as a trick when they plant both fruits and vegetables because it makes the fruit both sweeter and juicer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
