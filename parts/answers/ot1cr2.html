		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>its not that batteries charge faster at lower charge.  its that they can tolerate more flow when they are empty, so we provide them more flow and then restrict the charge rate to protect the battery as it reaches full.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>think of it like filling a bucket with a hose.</p>
<p>when its empty, you can go full force, itll splash around, but itll stay in the bucket.</p>
<p>when you get close to full you have to taper it off or the splash will run over.</p>
<p>batteries as a general rule are FAR more tolerant of discharging then charging. so these attributes dont really manifest for discharging where we have to worry about moderating its power draw.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The battery doesn't &quot;drain faster&quot;, but at some point (under 10%) it can't sustain the same reaction rate, so voltage drops abruptly.</p>
<p>Check out these <a href="https://www.mpoweruk.com/performance.htm" target="_blank">battery discharge rate graphs</a></p>
<p>Modern li-ion batteries can maintain a very steady reaction rate (voltage) for most of the range from 90% to 10%. It changes with temperature and power draw (phone usage), but phones can more or less predict it to display a &quot;charge %&quot;. That all goes out the window below 10%, when voltage starts dropping faster and faster, so the phone can no longer accurately predict how much is left.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nope. They (mostly) draw power at a constant rate. And for the most part, they slow down as they approach 100% because they are programmed to do so. Fast charging at 80%+ charge is really stressful on the battery and produced a lot of heat, which really hurts the health and longevity of the battery. So software slows it down to keep the heat and &quot;pressure&quot; down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of these answers are incomplete. To answer your question: no, usage doesn't drain the battery faster when it's at lower capacity. The power draw is the power draw, and will discharge the battery at a constant rate until it's empty. The reason batteries charge slower at high capacity is a consequence of lithium battery chemistry. If they didn't charge slower at high capacity, they would be exploding left and right.</p>
<p>Lithium batteries have a maximum cell voltage of around 4.2V with some minor variations depending on chemistry. You can't exceed the maximum voltage. Ever. It's dangerous. Any lithium battery in any consumer device will have an integrated safety circuit that disconnects the battery if the voltage exceeds the max. If the max is 4.2V, it will disconnect at 4.25V. Maybe 4.3. It's a small margin.</p>
<p>When you charge a battery and inject current into it, the voltage rises. Say for the sake of argument that your &quot;fast charge&quot; current is 1 Amp. That's the most you can stuff into the battery safely. Let's also say that by giving the battery 1A, the voltage increases by 0.5V.</p>
<p>If you have a dead battery at 3.0V, the moment you start fast-charging it will be at 3.5V. As the state of charge goes up, the voltage goes up. This is what's called a constant-current mode of charging, the &quot;fast charge.&quot; That means you are controlling the current (charge rate) but not the voltage. At some point, the voltage of the battery will reach 4.2V. That's your maximum voltage. If you keep on charging at 1 A, your fast charge current, the voltage continues to rise. If you let that go uninhibited the battery will catch on fire. Guaranteed.</p>
<p>To prevent that, and to prevent exceeding the maximum allowable voltage, the charger switches to &quot;constant voltage&quot; mode. In this mode you are controlling the voltage of the charger but not the current. If you continue charging while holding the voltage constant the battery draws less and less current. At some point the current drops to a preset threshold (say 10% of your fast charge current) and at this point you stop and say that the battery is fully charged.</p>
<p>You can see this in action in a <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/articles/a-designer-guide-fast-lithium-ion-battery-charging" target="_blank">Li-Ion charge curve.</a></p>
<p>It's not accurate to say that it's just programmed in because it's stressful on the battery. That implies that we <em>could</em> do it, we just don't for longevity. That's not the case. We don't do it because we can't, because the battery chemistry doesn't support it, and because the battery will explode in flames if we tried.</p>
<p>For this reason it will <em>always</em> take longer to charge from 80%-100% than from 0%-20%, whether it's a phone, electric car, laptop, whatever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's like watering a plant. At first, if it's really dry, it's more able to absorb the water. The more the dirt gets full of water, the less quickly it can absorb. The plant uses the water at a relatively consistent rate.</p>
<p>With batteries, when empty, they're more able to slurp in all those electrons. As they fill, there's less and less chemical ability to &quot;absorb&quot; the electrons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
