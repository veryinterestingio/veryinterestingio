<p>It's a nice theory that it takes time to verify the password with an online server, but:</p>
<p>1) In 2020 that shouldn't take more than a few miliseconds. Even if you're on very bad internet. </p>
<p>2) Not all windows accounts are in the cloud. You can have a local account as well and it will show the same behaviour</p>
<p>3) This behaviour also exists in many Linux-greeters (for example the one in Ubuntu also has this delay), and here usually you won't have a password that needs to be checked by a server.</p>
<p>So now for the answer:
It's what has been mentioned before: it's to prevent people from making several guesses in a row (doesn't have to be a brute force, people can also guess manually for frequently used passwords). </p>
<p>Microsoft also claims on their blog that it's to prevent dictionary attacks, contrary to what people claim in the comments below this post.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is per design. It knows fairly quickly that you entered the wrong password. However if it just gave you the option to type the password again as soon as possible it would allow someone else to continuously guess passwords. To prevent this there is a built inn delay in the password checking so that you can not type passwords too fast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Say you use your Microsoft account to log into your computer. This lets you do stuff like change your password using your online account in case you forget it, then access your computer with the new password. </p>
<p>Well normally Windows already knows your “current” password so you can log in quickly, and log in without internet access.</p>
<p>But if you enter the wrong password, it goes online to check with Microsoft whether the one you entered was right— the computer thinks it’s wrong, but maybe you changed it, and this is actually your new password. </p>
<p>For technical reasons, it is a security risk for Microsoft to <em>transmit the password to the computer</em> so your computer can’t know if it’s changed or what it is without checking with Microsoft each time, they just respond with “right” or “wrong”. But when you’re entering a password the computer <em>already knows is right</em> — the same one you used before or one you just set on your Microsoft account— after it confirms this one is correct, it will be faster in the future.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
