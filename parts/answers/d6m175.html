		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's easiest to think of entanglement in how it's used in quantum computing: Entanglement is information that is stored not in one particle or the other, but in the <em>correlation</em> between them.</p>
<p>The classic example is one particle with 0 angular momentum creating two particles with non-zero angular momentum (called spin). We know that angular momentum must be conserved, so whatever the particles' spin are, they have to cancel each other out so that the system of them has 0 angular momentum. We can choose to measure the spin along the 'z-axis' (let's say that's vertical), and say that if the spin is counterclockwise (so angular momentum as a vector points 'up') it's a spin-up particle and if clockwise, spin-down.</p>
<p>So far if I send you one of the particles and you measure it, you'll get spin up or down with equal chance, and I haven't actually sent you any information, since it's all random. What I <em>can</em> do, is to flip my particle upside-down. I must stress here what emphatically <strong>does not happen</strong> is that your particle, half a universe away, magically flips itself over to adjust to my flipping. Your particle, as best we can measure, stays exactly the way it is. So now we know that both of our particles are spin-up or spin-down, not knowing which.</p>
<p>Now if you measure your particle you'll still get spin-up or spin-down with random chance, and you still don't actually have any information. I have to message you in some classical way (we'll say I call you on the phone to put ourselves in the mindset of the scientists first working on this problem). Let's say you measure spin up. I call you up and say I've measured spin-down. <strong><em>Now</em></strong> you know that I have not flipped my particle. Now you have information. Your information comes not in the measurement you make, or the measurement I made, but in the correlation between the two measurements.</p>
<p>There's more I can do than just flip my particle. I can rotate it 90 degrees around the X axis, or 90 degrees around the Y axis (to simplify the description here, it's a bit more mathy under the hood). Those moves encode a value called phase which we won't discuss here. The point being that the particles can be 'in-phase' or 'out-of-phase'. So I can send you a message that I've measured 'down' and 'out-of-phase' and you measure yours to be 'down' and 'in-phase' so you know which of the 4 rotations (including no rotation at all) I've performed. So you actually get two bits of information in our entangled pair of particles</p>
<p>Why all the drama for something so simple? Well it turns out, I've kept things simple using 'spin' as our entangled state. There are only 2 states 'up' or 'down'. But the message I send to you allows you to get one of 4 messages. It turns out, different quantum systems with more states allow for more message packing. If my system has 3 states, I can send 9 messages, 4 states, 16 and so on. We call this 'Dense Quantum Encoding'. Packing more bits of information into fewer particles. It also turns out that if someone intercepts either one of our lines, my results or the particle I send to you to measure, they cannot get the message I sent you. If they intercept both lines, the physical interaction they perform on the particle I send to you becomes detectable on your end, because it will destroy the entangled information. After some number of particles you can detect there's an eavesdropper, and we can shut down communications, creating a communication system very robust to 'man-in-the-middle' attacks.</p>
<p>If you are interested in what entanglement is, see above. If you'd not like to be confused by what it is not, skip what follows.</p>
<p>So obviously you've heard about all kinds of &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot; and how Einstein &quot;hated&quot; entanglement or other such popular journalism nonsense about entanglement. What's that all about then? Well let's go back to our initial problem. I stated that particles come out either spin up or spin down but we don't know which. Let's imagine that there was actually some other state, some variable we cannot measure in any way. This state encodes whether the particle &quot;really is&quot; spin up or down. Even with the examples I've provided above, flipping 90 or 180 degrees, there still isn't anything particularly peculiar yet. </p>
<p>However, if I only rotate my particle 5 degrees, what happens? Due to maths I don't wish to get into here, if this hidden variable <em>does</em> pre-determine spin up or down, and no information, not even information in this hidden sector, can travel faster than light, we would expect that the probability of measuring both particles anti-aligned (one up one down) is linearly proportional to the number of degrees rotated. 0 degrees, 100%, 180 degrees, 0%, 18 degrees, 90% and so on. However, when we actually perform this measurement, we find that the probability actually varies by the cosine of the degrees rotated, not linearly. </p>
<p>Again, due to maths I don't care to get into, this means (at least) one of our assumptions is false: maybe there's no hidden variable after all, maybe information can travel faster than light. This is the end of the scientific commentary on the subject. Since we, by definition, can't measure the hidden sector, and science is only in the business of predicting the results of experiments based on the results of previous ones, we can't scientifically go further down this road.</p>
<p>But philosophically, here's where we arrive.  Since the hidden sector is not measurable, then it doesn't create any weird time paradoxes for us to allow information to travel faster than light in that sector. No &quot;real&quot; information is faster than light, nothing we can 'really' send a message in. So some people like to believe that underneath quantum mechanics, there's some other system of 'real' variables and everything has some 'real' truth that our measurements simply tease out indirectly.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we can say that nothing else we know of can travel faster than light, we know there are problems with time paradoxes with information traveling faster than light, and so on. So maybe the thing that's wrong is the assumption that there must be some 'real' variable that tells the particle how to behave in a measurement. Maybe when the particles are created they are created in a true superposition of states. They really are both up and down at the same time, not definitively one case or the other. And when we measure we can only measure one state or the other. This, of course, leads to the question of the measurement problem in quantum mechanics: what does &quot;actually&quot; happen when we measure a superposition of states and then the particle is only in whatever state we've measured after we measure it? </p>
<p>To be clear on my bias in the last two paragraphs, I am mostly a 'shut up and calculate' physicist when it comes to the physical part of the problem. It honestly does not matter which description is true, the science of the problem tells us that we cannot have both 'realism' (hidden variables) and 'locality' (information only travels at c or slower), often called 'local realism.' If I am being philosophical, I am more in the camp of keeping locality and discarding realism. I say this not to say that I am right or you should take my opinion more seriously than someone else, only that I am likely to have biased how I worded those paragraphs in favor of the opinion I have, so take them with an appropriate grain of salt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Entanglement pertains to the fact that a single quantum wavefunction (WF) covers many particles. The WF evolves over time in a completely deterministic way, until it <em>collapses</em>, which is where the mystery of quantum mechanics happens. The entire WF collapses at the same moment, completely disregarding the expanse of space it covers.</p>
<p>When the WF collapses, it loses all of its degrees of freedom and all the particles now have a definite state &mdash; this is what we get as the observation in an experiment. Immediately after that, the WF starts its deterministic (<em>unitary</em>) evolution again.</p>
<p>If you start with the wavefunction of two isolated particles, they can come into interaction and merge into a single wavefunction &mdash; that's how the particles get entangled.</p>
<p>Do note that WF collapsing across unbounded distances at once still doesn't violate Einstein's postulate on lightspeed being the highest speed at which information can travel: say you and I are a lightyear apart and share two entangled particles (one for each). When you observe a particle, you don't actually know whether you caused the WF to collapse. You just get your measurement, which respects the rules of quantum uncertainty and randomness. When I observe mine, I get my result. Neither of us knows whose measurement caused the WF collapse.</p>
<p>Our two results are co-dependent and only certain combinations are possible; but nothing about either result in isolation is different than it would have been without entanglement. So, just by seeing the result at your end, you got no information from me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
