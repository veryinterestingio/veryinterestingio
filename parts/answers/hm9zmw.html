		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By speaking, a smaller amount of viral droplets is expelled. This might not be enough to produce an accurate result. The concentration may be too low for the disease to be detected, however it might not be too low to infect a person - remember than not that many particles are needed to start an infection.</p>
<p>Using a swab, on the other hand, basically guarantees a pristine and trustworthy sample, and it is therefore much more reliable, if a bit uncomfortable.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many occasions where you may want to diagnose a patient with early disease (viral load may come up later). A negative result with specimen obtained at the site of (presumed) highest viral load would be much more reassuring than a result obtained from a specimen collected from a less satisfactory site. </p>
<p>That said, the specimen requirement sometimes makes people avoid sampling because of the discomfort associated. At a time where people will outright refuse even masking, there probably exists a degree of compromise one can make in terms of specimen requirements to increase the uptake rate if wider testing is beneficial to epidemiological management of the disease...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A  small number of viruses can infect a person because they infect human  cells and replicate creating more viruses.  But they can't replicate  within a test kit to create more, you need to get a bigger sample to be reliably detectable than you need to infect someone.  Wouldn't want to give someone a false negative.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s because that’s where the virus is most concentrated so it reduces the likelihood of a false negative or positive. The most accurate testing requires it to be done that way, there are other tests but not as accurate.</p>
