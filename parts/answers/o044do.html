		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of this depends on what you mean by &quot;shares DNA with&quot;.</p>
<p>For example, did you know that the King James Bible and the lyrics to &quot;Baby Got Back&quot; both use exactly the same 26 letters to form their words?</p>
<p>Did you know that thr Great Gatsby and Fight Club share more than 90% of the same words, if you count each version of 'the', 'and', etc as contributing to the similarity?</p>
<p>These are pretty different things from saying &quot;these two term papers share 80% of their sentences and paragraphs, I think one was plagiarized.&quot;</p>
<p>It's super important to clarify where we draw the lines when saying &quot;98%&quot; or &quot;60%&quot; or whatever, otherwise you get weirdness like &quot;wait, scientific American says I share 98% of my DNA with monkeys, but 23andme says I only share 27% DNA with my half-brother? What the hell?&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oooh I can answer this!</p>
<p>The “humans share 50% of DNA with a banana” factoid is a bit misleading—it’s based on the <del>number of</del> <em><del>genes</del></em> <del>we share with the banana plant</del>  <strong>average percent similarity between our amino acid sequences</strong>, not the total number of base pairs that are identical. I do not know what percent of DNA we actually share with bananas, but for other plant species it’s more like 10-15%.</p>
<p><a href="https://lab.dessimoz.org/blog/2020/12/08/human-banana-orthologs" target="_blank">Here is a nice breakdown of the accuracy of the &quot;50% banana&quot; statement.</a></p>
<p>The “percent relatedness” statistics you hear about are not all calculated in the same way. Some, like the banana plant fact, are based on amino acid sequences. Some are based on numbers of similar genes. Some are based on the similarity of the “exome,” or the DNA that is actually expressed as genes (which is only a small fraction of our DNA). And others are based on whole genomes. We share about 98% of our entire genome with chimpanzees, for instance, but previous studies also placed that number at 95% because they were doing a different calculation.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.23andme.com/23andme-and-you/genetics-101/genetic-similarities-of-mice-and-men/" target="_blank">Here is a short 23andMe post on human relatedness to other species</a> <strong>that compares number of genes</strong> that are similar--note the difference in percentages! 44% for fruit flies, 18% for plants, 92% for mouse, etc.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-does-the-fact-that-w/" target="_blank">Here is an example</a> of a time when our &quot;percent relatedness&quot; to chimpanzees seemed to change from 98% to 95% due to a study (circa 2004) that used different methods. Compare that to <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/tiny-genetic-differences-between-humans-and-other-primates-pervade-the-genome/" target="_blank">a more recent article</a> from the same source (2014) that revises the number back to \~99%.</p>
<p>I've done the whole genome comparison between humans and chimps myself (not from scratch though lol) and can confirm that it comes out to around 98% :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of this way.</p>
<p>All life on Earth shares a common ancestor depending on how far you go back. DNA is an instruction book on how to build life. At some point in past plants and animals had a single simple ancestor with DNA that had instructions for how to make that life. The 40%. This is the stuff we share with plants.</p>
<p>Now two members of this ancestor evolved down different paths one became plants and the other animals as this happens their instructions got more complicated but they don’t just throw out the 40% they share they build on top of.</p>
<p>This branching happens again and again during evolution but the closer (in time) the branch of two species the more DNA they share as they’ve not had time to diverge as much. Plants and Animals diverged a long time ago where as humans and Chimps diverged only minutes ago in evolutionary terms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
