		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A gas engine is only efficient at a certain rpm range. Outside that specific range of speeds it loses power rapidly. So gearing let's the motor stay in its sweet spot over a larger range of speeds. </p>
<p>Electric motors do not have this problem. They basically push as hard as tge amount of electricity you run through them regardless of what speed they are spinning at. The trick there is controlling the electricity to make that true ... and we have very awesome computers to control the power flow nowadays.</p>
<p>That having been said... the faster an electric motor is spinning the harder it is to push more power into it. One solution to that could be a transmission but in practice it is easier just to raise the voltage of the battery so you can push harder. Modern EVs are running on 408V batteries for the traction motor. :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a big thing to keep in mind: Transmissions require energy to work. </p>
<p>It's called a &quot;parasitic loss&quot;, the friction of gears/lubricant/bearings etc. results in around 10-20% of the motor's energy not making it to the tires because it's turned to heat by friction.</p>
<p>Single-gear drives are as efficient as possible. Since the motor has the low-end torque to accelerate with ease, and the high-end RPM to handle highway speed and beyond with ease, there's nothing to be gained.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
