<p>If you burn your hand on the stove, the first (kinda shocky) pain is the fast signal. The second pain (the more qualitative one) is the slower but longer acting signal/neuron.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! To be clear, I'm not 100% sure because, stunningly, I've never specifically conducted research into this! But here's my best educated guess, as someone who works in neurology.</p>
<hr />
<p>Signals in your brain have wires (nerves) that they can travel down, but not all wires are created equal. For complicated reasons involving how our nerves generate electricity, <em>insulated</em> nerves conduct faster signals than uninsulated ones.</p>
<p>Pain is carried along a kind of nerve called the &quot;type C&quot; nerve - basically, it's a &quot;thin&quot; nerve that doesn't carry much signal and doesn't carry it very fast. It's uninsulated, so it's pretty slow, and it's also got a limited bandwidth - if your brain is downloading pain, it can't download too much at once through that nerve. It's a kind of gatekeeping mechanism that prevents us getting 100% overloaded with pain immediately. </p>
<p>Type C nerves also don't have a very high priority. We receive a lot of signals, and type C is pretty far down the list of what the brain cares about because... well, pain is BAD. We need it because it keeps us alive (if you didn't know pain was bad, you wouldn't know injury was bad), but it also distracts us and makes us stupid. So other kinds of signals, like &quot;where am I&quot; signals and &quot;what am I&quot; signals and &quot;what temperature am I&quot; signals are all given higher priority, travelling on physically <em>faster</em>, higher-bandwidth cables that get connected directly to your brain's &quot;router&quot;, rather than having to run through three different servers and connect via metaphorical VPN in Portugal. </p>
<p><strong>When you're hit by something,</strong> lots of signals are sent all at once. Many of those are pain, but a lot of the others are signals like <em>&quot;proprioceptive&quot;</em> signals, which are the kind of signal that tell your body-parts where they are in space. You know how you can close your eyes and still touch your nose with your finger? That's called <em>proprioception</em>, and it has VERY high priority! It's a very important thing: if you're in pain because something near you is hurting you, then you need to be able to <em>move away from it</em> in order to not get damaged. This isn't possible if you don't know where your limbs are in space, and so proprioception is a physically faster, &quot;stronger&quot; signal than pain is. It hits your brain first, gets processed faster, and its bandwidth is very high so it can &quot;push out&quot; pain signals if there's a lot going on. You know how, when you rock back and forth, your stomachache doesn't feel so bad? That's because rocking back and forth generates lots of high-bandwidth &quot;where am I&quot; signals, which means there's not much brainspace left to think about your tummy pain. </p>
<p><strong>In a car accident,</strong> you'd have a lot of signals. To give four examples, in priority order as your brain cares about them, they could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Where are my body-parts in space?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;What kind of touch am I receiving?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Am I on fire?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;This hurts!&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>And lots of others. As you'll see, &quot;this hurts!&quot; is very far down the list! Pain is.. ignorable. Your body can forget about it for a while because it has physically got <em>no more bandwidth left</em>. </p>
<p>Once your body stops moving, though, all that bandwidth gets cleared away and suddenly <strong>BOOM</strong> pain all the time because now it can TELL YOU that it's there.</p>
<hr />
<p>Edit for people who care: yes, there's also other kinds of pain that travel on the much faster A&delta; nerves, but for this situation we're concerned mostly with the slow &quot;thuddy&quot; pain which travels along C nerves. C nerve pain is generally more overwhelming, especially as there's physically many more of them and they share less with other signals. A&delta; nerves are a little more complicated but this same explanation applies, bandwidth limitations (technically &quot;thalamic gating&quot; if you're interested) intentionally put in place to prevent cortical overload during painful situations. There's also obviously an impact from adrenaline, but that doesn't happen immediately. As a hormone, adrenaline takes a fair amount of time (a countable number of seconds) between secretion into the blood from the adrenal cortex above the kidney, travelling through the body, and impacting your brain and muscles and other gooey parts. That time delay is too significant to explain the effect as OP observes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Pain measures damage which happens as cells “break” and communicate this to nearby nerves. The two step system takes a second.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
