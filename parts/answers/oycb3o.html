		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Real estate agents used to be important back before the internet. When they listed a home for sale it went in a book and cataloged. It was quite the process. But now with the internet it has made it easier for buyers and sellers to see what the market is doing. Until recently, at least in my area, realtors were the only ones with access to sale prices. So the homeowner couldn’t see what a house sold for to judge what they could get for their house, they only had the neighborhood gossip. The real estate board fought tooth and nail to keep that information secret but the government forced them to provide that information to the public. A good realtor now a days has photographers, YouTube, and social media marketing to reach as many people as possible to see your home and home stagers to make your home look top notch.You can totally sell your own home privately if you’d like but some of the top agents have a large swath of influence online and more people can see your home increasing the likelyhood that you’ll get a better offer on your property. As for the contract (agreement of purchase and sale) and negotiations, the realtor always pushes what you want. It takes the stress of negotiation directly with a buyer off your plate. So they do add value to selling your home. Now in my area commissions are 4-5% of the sale price. I just sold my house, used a realtor and had to pay 56k after tax for their services. In my opinion they get paid way too much. My house sold in 5 days. And we told her what to do. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've bought multiple houses WITHOUT using a realtor, and in all cases I got huge decreases in cost. Used a real estate lawyer, paid by the hour, to check over the paperwork. Organized and executed the inspections myself. </p>
<p>It's not that hard at all. Real estate agents are vastly overpaid for basic home sale transactions, IMO.</p>
<p>Hence why companies like Redfin are doing extremely well nowadays.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Having bought and sold several homes with and without realtors over the years, I would suggest first-time home buyers and perhaps buyers in a new city/market go with a realtor, to leverage knowledge and networks. By that I mean you can take advantage of their knowledge of which neighborhoods are desirable, which communities offer the amenities that are important to you, and maybe which contractors and home inspectors you can use, provided they offer you a variety of options for each and aren’t just getting kickbacks from the contractors for referrals. </p>
<p>Beyond that, the internet really seemed to make realtors obsolete for us. And I watched that shift happen in real time. I was able to pull comparable homes and recent sales in my market and figure out what the average price per square foot and level of finish was. I hired a real estate attorney to help negotiate contracts and offers, and after getting hooked up with or finding my own home inspectors and contractors that I trusted, I was able to navigate those aspects as a buyer and seller myself. </p>
<p>Before the internet easily offered the tools to price and market your home as a seller and find listings as a buyer, realtors were essential. Now, their utility is far more limited.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my recent personal experience, on the buying side though, my agent was invaluable in helping us understand the market, where to position ourselves during the offer, which things to concede during the offer that look good/are worthwhile to the seller but don't impact us much. She was incredibly helpful for understanding the whole process.</p>
<p>I imagine on the selling side it's a similar situation, how to position the listing, advise on quick cheap fixes to make it sell for more.</p>
<p>Also remember you will do this a few times in your life, they do it daily, find yourself a good agent and leverage them and their experience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
