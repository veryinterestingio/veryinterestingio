		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A bunch of photons of a certain wavelength come out of the sun directly toward us, but they hit some atoms, get absorbed and emitted again in all directions. 40% of them go back into the sun and the others get shot off in other directions. Often into other atoms.</p>
<p>As they bounce around they change energy until they aren't in that part of the spectrum anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you start with a black body spectrum and your gas around the sun has 1 absorption line for simplicity. In a second, your star emits 100 photons of the frequency that will be absorbed by the absorption spectrum. All 100 of these are re-emitted in a random direction. 50 of these go back into the black body and 50 are lost into space.</p>
<p>I think your misconception is that the 50 that go back into the star preserve their wavelength and so the light that emitted from the blackbody is black-body + the 50 photons that went back in. This would mean your black body no longer had a black body spectrum anymore.</p>
<p>In reality the photons that go back into the star undergo many scattering cycles before coming out again (the definition of a black body) and so their frequency information is lost.</p>
<p>So effectively, the 'missing photons' that you are looking for are reabsorbed by the star and emitted at different frequencies.</p>
<p>(Obviously this grossly oversimplifies the process as a hot blackbody and a cold gas rather than a continuous temperature gradient, but hopefully the physics is still correct!)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whether you get an absorption or emission spectrum depends on the physics of how the light is produced. Low density environments (eg- nebulae or the stellar corona) give rise to emission spectra. Most of the light from a star comes from the photosphere, and that higher density environment gives rise to an absorption spectrum. This is the basically correct version that is taught to descriptive astronomy students.</p>
<p>If you want a more quantitative explanation, you have to consider the equation of radiative transfer. Stellar spectroscopists use computer codes to model the spectrum emerging from the photosphere. They do this by solving the radiative transfer equation under simplifying assumptions like local thermodynamic equilibrium and a plane-parallel atmospheric model. Here is the equation on wikipedia:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_transfer" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative\_transfer" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative\_transfer</a></a></p>
<p>I remember studying this thing in detail when I was in grad school, but that was a long time ago so my memory is hazy. That said, if you scroll down there is a section on solutions to the equation showing a term for emission and one for absorption. You get absorption lines when the absorption term dominates and emission (continuum) elsewhere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Couple of issues here: Lets start with the first misconception.   </p>
<p>The idea that the same color wavelength is absorbed and then reemitted is actually a misconception that is an unfortunate consequence of how fluorescence is taught. It is only true in a perfect vacuum, similar to how most early physics lessons are taught without friction being involved.  </p>
<p>In practice, the emitted light ends up at a different color than the absorption. There are however scattering events that don't change the wavelength. This is in more details at the end.   </p>
<p>Second issue: </p>
<p>It is actually really really hard to get light from different sources to cancel out. Especially if they are not lasers. To cancel out, the phases would have to be exactly 180 from each other and they would have to be the same intensity. Cancelation events happen more with a single light source that gets split and recombined, and even then the light its self isn't &quot;gone&quot;, rather some other part of the light beam has been doubled in intensity somewhere else.  For example, you might cancel out the light going through a material, only to end up with the reflected light from the same surface doubling.    </p>
<p>A  more detailed explanation of the first point.   </p>
<p>A simply absorption - fluorescence event looks like the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>excitation</li>
<li>solvent relaxation of excited state energy.*</li>
<li>emission to solvent modified ground state</li>
<li>solvent relaxation of ground state energy back to original ground state.*</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the absorption and emission have different energies. Even though the &quot;same&quot; two orbitals are involved, they have different energies due to the solvent stabilization being different for excited state verses ground state.</p>
<p>In words that looks like the following:</p>
<p>Excitation from the ground state excites to an excited state. Note that the excited state has a different distribution of electrons around the molecule, which can change its dipole moment. The solvent around the excited molecule reacts to this change and reorients to lower the energy of the excited state slightly. It then emits to the ground state of this altered solvent configuration. Once in the ground state, the solvent rearranges again, to return to the original ground state. The result is the emission is redshifted from the absorption, and the missing energy is turned into heat of the solvent.</p>
<p>* I've left off vibrational and rotational relaxation, which can also take place at the same spot as the solvent relaxation steps. There's also a whole mess of excited state energy transfers to other molecules and such that are possible as well as none radiative emission back to ground state.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
