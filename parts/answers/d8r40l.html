<p>Your skin is thickest on your back over your spinal cord.  You don't need much flexibility of skin or sensitivity there and thicker skin protects your spine.</p>
<p>Your  fingers have thin skin so they can bend easily.</p>
<p>Your head has a skull and uses a lot of blood.  So your skin is thin because it does not need to protect your skull and it lets heat escape more easily.  </p>
<p>Oil protects your skin from drying out and cracking.  The thin skin on your face needs extra oil to protect it because it is thin and exposed.   Your nose in particular.   Whereas the top of your head and much of your body had hair or clothes to protect it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
