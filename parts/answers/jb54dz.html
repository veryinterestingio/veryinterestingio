<p>They grow from the inside. Basically - the white starchy goodness inside slowly expands over time (or rather, builds up, and ripens), and their skin expands along with it.</p>
<p>Just like Apples, Oranges, and Human flesh bags.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Young potatoes don't have &quot;skin&quot; on the outside.  Older (larger) potatoes will have thier skin when dug up, but it's so thin you can wash it off with a good rinse/scrub.  The skin doesn't &quot;set&quot; until the plant dies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Potatoes, like carrots, are whats called â€žstorage rootsâ€œ. So they ultimately are structured like roots with a central cylinder for transport with the motherplant and outer layers for water absorption and storage. The storage part is enlarged in potatoes through selective breeding etc. Between the central cylinder and the outer rings is a ring of cells that can multiply. Thats where the growth of the outer rings happens. Inside the central cylinder is another ring that can multiply the specific cells inside that cylinder. And then there is a third on that keeps renewing the shell/skin as it rips and tears bc of the growth from below.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
