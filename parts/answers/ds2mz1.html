		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. People who are bored easily and aren't given anything to do will often either get depressed or get into trouble. Animals are similar - while it may be harder to tell when an animal is depressed on the outside, we can measure their health, and measure an increase in aggressive behavior. Animals that have more things to do (read: aren't bored) are healthier, live longer, and show fewer bad behaviors. This is why modern zoos are putting a lot more focus into &quot;enrichment activities&quot; for their animals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes they do. This can actually be an issue at zoos, with animals exhibiting loss of appetite and activity.</p>
<p>Boredom can spiral into depression and there are antidepressants for dogs to curb such activity like scratching themselves until they bleed.</p>
<p>Humans are not the only mammals that experience boredom.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. And we have used it in our studies on how addiction works. Rats will literally overdose on drugs if bored. If they have other options, like socialization, sex or exercise, they prefer the water to the drugs.    <a href="https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/substance-use-disorder/what-does-rat-park-teach-us-about-addiction" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/substance-use-disorder/what-does-rat-park-teach-us-about-addiction" target="_blank">https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/substance-use-disorder/what-does-rat-park-teach-us-about-addiction</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
