These may take a while to turn back on when you wake up, varying between people and which stage of sleep you woke up from (as others have pointed out, called 'sleep inertia').</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its to do with how well your Central Nervous System is functioning. Usually when we first wake up, youre quite tired, and feel sluggish, and thats due to your CNS. But this isnt always the case, if you have a hand gripper nearby, you can give it a little squeeze to test your grip, and that is a good indicator on how well your CNS is functioning at the moment</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have this sometimes. I always figured it was from one of two neuromuscular disorders in my family, one of which I have been tested for and confirmed to have,  and my neurologist has been content with that idea.</p>
