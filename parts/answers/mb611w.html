		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a 9 year massage therapist and would consider myself very knowledgable on the topic. </p>
<p>There are a ton of different reasons a “knot” can occur as listed by others “dehydration, malnutrition, poor body mechanics, injury, etc” but those explanations don’t speak to what it really is.</p>
<p>The term knot is very vague and really just speaks to a nonuniform texture in the tissues. The knot itself will tend to be either hypertonic (overly toned) or hypotonic (underly toned). The first tends to be bulky feeling tissue, the later can sometimes feel stringy like guitar strings”. But the symptom of the knots existence doesn’t speak to its cause.</p>
<p>Blatantly put, regular massage mostly just assists the painful feeling of the “knot” by scrambling nervous system signals (look up pain gate theory), but it doesn’t actually fix the underlying coordination pattern that caused the knot.</p>
<p>Fun facts is that the entire story of massage relieving muscles via release of lactic acid is completely false.</p>
<p>I could go on a long time but the ELI5 part is this: the body behaves like a sheet spread over a picnic table. When one end gets bunched (the knot), it steals space from the rest of the cloth so it’s not centered on the table anymore. Our body only has so many physical, mental, and emotional resources that are intimately intertwined. We regulate energy between these systems to complete the work we need done. Sometimes when our energy becomes too imbalanced an area will lose its ability to engage (stringy hypotonic knot that spasms) or it will gain too much energy (bulky cramping knot). It’s almost like in Star Trek when they say “put energy into forward shields”. When they do that there is less energy in the shields elsewhere. This is when “knots” start to appear for the purpose of maintaining as much balance as possible in the system. Hope that helps</p>
<p>Edit: cool thanks for my first award.</p>
<p>Edit: if anyone has questions they can inbox me and I can try to explain more, might take a little while to respond.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
