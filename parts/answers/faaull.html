		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>E=mc^2 is for massive stationary objects. The full equation is</p>
<p>E^(2)=p^(2)c^(2)+m^(2)c^(4)</p>
<p>where p is momentum. Note that p=mv is not a universal law either - it's only true for massive objects at low speed. Massless photons can have momentum! You can see this by setting m=0, because photons are massless, which gives you:</p>
<p>E^(2)=p^(2)c^(2)</p>
<p>E=pc (and p=E/c)</p>
<p>So photons have energy and momentum, and they're proportional to each other - by a factor of the speed of light. (Similarly if you set p=0, you get E=mc^(2) out again)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's another equation for energy in quantum mechanics: E = hf, with h being Planck's constant and f being the frequency of the light. That's typically how we talk about photon energy.</p>
<p>The Einstein relation also shows it has energy due to its momentum: E^2 = p^(2)c^(2) + m^(2)c^(4), with m being 0 for a photon. The quantum momentum relation is p = h/位 with 位 being the wavelength. The units we typically use for photon momentum are things like eV*s/nm, since wavelengths are usually on the nm-scale. (Note there's no mass involved in the quantum momentum discussion.)</p>
<p>With the Einstein relation, we can see (hf)^2 = (h/位)^(2)c^(2), which rearranges to c = 位f which is a well known wave relationship between the wave's speed, wavelength, and frequency, in this case for a light wave.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The full equation is</p>
<p>E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m_0^2 c^4</p>
<p>Photons, like all massless particles, have energy and momentum related by E=pc (p is momentum).</p>
<p>Massive particles have an extra term in the relationship between energy and momentum.</p>
<p>Note that m_0 is the /rest mass/.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The important thing to note here is <em>what</em> E = mc^2 describes. It's a relationship between an object's energy <em>in its rest frame</em> and its mass. This doesn't work for photons as they have no rest frame.</p>
<p>You would have also run into issues with throwing an object and claiming its mass has increased because of E = mc^2 . But the mass does not increase, you're just using E to describe a different thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
