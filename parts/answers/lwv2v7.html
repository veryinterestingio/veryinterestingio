		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Someone mentioned the flu shot and I realized no one (unless I missed one) has mentioned the most obvious reason there isn’t a human salmonella vaccine. </p>
<p>Salmonella can technically be transmitted between people, but that only accounts for around 5% of infections. Which means individual people getting it isn’t a community health issue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's complicated. The vaccine targeting chickens is primarily an effort to reduce food-borne disease in humans, and it does that pretty effectively. So, we target the source as a means of prevention rather than targeting humans directly. Easier and generally safer. Bacterial vaccines are generally short-lived (6-12mos), so they work fine for short-lived poultry, but would be harder to repeatedly use in humans. </p>
<p>If there were a market for that vaccine in humans, we'd already be there. The fact we don't have one for people in common usage suggests:</p>
<p>1) not enough people are affected</p>
<p>2) not enough people with significant influence are affected</p>
<p>3) the costs of establishing and giving the vaccine outweigh the costs of the disease itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>40ish years ago I was in Vet school.  Learned we had a salmonella vaccine for chickens but nobody in the US used it.  Cost 48 cents a bird.  Same thing for care.  Bird gets sick, wring it’s neck.   Not worth the money.  Eventually dropped out of it and switched to computers.  Small animal wasn’t really a thing then yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We do have a type of salmonella vaccine for humans, the typhoid vaccine! The typhoid vaccine covers the causative bacteria Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhi. It’s 30-70% effective in the first 2 years following being administered. There’s a TON of different strains of salmonella though, so I would assume that plays a major role in why we don’t just have a “salmonella vaccine” in humans...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Salmonella is (a small) part of normal gut flora, which tends to be delicately balanced. I'm assuming a vaccine would disrupt the proportions of gut flora.</p>
<p>The prevalence/severity/duration of the infection likely aren't worth the years of work and research and cost of getting a vaccine to market.</p>
<p>Chickens probably require a much smaller dose than humans would and don't live long enough to require any further doses. So much more financially viable to mass vaccinate chickens I guess.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
