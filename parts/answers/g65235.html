		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably the most research about seasonal viruses is based on flu viruses but this same trend holds true for many other respiratory viruses.</p>
<p>Although Flu is regarded as seasonal, flu cases happen year-round, they just seem to nearly always peak in December to February. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season/flu-season.htm" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season/flu-season.htm" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season/flu-season.htm</a></a></p>
<p>The reason for this peak isnt fully understood, but generally its seen that cooler and dryer (lower humidity) conditions favor transmission of the virus.</p>
<p>In this study they showed that in a guinea pig model lower humidity and temperature not only allowed for increased spreading of the virus via aerosols, but the guinea pigs themselves also shed more virus for longer periods of time.</p>
<p><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article%3Fid%3D10.1371/journal.ppat.0030151" target="_blank"><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article%3Fid%3D10.1371/journal.ppat.0030151" target="_blank">https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article%3Fid%3D10.1371/journal.ppat.0030151</a></a></p>
<p>There are also other theories regarding human behavior, i.e travel patterns, more crowding indoors when temperatures are lower etc that may also contribute to the seasonality of these viruses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the work has been done on influenza, even though several other viruses are almost equally strongly seasonal.  It’s generally assumed that the reasons for seasonality are the same, but it’s not certain. </p>
<p>For influenza, there are lots of explanations, but it's still not completely clear which of them is most right.  (Probably, as with most biology, there are many different reasons adding up.) Some of the reasons put forward are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Host health.  People are more susceptible to infection in winter (stress, dry noses, whatever).</li>
<li>Host sociology. People are more packed together in winter (more indoors; school season) and the virus is better transmitted</li>
<li>Host immunity. People's immune system may be tuned to photoperiod</li>
<li>Host nutrition. Fluctuations in vitamin D, C, and E, and selenium in diets have all been suggested</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these are more convincing than others (I'm pretty skeptical about nutrition in particular). One of the most convincing explanations is </p>
<ul>
<li>Absolute humidity. Experimentally, the influenza virus is much more  stable and capable of transmission in a fairly narrow range of absolute (not relative) humidity, and there are some groups who say they can predict influenza outbreaks based on absolute humidity.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's more complicated than humidity alone, since flu still can transmit in tropical regions where it is less seasonal or not seasonal at all, but in temperate climates it's probably a strong influence.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of the reason is the lipid bilayer that surrounds some viruses. Lipids are oil/fat based, and firmer in colder temperatures. The lipid bilayer is also known as the viral envelope. It protects the virus. This is why washing your hands with soap and water is so important, soap destroys the lipid bilayer because it has both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. </p>
<p>In warmer weather, the lipid bilayer is weaker than in colder weather, so viruses may not be able to survive on surfaces as long as they could in colder weather. The longer a virus can survive on a surface, the higher the risk of transmission.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't appear to be settled in terms of the fact that there are unexplained contradictions, but relative humidity plays a roll in the viability of many viruses.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3457514/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3457514/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3457514/</a></a></p>
<p>This article expounds that part of the issue is that airborne/aerosolized viruses travel between hosts much more efficiently, as well as the fact that various cells that help expel or defend from viruses do not work as well in the dry air that is common during the colder months indoors.</p>
