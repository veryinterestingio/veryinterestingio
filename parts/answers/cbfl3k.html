		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bones grow via areas of the bones that start off as cartilage and proceed to lengthen/enlarge and then ossify (turn to bone) as you age. You may have heard of fractures in kids being especially troubling if they break in areas where the &quot;growth plate&quot; is for this reason. It's also why kids are more resistant to impact than adults -- their bones are significantly more flexible because they aren't entirely bone yet.</p>
<p>Other bones do not even exist when we're infants and derive entirely from cartilage as we age, especially the carpals/tarsals (hand/foot bones). <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=pediatric+x-ray+foot&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA822CA822&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwip4J7GrarjAhWOGs0KHZwpDnUQ_AUIECgB&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=975" target="_blank">You can see that in x-rays of children's feet where it looks like a lot of the bones are floating.</a></p>
<p>I'll let others cover other elements of your question. But the general idea is the bones grow in a specific pattern in these cartilage areas, the soft tissues accommodate, and when you stop growing the cartilage areas become bone completely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s a little bit of both, and also a little bit of we don’t know. </p>
<p>Muscle, bone, and skin are all made of smaller units, cells. For this example, think of cells as little balls with a puzzle piece attached.</p>
<p>There are signaling molecules that send cells messages. Think of signaling molecules as puzzle pieces that fit perfectly into the ones on the cells, and when they link up, it sends the cell a message to do something. </p>
<p>When something like a limb first starts growing, there are signaling molecules that tell all those cells to start growing out. </p>
<p>There are also signaling molecules that the muscles cells send to the bone cells (and all the tissue types send to each other) that tell each other where they are. </p>
<p>There are so many tissue types - not just muscle and bone, but also tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, and more that all have to coordinate with each other to get to the form we see in adults. Truth be told, we don’t know all the details of how this works but it’s my favorite thing to talk about (and the subject of my research) so I’m happy to answer any additional questions- at the ELI5 level or higher.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Muscle and bone might grow at very similar rates but skin doesn't to the same extent. When I went through my growth spurt my legs became a lot longer over the period of a few months, I had the occasional pain on my knees and had plenty of stretch marks.</p>
<p>In short, our genetic material provides the information for a growth rate. However, there are plenty of factors that influence when and how much we grow like diet and environmental issues, chemical levels throughout our body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The separate systems do not grow in perfect sync.  For ease of understanding, we will subdivide everything were talking about into two different systems.  Bone or hard tissue, and soft tissue, which is essentially everything else (tendon, ligament, cartilage, skin).  Bone tends at young age to be the big player, as the soft tissue will grow in response to the bone lengthening.  Bone can grow very fast, and this is the new concepts on &quot;growing pains&quot;  bone lengthens at a rate of 3 inches over 6 months, and soft tissue races to keep up.  Growing pains occur in soft tissue playing catch up, feeling similar to a sprain strain, feeling substantially better with rest, and hurting the next day with activity.  </p>
<p>On a side note, this can also help in understanding some of the challenges in taking steroids as an athlete.  Your muscle will grown very fast under these hormones, but your tendons and ligaments do not grow as fast, this leads to a catastrophic muscle tear (typically at the tendon attachment).  I am not saying this is always the case, but when you see a high level muscle bound individual tear a pec/hamstring/bicep on a really heavy lift, they were likely mid cycle on a bout of steroids.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don’t necessarily grow at the same rate.  Stretch marks are very common around joints when growth spurts happen.  The bone and muscles may grow faster than the skin can expand to fit them, and tears happen in the skin.  Knees, hips, shoulders where the pectorals insert, these are spots where I personally have stretch marks from my growth spurts as a teen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
