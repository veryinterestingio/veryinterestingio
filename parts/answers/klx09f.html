		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work on a submarine base. I can confirm, unfortunately, that when a sailor dies while underway (at sea) they bag the body, stash it in the freezer, and then get to port ASAP where they might not even stay any longer than it takes to offload the remains. Thankfully I've only ever had to be part of that once, but even that was more than enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
