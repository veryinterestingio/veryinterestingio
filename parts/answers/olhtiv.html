		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unless the structures are really short, thermal expansion and contraction will be far more important over the life of the structure. What's actually worse is transform boundaries, where the sideways movement can create 'kinks' over time. The only solution there is to build the structure to bend as smoothly as possible for as long as possible then rebuild every few decades. </p>
<p>Here's a quote I found on Wikipedia about the Berkeley hills tunnel in the SF bay area, which crosses a transform fault. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>By 2017, cumulative minor damage from fault creep had significantly reduced the tunnel's cross section, to the point where BART determined it was necessary to plan for repair and mitigation against future creep.[4] The work, which includes excavating the tunnel walls and realigning the tracks, is expected to cost $60 million.[5]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dug in 1967, so that's 50 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't say how much movement occurs at continental plates, but we engineer pretty much all structures, especially linear structures like bridges, to include joints that allow for expansion and contraction for temperature and other factors. Even a temperature swing of 100 degrees F can generate enormous internal forces that can tear a structure apart (A 100' long piece of steel will grow/shrink about 3/4&quot; over a 100 degree F temperature swing)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You need to check out a bridge in Parkfield California. It's a short bridge across a small creek but it sits across the section of the San Andreas fault which is creeping. The bridge is gradually shearing under the movement. It's pretty cool. If you look across the bridge you can see it's bending.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m pretty sure your concern about pulling apart is only a concern at the Red Sea rift, the other boundaries are in the middle of oceans or not expansion type. The red sea expands at 1cm/yr and I can only find one proposed bridge 5km <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_of_the_Horns" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_of_the_Horns</a></p>
<p>I think the engineers signing off on the safety of the bridge would have to ensure expansion tolerance of whatever arbitrary amount the countries agree to such as 65yr = 65cm before refurbishment, and then refurbishment works would proceed to expand the land connections (or over the rift, not sure) and certify another refurbishment period until the cost of refurbishment exceeds the value of the land connection and they demolish the structure.</p>
<p>The answer is boring paperwork and more construction solves stuff like this in practice</p>
<p>Edit: interesting note, to achieve tolerances for expansion in the first place you have to build it with the concrete span compressed. Every year you can tighten the nuts and bolts of your bridge and basically apply more compression and counter the 1cm expansion until you run out of threads. If you were on a boundary that was stressing the bridge with shear forces (sideway plate movement) I’m sure a different set of considerations would be needed</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Which constructions are you thinking about?  I don't think we have any constructions spanning separating continents, so no-one has made systems to endure continual expansion-and-offset of foundations.</p>
<p>The plate-spreading continental boundary is just the Americas to Europe+Africa.  Other boundaries are currently convergent.</p>
<p>Thinking more broadly, there are current continental convergences between Africa-Eurasia and India-Eurasia where we do build things (Nepal, Iran, Greece...).  In these cases, the fact that continental plates deform across disparate faults (such that the overall slow deformation occurs in small discrete motions on a local level) means that most bridges and roads don't see disruption.  ie. Events like <a href="https://scedc.caltech.edu/graphics/earthquake/landers1992e.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> (CA, Landers 1992) are rare and you rebuild when they happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
