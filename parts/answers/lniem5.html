		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5:
What causes this? Brain. You can think of it as responsive sympathetic reflexes.
Why it is your stomach? 1- Because blood is being taken away from your stomach to you skeletal muscles. 2- Vagus nerve.
Why it happens so instantly? Again, Vagus nerve. </p>
<p>Not ELI5:
Since Vagus innervates GIT, Heart, Bronchial tree, Intestines and ascending and transverse 2/3rd of large intestine, stimulated Vagus can cause pretty much all of it instantly.
Other conditions that might occur to compliment the “drop feeling” may include: Tachycardia (Increased heart rate), Tachypnea (Higher breathing rate), Xerostomia (Lack of salivation) and Bronchodilation (Dilation of bronchus, causes Increased air flow to the lungs).</p>
