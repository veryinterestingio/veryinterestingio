		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a dark room, our pupils dilate to let in more light so we can see better. Pupils also constrict in a bright room to help cut down the amount of light going to the retina. If you go from a dark room to a light room, your dilated pupils let in a large amount of light which damages the retina because of how sensitive they are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it is quite literally hurting you.</p>
<p>Having too much light hit your retina will damage it, so your body uses one of the few communication channels it has to your consciousness - pain - to tell you that &quot;bright light bad&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I dunno if i would call it exactly as pain..it's feels more of like a natural response of our body to close our eyes when bright light is concentrated at it.. just like gaging is a natural response. </p>
<p>I have a fascination with the sun and I certainly did not have any pain when i used to look directly at it for 5 to 10 seconds when i was a kid.. you do start seeing with weird colors and it's like a whole different world though. </p>
<p>I'm not encouraging anyone to do it unless you want permanent eye damage but that's one of my experiences of bright light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simply there is a ton of energy in light,  ever held a magnefying glass focussed on some dry grass under the sun?  Now obviously that is the extreme case,  but this is what is happening in your eye through it's own lens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
