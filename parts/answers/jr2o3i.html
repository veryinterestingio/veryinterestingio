		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, itâ€™s not ready for the public. The data we just received is internal Pfizer data, which is likely robust and reliable but requires peer review from independent scientists and approval by the FDA.</p>
<p>If all goes according to plan, the first few million vaccines will be distributed to highest priority individuals in December.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Apparently the requirements by EU authorities are less strict thanks to the outbreak.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just want to be clear that this is absolutely untrue. The German health minister again confirmed today that the standards were not lowered in any way, it's just that the approval board is being sent the data as the study progresses instead of in bulk at the end of the study to speed up the approval. This might make it seem like the requirements are less, even though they aren't.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/JeCbW05fxbU" target="_blank">Link</a> to the press conference. Relevant part at and around 15:44. In German.</p>
<p>This is dangerous misinformation that could hurt people's willingness to take the vaccine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Needs more testing but the initial results are extremely promising. They looked at people who got sick who participated and 90% of them had the placebo. They want to get a larger sample now and the research needs to be peer reviewed but they're trying to emergency approve it with the FDA now</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
