		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s hard to know for sure. We don’t have a solid count for how many genes humans have to start with because there is some discussion about what counts as a gene, and not all sequences that could be considered a gene have been fully studied. Out of the 20,000-25,000 genes in our genome, 23 have been identified only in humans and not in any other currently living animals. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are maybe 6 genes that are only found in humans. That's about 0.002% of the human genome.
But the answer is more complicated than that. What makes us human is not just the genes but how they are regulated. We share 98-99% genes with chimps but when looked closely the genomes are all filled with structural rearrangements. This results in a very different regulatory system in both. So the actual similarity may be 60-70%.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Now a thing to note is even the purely human ones mentioned are likely derived from something that already exists. Theyre usually some sort of homolog that  came to be from a gene duplication or a variety of other events</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, consider that the amount of copies of a gene present in the genome, or the arrangement of genes, or the expression of a gene, could be unique in humans. Genetic diversity is much more complex than just which genes exist. As the other responses have said, it’s really hard to measure. But I don’t think very much is unique to humans, to make an understatement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If we're a separate species, then all our genes are human. We probably share a small % with fruit flies but that doesn't mean we can grow wings of any kind, or interbreed with them with any viable product. You can't put human cells in a petri dish and cultivate a banana.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
