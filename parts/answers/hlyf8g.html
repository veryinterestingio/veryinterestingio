		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some foods, like peanuts or seafood, are more prone to trigger allergic reactions simply due to the shape of specific molecules in their components (called allergens), which easily bind to different immunoglobulins and thus lead our immune system to respond to them more intensely the next time they enter our organism.</p>
<p>You cannot have an allergic reaction to something with which you have never had prior contact, because when an allergen binds to an immunoglobulin for the first time it takes a few days for your organism to mass-replicate that immunoglobulin. The presence of lots of an immunoglobulin that binds to an allergen is what causes noticeable allergic reactions. Each time the immunoglobulins get activated, that signals the production of more of them. That's why frequent exposure to an allergen causes progressively severe allergies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Being &quot;exotic&quot; doesn't really tell you much about the allergy potential of a food. It just tells you that it <em>could</em> be more likely. While there are innumerable differences across biomes and the humans who live in them, by and large we <em>can</em> all eat the same foods. Even if you aren't as well adapted to some foods as &quot;the locals&quot;, it doesn't mean your body will experience any ill effects. And in fact, the reproductive strategy of many fruits specifically seems to be enticing mammals to eat them, and thus transport and fertilize the seed passively. So I'd kind of expect fruits to be one of the <em>most</em> &quot;cross-compatible&quot; food groups.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some foods contain specific substances (chemicals, proteins etc) that trigger allergic reactions in some people. You're not allergic to them because they're unknown, but because your body's immune system incorrectly thinks it's an enemy to attack. Exotic fruits are by and large just the same old carbon, sugars, water and other trace elements arranged in different ways and amounts. Which most people aren't allergic to, mainly because we need most of those things to live.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that countries that have a lot of peanuts, where young children eat peanuts have few peanut allergies. Countries that have few peanuts have few peanut allergies. Countries with a lot of peanuts but kids aren't allowed to consume peanuts have a lot of peanuts allergies.</p>
<p>It seems that kids who are exposed to peanuts but don't  consume them at a young age are the ones who develop allergies.</p>
<p>This jibes with what other people have said: allergies develop with repeated exposure. It just seems peanut allergies are weird and that exposure without consumption seems to trigger the allergy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
