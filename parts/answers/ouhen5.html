		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't know the answer here. It's also important to note two things: First, there's a <em>ton</em> of variation in heights within each population, and a lot of overlap between populations (ie, the places that are tall on average are not uniformly taller - there are still lots of short people), and second, the correlation between temperature and height is not a very strong one - there are some hot places with quite tall people, like Iran and Australia, and some colder places with quite short people, like Mongolia. In particular, continental Europe is quite warm (unusually so for its latitude), but also quite tall - taller than many colder places. </p>
<p>Next is the fact that this correlation is not the only correlation you can make here. Another one you can make is that with a few outliers, the wealthier the country, the taller the people. We also know that good nutrition makes you taller, and wealthier countries have better access to food, so this could be a potential answer to the question: Colder countries have taller people because they're wealthier. But then of course, a new question emerges: Why are colder countries wealthier? We don't know what the causal relationships here are, if there even are any. It could be that being colder makes you wealthier and therefore taller. It could be that being colder makes you taller, and for some reason taller people are better at getting money. It could be that both wealth and height are independently related to temperature, or that this is all coincidence. It could even be that having taller people makes the region colder, although that would conflict with everything we know about climate science, so isn't very likely. </p>
<p>Another thing that could be at play here is the fact that maps of height correlate quite well with maps of <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/media/global-human-journey/" target="_blank">human migration</a> out of Africa. Humans began in sub-Saharan Africa, travelled to the Arabian peninsula, then to the Indian subcontinent. From there, the populations split: Some headed off Northwards into Europe. Others moved East across India, then split again, some going south through South-East Asia and others North through China and eventually across to the Americas. The shortest countries are those of sub-Saharan Africa, India and South-East Asia, with Europe being very tall and East Asians and native Americans seemingly a little taller. Did a particular mutation occur in the population that headed to Europe that increased height, and a similar mutation in those who moved up through East Asia? Or did Europeans gain their increased height from the Neanderthals living in the area whom they interbred with, and the East Asians pick up their increased height from the Denisovans who occupied that area? If this is the case, then why were those sub-species taller than sapiens? Or why did those height increasing mutations get propagated in colder regions? </p>
<p>Finally, there's a direct link between size and temperature: The larger you are, the slower you lose heat, because to lose heat it must pass through your surface, which means the smaller your surface is compared to your size, the slower you lose heat. And the larger you are, the smaller your surface is relative to your size. This means that mammals living in cold climates are likely to become larger than their warm climate relatives, because this is an effective way of reducing heat loss. </p>
<p>You can use these pieces to come up with an explanation for this question, but bear in mind that we don't know which combination of these pieces is the right answer, and it's likely a combination of multiple factors because basically everything in biology is a combination of multiple factors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure genetics and environment are the two major factors on this- for example, I have parents who were both the smallest kids in their class growing up (at least until dad hit puberty), so I'm likewise tiny. My older brother and sister were similar, though my younger sister inherited some hidden genes from somewhere and hit a decent growth spurt in her teens. She did more sports than I did growing up, so the whole &quot;stretching of the muscles&quot; could be a factor at play there. </p>
<p>I live in a northern city where it is cold as heck half of the year. We're also very multicultural- most of the folks that I know who are 6-7 feet also happen to be of Ukrainian, Polish, or African descent. The first two countries have living conditions that are world's away from the third, so I'm not sure what the correlation is. Most of my other &quot;shorties in arms&quot; (4'8-5'1) are of Asian (namely, Filipino) descent. </p>
<p>I'm full on European, but for Caucasians it really can be a toss-up depending on past genetics and current living conditions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
