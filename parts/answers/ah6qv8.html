		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People born male develop the &quot;cro magnon bulge&quot; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brow_ridge" target="_blank">brow ridge</a>: a prominent ridge across the face just under the forehead and supporting the eyebrows.  Women in general don't have that bulge -- the forehead rises basically straight up from the optical orbits.  </p>
<p>Once you start noticing it, you'll never un-notice it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There really isn’t one main feature. The other answers point out some main features that are more masculine or feminine, however think of a dog vs cat. Name one feature that distinguishes them. You could come up with something, but really what happens is your brain is looking at a lot of things and making a judgment in a fraction of a second that what you’re seeing is a cat. Before you notice the whiskers, you know it’s a cat. It’s the same in this case. It’s your brain recognizing a pattern (and making judgements often without you knowing it when some feature doesn’t fit the pattern), not a single feature</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of feature seen as masculine or feminine, there's not one thing you can pinpoint it to.</p>
<p>In general having soft features, small nose, wide eyes, large lips, round jawline, round hairline, small head, and a round forehead are scene as feminine. Some of these features can be changed with hormone replacement, so it's not purely skeletal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
