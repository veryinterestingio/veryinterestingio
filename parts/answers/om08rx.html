		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's actually not our stomach but the jejunum, a part of the small intestine. When we are hungry, our stomach and upper intestine is filled with air. Although there is nothing to digest, the stomach, which is a huge muscle, contracts, compressing the air and pushing it into the duodenum and jejunum, where the sounds occur.
Fun fact: one german word for the jejunum is &quot;Knurrdarm&quot;, which translates to &quot;growling intestine&quot;.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The movement of food occurs via peristalsis, which is the process in which smooth muscles from your esophagus down to your rectum begin to contract in a rhythmical motion to guide food through your body. Your stomach is part of this same scheduled conga line, but it’s different in two ways: It is very muscular and is designed to twist and turn (a term called churning) when it contracts. It is also full of air, particularly in it’s top half (called the cardia) so it becomes easier to hear the stomach when it churns (the air makes it partially tympanic, like a bag pipe or balloon). As it churns, some of the air will get pushed out rapidly through a small valve connecting the stomach to the intestines, causing the rushing/gurgling sensation you hear/feel. In contrast, when the stomach is full of food or fluid, there is less room for air, so the peristaltic passage of contents from the stomach to the intestines is less audible (more muffled).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
