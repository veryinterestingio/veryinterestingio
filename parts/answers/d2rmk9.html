When I look at modern high German, it is only spoken around Hannover, and who cares about that place.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Economics question: </p>
<p>In Howard Zinn's &quot;People's History of the United States,&quot; he talks quite a bit about how in the early days of the pre-revolutionary colonies, the moneyed ruling class was strongly opposed to the printing of paper currency, that doing so would facilitate more equal distribution of wealth down into the working classes. </p>
<p>He makes it clear that debt, property ownership, and other modern economic principles all existed. There were still banks, lenders, etc. Just that there was no actual paper currency, and that this system benefited those already in power. </p>
<p>But he doesn't really go into the economic reason for this, or explain why. And I've always been curious. </p>
<p>Can anyone explain?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
