		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This vaccine is likely to be given to around two hundred million <em>healthy</em> people in the US alone. </p>
<p>What kind of risk are you prepared to take with it?  Will you accept a one in ten thousand chance of a side effect?  That’s 20,000 healthy people you’ve harmed. </p>
<p>How many people have to be in a clinical trial to see if there’s a one in ten thousand chance?  You’re not going to learn much if you test it on a dozen folks in your home town. So you need a large clinical trial, both to see if it’s safe and if it’s effective. </p>
<p>But what if it’s more than one in ten thousand?  What if it’s one in a thousand, or one in a hundred, who have side effects?  Now maybe you’ve harmed hundreds of people in your clinical trial!  </p>
<p>So you need to perform careful, graded clinical trials. Establish safety in a small group, then a larger group, and then extend to a big group to be sure. </p>
<p>Is this a purely hypothetical issue?  Vaccine trials in not so distant history have seen issues like narcolepsy, Bell’s palsy, exacerbation of disease, and intussusception at detectable rates. Would you expect narcolepsy as a side effect of a vaccine? Neither did anyone else, until it happened. (And the reason you don’t hear about these things, and assume that it would be ok to bypass safety trials, is that the trials are so good that side effects <em>are</em> incredibly rare.)</p>
<p>There’s a very good reason for being careful with vaccines.  They’re not like cancer drugs, say, that are given to a relatively small number of people who are likely willing to risk rare side effects. When you talk about hundreds of millions, or billions, of doses, and delivery to healthy people, safety is non-negotiable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2964774/" target="_blank">TGN1412 trial</a></p>
<p>This was a “first in human” trial of a drug that had passed all the animal studies. After very first infusion of a dose 500 times smaller than that found safe in animal studies, all six human volunteers faced life-threatening conditions involving multiorgan failure for which they were moved to intensive care unit</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trials take time. You cannot give someone a vaccine and see that it works in a few hours.  They have to develop antibodies, be exposed to the virus naturally, and resist it.  Those antibodies have to last.  Will one shot work, or do you need boosters like with MMR?</p>
<p>The stages of trials are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Safety: will the treatment harm the patient?</li>
<li>Efficacy: will the treatment actually improve the condition</li>
<li>Dosage: what dosage is necessary for effective treatment?  In the case of a vaccine, do you need boosters, or is one and done good enough?</li>
<li>Long term impact: how is the treatment working over time?  Are there long term impacts that cannot be studied in limited safety trials?</li>
</ol>
<p>The vaccine has to go through the first 3 stages before it can be sent for mass production and distribution.  Otherwise, you may have a dangerous, ineffective, or insufficient vaccine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One major barrier is efficacy. You need to prove the vaccine works. A vaccine is no good if you build up antibodies for a week and then lose immunity after 2 weeks. You need longer timescales to take measurements at.</p>
<p>Plus, you can't just expose people to the virus to prove a vaccine works, you have to give it to a group of people and look at how many get infected naturally versus a similar group who wasn't vaccinated. That also takes time to measure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
