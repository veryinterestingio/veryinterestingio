		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The food you eat.</p>
<p>The carbohydrate you eat is long chains of sugar. They are broken down to simple sugars like Glucose that is C6H12O6</p>
<p>You can sum up your metabolism of it  as </p>
<p>C6H12O6 + 6O2 = 6 H20 + 6  CO2 + usable energy.</p>
<p>So sugar + oxyger = water + carbon dioxide + usable energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blood sugar that you've burned.  The complete reaction goes...</p>
<p>C6H12O6 + 6O2  --&gt; 6CO2 + 6H2O + 2.8MJ of energy</p>
<p>So glucose (produced from food you've digested) reacts with oxygen (which you inhaled) and the products are energy, carbon dioxide (slightly poisonous; you exhale that) and water (useful, mostly your cells hang onto it but you can pee it out if you have excess).</p>
<p>[Edit: I wrote the reaction in <em>moles</em>, so we're talking 1 mole (180.18g) of glucose to produce 2.8 megajoules.]</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It comes from the sugars, fats, and proteins in your body that you are using for energy. They are all chemicals made of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. Combining them with oxygen in your blood gives off energy your body can use, and leaves behind carbon dioxide and water. There are many chemical reactions involved, but at its basic level it's pretty similar to fire (which also burns carbon and gives off CO2 and water).</p>
<p>That is also where the weight is going when you &quot;lose weight.&quot; You are breathing it out. And for that reason, how hard you are breathing is a good way to determine how fast you are burning calories, for example when comparing different exercises.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
