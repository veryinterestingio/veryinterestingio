		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different TV stations show their own commercials for local stuff, like the local news channels, other shows they air, or local events to give some examples. But the feed they are showing for the main show(s) are from some other feed they get that might be nation-wide or other larger broadcast areas.</p>
<p>The local station will insert their own ads over the ads in the main feed, but sometimes the timing isn't exactly right and for just a split second you can see the ad from the real feed as it finishes and goes back to the real show.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Canada, we have a thing called 'simulcasting', where the Canadian stations are allowed to substitute their commercials for the American ones when they are playing the same show. So that happens fairly frequently. In fact, last night, we were watching <em>Wheel of Fortune</em>, tuned in to the US station, and about five minutes in, it was switched to the Canadian station, which was showing a completely different episode. We were sitting there for a few seconds, wondering what happened to Barry and Madeleine (two of the contestants) before we clued in to what had happened.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have explained, these are &quot;local insert&quot; commercials. CNBC transmits a national feed with its own commercials baked in. Your local cable company will take that feed and overlay its own commercials before sending the broadcast to you. But the cable company's timing might be off by a second or two, causing it to overlay its commercials too early, so when the cable company's commercial ends, you see a couple of seconds of the national feed commercial before the show resumes.</p>
<p>If you are watching on the CNBC app, that's simply another &quot;cable company&quot;, overlaying app-specific commercials onto the national feed, even if the &quot;commercials&quot; are just screens saying &quot;Commercial Break in Progress.&quot; This is so that CNBC can sell targeted ads, where every viewer gets a unique ad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually work in a TV station so I can answer this.</p>
<p>So if you see a part of a commercial and then it immediately cuts to another one, those are the parts of the break segment where local advertisement is run and 99% of the time, those need to be triggered manually.  And those always come in with about a 2-second delay that has to be compensated for by the control room operator.  So there is a very good chance that their timing isn't perfect and that leads to those jarring cuts between two different commercials.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
