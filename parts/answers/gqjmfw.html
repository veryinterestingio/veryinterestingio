That's why only some things glow in a blacklight. It's also how dayglo pignents work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Itâ€™s called black light because they put a very dark blue pigment around the lamp, which looks black. This pigment blocks most visible light, letting only UV through, however it still lets some blue and violet through, which is why we can see it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're right! A black light puts out <em>most,</em> but not <em>all,</em> of its radiation in the ultraviolet. In fact, if there's no filter material applied to the bulb to cut the visible light and give it the characteristic dim violet glow, a &quot;black&quot; light actually appears blue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fluorescent lights have a certain &quot;width&quot; in the emission spectrum. They don't emit photons of one certain wavelength,  but a more or less broad &quot;peak&quot;, with some photons at higher and some at lower wavelengths around it.</p>
<p>The higher-wavelength flank of the peak of a blacklight reaches into the visible spectrum, making it look purple. But it's much brighter in the wave lengths you can't see, but ofc those don't add to the brightness for your eyes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
