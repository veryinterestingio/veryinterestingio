I don't actually see it like it's in front of me or like I would seeing a physical object. Instead it's like it's existing somewhere in the back of my mind and the visualisation is entirely in my head.</p>
<p>If I close my eyes it's still black, me imagining the image doesn't take away from the fact my eyes are closed because the thing I'm imagining isn't actually there (duh) </p>
<p>I just thought about where I work and the people I work with to try and explain it better but it's actually quite difficult</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually quite interesting, as I'm the opposite - I honestly did not know some people couldn't imagine things. Personally, having always had a love for books and fiction, I often fall asleep to &quot;personal mind movies&quot;. I can make up a story and imagine characters and how they look and move, as well as the surroundings and everything.</p>
<p>Actually, I had to learn how to <em>not</em> have pictures in my head. I had a period where I was fascinated by learning how to &quot;empty your head&quot; because I could not do it. At most I had a second before something popped up in my head. It takes a lot of focus for me to empty my head of &quot;pictures&quot; even now. It is a weird feeling, it is like a whole new kind of relaxation of the mind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
