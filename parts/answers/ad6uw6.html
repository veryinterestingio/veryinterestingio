		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a paper that asked that question... </p>
<blockquote>
<p>We calculate the current spatial distribution of projectile delivery to the Earth and Moon using numerical orbital dynamics simulations of candidate impactors drawn from a debiased Near-Earth Object (NEO) model. We examine the latitude distribution of impactor sites and find that for both the Earth and Moon there is a small deficiency of time-averaged impact rates at the poles. The ratio between deliveries within 30° of the pole to that of a 30° band centered on the equator is small for Earth (&lt;5% (0.958±0.001) and somewhat greater for the Moon (∼10%) (0.903±0.005). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the Earth's poles receive slightly less meteorites and impacts than the equator, and the effect is slightly more pronounced on the Moon.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Looking at a <a href="https://s22380.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/USGS-Lunar-Map-visual-Mercator.jpg" target="_blank">map of the Moon</a> may help us find an answer as it's surface contains the record of every impact over it's 4.5 BY life. The central part of the map is the part of the moon facing us and so has relatively few impacts where the edges is facing away and has took the brunt of impacts. Keep in mind that this map exaggerates the polar regions, but higher latitude impacts appear to be more common, or at least higher energy. This could be due to the Earth's gravity deflecting the paths of nearby asteroids or possibly due to the orbital inclines of asteroids during the late bombardment phase of the solar system when most of these impacts were made. If the former is the bigger factor, then we could assume that the Moon would have a similar but smaller effect on asteroids impacting Earth and high latitude impacts should be somewhat more common. If it is the latter then the current likelihood could be different because the typical asteroid orbit now is probably very different from what it was 4 billion years ago. </p>
<p>TLDR; Depends on how the Moon's gravity deflects asteroids and the orbital inclination distribution of asteroids in our solar system, but it appears that high latitude impacts may be more common.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, impact is more likely at equator than poles.  Assuming uniform distribution of incoming asteroids, if the earth were sitting still, the likelihood of impact would be uniform.  However, since the earth is whizzing around the sun at 67,000 MPH with the equator acting as the earth's windshield (plus or minus 30 degrees), it is much more likely to be impacted, kind of like a baseball hitting a bird:</p>
