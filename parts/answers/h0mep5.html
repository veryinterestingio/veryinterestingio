		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can think of electricity like a river. </p>
<h4>Voltage</h4>
<p>The higher the top part of the river is, the faster the water flows. The difference in height of the top and bottom of the river is the voltage, V in the equation.</p>
<h4>Current</h4>
<p>When there is a height difference, the water in the river flows. Similarly, a voltage makes electricity flow. The amount of electricity flow is called current. That's the I in the equation.</p>
<h4>Resistance</h4>
<p>The R means resistance. In a river, resistance is the amount of any rocks, islands or anything that makes it more difficult for the water to flow. With electricity, resistance tries to prevent electricity from flowing.</p>
<h4>Your question</h4>
<p>It doesn't matter how high the voltage is, it won't hurt you unless there is a current. If the current is tiny or only lasts for a very short amount of time, it's like dropping a water droplet from the sky. Sure, it drops from high above but it's just a tiny amount of water. If the current is larger and/or affects you for a long time, it's like dropping a swimming pool on you or pouring a constant stream of water.</p>
<p>Edit: After a few comments to this, I realize my comment doesn't answer the question completely. I focused only on why high voltage doesn't always mean it's deadly and neglected how time effects how lethal electricity is and that the current drops in the case of a Van de Graaf generator. Please read the replies to this comment too to get a proper answer to the question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ignore all the people talking about &quot;It's the current that kills you.&quot; To put it simply, current is dependant on the Voltage and the Resistance of the conductor (called Ohm's Law or V=IR where V=voltage, I=current and R=resistance) In this case, the Resistance (your body at around 10,000 Ohms for dry, unbroken skin) is constant, it doesn't change whether or not you take 120 Volts or 200,000. So, if you increase the voltage the current must also increase. (at 120 volts, you have roughly 0.012 Amps, enough to seriously injure or kill you) So, grabbing wires in your house is a bad idea.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>However, if we plug 200,000 Volts into our equation, we get an amperage of over 20 Amps, enough to instaboil you. So, why don't people explode when they get zapped by a Van De Graaf? Simple, the voltage is only at 200,000 for a fraction of a microsecond before dropping to low double digits. In that moment, there <em>is</em> 20 Amps across their body, but it's so brief, it causes no real damage. Meanwhile, an outlet is a <em>constant</em> 120 volts, even when your body loads it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>TL;DR: A Van De Graaf generator is like getting a bucket of water thrown at you, high capacity but over quickly. An outlet is like being sprayed with a hose, Low capacity but constant. A hose will get you wetter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nobody has quite got this right.</p>
<p>Voltage and current both matter, because power is current times voltage. Energy is power multiplied with time (the integral really, but this is ELI5). There is very little energy in the VdG generator, because the voltage drops to almost nothing over an incredibly small time. Ultimately energy is required to boil your blood, overload your nervous system, etc. Household power is extremely dangerous because it can supply high power over an indefinite period (basically infinite energy) while paralyzing your nervous system and your ability to withdraw from the situation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is another component that hasn’t really been addressed.  That is that there are multiple ways electricity can kill you.  It can straight up cook you which is going to take a large amount of power going through something sensitive.  Another way is to be similar to the electrical signals your body uses and make them start malfunctioning.  Your nervous system doesn’t have a lot of power in its electrical signals.  So a relatively small amount of power at just the right frequency can stop your heart.  Or it can get it to start beating properly again with something like a defibrillator.  </p>
<p>House AC has a frequency fairly similar to what your body uses and it has a lot of power.  If you get enough of it through any part of you long enough you will get a lot of damage.  If you have it go through something important like your heart or your brain it wouldn’t take long at all.  However most of the time when you get shocked with household voltage you don’t have it going through anything important.  This is why electricians are taught to work with one hand if they ever deal with something live.  Get the current flowing from one arm to the other it will most likely go through the heart.  </p>
<p>VGGs are not going to push power through you for long at all.  So they aren’t going to be able to cook anything.  And they are unlikely to go through your brain or heart.  So relatively safe.  </p>
<p>Something like a Tesla Coil is a bit of the cross between the two.  I have seen those supply enough power to burn through a 2”x4”.  But they can supply power similar to a VGG if turned down low enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Sticking your finger in an outlet - getting hit by a low speed hammer on your head. </p>
<p>Think of voltage as that &quot;speed&quot;. It doesn't have a lot of energy in it (the &quot;mass&quot; if you will) if it is a balloon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
