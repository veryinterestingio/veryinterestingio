		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The poles don't really exist in the way that you're thinking... they are more conceptual than physical.</p>
<p>Far from the poles compasses point in a general direction aligned with magnetic field lines. If you've seen magnetic field diagrams like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/siKNQwTuJwF2VjbGXBT3XZ-650-80.jpg" target="_blank">https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/siKNQwTuJwF2VjbGXBT3XZ-650-80.jpg</a></p>
<p>...you'll know that near the equator those field lines run mostly parallel to the surface of the Earth. However close to the poles they bend toward the Earth and run more perpendicular to the ground... The more parallel they are the better they work for compasses, for reasons that should be obvious if you envision them dragging the compass needle along with them, you want the needle to be dragged horizontally, not vertically. Near the poles they do a better job of telling you which way is up versus down, but of course gravity does a pretty good job telling us that as well.</p>
<p>Magnetic fields in diagrams like the one above are shown to be very clean and orderly, in real life they aren't like that. They are knocked around by solar radiation for example, they produce the auroras where they intersect the atmosphere and if you've seen the auroras you've seen how much they move around:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVsONlc3OUY" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVsONlc3OUY</a></p>
<p>It's a giant circle, you can only see a part of that circle at any given time and location because of how big it is, but look at the diagram in the first link again and imagine intersecting those field lines with a plane at some altitude above the surface at the pole... it would produce a circle. Importantly, this circle is not clean or static, it moves around in real time and is chaotic.</p>
<p>Anyway, near the poles the magnetic field is moving around constantly relative to the ground plane... We can AVERAGE this to a point at any particular instant in time, but that's just an average.</p>
<p>TL;DR: The phenomenon that produces the poles is messy and chaotic, the location of the &quot;pole&quot; is just an average of a whole bunch of chaos over a certain amount of time. It's really more of a conceptual invention than a physical thing.</p>
<hr />
<p>I wanted to add this, this is much closer to what the magnetic field would actually look like if you could see it:</p>

<p>It's blown by &quot;solar wind&quot; so that it's longer on the side facing away from the sun and shorter on the side facing towards it, and it's kind of wispy and fluid and constantly moving around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Only related to your question: the NOAA has a really cool interactive map on their website that shows you the updated declination lines of magnetic north (where your compass points) versus true north (the “top” of the earth). This is obviously because of the effect of a non-symmetrical fluctuating magnetic pole. It’s useful in orienteering when calibrating your compass’ reading to the lines on a map: <a href="https://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/viewers/historical_declination/" target="_blank">https://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/viewers/historical_declination/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
