<p>The idea was you pour them into water.  The dissolving candy would sweeten it and the released CO2 would make it fizzy.</p>
<p>It didnt work, but turned into a pretty fun candy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They make the candy in a tank of high pressure gas.</p>
<p>Imagine if you were in a  spaceship and you  put a lid on an empty jar. The pressure inside the jar would be the same as inside the spaceship.</p>
<p>Now if you went out into space and took the lid off the jar, air would rush out.</p>
<p>It's the same idea with poprocks. They make them under high pressure and small pockets of high pressure gas gets trapped in the candy. When the candy cracks / melts, the gas escapes and makes the popping noise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
