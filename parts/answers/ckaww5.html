		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you re-heat things in a microwave, water molecules are what absorb the microwaves and receive the energy. With things like cheese, that makes the water kind of separate out and makes the cheese more 'soggy and stringy' instead of 'foamy'. Texture changes taste.<br />
If you re-heat your Mac and cheese in an oven instead of a microwave, it will be much better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably more significant than the minor issues of moisture loss already mentioned in this thread, (which only really affects texture, not taste,) pasta actually changes its chemical structure when its cooked, cooled for a time and then reheated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cooking pasta and then cooling it down changes its structure so it becomes a form of 'resistant starch.'</p>
<p>Unlike carbohydrates, resistant starch resists digestion by the enzymes in our stomachs - and the sudden highs and lows of blood glucose that result from it - and instead continues travelling to the large intestine, where it acts more like dietary fibre. </p>
<p>This means that if you cook some pasta and let it cool down, your body will digest it like itâ€™s fibre instead of carbohydrates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those once delicious jones-crushing carbohydrates turn into &quot;resistant starch&quot; which tastes like old glue...</p>
<p>You're going to need a <em>lot</em> of extra cheese to compensate for that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ever heard of a steam oven? Not a high pressure oven, but one where there's a compartment for like half a gallon of water.</p>
<p>You throw in anything, and you reheat it, but not with warm air, but with steam.</p>
<p>You steak, cooked to perfection yesterday, will come out of the steam oven like it was freshly cooked.</p>
<p>Same with your Mac and Cheese!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
