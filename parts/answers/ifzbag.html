		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An interesting sidenote about this is that -273° C being absolute zero is a &quot;coincidence&quot; of using the freezing (0° C) and boiling point (100° C) of water. </p>
<p>Kelvins set absolute zero to 0 K, and uses the same increment scale as Celsius, so 273 K is the freezing point of water. Absolute zero in Fahrenheit is -459° F.</p>
<p>We could have easily created another scale like Celcius slided so freezing is &quot;a trillion&quot;, so absolute zero would be about negative &quot;a trillion&quot;. This makes the desparity seem less extreme between high and low temperatures. That scale just would be far less useful to our everyday lives.</p>
<p>Edit:  Added ° symbol for C/F (Kelvin doesn't use it)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You could move millions of miles per hour but the slowest you can move is 0.</p>
<p>Except, in this case, we call the state of no movement -273 degrees Celcius.</p>
<p>Note:  In Kelvin, 0 is the state of no movement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We just happen to live around the lower end of the spectrum in terms of temperatures across the universe. Life gets harder to support at higher temperatures for a number of reasons, one being that things start to become unstable, they have so much energy at those higher temperatures molecules literally breakdown or react more readily with others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People have given you the physics answer, but it's worth acknowledging the linguistic one as well.</p>
<p>Most of our uses for temperature relate to either freezing or boiling of water. Cooking is the obvious one, but it's also very important for our understanding of weather, and to some degree even practising medicine. </p>
<p>This is to say the average person benefits from understanding generally what temperature boiling and freezing are, so we decided to make freezing zero and boiling one hundred. This makes it easy for people to remember.</p>
<p>Ultimately though on the grand scheme of physics freezing of water is pretty far towards the cold end of the spectrum. So when you use these measurements for physics it can feel like we set some sort of arbitrary limit on how cold things can get.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
