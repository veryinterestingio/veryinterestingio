		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the aircraft will naturally want to yaw due to the asymmetric thrust. However, this can be compensated for by the controls turning into the yaw to keep it going straight.</p>
<p>There is a speed, called minimum control speed (Vmca), where there aerodynamic forces from the controls are not powerful enough to counteract the yaw if the aircraft is allowed to slow below this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most aircraft can mitigate this, but there were some instances where this exact thrust assymetry caused departure from controlled flight conditions - F14 A had a known issue at low speed / high yaw combo that could cause an unrecoverable situation, for example.</p>
<p>But usually there must be a very specyfic situation / emergency for an aircraft not to be able to counter this. Especially commercial aircraft, literally designed around safety.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes but.  The planes are designed to have enough counter torque available to even this out in safe flight conditions, and enough engine power in the remaining jet to keep flying.</p>
<p>It is a bit like being in your spare tyre.  You are no longer going on a cross country rally drive but instead you can drive like your grandmother to the nearest garage without fear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The yaw can be prevented by the tail and rudder. Flying on one engine also creates unequal lift, counteracted by the ailerons then.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
