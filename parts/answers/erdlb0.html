		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the age of sail, ship's cabins were poorly ventilated, and dozens (or even hundreds) of men would keep the cabin more than warm enough with their body heat alone when they were sleeping. When walking about the deck of the ship, warm clothing was about all that could be relied on.</p>
<p>Ships were extremely flammable, with not just wood and cloth but also tar for waterproofing the ship. </p>
<p>While there were ovens introduced later on, they were more for cooking and were not designed for heating the ship.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There were seldom open fires on a ship due to the extreme danger that a fire represented.  For certain specialized cases (e.g. whalers rendering whale oil) there would be fires that were carefully watched.  </p>
<p>Even matches were a significant danger.  The term &quot;the smoking lamp is lit&quot; was still used up until recently in the Navy to indicate that smoking was allowed.   This came from the days when a literal lamp was provided for sailors to use in lighting their pipes or cigars.  No lamp, no smoking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone has already said, fires werenâ€™t really used for warmth, but ships even in the 1500s had a brick kychen down in the hold for cooking. They would only be able to use this in fair weather as the hatches would need to be open to let the smoke out. Most of the time food was dried or salted or more likely simple thrice baked biscuits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The British Navy adopted <a href="https://www.hms-victory.com/things-to-see/galley" target="_blank">Brodie Stoves</a> from 1781to 1819 for cooking on most royal navy ships.
