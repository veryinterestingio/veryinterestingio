		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1 - blood is inversely proportional to body fat percentage. And on average females have more fat then males at the same weight and height
2 - menstruation causes women to lose some blood, that needs to be replaced
3 - it has been shown that higher levels of  testosterone causes more blood production. (And faster clotting times)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Androgens (e.g. testosterone) drive red blood cell production. Since men have higher levels of testosterone, it follows that they have a higher percentage of red blood cells. There is an old myth that the difference comes from women’s menstruation, but this myth has been disproven, most notably by the fact that post-menopausal women do not see an uptick in red blood cell percentage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It should also be noted that testosterone increases hematocrit (percentage of red blood cells) and hemoglobin (the substance in blood that carries oxygen (O2) ). Those on T supplements for example must be monitored for polycythemia (basically too many red blood cells). </p>
<p>So that’s another potential reason for the increase compared to females of similar mass. Possibly the main explanatory reason.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably has more to do with muscle mass. In general males hold on to more muscle than females. </p>
<p>Muscles definitely need more blood supply than long term fat stores do. </p>
<p>When a female is pregnant, she can pretty much have 50% more blood than she did before pregnancy.</p>
<p>The vascular system is interesting and definitely not just influenced by biological sex but also where you live and what your lifestyle is like. People in higher altitudes have more blood than people at sea level. An athlete will have more blood than a couch potato of the same height and weight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The menstruation blood loss thing people have mentioned is v minuscule and shaky as a relevant fact because of that bc it's usually shedding uterine tissue and lubricant that comes out during menstruation but!  </p>
<p>Uteri and fallopian tubes are what's called hollow organs- like stomachs, intestines, or bladders, which just refers to organs that aren't solid masses of organ tissue or contain/produce something other than blood.<br />
Meaning that, in addition to regularly taking up more space than any rough equivalent you could think of for men (such as ureters, testes, prostate glands, etc.) they're also not filled with or filtering blood! Even prior to menstruation, it's actually building up uterine tissue instead of blood, and the blood that's lost is so little your body remakes it as its lost.<br />
So your uterus/fallopian tubes do reduce your overall carrying capacity for blood volume.<br />
And, while your first thought may be that boob mass makes up for that taken space, that's actually filled with breast tissue, which is a combination of glands and hollow organ tissue, and fat, which needs no blood; compared to muscle, which is live tissue that needs blood for perfusion, and also what men usually have in that area. (Obvi it very slightly increases veins/capillaries that need to perfuse the surface area but mens bodies have external genitalia and on average tend to have better circulation so I assume that part kinda evens out)  </p>
<p>So the menstruation fact wasn't quite right, but your reproductive organs do factor in on their own to having slightly less blood volume than a male of your size!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
