<p>Most planes require a runway to actually land on, so you can't really just land to pick up the survivors. For similar reasons, you won't be able to get the survivors off in a plane most of the time.</p>
<p>Depending on range, a Search and Rescue helicopter may come to pick them up, but if that's impractical, they will at least try to find a way to deliver food and water while arranging for a boat to come and do the actual pickup. This is what actually happened a couple weeks ago. <a href="https://time.com/5875356/deserted-island-sos/" target="_blank">https://time.com/5875356/deserted-island-sos/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The plane down there doesn't need to be the one to do the rescue, they have GPS and a radio.  The plane's only job is to call in the coordinates to the local authority, they can arrange the dispatch of a helicopter or fast boat that can deliver food/water to hold the survivors over for a few days until a rescue ship can arrive.</p>
<p>As for communication, a plane that circles a random island in an ocean is a pretty good sign they saw your signal regardless of if they can call you on the island to tell you so, there is a huge amount that can be communicated without actually talking.</p>
<p>Unless you somehow stranded yourself at Point Nemo, you're going to be within flight range of a helicopter that can drop off supplies within a day to hold you over for the 2-3 days until a ship can arrive to come pick you up.  If a plane has seen the signal then supplies will arrive within a day and rescue within just a few more, the problem is getting the plane to see your signal not what happens after they've seen it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a commercial pilot.</p>
<p>Firstly, as the Harrison Ford film Six Days and Seven Nights correctly intimated, if your trapped on a desert island and you see a commercial flight like an Airbus or Boeing, don't bother trying to signal it. You really would need to set off a nuke to have any chance of them seeing you, and even if those aircraft go particularly low for some reason, their cockpits are not massively conducive to looking at things on the ground at a 45 degree angle where they might be able to work out what they are seeing.</p>
<p>Your only chance would be with smaller commercial or private aircraft that fly lower. Beyond about 2000ft in height (Which is the measurement between you and the ground, altitude is the measurement between you and sea level which can be different) its kind of hard to work out what is going on down on the ground, so all that rubbish about making three fires in a triangle and so forth won't really work, (So if you ever see a survival instructor spouting that crap, correct him). If you want to be seen by an aircraft, go BIG. Biggest fire you can make, biggest sign you can make.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, any kind of symbol we recognise as a letter will draw our attention but the symbols V and X have a special status and indicate &quot;I need help&quot; and &quot;I need help and medical attention&quot; respectively. Waving your arms at us also works but a plane has to go really low to make that out generally so it's only useful once you have attracted our attention in another way. A red flare is the gold standard. We see red flares we pay attention.</p>
<p>One thing you have to be aware of is that context is important. Flying over an island and seeing these things will draw more investigation than say perhaps in a semi urban area, though red flares generally work wherever.</p>
<p>Once the pilot has seen you, they will (If safe to do so) make a low pass over you to observe and roll their wings left and right to signal we have seen you, generally known as giving you a wing wiggle. The pilot might repeat the pass if he/she thinks its prudent, safe and fuel permissive to do so.</p>
<p>Once the pilot has seen you and determined you require assistance, he/she will contact whatever ATC or radar control he is reporting to (A lot of private pilots and certain types of aircraft don't necessarily have to report to any in some areas of airspace). He/she may, given the situation and what he/she believes the situation to be, preface the call with the message &quot;PAN PAN PAN&quot; which indicates this is very urgent, and all other traffic on that frequency will minimise to allow him to report what he/she has seen. The pilot will provide the co-ordinates of where you were seen, the time that it was seen, what they believe the situation to be and will state clearly that search and rescue is required. The management of the rescue will then be relayed by that ATC or control station to the relevant authorities.</p>
<p>If fuel is permissive, the pilot might hang around for a few more passes, but will more likely just head on their way. Being in a plane, there isn't much more they can do for you.</p>
<p>A helicopter might be slightly different, but would for the most part follow the same process with the exception they may land. The would have to be in a fuel/weight/safety permissive situation and completely down to the discretion of the pilot, particularly if they have passengers they have to think about as they could in theory be putting themselves, their passengers or the aircraft at risk too.</p>
