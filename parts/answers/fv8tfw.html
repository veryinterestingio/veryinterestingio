		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Evolution works because only the variations that work get a chance to reproduce and pass on their genes while the variations that are detrimental tend to die.</p>
<p>Baby sea turtles make a great snack for a lot of animals. Hatching sea turtles can go in any direction they want really. But the safest direction for them to go is the water.</p>
<p>Imagine thousands or hundreds of thousands of generations of sea turtle babies hatching year after year. Which ones have the best chance of survival? The ones attracted to the sea. They are the ones most likely to pass on the genes that gave them a preference for the sea.</p>
<p>The sea turtle babies that preferred to warm up in the sun a little likely all get eaten and don't pass on their genes.</p>
<p>A selective pressure like that will change animals over successive generations until the urge to make a run for the sea is very strong in all sea turtles. After all, the ones missing that urge never reproduced.</p>
<p>And not everything is simple instinct. Whales like orca's, often reproduce in very specific places because of their requirements. The reproduction of most animals is closely tied to the availability of food because reproducing is very resource-intensive for the parent and the young also need food.</p>
<p>So, in the case of whales, they're not instinctively driven to certain areas. They're instinctively driven to reproduce when they get the chance to glut on food. For orca's, that's when other whales, seals, penguins, fish etc. start to reproduce. Which in turn is often when the food for those animals start to reproduce.</p>
<p>Orcas tend to be very habitual. Different pods specialise in hunting different food sources. A pod can be traditional whale hunters, seal hunters or fish eaters despite all orca's being the same species. As such, they all share the instinct to reproduce when food is plentiful but where that is varies and is learned behaviour that young orcas pick up from their parents.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Baby sea turtles hatching and immediately being drawn towards the sea sounds like a very complex thing, because it requires first to know the sea is there, and then make a trek to get to it. It's understandable to be curious how a newly born turtle could &quot;instinctively&quot; begin a complex action, without being taught or shown first. The thing to realize is, this action of going to the sea is as instinctual as a human baby taking its first breath when it exits the womb. It's not a question of thought, or decision, it just IS what happens. Go under water, and tell yourself you don't need air, you're not going to go after it, you want to die, and you're going to stay under until it happens. That instinct to breathe becomes so strong, that there are very few who can resist... just look up people who successfully drowned themselves on purpose. You'll get a first hand experience of what the urge from a strong instinctual reaction causes you to do. You will surface for air, I can almost guarantee it. These sea turtles, upon being born, have this instinct so strong to get to the sea, they don't know why, they don't contemplate it, they just go, because everything inside of them tells them to. And like others have said, this gives these sea turtles a much better chance at survival and to pass on the &quot;GET TO THE SEA&quot; gene versus the turtles who didn't feel the urge to get there as quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why do babies crawl? Why do babies cry? It isn't because they have knowledge of it. It is because it feels like the best thing to do at the time.</p>
<p>A turtle crawls to sea because that's what it feels is favorable to do at the time. Any turtle that doesn't will get eaten, so the ones who survive end up being the ones who feel like going out to sea.</p>
<p>Why do things taste good or smell good? Why does it feel good to cool down during a hot day or warm up during a cold day? Why do we feel pain? The reason we feel these things isn't because we have some knowledge of why. We just feel like there are certain things that are right for us, and certain things that aren't.</p>
<p>Animals who migrate feel colder and warmer streams. It feels right for them to follow these streams.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
