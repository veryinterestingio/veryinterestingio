		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Recommend the writeup at CERN.  At CERN they actually create antimatter particles to study - they don't hang around very long, though.  </p>
<p><a href="https://home.cern/science/physics/antimatter" target="_blank"><a href="https://home.cern/science/physics/antimatter" target="_blank">https://home.cern/science/physics/antimatter</a></a> </p>
<p>Basically, the formulas that combine special relativity and quantum theory postulated an electron with positive energy, and a proton with negative energy.</p>
<p>For our purposes, it's literally a molecule in which the proton is a negatively charged particle, identical in every way except electrical charge.  And yes, this means entire complex molecules and galaxies should be observable.   Specifically, the models postulating the moments of the Big Bang would predict an equal number of matter and antimatter particles.  </p>
<p>But . . . we don't see all that antimatter anywhere.  So everyone is trying to figure out if that means a defect in the model or something not considered by the model.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anti-matter works as regular matter for the most part. But disintegrate when meeting its regular counterpart. </p>
<p>Imagine a universe where antimatter would have been a bit more abundant than our regular matter and it would have been an anti-matter universe where regular matter struggle to exist. </p>
<p>Simply because it's difficult to isolate completely one type from the other. One has to &quot;win&quot; and the other only exist when freshly created.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
