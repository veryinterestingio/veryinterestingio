		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Inflammation!</p>
<p>To keep it simple, when you’re sick your body will flood itself with white blood cells. That along with increased blood flow and the typical fever result in aches and pain in your joints and muscles.</p>
<p>You’re essentially inflamed all over.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you have the flu, you're really infected with a new, slightly altered influenza virus that circulates every year and usually peaks around winter.</p>
<p>Your immune cells recognise it as foreign and launch an inflammatory response against it. Here are some of the causes of aches/pains/tiredness:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Your blood vessels normally become a little leaky to allow immune cells to reach their target. In the case of the flu this is systemic (body-wide) so you get a generalised swelling as your tissues become more fluid- you might see this as puffy eyes and a runny nose, for example. This can be coupled with muscular aches as swelling can compress vessels and muscle cells.</p>
</li>
<li>Very important signalling molecules are released by immune cells in response to infection. These are called cytokines. While their primary role is to activate further immune responses and kill the infecting agent, they also have some interesting off target effects. One such effect is on the brain; they depress you and give you that tired sluggish feeling of the flu. They also cause activate pain receptors to make you &quot;feel&quot; like you have been injured even though you have not. An interesting evolutionary argument for this is that if our predecessors were infected by some illness, they would be better off staying in their hidey-hole rather than going out hunting food etc. So even though the aches and pains may feel an unnecessary counterproductive feature of the immune response, it may have some benefit! (At least evolutionarily)</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body produces proteins called Cytokines while sick. “Cytokines are a large group of proteins, peptides or glycoproteins that are secreted by specific cells of immune system. Cytokines are a category of signaling molecules that mediate and regulate immunity, inflammation and hematopoiesis.”</p>
<p>So long story short, it is indeed inflammation</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Consider your body a city. Now that said city gets invaded by criminals aka Influenca. Those themselves will rampage and damage what’s inside the city and therefore cause symptoms but what makes things even worse is how the “police” (white blood cells like leukocytes) reacts. Basically a war between those two factions breaks out and damages the city even further.
Now after things are settled that city is lying in ruins and that’s what you feel even after the virus got eliminated and therefore feel tired even days after the infection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
