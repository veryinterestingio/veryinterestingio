		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There aren't that many strong publications out there testing this yet. Most scientists would have gotten their hands on post vax serum in January or February. I'm guessing that we will see many papers on the subject over the summer.</p>
<p>This paper looks solid. <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/03/24/science.abg9175.abstract" target="_blank"><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/03/24/science.abg9175.abstract" target="_blank">https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/03/24/science.abg9175.abstract</a></a>  They find that people who never had covid and then got the vaccine develop some (but not all that great) ability to neutralize SARS1. People who were natrually infected and then got the vaccine after have a decent ability to neutralize SARS1 though.</p>
<p>Generally, it seems that there is some cross reactivity of SARS2 antibody responses from natural infection to SARS1. My expectation would be that we will therefore similarly see some response to SARS1 in vaccinated individuals, though probably less response than seen with natural infection.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/covid-19-story-tip-study-shows-vaccines-may-protect-against-new-covid-19-strains--and-maybe-the-common-cold" target="_blank">This article says that one of the current vaccines protects against one of the common cold coronaviruses but is not two of the others tested. </a></p>
<p>So, it's possible, but it doesn't seem to have been tested. It's likely not a high priority as SARS-COV-1 isn't in circulation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is some reason to believe it likely that these very similar viruses will have <strong>some degree</strong> of cross-reactive properties.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/pdf/S2211-1247(21)00050-4.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/pdf/S2211-1247(21)00050-4.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/pdf/S2211-1247(21)00050-4.pdf</a></a></p>
<p>How much?  Hard to say.</p>
<p>But you will <strong>likely never see this hypothesis properly tested</strong> with actual humans, because SARS-COV-1 is a successfully eliminated contagion with extreme lethality; You could never ethically infect people. Animal testing is only moderately applicable, having led us down false paths before (eg one of the lab tests of hydroxychloroquine).</p>
<p>And while I'm not familiar with what kind of lab isolates exist in the world in 2021 in this specific instance, SARS-COV-1 is absolutely worthy of the highest level of biosafety available, having escaped the lab several times since the 2003 outbreak.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 shares roughly 50% sequence homology with SARS-CoV spike protein. Therefore, a person with a covid vaccine will be somewhat protected. However, it's probably not similar enough to fully vaccinate someone against SARS-CoV as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
