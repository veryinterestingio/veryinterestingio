		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Real soap is good but forms a scum in hard water that is difficult to remove. </p>
<p>Detergents are good for removing oils but can be harsh on your skin.</p>
<p>Glass cleaners are designed to clean glass/mirrors and leave a streak free surface but ammonia based cleaners like windex will remove tint from windows or computer monitors.</p>
<p>Mold/mildew/sanitizers have different properties that make them ideal for some problems but ineffective for others. </p>
<p>For example, bleach is cheap and can be used for sanitizing fruits and vegetables but will rust metal and doesn’t last long.</p>
<p>Phenols like lyesol is good but can leave a residue  so you can’t use it on food surfaces.</p>
<p>And quats are good but can be expensive and have to be diluted correctly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chiming in kind of late, and I don't know nearly as much as others. But having worked with wood and wood finishes quite a bit I would recommend against using things like pledge to clean finished wood surfaces, it can damage the finish and makes it hard to refinish. Instead use water with a bit of dawn dish soap in it, it cuts grease and cleans most things off and won't damage your finish.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
