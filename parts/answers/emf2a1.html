		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not all drug tolerances work the way alcohol tolerance does. </p>
<p>your body gets rid of alcohol using a liver enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase. If you drink a lot, your liver will adapt to the increase in that particular toxin, and make more of the enzyme to detoxify it. </p>
<p>Opioid tolerance for example, is different. The neurons that are stimulated by an opioid don't like to be strongly stimulated the way drug use does, so they make less of the receptor that responds to the drug. This means its becomes harder and harder to get the same response from the same amount of drug</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
