		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the soda you get form a machine isn’t quite the same as the soda from the bottle.</p>
<p>Restaurants get packs of the soda syrup that they hook up to the machine, which the machine then mixes with water and adds the carbonation right then and there as you push the lever.  This means that the carbonation is less throughly mixed/dissolved in the soda. There is less carbonation in soda from the machine than bottled soda.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bottled soda is under pressure. As the pressure increases, more gas will be held in the liquid before its saturated. I believe it actually becomes supersaturated, so the agitation from pouring it releases the gas.</p>
<p>Fountains add gas as you dispense, but because it isn’t under pressure, it can’t be supersaturated.</p>
<p>This is assuming that they’re identical temperatures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've found that volatile fizzing is usually caused by warm temps. Either the soda bottle was warm or the glass cup (which retains more heat than a paper cup) is relativity warm. </p>
<p>The amount of carbonation that the soda can hold is (at least partially) dictated by temperature. If the soda is carbonated at a cold temperature (for max carbonation) then the rapid warming from your glass will cause that carbonation to fizz out rapidly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Soda from a machine does not taste the same as from the bottle. Like, at all. Differences in carbonation (noticeably lower than from a bottle) and syrup contribute to this</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
