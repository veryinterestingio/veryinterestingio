		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cacti are incredibly competitive in their environment, meaning they have adaptations to make efficient use of resources in a resource poor environment. However, other species that evolved in higher resource environments are similarly adapted to use more resources effectively, allowing them to out compete cacti which may uptake nutrients more slowly due to their adaptation to extreme environments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the cactus species.  I've seen plenty of cactus that grow in fairly lush places because when a drought does hit, they can survive.  But usually, they can't compete for the light.  Vascular plants grow too fast and shade them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a man from Texas, I can attest to seeing prickly pears not 50 ft from the gulf. However, that being said, cacti have an adaptation that makes them open their stoma at night to collect CO2, the time where water loss will be minimal, and then close the stoma during the day. That's great for surviving in deserts but it's poor for growing at any appreciable rate, which leads to them being choked out of sunlight. As there isn't much surface area for photosynthesis in the first place they are hit very hard in normal climates.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An important point that hasn't been brought up is that there is a major division in cacti based on where they live.  There are the desert dwelling cacti which are the first to come to many people's minds, but there are also the jungle cacti which live in rain forests.  A common jungle cacti is the Christmas cactus.  So technically there are cacti in less harsh environments (whether jungle is harsh or not is up to interpretation).  </p>
<p>To the question at hand, you don't commonly see desert cacti in non arid environments because the same traits that make them do well in arid environments are a hindrance in less arid ones.  Sort of like how an Olympic weightlifter makes a poor sprinter, even though they perform very well in their own sport.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something to consider is that other organisms are better suited for such environments. A cactus may thrive in sandy, dry, hot soil, but they won't thrive in wet, rich, cold soil, because other things are going to have a better time of it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is that cacti operate on the CAM cycle, which has it's own set of pros/cons relative to C3 and C4.<br />
