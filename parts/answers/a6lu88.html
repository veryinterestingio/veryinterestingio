		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>as to why nails grow how they normally do, it's because of how they're built. all of the nail you can see is dead. it's created under the skin by a strip of material called the &quot;root&quot;, and it's a C shaped channel that build the nail. the nail grows forward because that's the direction the material is drawn. </p>
<p>a common cause of ingrown nails is bad footwear. the pressure pushes the skin and nail together until the obvious happens. trauma is another cause. something damages the toe and the nail gets messed up. as are infections in the toe, as infections can swell tissues. however, a large number of cases have no known cause. </p>
<p>common speculation among professionals is that it's a minor defect in the nail's root. if the channel is misshapen, then the nail can push in the wrong direction. not unlike a defective printer. the rest of your anatomy has some ability to compensate, the Perionychium (the skin around your nail) can callous up and that added hardness can potentially push the nail into proper shape, but sometimes it can't. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off, that can happen. I once got an ingrown toenail so bad they had to literally slice my toenail in half, and removed the entire left side. It took 20 years to properly regrow back.</p>
<p>That said, think about how the nail grows. It doesn’t grow from the tip outwards. It grows under your skin and then pushes out like a soft serve yogurt machine.  (Just ask any woman who painted her nails two weeks ago and hasn’t touched them up.)</p>
<p>As the nail grows and gets pushed out, it follows the path of callouses you’ve built up over the years, and that guides the nail outwards.</p>
<p>Sometimes though, the nail falls off the track like a pair of skis trying to carve through ice.  Maybe the left ski follows the callous path and it ok, but the right ski pops out and goes all wonky....that’s when it starts to really dig into the callous and becomes painful. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tip; wear shoes that are appropriate for your foot size, anything that’s too tight will cause Ingrowns.</p>
<p>I get them on both sides of my big toe on both big toes, but at this point, I’ve gotten so good at getting rid of them, that I don’t really mind. It’s kind of relieving to get rid of. I don’t think I’d stomach surgery on my toes.im 29 and I never used to get them at 24, they started coming in about 3 years ago</p>
<p>Get a good pair of scissors and cut your nail into a wedge, the thinner part of the wedge being the front edge of your toenail, you have to pry the scissor edge down the side of it and snip, push it forward a little more, snip, keep going until it comes off. Then you will feel that sweet relief</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ingrown nails can be the result of a genetic anomaly that tells the cells in the nail to grow in a direction that wasn't intended. It can make the nail almost slice off the tip of the finger or toe in the process. The resulting ingrown nail can easily be surgically corrected.</p>
<p>On the other hand, ingrown nails can be the result of an accident that pushes one side of the nail into the tissue and skin. The resulting ingrown nail can then have an opportunity to keep growing in the same path.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
