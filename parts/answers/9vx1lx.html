		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The job is going to pay an entry level wage, but managers selfishly want someone who is way overqualified and will be able to overperform for that low wage. They think those overqualified people won't need as much supervision. </p>
<p>I hate this practice, but I had a manager that purposely put a wishlist of requirements in job descriptions. She put &quot;Adobe Suite&quot; in every job listing, even when it had absolutely nothing to do with the position, because she just wanted someone in the department to have that skillset. When I was promoted, she posted my old job, and I called her thinking there had been a mistake. I told her I've had this job and I don't qualify to apply! She had years of budgetary experience, managerial experience, and Adobe Suite listed. None were needed for the position. </p>
<p>I personally HATE this practice, because it completely distorts who you get applying. Perfectly qualified people don't apply, because they don't have those unrelated skills. No one that overqualified is going to be happy at that pay, at least not for long. And, in my experience, a lot of the people who apply when they don't have those bogus qualifications, also don't have some of the actually necessary ones - they have a bigger tendency to overestimate their qualifications in general. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Disclaimer: Personal experience, not actual data</p>
<p>1.) Cynical reason, my husband is being laid off in a few months, he has 13+ years in his field. People are requesting him for &quot;entry level&quot; jobs because of these experience requirements. They tend to use that term to negotiate salary. Which is shady and back handed, but if you ask for (made up numbers) $145k/y for an &quot;entry level&quot; job, even if your work experience means you are far from entry level, they can say, &quot;oh, well entry level salaries are capped at $97k/y,&quot; and negotiate down severely.</p>
<p>2.) Possible practical reason, many companies assume internships and/or work study. Entry level may also be in reference to the type of work and not the actual experience. For example, you may be a member of a group and not a senior lead or developer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If they post the position as “entry level” they do not have an expectation of premium level pay/compensation.  By adding the experience requirements, they are able to identify with an employee currently in the industry that is looking to make a lateral change, instead of an upward gain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The role might not be entry level, but the amount they want to pay a person to do it is.</p>
<p>Easier to convince a cheaper, less-experienced person to work harder and at a higher level than they're compensated for than to convince a highly experienced person to work for less. </p>
<p>Once you know your market value and you get good job offers, you are perfectly happy saying fuck off to a piss-taking offer. When you're younger or less in demand, you tend to take any job and take any shit they throw at you to keep it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>HR has one primary job in this regard. Get the highest quality person at the lowest possible price point with minimal effort to themselves.</p>
<p>This means that they are lowering an applicants starting salary negotiating position before they even have someone in for an interview. If they do not get any qualified applicants they may re-advertise at a higher salary. They can always re-advertise again until they get a qualified person. You don't start an auction with a high bid.</p>
<p>This may also be HR being extremely incompetent and just sticking &quot;entry level&quot; because they cannot be bothered doing some research about what the industry pay point for that position is so grossly low ball it and then just negotiate up. They do the same when the write &quot;Pay: competitive&quot;. Its code for &quot;we would pay you in hay and straw if we could&quot;.</p>
<p>Some HR departments just write in what they want in an applicant and then expect people just below those requirements to either apply, if they are motivated enough, or not bother trying to apply if they lack that motivation. It winnows out the chaff. </p>
