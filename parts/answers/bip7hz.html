		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Specialized cells called fibroblasts weave a fiber net under the scab to act as a scaffold for other cells to heal the wound. Over time the fiber net slowly tightens to help close the wound.</p>
<p>The pull of the fibers triggers the nerves on your skin that sense very tiny vibrations. These nerves usually signal that a bug is crawling on you so you feel itchy and scratch it off. However, the wound healing accidently triggers this, making the wound feel itchy.</p>
<p>Don't scratch the scab though! Removing the scab early makes it more likely to scar or to get a new infection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Histamine is a chemical released by the body to encourage new cell growth. Unfortunately one side effect of histamine is itching. Forming new cells (to replace the damaged ones) results in the local release of histamine, which also causes your skin to feel very itchy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
