		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically, yes, although immunity is a bit more complicated than T-cells.</p>
<p>Something related called donor lymphocyte infusion is performed. It happens when someone who received a stem cell transplant  has disease relapse. You take the T-cells from the donor (who has the &quot;same&quot; immune system) and inject them into the recipient, hoping that will give sufficient immunologic boost to kill the cancer.</p>
<p>If you transfuse someone's T-cells into an unrelated person, the T-cells will attack the other person's body and result in something called graft versus host disease. It's a terrible disease.</p>
<p>There's also granulocyte transfusion, where you take someone's neutrophils and transfuse into someone who has too few neutrophils which can theoretically help fight an infection. Neutrophils can't cause graft versus host disease because they die off quite quickly and can't divide. The evidence that it works is quite questionable though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Twin donation (not sure if it's T-cells though) is done in some cancers already. I worked with a woman who thought she was non-identical with her twin. She was surprised to find out that sequencing showed they were identical.</p>
<p>The catch here is, even when the two are raised together, each immune system makes its own decisions, so they diverge over time.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/90805/" target="_blank">Thus you get graft vs. host disease even from identical twin donors.</a> (There are things you can do to mitigate this; the article's from 1979 when GvHD was less well understood.) Graft vs. host disease arises when donated bone marrow is used to eradicate leukemia, but then, being &quot;different&quot; than everything else in the body, decides to go on a rampage and kill all the things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In theory yes, in a genetically identical twin (so complete HLA match at all loci). This is based on what we now do in treatment of cell therapy for cancer patients (it also happens to be my own research :) where we take patient's own anti-tumor T cells expand and infuse back to them </p>
<p>You can do it two ways. </p>
<p>1) Find and isolate  T cells reactive against the virus or infection, expand them in large flasks and infuse them back into acceptor. Advantage here is that you can take a pool of reactive T cells so you get broader repertoire targeting the infection. But this has to be like you said HLA matched so your acceptor T cells don't kill donor T cells, so genetically identical twin might work</p>
<p>2) If you already know the specific protein and Epitopes from the infection you are targeting say SARS COV2 protein S1 some epitope restricted by patient's HLA A0201 (one type) for e.g. you can also isolate the specific T cell receptor (TCR) gene responsible for the targeting and engineer your acceptor twin's healthy T cells to express the TCR. <em>This is called TCR therapy</em>. The advantage here is that you control the specificity since you know exactly what you're targeting, so there is less chance of off target effects. Now the con is if you're targeting say SARS COV2 you likely need multiple proteins targeted on the virus and you lose the advantage of the broad repertoire that's available in #1 (each TCR from a T cell only recognizes one epitope from a given protein region).  #2 however has the huuuuge advantage that you don't need to have perfect HLA match since you can still use the acceptor's own T cells. All you're engineering into it is the actual TCR gene that is targeting the infection. <em>So forget your identical twin example, if I currently have a disease and you have already recovered from it, if you and I share even 1-2 HLAs it's possible we can take your TCR against the virus and genetically engineer the TCR into my T-cells</em>. Cool huh.</p>
<p>However, I have to warn if you're thinking in terms of COVID19 you likely have to intervene much much earlier in their disease course. The reason being, the disease causes severe respiratory failure like ARDs and symptoms are similar to when you have cytokine release syndrome in patients undergoing T cell therapy. So it unclear if you will be helping the patient if you give this amount of cells at a late stage of the disease, since the first stop all the billions of T-cells you infuse into patients are going to go straight to guess where : Lungs. They might severely damage the lungs which is already fighting an infection. Nevertheless it's unexplored and opportunities abound.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You would somehow have to ensure you transfer a Stem cell memory T cell capable of producing the correct T cell receptor against a COVID antigen, and that may be able to expand sufficiently to confer immunity.  Typically t effector cells are already committed to a particular target - so it wouldn’t matter how many of those guys you transfer if they aren’t committed to the correct antigen.  So, I would guess no, unless you enrich for the covid t cells.  But, if you meant enriching for covid attacking t cells, then sure!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This can actually work with other people's T cells as well, doesn't have to be a twin. Look up allogeneic (donor) stem cell transplants. Similarly, allogeneic Car T cell therapies are used but to fight cancer, but these cells are engineered to attack a specific target. </p>
<p>I imagine if the &quot;engineering&quot; happened somewhere else, such as another humans immune response, these cells can continue to produce the antibodies if transplanted.</p>
<p>But, those cells do die eventually, so transplanted cells wouldn't be a lifetime immunity. I guess if it was B-cells, it could work if they just kept dividing. </p>
<p>Vaccines, it is always best to have a humoral immunity from the patient themselves as of now. </p>
<p>There are also other options of neutralizing antibodies which do not last long but work for short term such as RSV treatments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
