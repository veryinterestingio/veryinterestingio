		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>General rule of thumb, most of the stains you're trying to remove require a high pH(more basic/alkaline). Vinegar, being an acid, actually lowers the pH making commercial laundry detergents less effective. The smell is likely coming from your washer itself, which the vinegar helps to remove odors from.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Adding&quot; used here is confusing.  You do not add vinegar, you use it instead of detergent, or use it in the rinse cycle.  </p>
<p>Cleaning clothes requires a ph of about 11.  Most water is a ph of 7.  So borax or washing soda will help your detergent clean better, because the ph is raised (by the soda or borax). Deodorizes as well. </p>
<p>Detergent works by having two heads. One head is sticky and picks up dirt and grease and the other head is water soluble and is washed away, carrying the grease with it.    </p>
<p>When either too much or too little detergent is used, the sticky heads remain in the laundry with the smelly smells.  The vinegar carries these away.   </p>
<p>Understanding the process makes it easier to remember, for me at least.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We used vinegar in our front load washer for about a year before it broke. Turns out the vinegar caused some kind of reaction between the aluminum and stainless steel used in the drum, and caused the aluminum to basically dissolve. Electrolysis of some kind. The repair shop said that happens often when people use vinegar in some washers. It was actually in the manual not to use vinegar in the machine. So our bad. And not covered by the warranty. </p>
<p>Our new washer actually says you can use vinegar to clean it when using the tub cleaning cycle. So we use vinegar in the laundry too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vinegar helps break down protein and minerals, like salt and calcium.
So vinegar will help remove smell from dirt, sweat, etc.
Because vinegar also breaks down calcium, it softens your clothes and helps clean your washing machine in good shape by preventing scale. </p>
<p>Commercial laundry detergents are designed to make your clothes very fluffy and scented and to make you, as a consumer think that scent is a necessary part of cleanliness and therefor keep you buying the product.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding vinegar (acid) to laundry detergent (generally caustic) would reduce the alkalinity and overall effectiveness of the laundry detergent.  I feel it would make more sense to add the vinegar to the final rinse cycle vs the wash cycle. This would help to neutralize any residual alkalinity from the wash and still aid in reducing washing machine odor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
