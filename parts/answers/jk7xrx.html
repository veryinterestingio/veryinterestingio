		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The more intelligent vertebrates of Earth (primates, corvids, cetaceans) seem to be able to communicate with each other and express basic thoughts and emotions across species.  There are even accounts of such cross-species intelligent interaction between humans and octopus.  Does that give you hope that intelligence in non-terrestrial species would, at least on a basic level, be understandable to us, and vice-versa?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have your views about the likelihood of finding extraterrestrial life in our solar system changed in the recent months and years? Especially with the (still debated) claims of phosphine on Venus, some complex molecules on Titan, liquid water on the moon. </p>
<p>For an outsider, these findings sound significant for astrobiology. But on the other hand, these kind of findings must happen all the time. So has it influenced your assessment on how probable life in our planetary neighborhood is or is it just &quot;nice to know&quot; information?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
