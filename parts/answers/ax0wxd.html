		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we go through stressful situations we produce something called cortisol that some people call the &quot;stress hormone&quot;.  When cortisol levels are high our bodies can react through inflamation, weight gain, high blood pressure, etc.  I'm not sure what the mechanism is (not a doctor, just a pothead) but reducing stress also reduces cortisol levels.  So yeah, a vacation helps.... Until you come back to whatever was stressing you in the first place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's recently been established that psychological stress can affect the makeup of your gut biome, and vice versa. </p>
<p>Because the ratios of bacteria in your body take time to change, they act as a sort of damper on the rate of change in stress levels.  </p>
<p>I don't remember the exact species involved, but to give an example being stressed out for five days in a row can lead to there being more of certain bacteria in your gut, and those bacteria actually can themselves induce more psychological stress by affecting neurotransmitter levels. So here even if your external stressors stop, you can still feel stressed out because of the activity of these now abundant bacteria.  </p>
<p>But also in your low-external-stressor environment like vacation, the bacterial ratios start coming back toward the ones that are associated with feeling relaxed.  </p>
<p>I know you're only five, little buddy, but when you do learn to sound out words you can check out this excellent review of recent research in this area: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6290721/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6290721/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have two stress responses, </p>
<p>The first is like running the 100m, it starts quickly and it is over quickly. </p>
<p>The second is like running a marathon, it starts a bit slower, and lasts MUCH LONGER. (Funnily enough it can actually change your genetic expression, and pregnant mothers can transfer their methylated chromatin structure off to their fetuses) </p>
<p>Now, if you hop out of the marathon half way it will take you much longer to catch your breath than it would if you hopped out at 40m in the 100m dash. </p>
<p>Your “long term” stress response takes awhile to ramp up, and awhile to ramp down. When going on a vacation you give yourself enough of a break to catch your breath. (Often times in the first few days of a vacation you may still be a bit out of breath from the stress response slowing down) </p>
<p>Tl:dr; cortisol stress response takes some time to slow down- often a day is not long enough to get rid of all that methylated DNA or reverse that homeostatic swing</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have this nice and simple model describing stress called the General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS). It essentially is a model describing how the body reacts to stress.</p>
<p><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/576850a1b8a79b8b9f44d7fd/t/58a20cb78419c25dbf7428ee/1487015104489/General+Adaptation+Syndrome.jpg" target="_blank">This photo describes how it works, essentially.</a>.</p>
<p>But to further explain it, imagine you have a few stressors. Maybe you have to work too much, your relationship isn't going too well, you don't have a lot of money, or whatever might stress you out. Imagine all of these stressors filling a large bowl. Luckily, the bowl has a hole on the bottom to remove some of the stressors, which is our body reacting to get rid of them. However, the amount of stressors you can remove in a timeframe isn't infinite. If you fill the bowl with them quicker than you can remove them, you will eventually see health problems.</p>
<p>So, what is a stressor? The answer is everything that releases hormones which are supposed to reduce stress. The impact of a stressor depends on the person experiencing them, and they can be positive too! For example, if an athlete trains to achieve physiological changes (like larger muscles or more blood volume pumped), that only works by putting the body under stress and then letting it <em>adapt</em>. It's the same as more known stressors, like work stress. The difference is that athletes make sure to never fill the bowl too much so that they can adapt to the stress. If your life circumstances are too stressful to ever properly empty the bowl, then you can't adapt. If you are able to adapt, then you will be more resistant to the same stressor. If you can't, then that's bad.</p>
<p>Vacations alleviate the stress because they remove many stressors from your life. You don't have to work/go to school, can skip possibly stressful parts of your daily routine, and, if you budget properly, won't have to worry about money. The lack of these and other stressors make sure that the bowl can empty itself properly.</p>
<p>Stress can also be both psychological as well as physiological. I already outlined examples for both, but to give some now ideas:</p>
<p>Physiological stress can be: muscle stress through resistance training, getting a nasty infection...</p>
<p>Psychological stress can be: work, caring for people with mental illnesses, living in a dangerous neighbourhood, divorce... </p>
<p>The way both are handled by the body is different. Unfortunately, this is where my knowledge about the topic isn't sufficient to keep writing. Hope that my comment was helpful nonetheless!</p>
<p>tl;dr: Our body constantly gets rid of stress. If you have too many stressors in your life and your body can't get rid of them in time, that might lead to health detriments. Holiday is effective for stress reduction because you remove many stressors from your life during holidays.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
