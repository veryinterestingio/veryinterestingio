		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just got the most hilarious commentary with the lovely headline &quot;You are stupid - but Satan loves you&quot;</p>
<p>I quote:</p>
<p>&quot;Just seen you going to answer questions on Reddit about Palizoic and Mezosoic eras being what you claim are 65 to 540 million year ago.</p>
<p>You're obviously a simpleton but even so you may be able to operate a calculator and work out this equashun:  Earthworms build topsoil at the rate of one inch per five years.</p>
<p>Therefore if Earth was 540 MYO there would be 540 divided by 5 = 108 million inches of topsoil everywhere.</p>
<p>Clearly there isn't and therefore you head has been stuffed with garbage.</p>
<p>Darwin actually proved Earth is young and The Flood was a worldwide catastrophe about 4,350 year ago and during the 330 days of downpour, inundations, drain-off and drying all the land creatures were buried in deep sediments that idiots like you label Mesozic, Cretinous etc.</p>
<p>Mary Schweitzer has had the grace to admit that she know her silly 65MYO dinosaur tissue is wrong but she is going to believe it anyway - so why are you so deluded as to believe there was masses of dinosaurs 540 MYA?</p>
<p>Instead of prattling nonsense why not do the world a favour and go poking about the secret storerooms and drag out some of those Nephilim giant bones?&quot;</p>
<p>This, folks, is why we need to get better science education in our schools!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What was the first mammal to have the ability to eat plants? Were all the mammals of the era insectivores? Would it be correct to say that all mammals started as carnivorous insectivores and then later developed an adaptation to eating plants? When did that happen and were the first mammals all underground burrowing animals? Could the eat the roots of plants if so? Where can I learn more about these little guys?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
