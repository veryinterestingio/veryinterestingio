		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Cats and Dogs can be allergic to humans. For the same reasons humans can be allergic to them <a href="https://wagwalking.com/condition/human-dander-allergies" target="_blank">&quot;Dander&quot; or dry shed skin.</a> Dogs and Cats can also be allergic to one another. </p>
<p>To my knowledge most if not all animals can have allergies and against most if not all shed skin it should be theoretically possible for any animal to allergic to another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pets can have allergies the same as humans, and often to similar things and with similar symptoms.  Anecdotally it seems like food allergies are more common than things like sneezing or itchy reactions but that could very well be confirmation bias since vomiting is hard to ignore when your dog has an allergic reaction to food whereas you might not even realize they have a slightly stuffy nose.</p>
<p><a href="https://pets.webmd.com/cats/cat-allergy-symptoms-triggers" target="_blank">This isn't the most scholarly source, but it has references and serves as a nice summary. </a> There are similar pages for dogs and other animals as well.  I went for cats since I had a cat with a human dander allergy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
