		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/02/02/myths-of-vaccine-manufacturing" target="_blank">This article</a> by Derek Lowe on the blog-website of Science Magazine outlines some of the challenges of vaccine manufacturing, specifically of the Moderna and BioNTech/Pfizer vaccines.</p>
<p>The takeaway is that there are some bottlenecks in the process that require complex manufacturing technology that can't be easily put in operation by just sharing the formula.</p>
<p>Note that there are initiatives to expand manufacturing by some producers whose own vaccine research has stalled or failed. For example, the firm Sanofi has signed on with Pfizer to help with the production of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine after their own vaccine research showed unsatisfactory results. But this process is slow for reasons outlined in the blog post I linked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's no facilities in Canada which can produce mRNA vaccines on a commercial/mass scale now. One is being built in Montr√©al but it won't be ready to produce until next year. It will produce Novavax under license.</p>
<p>Pfizer actually licensed Sanofi to make a hundred million doses of its vaccine to speed up distribution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would suggest two things:</p>
<p>First, Canada would need the ready-to-roll manufacturing capability to produce the BioNTech/Pfizer or Moderna vaccine (which uses new mRNA technology). Being able to produce one type of vaccine doesn't automatically mean you can produce them all.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvA9gs5gxNY" target="_blank">Vox has a good explainer on YouTube</a>, and I believe only three facilities (one in Belgium and two in the US) are technically capable of mRNA manufacture right now. There's discussion in countries like Australia whether investment to add tooling to manufacture current and future mRNA vaccines <a href="https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/what-if-australia-can-t-make-mrna-covid-vaccines-l" target="_blank">needs to be made</a> (and how to do it).</p>
<p>Second, a local vaccine manufacturer/government could manufacture under licence. In the case of the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine it's already being done (for example, Australia's <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2021-02-12/covid-19-vaccine-oxford-astrazeneca-adenovirus-csl-manufacturing/13140104" target="_blank">CSL</a> or South Korea's <a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2020/12/693_300153.html" target="_blank">SK Bioscience</a>).</p>
<p>Equitable supply is the major issue. Pricing is relevant but less immediate (we know the EU <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n281" target="_blank">paid</a> less than South Africa for the AstraZeneca vaccine for example).</p>
<p>Edit: An <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-roots-of-canadas-covid-19-vaccine-shortage-go-back-decades-154792" target="_blank">opinion article</a> on the specific situation in Canada may be helpful. Looks like your domestic issue is both (1) and (2).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
