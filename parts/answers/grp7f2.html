<p>Quinine comes from tree bark and it is extremely bitter. Thus, the quinine and water mixture is loaded up with sugar so it doesn't taste as horrible. This is also why we have gin &amp; tonics, British soldiers had a lot of gin, quinine and sugar. Gin and sugar make quinine water tolerable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The quinine reason has been explained several times on here, so I am just hijacking this thread for a couple of fun tidbits about Tonic Water and Quinine.</p>
<p>First. If you kinda like Tonic water, but often find it to be too bitter and want a sweeter more palatable alternative. Try Mediterranean Tonic, especially the Fever-Tree brand. It's incredible. If you want something a little more unique try Aegean Tonic it has a more cucumbery taste and is fantastic on a hot day.</p>
<p>Another fun fact. The hydroxychloroquine that Donald Trump was touting as a miracle cure for Covid-19 is a member of an entire class of chemicals that are based on the the chemistry of Quinine. Quinine is naturally occurring in a tree bark, while hydroxychloroquine and similar drugs are engineered. They both function primarily by surpressing your immune system to prevent it from attacking itself. Don't think that drinking Gin and Tonics will help with Covid-19 though. First off hydroxychloroquine has been shown to have only some very limited applications in Covid-19 treatment. Secondly the differences are severe enough that it's hardly going to be the same thing. It would be kinda like trying to use a TI-83 to break up with your girlfriend over a zoom call since its still a computer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quinine is bitter as hell. You counteract the bitter by adding sugar. Get some bakers chocolate and get some dark chocolate. The dark chocolate might not seem that sweet until you compare it to the bakers chocolate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
