		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;When the lever is pressed it releases the pressure causing the nitrous oxide to expand within the fat molecule, dispensing whipped cream. This is why making whipped cream with a whipped cream dispenser creates 4x the amount as opposed to whipping air into the cream which produces half as much.&quot;</p>
<p>The contents are under pressure with nitrous</p>
<p>Edit: yall I copied and pasted this from a whipped cream canister site. I didnt write it, and I know the math is weird. </p>
<p>Its saying that the volume of cream is doubled from the liquid state in hand whipped cream, and the canister doubles that, hence the 4x part. Stop @ing me oh my god.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The can is pressurized with nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide is fat soluble, so it can move inside the cream. When you press the nozzle the gas expands and pushes the cream out, as the gas comes out of the cream it whips it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whipped cream is really a bunch of tiny bubbles.  They take that stuff and cram it all into the can, which makes the bubbles really small.  When you push the lever, the stuff comes out and the bubbles grow back to their regular size, then you eat them.</p>
<p>You have to shake the can before you use it to make sure the bubbles are all mixed up first, or you might just get cream and sadness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cream consists of water, sugar and milk fats. When you have more than a certain amount of milk fats in the milk (30%) they form a net of molecules. When you force gas bubbles into the cream they get trapped in the net and you get whipped cream (a foam).</p>
<p>Whipped cream containers have nitro gas in them. Nitro is lipophilic (fat loving) and wants to attach itself to fat molecules. Under high pressure the nitro is dissolved (stuck on an atomic level) in the liquid, but when pressure drops they form bubbles (just like when you open a soda bottle). Since the nitro was attached to the fat molecules they're just in the right place to instantly foam up the cream. The nozzle tends to be shaped in a way that controls how the pressure drops and then how the foam is shaped as it expands.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
