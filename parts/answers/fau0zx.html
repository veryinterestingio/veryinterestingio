		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a wheel with a single spoke that is pointing straight up and you take a picture of it. Now imagine the wheel is spinning so fast clockwise that the next picture you take, the spoke is at 11 o'clock. The wheel turns almost all the way around again and you take another picture and it's at 10 o'clock...</p>
<p>Now go back and look at the pictures. The sequence of pictures will look like the wheel is turning slowly in the opposite direction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're talking about the effect in videos, the frame rate of the camera doesn't sync with the spin rate of the wheels.  Think of a strobe light flashing. If the wheel rotates say 2.8 times while the camera takes one frame it looks like it is rotating backwards.</p>
<p>There's several videos of a helicopter where it looks like the blades aren't moving at all.</p>
