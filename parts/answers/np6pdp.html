		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your central nervous system is telling your muscles to “tighten up” because it thinks they need to be tight to avoid injury or harm. Stretching and rolling out can help with the perception of loosening them up, but really it’s your CNS telling them to relax. That’s why you feel better after moving around and stretching when you’re sore because your CNS is toning down.</p>
<p>Edit: I apologize. Your autonomic nervous system is toning your muscles down. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You got little guys in your muscles that sense if the muscle is lengthening (stretch) or shortening (contraction) and they work together to make sure the muscle doesn’t go in a position that would hurt it. When stretching, those guys feel the change in length and in return send signals to the nervous system that will tell your muscle to relax. But if you stretch too much, the other guys sense it and make sure your muscle contracts to protect it.</p>
<p>And there’s also a release of hormones following that, and this all contributes to tricking your body into feeling better!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your muscles that are excited or grouchy from a good work out or from repeated moments of pain are told to calm down by your brain after you put pressure on them, as long as the pressure isn’t so much it isn’t causing big owchies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
