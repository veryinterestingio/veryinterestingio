		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't comment on the archaeology side, but the U-Th dating of cave carbonates is an incredibly well established science and Dirk Hoffmann really does know what he's doing with it. The dates are of carbonate precipitated on top of the art by subsequent flows - that's pretty unambigously younger than the art itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, neanderthals existed concurrently with humans and were just as smart as us. They eventually interbred with humans and faded/melded into homo sapiens. (As homo sapiens are breeding machines, Homo Neanderthalis couldn't keep up.) I would say its entirely possible that the paintings could have been drawn by them, depending on the region. (Neanderthals lived in mid to northern Asia/Russia)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neanderthals were human. Homo neanderthalensis branched from what would become Homo sapiens probably between 400,000 and 800,000 years ago. Humans were still essentially human a million years ago. There is taxonomic dispute over even considering them a separate species, some suggest they should be a subspecies -one which could and did interbreed with Homo sapiens until they were utterly absorbed into our genetic stock.</p>
<p>As such, I find the idea that the <em>couldn't</em> have made the cave art to be utterly without basis. Humans make art, and we have probably been doing so in some form since before the branch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
