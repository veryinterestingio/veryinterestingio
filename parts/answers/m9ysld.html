<p>Lots of warm blood+ extra heat sensitive nerves = constant signals that the area is hot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you canâ€™t feel the heat and pain is when you need to be really concerned.</p>
<p>When you have a burn bad enough and there is no pain is time to go to the hospital.</p>
<p>Ironically, the more pain you are in, the less severe(typically) the burn is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your pain receptors and signaling pathways are sensitized following noxious stimulation (e.g. burn). They are more excitable, so the threshold for &quot;pain&quot; sensations is lower. This can lead to &quot;hyperalgesia&quot; (previously painful stimulation is now more painful) as well as allodynia (previously innocuous stimulation is now painful).</p>
<p>Related, I believe that thermoreceptors can be activated by both extreme heat and cold (as well as certain chemicals, like capsaicin in chili peppers and menthol). This is why you might feel &quot;burning&quot; sensations from cold exposure or handling chili seeds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Speaking from personal experience. Like previous commenters said the nerves are on fire and the cold water stops the burning but ALSO it helps to lessen the intense pain by deadening the sensation. I once had a burn from high school chemistry class, heat not chemical, on all four fingers of my right hand. School nurse gave me an ice pack to keep on it. I had to go home because I literally could not function even after an hour with the ice pack. Once home I sat with my hand in a small cooler filled with ice water for about an hour. Every time I took my hand out the same intense throbbing pain came back. Finally I made the choice of this is my life now vs fuck it let's see what happens. I took my hand out and focused on the pain to see how long it would last. It started to hurt less and less and after a few minutes  it was much much better so I proceeded to enjoy some daytime TV and video games. My suspicion is that I was delaying the natural response of my body's nervous system that allows the brain to ignore constant signals and once I stopped trying to focus on stopping the pain and just feel it while distracting myself, my body did its thing and started healing and coping.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
