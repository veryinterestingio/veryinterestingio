		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The association of emotions to music scales are due to cultural influence. There exists cultures that have it the other way around completely.
We have been conditioned ever since we were babies to associate minor scale with sad events that it has become automatic.
Even harmony and dissonance does not seem to be universal. Many cultures around the world have evolved to enjoy music that sounds dissonant and inharmonic to us. Things that we consider as annoying noise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How &quot;happy&quot; or &quot;sad&quot; a scale (or in this case: rather &quot;mode&quot;) sounds, pretty much depends on the intervals you find in them. It is easier, however, to talk about &quot;brightness&quot; of a scale, rather than &quot;happyness&quot; or &quot;sadness&quot;.</p>
<p>There's a pretty good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNY_ZCUBmcA" target="_blank">video explainer by David Bennett on scale brightness</a> (absolutely worth watching!). It also shows that there are brighter scales than Major (Lydian) and much, much darker scales than Minor (e.g. Locrian).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's mostly cultural. In Western music (Europe/North American), major is used for &quot;happy&quot; and minor is &quot;sad&quot;.  However, there are cultures and musical traditions (such as Jewish fold/traditional music) where minor does NOT mean sad. But if all the minor songs you hear are sad, an association is made.</p>
<p>Music-theory-for-dummies Youtuber Adam Neely did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rEqrPwVITY" target="_blank">an excellent short video on this exact question</a>, you should check it out if the seemingly-contradicting answers here are confusing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's entirely context based. Major is not always happy, minor is not always sad. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5CVsCnxyXg" target="_blank">No Surprises - Radiohead</a> is in F Major, but it's one of the saddest sounding songs I know. Likewise, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOa1a8hYP8&amp;list=OLAK5uy_m0q7jXEiluceiC8lZfFlyWym7YMSVmSBA&amp;index=5" target="_blank">Lotus Flower - Radiohead</a> is in D minor, but it sounds very upbeat and full of life. </p>
<p>The idea that major is happy and minor is sad is only true if you make it true. It just happens to be easier to make it a reality rather than the other way around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just a cultural thing. There was a time when minor wasn't &quot;sad&quot; but just &quot;having increased emotion&quot;. Similarly, the major scale at some points of time was seen as incredibly &quot;romantic&quot; and not just happy.  </p>
<p>(There are also other modes too, not just Major and Minor. Unfortunately it's also usually taught to people as &quot;major = happy, minor = sad&quot; in early music Education.  </p>
<p>The truth is really that Major tends to be more STABLE in terms of its resolution. Minor tends to be less stable (thus why all those olllldddd pieces in minor end on a major chord (called a Picardy third) because the overtones of the minor chord don't line up so well as a sustained chord inside of a boomy acoustic like a church. For the more nerdy, there is an inherent dissonance in the minor 3rd being played as a NOTE against the major third generated as an OVERTONE of the Tonic pitch).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
