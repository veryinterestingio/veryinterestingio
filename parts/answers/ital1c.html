		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine this scenario:<br />
I owe you $10<br />
You owe your brother $10<br />
Your brother owes your Dad $10<br />
Your Dad owes his friend $10<br />
And that friend owes his wife $10</p>
<p>That's $50 of &quot;total debt&quot; that can all be paid off with $10. Once I generate $10 worth of productivity I pay you, you pay your brother, etc.</p>
<p>In short, different entities owe each other money. This is the best way to handle economics long term.</p>
<p>It can have negative consequences but not in the same way that you owing money on a loan can.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Governments need more funds than they collect in tax revenue, so they borrow money by issuing bonds. The money is borrowed from investors, both individuals and (primarily) institutional investors like retirement and pension funds, university endowments, insurance companies. About 70% of US debt is owed to American investors while the other 30% is owed to foreign investors, companies, and some foreign government investments (like soverign wealth funds).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what you mean by 'we'. If you're talking about individuals, it's usually a bank or business. If we're talking about the country, it's split between foreign governments, banks, investors, and the reserve bank. One thing that people forget also, is that you can have debt and be owed debt at the same time, so there's all this debt but it doesn't all come from one place and sort of cancels out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The world is not in debt. Generally when you see things that say &quot;the world is in debt&quot;, they're adding up all the debts that everyone has. So your mortgage, US Treasury bonds, corporate bonds, etc. </p>
<p>However, what's important to remember is that every debt is an asset to someone else. For example, when you borrow money, that's a debt for you but it's counted as an asset on the balance sheet of the bank that you got the money from, because you're going to have to pay it back eventually. Or when you buy a US Treasury bond, you're loaning money to the US government. That's a debt for them but an asset for you. </p>
<p>So this means that overall, the world is not in debt. If you add it up, the debts are cancelled out by their corresponding assets, and what you're left with is the total value of all the stuff in the world - houses, cars, gasoline, computers, etc. etc. etc. Total global net worth is estimated at around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_wealth" target="_blank">350 trillion dollars</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
