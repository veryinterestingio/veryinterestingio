		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your butthole actually has similar receptors as your mouth and tongue, as well as the one that detects spicy. The capsaicin that makes things spicy is waxy, so it sticks to things it touches and is hard to get off. It's also not easily digestible, so some of it will pass all the way through and get stuck on your butthole when you poop. Since your butthole has the spicy receptor, it burns!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spicy food fools pain receptors into firing without really causing damage. The benefit to causing ourselves pain through spicy food is a rush of endorphins released by our brain which make our heads feel good. This association is learned. Meaning, spicy foods are a tough sell for kids. So, you are doing something counter to your own preservation... or so your body thinks. Diarrhea is the bodies way of emptying your guts by flooding your digestive system with moisture. Your body can't tell that the spicy substance you ate isn't something dangerous. It just wants to get rid of the cause of pain.</p>
<p>Also, endorphins are released as part of our fight or flight response. This response floods our brains with stuff that get us ready to fight or run because we are experiencing a threat. One of the other things this response does is cause us to want to pee or poop. When you are hiding during hide and seek and you feel the urge to pee, it's because you are telling your body, get ready to move quick. The kid seeking you isn't a real threat just like spicy foods aren't a real threat, but that doesn't matter to your body.</p>
<p>So you get diarrhea cause your body feels threatened.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Capsaicin, the spice chemical, is not tasted with taste buds like other flavours. It binds to and activates temperature receptors, the same ones that would fire if you touched something hot or drank scalding water. That's why &quot;hot&quot; dishes taste &quot;hot&quot; - it's your temperature sensors firing so to your brain it's the exact same experience as actual physical hot temperature. That's also why spicy hot food burns not just your tongue but your whole mouth, lips, nose, and even <em>any</em> bare skin if it's spicy enough. Anywhere with a lot of sensitive skin will &quot;taste&quot; the spice. Your ass, like your mouth, has sensitive mucous membranes that have lots of receptors.</p>
<p>Bonus: That's also why spiciness adds up with temperature. Like a spicy soup tastes spicier if it's also steaming hot. Spice and temperature activate the same sensors, so if both are present, the effect stacks and adds together. It's just more of the same &quot;hot&quot; signal coming in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
