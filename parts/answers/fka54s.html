		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: there aren't all that many liquids that you come in contact with frequently. Most of them are water-based. Water with stuff in it.</p>
<p>Alcohol is fundamentally different. It's not alcohol in water, it's that the alcohol IS the liquid. Most of us have water as our frame of reference for what we expect a liquid to be like, but alcohol is as different from water as oil or dish soap is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Isopropyl alcohol (C3H7OH) <em>looks</em> like water (H2O) but molecularly it's more similar to oil (Various CH complexes) and has slightly &quot;oily&quot; behavior - it has less internal surface tension and doesn't wet surfaces as aggressively as water does.</p>
<p>It also readily evaporates at body temperature and is moderately soluble in fats - you may have noticed your hands got very cold and dry as it wicked the skin oils away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
