		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did some math based on my own knowledge from Optometry school, and an <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3757906/" target="_blank">article</a>. Don't nit pick numbers i'm doing fast math to get general magnitudes as a study break. Humans can resolve 1 minute of arc (1/60th of a degree). Based on an axial length of 22mm and a photoreceptor spacing of 6.5Î¼m (0.0000065 meters). If we're blowing up an eyeball to have the same photoreceptor spacing, but the size of the earth (diameter 12741981.12 meters). This calculates out to 3x10\^-11 degrees of resolution.</p>
<p>This would correspond to a resolution of 0.2mm on the moon (you'd be able to distinguish a grain of sand), 7.8cm on the sun, 4 meters on pluto, and 21 kilometers on the closest star Proxima Centauri. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Yeah that looks better than modern telescopes. This is also assuming perfect optics (completely impossible and would degrade this system tremendously, but I'd bet it'd still be better than what we have).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Anyways, back to finals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a sense, the Earth <em>already is</em> a giant eyeball. By placing telescopes on opposite sides of the Earth, you can combine the data using interferometry to get the same resolution you'd get with an Earth sized telescope.</p>
<p>However, this is easiest to do at longer wavelengths - like radio waves or even microwaves. It's much harder to do with infrared or visible light, and we can only do that on a small scale - like two telescopes on the same mountain. So an Earth-sized eyeball would have a similar baseline to a worldwide radio telescope interferometer, but at shorter wavelengths than we can currently manage. Also, shorter wavelengths are inherently &quot;less fuzzy&quot;, so a world-sized optical telescope (or eyeball) would have higher resolution than a world-sized radio telescope.</p>
<p>But in addition to resolution, a world-sized eyeball/telescope would have incredible <em>sensitivity</em>. We can use interferometry to combine multiple telescopes to make a high resolution image, but for <em>sensitivity</em> you really can't beat just having a huge collecting area.</p>
<p>The night sky actually has lots of nebulae and galaxies that are big enough that you could make them out with the human eye - but they're too dim to be seen well at night. <em>Sensitivity</em> is what makes the difference here: if the human eye was bigger, you could pick up a lot more light, and see lots of galaxies and nebulae in the night sky that aren't normally visible.</p>
<p>Currently, the biggest visible light telescopes being built have a mirror 30m in diameter. If the pupil of the world-eye is even 1% of the diameter of the Earth, that's an aperture of ~130 km, and would collect about more than 10 million times as much light, and have thousands of times better resolution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>I become a transparent eye-ball; I am nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part or parcel of God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the human eye diameter is roughly <a href="https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2002/AniciaNdabahaliye1.shtml" target="_blank">25mm</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fovea_centralis" target="_blank">fovea</a> is ~1.5mm and sees 2deg of the visual field.  the earth is ~<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth" target="_blank">7917mi</a> in diamter.  if we simply scale the eye (and assume the lens-to-retina distance = diameter and assume our theoretical lens is perfect), our earth-fovea is 475 miles across. <del>assuming we still have human-sized cones (50 cones per 100 micrometers), cone separation corresponds to (.5 micrometers * 2deg/475mi) = 4.7E-12 arcseconds.  pretty badass telescope, pretty much impossible.</del></p>
<p>edit: normal human visual acuity is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity" target="_blank">1 arcminute</a>, which corresponds to (1arcmin * 1.5mm/120armin) = 12.5 micrometers of fovea to resolve 1arcmin.  assuming we still have human-sized cones, that corresponds to (12.5 micrometers * 2deg/475mi) = 1.2E-10 arcseconds.  pretty badass telescope, pretty much impossible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Resolving power scales linearly with reciprocal diameter. </p>
<p>The Earth's diameter is around 12.47 million meters, which would give a maximum resolution of 2.5 E-12 degrees at 550nm.</p>
<p>That would be <em>amazingly</em> good at resolving astronomical objects, especially if the full area of the Earth was used for light capture. </p>
<p>But resolving power is not the same as magnification. You would need Earth-sized optics and/or some unbelievably advanced computing power to turn an Earth-sized sensor into useful human-viewable images. </p>
<p>For stars, you'd probably need optical filtering to prevent sensor white-out. For optics - building Earth-sized glass lenses might be a challenge. A hypothetical quantum gravity civilisation might have more elegant solutions.</p>
<p>There would be some interesting engineering issues. You'd have no problem viewing the surface of remote planets, but <em>tracking</em> the surface of a remote planet as it moved through space would be a much harder challenge.</p>
<p>There are also practical limits set by dust and microlensing events. Anything between you and your objective could potentially reduce resolution. </p>
<p>Bottom line - not even remotely practical with current technology. But if it could be built, it would absolutely transform astronomy and SETI.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
