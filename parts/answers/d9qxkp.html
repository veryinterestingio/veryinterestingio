<p>Hi! I'm an audiologist, someone who specializes in hearing and balance. </p>
<p>This phenomenon is known as transient ear noise. It's completely normal and can happen to anyone. It may last several seconds, possibly up to a minute. </p>
<p>There's lots of theories about why this happens, but it could be due to caffeine use, head position, tension, etc. It can also happen for no reason at all. </p>
<p>They're typically harmless occurrences and don't mean damage is occuring to the hearing system. There's no evidence to connect the events with hearing loss or more serious tinnitus (ringing in the ear).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It can have many reasons. Most of the time it is harmless. </p>
<ol>
<li>Sometimes our brain &quot;creates&quot; that noise (which is often the case with a tinnitus)</li>
<li>Some disturbances in our ear can cause the nerves to not work properly. An example for that would be standing up too fast, the blood doesnt reach the ear fast enough and you sometimes hear a high pitched noise. </li>
<li>Stress. Most of the time the high pitched noise is due to stress which can
A) tighten some blood vessels which would again mean not enough blood in ear (sounds stupid, obviously it is way more complicated than that, but this will do, i think)
B) make our brain react wich can cause us to hear noises (not just a high pitch )</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course there are many other possible reasons like brain injury, ear injury etc. But these are the most common reasons. Again: In reality it is way more complicated.</p>
<p>I hope I could help :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OP, I’m assuming you’re probably from the US, where most doctors will tell you it’s nothing, similar to all the comments here.</p>
<p>Check your blood pressure. You could be having unchecked hypertension or pre-hypertension. I talked to a doctor from another country where the healthcare is much better and affordable, and they really nailed the cause of my symptoms. Now that I got my blood pressure to healthy states, the high pitched sounds went away completely. Hopefully what worked for me also works for you. Good luck OP.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called tinnitus (tin ah tus) and happens to a lot of people at least occasionally. For an unlucky number, like myself, it is continuous.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why it can occur but not all possible causes are known. Meaning sometimes it happens for no reason. Known reasons include:
1) recent exposure to loud noises
2) side effect of certain prescription drugs
3) actual hearing loss
4) traumatic brain injury</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
