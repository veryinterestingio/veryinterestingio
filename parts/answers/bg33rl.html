		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For non-digital works they typically use templates and strict divisions of labor. One person (or small group) draws the outlines, another group fills it in, another group does the shading etc.</p>
<p>For digital works different animators are responsible for very specific items and then share their work. One person (or small team) will collectively create clothing or hair or skin textures. Another group works on the skeleton that you then put the textures on. Another group then works specifically on the motion and movement. Another group on lighting and shading.</p>
<p>They're using the same items (assets is what they're typically called). Skeleton team saves a model and all the other ones can download it for their use. Texture team saves clothing or skin or what not and every other team can download it and use it so that the digital assets are the same across everyone's department.</p>
<p>FINALLY there is editing that happens, just like a movie. Just like in live-action there are editors to make sure everything makes sense and that people look the same between shots, there are the editors for animation that ensure that there isn't noticeable deviation between frames.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Animation is not done by drawing each frame as a picture.   Instead the draw lots of bits of picture on clear plastic called cells and then stack them together to make the picture.   This lets them reuse backgrounds and such that don't change every panel. </p>
<p>For consistency they can have the same person draw one thing for the whole movie.   For example on person drew the sparkles for the magic wand in cinderella.   Every time the wand sparkled it used a cell drawn by that person</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Building on the other posts they also make terribly explicit reference sheets. Here's one from Belle: <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_CQU4SY2v8Z8/TVHhuWE0SDI/AAAAAAAAALE/Hszc9OjGVHs/s1600/Belle_Modelsheet.jpg" target="_blank">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_CQU4SY2v8Z8/TVHhuWE0SDI/AAAAAAAAALE/Hszc9OjGVHs/s1600/Belle_Modelsheet.jpg</a></p>
<p>Basically they figure out that you start with the circle and if you divide it in half you get the placement for this line and if you divide that into thirds you'll find the eyebrow, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>also, keyframes</p>
<p>A smaller team (or person) does only every nth frame (the keyframes), and a much larger team does all the frames in-between.</p>
<p>They use the keyframes as reference, so it allows consistency.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
