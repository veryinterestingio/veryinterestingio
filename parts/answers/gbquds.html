		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>SARS ended quickly because it caused severe illness in most people. So even though it had a high R0, once you knew what to look for you could quickly find and contain anyone who had it. That’s how we brought it under control - we were able to find everyone who had it before it got out of control.</p>
<p>The problem with COVID-19 is that a large majority of people who get it either get mild or no symptoms. Meaning you have people running around with no idea they have it spreading it. Even those who eventually get severe disease will  initially have mild symptoms for a few days, and it will be difficult to recognize the symptoms.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is when we compare it to a disease at the other end of the spectrum, for example, the flu. The flu is highly contagious during the incubation period, and viral shedding peaks when the symptoms first begin. A hallmark of the flu is that the flu’s symptoms come on suddenly and quickly, and those symptoms include muscle aches and lethargy, so symptomatic people are less likely to spread the disease. Because the spread usually occurs during a period when the patient is not symptomatic, contact tracing and containment for the flu nearly impossible. When a case of the flu is found, it is already considered to be too late.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
