		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't know. However, one strong theory is that, for the VAST majority of human history, bread was not made with commercial, single-strain yeast. It was made with wild yeast or, occasionally, yeast from beer making; broadly, what we would now call sourdough bread. These cultures contained many microorganisms, and they break down the nutrients in flour much farther than do conventional commercial yeasts.</p>
<p>It should also be pointed out that many cultures did not treat wheat bread as their primary foodstuff, historically. Beans and corn, rice, and cassava have all been staple crops of large groups of people. Even &quot;western&quot; cultures have often relied heavily on barley or rye breads.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In this whole discussion it should also be noted that gluten intolerance and celiac disease are not the same. Gluten intolerance triggers short term smyptoms (diarrhea, bloating etc) but causes no long term harm to the body. Celiac disease in the other hand is an autoimmune disease and not eating gluten free will cause serious (up to lethal) permanent harm to your intestine in the long term.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One factor is that people who otherwise would have died are now just diagnosed as coeliac.  </p>
<p>Another is that with the whole health-blog, alt-science thing, gluten (or many other things - carbs in general, 'acidic' foods, etc) can be blamed for health ills and in the absence of other explanations, the nocebo effect is a real thing; people feel bad when they expect to feel bad.  </p>
<p>It might also relate to microbiomes.  We're eating all kinds of novel foods/drugs and are exposed to all sorts of novel environmental things that might alter how we digest foods.  THe foods themselves are different too, e.g. compare commercial bread production to traditional sourdough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before the link between celiac and gluten was discovered the infant mortality rate of celiacs was 30 percent. Moreover, without proper diet celiac causes infertility. So itâ€™s very likely some of the increase in celiac (a genetic disorder) is because people with the disorder are living long enough to reproduce and pass on the condition.  </p>
<p>Of course, there is also the fact testing is now more common, and the fact that we have been breeding wheat to have more gluten for millennia so there are more reactions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many people did die young in those 5000 years and some might have died due to nutrient deficiency caused by gluten intolerance but it must have gone undiagnosed as such. Also, allergies in general are increasing in the population one theory of which is the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene_hypothesis" target="_blank">Hygiene Hypothesis</a></p>
<p>Also,Not everyone lived off bread. Many cultures like Asians lived off rice which is inherently gluten free.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
