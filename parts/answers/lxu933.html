		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is, and it's called the ICRS (International Celestial Reference System). It is an idealized set of coordinates, the current realization of which is called the ICRF (International Celestial Reference Frame) version 3.</p>
<p>Astronomical reference systems are based on the celestial sphere, which is the backdrop of very remote galaxies and other radio sources that are for all practical purposes so distant as to be effectively motionless. If you can fix a set of three orthogonal axes with respect to this sphere, and define its center, then you're done.</p>
<p>The center of the ICRS is the barycenter (center of mass) of the solar system. This is quite close to, but not exactly at, the center of the Sun.</p>
<p>The two biggest features on the celestial sphere for Earth astronomers are the ecliptic and the equator. The ecliptic is the circle on the celestial sphere that the Sun traces out over one year. It is the projection of the orbit of the Earth onto the 'universe'. Likewise the equator is the projection of the plane of rotation of the Earth. If you label their intersection (the vernal equinox, which is where the Sun is around March 20th) as the positive x-axis, and define that positive z is in the direction of angular momentum of Earth, you've basically captured the idea. This is called equatorial coordinates.</p>
<p>Now this is tied to the rotation of the Earth, which is not as stable as first thought, which means this coordinate system moves. That's not good. The ICRS directions we use today are more or less 'frozen in time' on January 1, 2000, with a slight offset to account for the fact that we have better measurements since then.</p>
<p>The ICRF itself is defined as a list of coordinates of some very distant radio sources which can be pinpointed to very high accuracy:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no unambiguous &quot;this place but 6 months ago&quot;. Such a description would need an unambiguous definition of &quot;at rest&quot; (staying at the same place), which does not exist. Something that's at rest for one observer will move for another observer and vice versa. Both views are equally valid.</p>
<p>All the coordinate systems we can introduce are arbitrary. The ICRS discussed by /u/TheBB uses the barycenter of the Solar System as reference. In that case Earth is ~300 million km away from the place where it was 6 months ago (twice the Earth/Sun distance). Similarly, you could use the barycenter of our galaxy as reference. Then Earth would be ~3 billion km away from where it was 6 months ago (largely from the Sun's orbit in the galaxy). You could also use the barycenter of the Andromeda galaxy, or any other reference you like, and you'll get a different answer every time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ties into my thoughts a while ago... Astral Navigation sounds like it is very much impossible. Fixed reference points on earth are the locations of objects in the past. Move toward those objects, and they will change. At further lengths away from Earth, the locations of &quot;known&quot; objects are going to change significantly and/or they will be gone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
