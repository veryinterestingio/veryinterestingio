		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I once read about an experiment where scientists numbed a part of the brain that instinctively categorizes all sensory input as either self or external. When numbed, people experienced &quot;ghostly presences&quot; etc - most likely their own breathing, shadow etc being misidentified as being caused by an external agent. Does anyone know the name of this part of the brain? Could a failure of it explain schizophrenic voices (your inner monologue being misinterpreted as not from self)?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
