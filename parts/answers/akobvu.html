		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think there are two different questions in your question. One question is what is the chance a surgery will be successful, i.e. solve the problem the patient was having. The other question is what is the chance of a complication of the surgery, i.e an unintended consequence that is a risk of having the surgery in general.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>For the first question, chance of success is typically going to be quoted based on past results. For example, if people are getting spinal fusions to treat pain, and 80% of patients who got that surgery in the past reported pain relief afterward, then the success rate will probably be quoted to the patient as 80%. It is much tougher to give these estimates for surgeries where only a few have ever been performed, so probably at that point the surgeon is making an educated guess.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Calculating risk on the other hand, is a bit more algorithm driven, though still relies on clinical judgment. There are scores used to assess surgical risk. The one most commonly used to assess cardiovascular risk during surgery (risk of heart attacks, strokes, etc.) is the Revised Cardiac Risk Index. It basically grades people on a risk scale from 0 - 6, with higher numbers representing more risk. For overall surgical risk (not just to the cardiovascular system, but the whole body) there are other calculators. One of the best known is the NSQIP, which can give estimates of mortality, chance of major complications, chance of ending up in a nursing facility after surgery and so on. It takes into account a large number of factors, including the type of surgery, patient age, sex, and past medical history. You can play around with this calculator <a href="https://riskcalculator.facs.org/RiskCalculator/" target="_blank">here</a> if you like.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surgeon here.
Here is a quick rundown.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Likelihood you will be dead or disabled without the planned procedure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Likelihood the planned procedure will alleviate symptom and risk at hand and also the confidence that the diagnosis is correct versus alternative differentials.</p>
</li>
<li>Individual acute and chronic states of patient’s organ system functions to endure the planned anesthesia as well as the recovery. This also  includes the degree of disease progression of the condition to be treated.</li>
</ol>
<p>4, the overall trajectory of the patient’s health including functional status, nutrition, mental capacity, mobility, dependence on medications, past and ongoing substance abuse, and comorbid disease states. This includes the patient’s willingness and ability to correct undesirable factors prior and subsequent to surgery.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Prior surgeries of the same or adjacent tissue that will affect the complexity and demand for technical skill and operative time of the planned procedure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The individual surgeon’s and anesthesia provider’s level of experience and skill for the planned procedure as well as the availability of resources in the health system to manage the condition and the expected sequela or consequences of the procedure and disease state. Some patients are better off being transferred to higher levels of acuity such a as emergency department from office, inpatient setting, elective outpatient surgery, or referral to a tertiary care system with increased availability of specialized services, equipment and personnel. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The likely incidence of both adverse events and complications both overall and for the particular surgeon, operative team, health system, and region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Availability of support systems to participate in recovery including financial considerations, insurance benefits, network of family and friends, potential caregivers in the home, willingness to participate in counseling, clearances, insurance requirements, and recommended adjuvant therapies including medication compliance and those administered by professional personnel.</p>
</li>
<li>The very well documented and highly reliable gut feeling of an ethical professional that acts in the patient’s best interests rather than of their own individual finances or reputation. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is a condensed version:</p>
<p>We first decide on what we mean by &quot;success&quot;.  Do we mean that there are no complications? Do we mean that the patient recovers fully?  Etc etc.</p>
<p>Then, we decide to take a sample of patients who will be undergoing this surgery.  We perform the surgery on these people and observe how many patients have a &quot;successful&quot; surgery.</p>
<p>The rest is statistics.  We can estimate the probability of success by computing (# of successes in the sample)/(Sample Size).  We can control for covariates with an appropriate regression method (e.g. Surgery is 40% successful for me, but 60% successful for women).</p>
<p>This is an extremely condensed version.  I've not talked about how the data is collected (e.g. did you go and find people, or are you just using data you happen to have lying around), what variables you can and can't control for, or ensuring that these computations are valid and unbiased.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Risk calculations can only be created retrospectively. Meaning, someone has to do a bunch of procedures and track those patients over a certain period of time and count up how many were successful and what kinds of complications occurred. The best versions of this type of study will track a large range of patients from different regions, different hospitals, and different surgeons. Risk numbers you are given are useful if they’re available, but should not be taken as absolutes. If a doctor tells you a success rate, ask him/her further about what success means. Success to you might be different than how it was measured in a study. Also, your specific health history, the specific surgeon’s technique, and other things matter and may  either increase or decrease your risk relative to the population that was studied. Ask your surgeon, “do I fit well into the population that was studied?” And, “how did the studies measure success of surgery?”</p>
<p>TLDR risk numbers are created by studying groups of people who have already had the surgery. They are useful but take them with a grain of salt. Ask your doctor more questions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This may surprise you by being a very controversial issue.
In short, we use the complication and success rates published (often by the best surgeons in the best academic centers) which may or not apply to the situation at hand.  There is a push for surgeons to ise their own complication rate which a junior surgeon may not even have. Learning curves are real and how to convey this is uncertain.
For entirely new procedures, we do our best to guess.
Large databases can provide information as well. </p>
<p>Asking a surgeon what they base the success rate on may be helpful...</p>
<p>I found this published:
The definition of risk in surgical patients is a complex and controversial area. Generally risk is poorly understood and depends on past individual and professional perception, and societal norms. In medical use the situation is further complicated by practical considerations of the ease with which risk can be measured; and this seems to have driven much risk assessment work, with a focus on objective measurements of cardiac function. The usefulness of risk assessment and the definition of risk is however in doubt because there are very few studies that have materially altered patient outcome based on information gained by risk assessment. This paper discusses these issues, highlights areas where more research could usefully be performed, and by defining limits for high surgical risk, suggests a practical approach to the assessment of risk using risk assessment tools.</p>
