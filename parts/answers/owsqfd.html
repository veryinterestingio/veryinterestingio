		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pesticides are probably the least important factor in honey bee colony collapse. The use of neonics isn’t well correlated with poor survival of honey bees. Eg, in Canada the numbers of bee hives increased greatly after neonics were introduced. They continue to be used in Canada. You can download data for hive numbers from FAOSTAT.</p>
<p>The science has become highly politicized, which makes things more difficult to judge. But there’s some funny stuff. See this Science article. Both positive and negative effects are observed in hives near neonic treated fields. Note Fig. 2 - the country with the most positive effects has the x axis compressed two fold!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not up to date on the latest ecology data so I can't weigh in on that. But regarding the EU versus US restrictions (and more generally) it is worth knowing that these are on some level political decisions.</p>
<p>The ag industry do a lot of testing to evaluate the ecological impacts of pesticides. However that's just data at the end of the day. How you interpret that and weigh it up against other factors is much more complicated.</p>
<p>Glyphosate usage in the US is a particularly interesting case. Proving or disproving a link between a particular compound and long term, multi factor conditions such as cancer is quite difficult. At that stage you are more in the realm of epidemiology than chemistry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
