		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, you can fairly effectively stop a receding hairline by taking something that blocks testosterone from being converted to dht, or blocking dht from being used in the body, suck as as finasteride. If you are genetically predisposed to it, dht will take your hair, and its a natural byproduct of Test. Not only that, but you can somewhat effectively regrow lost hair with something like minoxidil depending on your circumstances.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have mentioned, the concentration of androgen rises to toxic levels on the scalp but often times you'll seen an 'island' pattern form of skin where the surrounding hair is unaffected. So pure concentrations of DHT don't explain that.</p>
<p>The latest happy accident was when a lady went for a botox treatment(yes, women can go bald too later in life) and afterward saw some regrowth. What happened is the botox killed the nerves that pull on muscles, which stops you moving them and crushing the collagen which smooths out wrinkles.</p>
<p>But it just targets muscles regardless. This loosened the skin on the scalp and allowed for more bloodflow to the area. More blood means less overall concentration of DHT in the area. So the initial culprit may be the muscles pulling the skin too tightly over the scalp as we age.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I (F, 28) have alopecia. I start wearing a lot of beanies and head scarves every time I go into another hair loss cycle. I've thought about getting some wigs or hair pieces that might look like my natural hair too. Having light hair also helps mask hair loss if your hair is just &quot;thin&quot;... On this most recent cycle of hair loss I've lost about half of the hair all over my body and wear hats 90% of the time. This is one of the cheapest and simplest solution. There are also a lot of anti-thinning, DHT blocking shampoos/conditioners which might help you. Minoxidil is also a good option to try. </p>
<p>It's not completely related to what you're looking for, but I can definitely say that hair pieces, weaves, and wigs can look very natural and are a great option for people who are struggling with their hair. A nice hair piece or wig can give you that little extra bit of confidence if you're really self conscious about hair loss.</p>
<p>OR - embrace the lack of hair and shave it off like my siblings did. Bald is beautiful too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
