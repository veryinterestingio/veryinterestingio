		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Beyond what the other person said, if you know whether or not the reaction is spontaneous at a given temperature you could ballpark ΔΗ from the entropy. If it is a negative change in entropy and the reaction is spontaneous then clearly the enthalpy change is going to have to be quite negative as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My rule of thumb is how many bonds are you breaking vs how many are you making, given that breaking bonds will consume energy and making bonds will release it. Hess's Law is what you'd use to get exact numbers, but you can get a very rough ballpark by knowing the general strength of certain commom bonds</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Expert physical chemists can estimate enthalpy change for most reactions quite quickly and accurately. If you memorize the approximate bond energies for all common bonds and roughly calculate enthalpy of bonds broken minus bonds formed, it's not too tough. </p>
<p>I remember being asked to do this during my oral exam. The old pros could do it quite quickly and I could do it somewhat more slowly  at the time haha. It has been a while.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Use Hartree-Fock approximations to give an estimate of bond energies if you know the reactants and products, and take the difference. </p>
<p>You need experimental data to determine the bond structure, but no need to directly measure it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
