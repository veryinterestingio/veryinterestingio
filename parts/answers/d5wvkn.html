Once we determined there were other moons, we used the name for our own moon to describe them.</p>
<p>However, the correct name for them is actually &quot;natural satellites&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Then Galileo saw Jupiter’s four major satellites and referred to them as moons. The real term is satellites, which the Moon, aka Luna, only really being named Moon</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The technical term for &quot;moon&quot; is &quot;satellite&quot;. </p>
<p>When we say that a planet has &quot;moons&quot;, we mean it has large, orbiting satellites like the one orbiting ours, which we call &quot;moon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Moon&quot; is the English name for our largest satellite. Other languages call it something different. &quot;Luna,&quot; for one, or &quot;Selene.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no official name given by the astronomical union to the Earth, the sun nor the moon. All cultures have these bodies named in their own language and the union refuses to invalidate them by dictating an “official” name despite my urging to name the Earth’s sun ‘Chad’.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The class of objects we refer to as moons take their name from the Moon, since we named it well before we realized there were other similar things. </p>
<p>It's also worth noting it's called the Moon in English, but has a variety of names in different languages, as do most other naked eye objects in the sky, like the Sun, or the galaxy we inhabit. And if anyone tries to convince you Luna or Sol are official names, tell em to take a hike.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
