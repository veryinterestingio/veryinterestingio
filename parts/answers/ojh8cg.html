		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is easiest to answer the question in two parts. First, does natural infection produce antibodies to other viral proteins and second, are those antibodies neutralizing.</p>
<p>The answer to the first one is emphatically yes. The highest antibody titer after natural infection is to N (nucleocapsid) protein. Spike is second and there are lower titers of antibody against E (envelope) M (membrane) and other (non-structural) proteins. This is why the majority of serological tests for SARS are against N protein (strongest signal of prior infection) and why you should <strong>not</strong> get a serology test to see if your vaccination worked (the vaccines are against S, serology will not detect those antibodies). Sorry I cant find the reference right now the paper is from a year ago and there are a TON of SARS papers about antibody response.</p>
<p>EDIT: man, still can't find the paper I am thinking of which had really ncie clear figures and a nice cohort size but here is one showing that by week 10 post infection there are antibodies binding all over the SARS2 proteome. <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/629185/fimmu-12-629185-HTML/image\_m/fimmu-12-629185-g002.jpg" target="_blank">https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/629185/fimmu-12-629185-HTML/image\_m/fimmu-12-629185-g002.jpg</a></p>
<p>Second question - are these non-spike antibodies neutralizing? When you are testing a convalescent patient's serum for neutralizing activity it is a huge pain in the ass to figure out which antibodies are doing the job. Using monoclonal antibodies it has been found that Spike antibodies are the most effective, and this makes sense since it prevents cell entry. This is why the vaccines all target Spike.</p>
<p>This does not mean that other antibodies are not helpful. Any antibodies to non-structural protein (those involved in replication inside the cell) arent going to see the target and will not do anything to help. Antibodies against structural proteins (those present in the virion) will be able to bind virus and some may help neutralize; there have been reports of neutralization with nucleocapsid specific antibodies.</p>
<p>Even non-neutralizing anitbodies can be helpful - phagocytic cells like macrophages will attack and clear anything that is bound by an antibody so a virion that is bound by antibody to E or M protein will be targeted for destruction. This is not what is meant by 'neutralization' however, neutralizing antibodies are those which can block infection on their own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The immune response to infection definitely produces antibodies to other surface proteins (e.g. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003656" target="_blank">this work</a> reports antibodies against spike, nucleocapsid, membrane and envelope proteins for SARS-CoV-2). Are any of the non-spike antibodies neutralizing though?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe this was actually covered on the <a href="https://www.microbe.tv/twiv/" target="_blank">latest episode</a> of this week in virology (during the q&amp;a at the end if memory serves me). TL;DL at least with covid-19, the antibodies target mostly the RBD within the spike protein.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
