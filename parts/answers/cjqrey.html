		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to the FDA, the plastic used in water bottles is completely safe for repeated use. They do add that you should wash your plastic bottles because they could have bacteria in them that builds up after being refilled multiple times. Per the FDA, the original source of the rumor that plastic bottles being reused cause cancer was from an email hoax that went viral. That email hoax was based on a student's masters thesis and the thesis has not been peer reviewed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What unbiased agency is saying dangerous chemicals will leach into your water? What health authority is providing this information?</p>
<p>The main concern with refilling one-use-intended plastic bottles is sanitation, not chemical leaching. Once your lips touch the bottle or you crack the seal and air gets in, the odds increase that the &quot;pure&quot; water in there gets pathogens in it.</p>
<p>Plastic one-use-intended bottles will slowly degrade over time, but not enough to cause chemical leachate into their water unless you keep them for years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The danger of reusing a single-use water bottle has nothing to do with the chemicals but everything to do with its shape. The problem is those ridges in the bottle which are there to make the bottle stronger while using less plastic overall. However, these ridges are excellent places for bacteria to get caught and grow. Once they grow enough, they can make a protective layer, called biofilm, that will protect them from soap and other chemical cleaners. Using a scouring brush to clean the bottle just makes it worse because it creates many tiny grooves for bacteria to get caught in. </p>
<p>You can reuse the bottle a few times, but you should toss it within a week at most of first drinking it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>'Plastic contamination is rampant in bottled water. That was the unsettling conclusion of a study published last year in Frontiers in Chemistry that analyzed samples taken from 259 bottled waters sold in several countries and found that 93% of them contained “microplastic” synthetic polymer particles.'</p>
<p>The article goes on to say the World Health Organization is investigating the safety of bottled water. </p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://time.com/5581326/plastic-particles-in-bottled-water/" target="_blank">https://time.com/5581326/plastic-particles-in-bottled-water/</a></p>
<p>(Opinion) We are interacting with these microplastics on a daily basis but directly consuming them seems foolish even without conclusive evidence of their effect on the body. At the very least they are foreign substances that the body has not evolved to process. </p>
<p>Over time we have been able to identify many things as harmful that were seemingly innocuous, like lead paint in children's toys. Just because something is legal and unregulated does not mean it is safe. Use your own discretion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
